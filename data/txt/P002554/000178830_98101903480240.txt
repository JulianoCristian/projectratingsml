APPRAIkAL OF SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
SUDAN RAILWAYS
SUh4ARY
1.        The Bank has been asked to help finance the three years,
1965/66-1967/68, of the Railways Development Program which covers the
period from 19614/65 to 1970/71. This would be the second loan to the
Government of Sudan for the Railways.
ii,       The Railways' capital expenditure in 1965/66 - 1967/68 will
amount to approximately ISd 16.4 million of which ESd 11.1 million
would be foreign exchange.  The Government wishes to borrouf LSd 10.8
million - US$ 31 million equivalent. The proposed loan would cover
66 percent of the total cost and 97 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the Project.
iii.      The Railways' program 1964/65 - 1970/71 is well conceived.
The Project, which coVers three years of the over-all program,
is teclhically, economically and financially sound.  Estixnates
of cost are realistic. Proposed procurement procedures are satisfactory
to the Bank.
iv.       The Railways operate all of the rail, river and port services
and virtually all the hotel and catering services in the Sudan. Road
competition is virtually non-existent and is expected to remain of small
consequence to the Railways within the Government's Ten-Year Plan which
extends to 1970/71.
v.        The Government intends to reorganize the Railways as a
separate body corporate, with such independent financial resources,
powers and legal status as are required to enable it to carry out its
responsibilities efficiently.
vi.       Internal organization and management of the Railways are good.
The hiring of expatriate experts, the need for which is recognized by
the Railways, has not progressed satisfactorily principally because the
salary scales which the Railways are permitted to offer have been
inadequate. However, the Government has agreed to approve the higher
salaries required to attract the needed personnel.
vii.      Operating efficiency has improved materially during recent
years and is now satisfactory. There is room for additional improvement
which the Project and internal procedures recently initiated are designed
to achieve,
viii.     Past earnings and financial position have been good.   Based
upon reasonable estimates of future traffic, future earnings and finances
may be expected to remain sound. The Railways' cash position will remain
satisfactory.



ii
ix.      The rate structure of -the railw;ays' steamer and port services
requires modification in order to bring it more in line with costs.
However, the Government and the Railways have agreed that cost analyses
and rate studies for this purpose will be carried out with the assistance
of consultants.
x.       Other matters agreed to during negotiations include technical
improvements with respect to the permanent way, operations, the accounting
system and financial relations with the Government, and the hiring of a
traffic research officer and a traffic research training officer.
xi.      The Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 31 million.
The Government would be the Borrower. The proceeds would be made avail-
able to the Railways on the same terms as the proposed loan. A term of
25 years is recommended, including a 4-1/2 year period of grace.



A.PPRAISAL CF SECOND RAIHWAY PROJECT
SUDAN RAILWAYS
I. INTPRQDUCTION
1.        In 1958, the Bank appraised the Sudan Railways and its 1958/59 -
1959/60 development scheme (Report No. TO-180-a, of July 7, 1958) and
made a loan (No. 202) to the Government in the amount of US$ 39 million
equivalent for that purpose.  The loan, fully disbursed, has been success-
ful in assisting the Sudan Railways in further improving its already
sound position, in many respects beyond the expectations at that time.
2.        In 1962, the Bank commissioned SOFRERAIL of Paris, France to
study the position and future prospects of the Railways; the consultants
issued a comprehensive report in July 1963.
3.        The Government of the Republic of the Sudan has asked the Bank
to assist in firancing that part of its development plan for the Sudan
Railways which is to be carried out during the three-year period, 1965/66 -
1967/68. The Railways' program in its entirety will have covered a ten-
year period 1961/62 - 1970/71 which coincides in time with and is an integral
part of the Governmentts Ten-Year Plan of Economic and Social Development.
4.        The first four years (1961/62 - 1964/65) of the Railways' Ten-
Year Plan have been successfully completed, partially with the assistance of
a loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, amounting to
the equivalent of US$ 19.6 million.
5.        The Railways' capital expenditure in 1965/66 - 1967/68 will
amnount to approximately 1Sd 16.4 million of which the foreign exchange cost
is estimated to be about LSd 11.1 million.   The Government wishes to
borrow LSd 10.8 million - US$ 31 million equivalent.
6.        This report is based on information contained in the SOFRERAIL
report, on an appraisal made by the mission which visited the Sudan during
April and 1lay 1964, and in October 1965.  It has been prepared by Mr. Gunther
Lubbeke and Mr. John McCunniff.
HI. TRANSPORTATION IN THE SUDAN
7.        Sudan covers an area of about one million souare miles, about
five times the size of France, with a population of 13 million and a
density of only 13 persons per square mile. Outside of Khartoum, the
capital (about 300,000 people), the population is thinly and unevenly
distributed. The northern third of the country is a desert; to the
west and southwest are vast areas dotted with occasional nomad camps;
and the south is largely undeveloped, although it has abundant rainfall
and a large agricultural potential.
8.        There is intensive agriculture based on man-made irrigation
works or seasonal flooding in relatively densely-settled and narrow
strips along the Nile, along its branches and tributaries and particu-
larly in the Gezira region, in the Khasm el Girba area and in the Gash
near Kassala. Production from these areas is supplemented to some
extent by that in rainfall areas, principally in central Sudan.



9.        Virtually all productive regions are served by the railway net-
work, three of them being reached by extensions constructed during the
last decade, These are: a) the Er Roseires branch; b) the western
extension to Nyala; and c) the southern extension to Wau.
10.       The most important mode of transportation in the Sudan is the
railway, which handlesabout 80 percent of all freight and about 60 percent
of all passenger traffic. It provides virtually all for-hire land and
inland water transportation. Road development is only in its infancy*
Hard surface roads are found only in the main cities, their immediate
vicinities and along limited stretches adjacent to two or three main cities.
I,       The number of motor vehicles in the Sudan is relatively small
and they are used primarily for short-haul traffic in and around the
major urban areas, The number of trucks and buses declined in 1962, but
the general trend is upward, The following table shows the number of
passenger cars, trucks and buses from 1958 to 196h:
Passenger
Year         Trucks          Buses             cars
1958         12,527            578           11,166
1959         12,219            923           10,338
1960         13,116            604           15,199
1961         15,468          1,214           15,298
1962         1h,767          1,00h           16,781
196h         17,413          1,498           18,967
Figures for 1963 are not available.
120       The Government's Ten-Year Plan of Economic and Social Develop-
ment includes total investments of 1Sd 337 million in the public sector.
Of this, about LSd 63 million, or 19 percent, is for transportation.
Investment in roads, bridges and ferries accounts for ISd 6.5 million,
only 10 percent of the investment for transportation. Moreover, of the
latter amount only MSd 115 million are for roads; I,Sd 3045 million for
bridges; and iSd 0.40 million for road equipment.
13.       The Plan contains small amounts for the survey of new roads
which, when and if constructed, would constitute the beginnings of a
road network. In addition, there is under construction at the present
time, with the assistance of US-AID funds, a new road from Khartoum to
Wad Medani, and the Plan includes a new road from Dilling to Kadugli.
Neither of these would materially affect the over-all traffic volume of
the Railways.
14.       US-AID has also financed the survey of the projected road
Khartoum-Kassala - Port Sudan which has been included in the supplemental
Investment Program for possible start during the Plan period. However,
the Plan of the Government in respect of the Railways and the projected
improvement in railway operations inherent in the Railways' program are
designed to achieve railway capacity equal to demand throughout the Plan



- 3 -
period and there is accordingly little economic justification for
building this road at this time, It appears unlikely that under present
circumstances, the Khartoum-Kassala-Port Sudan road will be cons-
tructed prior to 1970/71.
15.       There is no coastal water transport in the Sudan. The inland
water transport system is operated by the Sudan Railways, and is pri-
marily a feeder service to the railways; the impact of the air service
is minor. The Railways therefore have no important competition. While
there is no immediate need for the Government to be concerned with the
economic coordination of transport in the Sudan, this matter should be
made an integral part of future planning in the transport sector.
III.  THE SUDAS RAIlT1TAYS
A. Scope of Operations
16.       The Sudan Pailways operate 4,740 route-kilometers of single
track railway lines; steamer services on two    separate stretches of
the Mile and its tributaries;  the coimtry's only port of transshipment
between ocean and land transport at Port Sudan; and several hotels,
rest houses, restaurants, dining facilities on trains and steamers and
various catering services.
Be  Ownership, Organization and iTanagement
17.       The Sudan Railways are state owned, and are operated as a
Government department under the direction of the Minister of Communications,
18.       The Government intends to reorganize the Railways as a body
corporate. It will become an independent organization, with such inde-
pendent financial resources, powers and legal status as are required to
enable it to carry out its responsibilities for the management, operation
and development of its various services, in accordance with sound business,
financial and transportation practices.
19.       Management and operations are directed by a General Manager who
is appointed by and is responsible to the Minister of Communications.
20.       Under the General Manager are three deputies.   There are nine
department chiefs; the Chief Traffic Manager, who is also in charge of
operations, the Chief Civil Engineer, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, the
Chief Accountant, the Stores Controller, the Chief Establishment Officer
(personnel), the Port Manager at Port Sudan, the River Engineer at
Khartoum and the Controller of hotels and catering at Khartoum. A Traffic
Research Department was created in 1960. The usual subdivisions exist in
each department.  There are ten traffic districts, two locomotive divisions,
and seven civil engineering districts. The river services are managed in
the same way as those of the railways, coming under the same department
heads and falling within the same operational district.



21.       Port Sudan is under the direction of a Port Manager.   Under him
a dock superintendent is in charge of shore operations, and a harbor
master of marine operations. Traffic in and out by rail is controlled by
the Railwayst Traffic Manager. Maintenance and construction of civil-
engineering iworks are the responsibility of the Railways' Chief Engineer,
22.       Following the recommendations of SOFRERAIL in part, the Traffic
Department has been reorganized. A Central Control Office headed by a
Chief Controller has been established under the Operating Superintendent.
This office controls train and locomotive running in the entire system,
studies traffic requirements and distributes empty freight cars. Traffic
control operators, i.e., train dispatchers, are located at Atbara, Haiya,
Port Sudan, Kassala, Sennar, Khartoum and Kosti.   The efficiency of the
Traffic Department has been improved substantially by these measures.
There appears to be no present need for further changes in the organiza-
tion of the Traffic Department, which in the main has been working well.
C. ?ersonnel and Labor
23.       The classified staff consists of administrative and professional,
sub-professional and clerical and certain technical employees. The classi-
fication and number of personnel employed are shown in Table 1. The number
of employees in relation to the size and other conditions of operations is
reasonable.
2h.       The number of expatriates employed has decreased from 205 in
1961 to 17 in 1965, and there is a serious shortage of qualified engineers,
economists and accountants. The Railways have been making a continuous
but generally unsuccessful effort to attract qualified foreign experts.
The compensation offered has generally been inadequate to attract the
needed personnel. There exists, also, some difficulty in retaining key
indigenous personnel in the face of the higher salaries which private
industry offers. These problems arise primarily because the Railways
have been tied to general governmental rules. The Government has agreed
to approve the higher salaries required to attract needed expatriates,
D. The Railway System
1. Rail Lines
25.       The rail lines are the most important part of the system.   The
civil engineering works, motive power, rolling stock and equipment main-
tenance facilities are briefly described below.
26.       a) Civil Engineering Works:   The principal rail arteries (see
Map) are: (i) Khartoum-Atbara-Port Sudan, on the Red Sea (787 km); -
(ii) Khartoum-Wad Medani-Sennar-Kosti-El Obeid (639 km); and (iii) Haiya-
Kassala-Sennar (802 km). These lines have been opened for traffic between
1897 and 1929. Secondary lines are: (i) Atbara-W4adi Halfal on the
Egyptian Nile, with a branch to Karima (833 km), in operation since 1897
and 1906;  (ii)  Sennar-Er Roseires (220 km) in operation since 1954;



- 5 -
(iii) the Western Extension, Er Rahad-Babanusa-NyCala(685 km)), opened for
traffic by sections in 1956, 1957 and 1959; and (iv) the Southern
Extension, Babanusa-lWau (h45 km), opened for traffic in 1961.
27.       All lines are single track;  the gauge is 316". The main lines
are laid with 75-pound rails, and most of the secondary lines with 50-pound
rails. Relaying of 90-pound rails on the 313 kn Khartoum - Atbara section
started in 1963 a n d   reached Atbara in September 1965.  Domestic hard-
wood, used for ties during recont years in order to save foreign exchange,
is of irregular growth and there are many ties with uneven bottoms which
should have been rejected.  This has been corrected and domestic ties which
do not meet standard requirements are no longer accepted. In additions
about 250,000 hardwood ties are being imported.
28.       Subsoil, of good quality sand, generally serves as ballast.
Stone is used only in short sections as lateral support and not as bearing
ballast. The maximum gradient is 1 in 100 and the minimum curvature is
1,000 feet radius. Bridges and culverts are of substantial construction.
29.       The Communications system consists of general telephone circuits,
supplemented by a teletype network and direct telephones connecting the
main traffic centers. Signalling on the main lines consists of mechanical
interlocking on the stations and electric token instruments which are
satisfactory. On secondary lines signalling is of simp'le but adequate
design.
30.       b) Motive Power:  The Railways have 167 steam locomotives, 72
mainline and 38 switching diesel locomotives, (see Table 2). All steam
locomotives are oil-burning; 91, built between 1920 and 1931 are due for
retirement; and 76 were acquired between 1951 and 1956. All main line
diesel electric locomotives were placed in service since 1961. Of the
38 diesel shunters, five were acquired in 1952 and 30 in 1957 or later.
Most of the existing main line diesels are of about 1,800 h.p. and
17-ton axleload and are not suitable for use on rails of less than 75-pound
weight. Two diesels of about 1,200 h.p. and about 12.5 tons axleload are
suitable for operation on 50-pound rails.
31.       The Railways had experienced substantial difficulties with the
diesel-electric locomotives in connection with air filters and traction
motors as initially installed, and many months of service w-ere lost while
awaiting repairs and refitting. With the assistance of manufacturers,
factory representatives all diesel motive power has been returned to
service. The diesels are otherwise satisfactorily maintained.
32.       c) Rolling Stock:  As of June 30, 1965, there were 349 passenger
cars, 179 service cars and a small number of dining, baggage and mail cars.
Al1 cars have wooden bodies. Revenue-earning freight stock consisted of
5,116 cars. All are on bogies except for about 250 two-axle cars, About
1,670 freight cars are more than 35 years of age and are due for replace-
ment. The stock is generally well maintained.



- 6 -
33.       d) lWorkshops and Running Sheds:  Shops, well equipped for
heavy and light repairs of motive power and rolling stock and for the
building of bodies for passenger cars and freight cars, are concentrated
at Atbara. A small plant for the assembly of freight cars imported in a
sub-assembled condition is located at Port Sudan. Diesel running sheds
are located at Atbara, Port Sudan and Kassala. Temporary facilities are
used at Khartoum and Sennar where new diesel running sheds are under
construction. Steam running sheds exist at the major junctions. The
diesel running sheds are well equipped; but except for the sheds at
Atbara and Khartoum the steam sheds are poor and in some cases obsolete.
This is the result of the Railways' plan for further dieselization0
2. River Services
34.       Steamer services are operated on two sections of the Nile (see
Map) employing 399 units of floating craft (see Table 3). The principal
railway transshipment point is Kosti on the White Nile. Service on the for-
mer Northern Reach between Wadi Halfa and Shellal (Egypt) has been
discontinued in 1964/65 because the existing flat bottom river craft have
to be replaced by craft of adequate draught suitable for navigation in
the deep waters of the large lake to be formed by the Aswan Dam.
35.       The Dongola Reach between Karima and Dongola (287 km) is
operated in all seasons. The Southern Reach extends southward from
Khartoum along the White Nile and some of its tributaries, All-season
services are provided between Khartoum-Kosti-Malakal (720 km), and
between Malakal and Juba (935 km). Services between Malakal and Wau and
between Malakal and Gambela, which is Ethiopian territory, are seasonal.
36.       The main dockyard, situated at Khartoum North,provides main-
tenance and repairs for all floating units on the Southern Reach. The
yard is well laid out, well managed and equipped. It has facilities for
building ne rr-f      A smaller doclkyard exists at Karima. The majority
oi floating crait is old but in sctisi%ctory condition.   Most of the
to-:'iig units ate dieselized.
3. Port Sudan
37.       Port Sudan is the principal gateway for the foreign trade of
the Sudan and the only port in the country capable of berthing ocean
vessels.  Little dredging of the harbor is necessary and vessels drawing
up to 33 feet of water can be berthed at all times.
38.       The major part of the wharf facilities are located on the north
side of the harbor where there are eight general cargo berths with
transit sheds. There are also two berths under construction,to be
completed about April 1966. Extensive privately-owned storage sheds
are also located in the adjacent area.   On the south side, four berths
with about 1,700 feet of quay are available for handling bulk-cargoes,
There is ample open-storage space. A grain silo and a pipeline, to provide
connection from the south berths with a new refinery 12 km south of the
recently constructed port, were placed in operation in October 1964.



- 7 -
39.       The cargo-handling equipment is adequate for the present wharf
facilities and is well maintained. Floating craft are adequate in number
but some of them are old and due for replacement. A small dockyard and
satisfactory fire services are provided. Access by road and rail and
railway installations within the port area are adequate.
E. Operating Efficiency
40.       1.  Railways: Factors which adversely affect operating efficiency
are climatic condiT5ins such as sandstorms in the dry season and washouts in
the rainy season, which frequently interrupt train movements; excessive length
and unequal distances between crossing stations, which reduce the flexa-
bility of train operations, increase train waiting time and have a cumu-
lative adverse effect on line capacity and train punctuality; the
absence of automatic couplers on 45 percent of the rolling stock; and
deformed rail ends on many sections whiclh cause damaging impacts on running
gear of motive power and rolling stock. Most of these matters are being
gradually corrected. In contrast, traffic conditions are quite favorable,
as described in paragraph 47.
41.       The statistics shown in Table 4 indicate that operating effi-
ciency has improved materially during the seven years from 1957/58 to
1963/64. For example, during this period average gross tons per train,
which is higher than that of any European railway, increased 30 percent;
net tons per freight train, 39 percent; net ton-km per car day, 52 percent;
and freight car turn-around, 17 percent. But other indices of efficiency
are not quite satisfactory.   For example, the locomotive kms per available
mainline diesel locomotive (105,000 km in 1963/64) could be increased
substantially by improving maintenance methods and increasing train speeds.
In 1964/65 the utilization of the motive power and the rolling stock
deteriorated due to a decrease in traffic mainly caused by a very poor
cotton crop. However, in general, the productivity is good; management
gives particular attention to efficient and econoimic handling of traffic;
and, under existing circumstances, it has done quite well in attaining
efficiency. Further improvement can be expected.
42.       2.  Port Sudan:   The port is a well-managed and an efficient
operation. Some difficulties had been experienced because of congestion,
the result of delays in railings coincident with record export crops and
sharp increases in imports. However, there was no backlog of railings at
Port Sudan in October 1965. The average rate of cargo handling, about
10 tons per gang hour and 13 tons per hatch hour, is satisfactory.
43.       3.  River Services:   The efficiency of the river services has
been improved by the dieselization of the fleet in recent years and is
satisfactory.
F. Present Traffic
44.       The principal traffic statistics for the railway6, river services
and port for the years 1957/58 - 1964/65, compared with 1952/53, arc set
forth in Table 5.



- 8 -
45.      a. Railways:  The number of passengers rose from 2.4 million in
1952/53 to 3.2 million in 1962/63 or about 37 percent and thereafter de-
clined slightly to 3.1 million in 1963/64 and 1964/65. However, passenger-
kms increased by 73 percent reflecting a substantial rise in the average
length of journey from 192 km to 250 km. In 1963/64 passenger-kms were 33
percent above the year 1957/58, the peak year so far, despite a 9 percent
decline in the number of passengers. Freight traffic is predominantly long-
haul import and export transportation. The average haul is 852 km. For
the year 1964/65, import traffic accounted for 42 percent of the tons and
50 percent of the ton-kms; and export traffic made up 31 percent of the
tonnage and 39 percent of the ton-kms. Twenty-seven percent of the tons
and 11 percent of the ton-kms were local traffic and the small balance
consisted of livestock. Total tons and ton-kms increased by 116 and 147
percent, respectively, in the 1952/53 - 1963/64 period; and by 69 and 90
percent in the six years 1957/58 - 1963/64. Mainly because of a very poor
cotton crop, total tons declined in 1964/65 by 17 percent, and ton-kms by
20 percent, (see paragraph 59).
46.      The principal  export commodities are cotton and cottonseed, cotton-
seed oil cake, groundnuts, dura, sesame and gum arabic. Imports consist
primarily of petroleum products, cement, sugar, wheat, iron and steel, ferti-
lizer, salt and timber. These commodities made up 90 and 70 percent, re-
spectively, of railed exports and imports.
47.      Traffic conditions are generally favorable: a) the bulk of the
traffic is moved to and from Port Sudan; b) up and down traffic is well-
balanced, and therefore the ratio of loaded to total car movements is high
as compared with other railways; and c) the average distances of freight
haul and of passenger trips have always been long and have become even
longer since the Western and Southern extensions were opened for traffic,
in 1959 and 1961.
48.      b. River Services:  River transportation is primarily a feeder
service for the railways. Service on the Northern Reach had been suspended
by the end of the year 1964/65, (paragraph 34).   On the two remaining
sections of the river, traffic is relatively light consisting annually only
of about 125,000 to 150,000 tons of freight and of about 200,000 passengers.
Freight traffic reached a peak 158,000 tons in 1961/62, declined moderately
in the two following years, and rather substantially in 1964/65 to 127,000
tons as a result of unsettled conditions in the southern part of Sudan.
Passenger traffic reached a high of 202,000 passengers in 1964/65.
49.      c. Port Sudan:  While the number of merchant ships calling at Port
Sudan increased by about 10 percent from 1,168 in 1957/58 to 1,294 in 1962/
63 the peak year, a sharp decline to about the 1957/58 level was experienced
in 1964/65. Import tons also were substantially less in that year than in
the two previous years. However, between 1957/58 and 1964/65, total tons of
imports and exports, exclusive of livestock, rose by more than 45 percent.
Port traffic also has been affected by the factors referred to in paragraph
59.

G.  Financial Aspects
1. Balance Sheet
a) General
50.       The financial position as of June 30, 1965 is shown in the pro-
visional balance sheet submitted by the RaiLways (Table 6).   A summary of
the financial position is given below:
Summary Balance Sheet Data as of
June 30  1965
(lES--d 000)
Assets                                 Li a b i liti . e s
Current Assets             21,750       Current Liabilities           4,808
Provident Fund                1,328
Loans                        20,483
Net Fixed Assets           63,657       Total Liabilities            26,619
E q u i t-y
Capital - Sudan Gov't.       21,548

Total Equity                 58,788
Total Liabilities
Total Assets               85,407         and Equity                 85,407
b) Current Assets and Liabilities
51.       Current assets are more than 4 times current liabilities.    Ex-
cluding from current assets stores and materials of ESd 6.6 million, the
liquidity ratio is more than 3 to 1. Included in current assets is the
Government Current Account which was in favor of the Railways in an amount
of ISd 9.5 million. The current and liquid position of the Railways is
good.
c) Debt
52.       Outstanding long-term debt as of June 30, 1965 is LSd 20.5 million.
This consists of IBRD Loan No. 202, LSd 11.5 million, with a term of 20 years
from 1958 at 5-5/8 percent interest; a loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development in the amount of LSd 6.6 million equivalent, with
IL percent interest and a maturity date of 1977; and LSd 2.4 million owed to
the Government for railway construction before 1914, which bears no
interest. The debt-equity ratio was a favorable 26/74.



- 10 -
d) Financial Arrangements with Government
53.       1. Government Capital.  The Sudan Government has provided money
for capital expenditures in excess of the Railways' own resources. Such
capital expenditures are approved as part of the budget. These Government
funds have been permanent investments and are considered as equity capital
which bears interest at 4 percent per year with one temporary exception -
funds for the railway extension to the Khasm El Girba dam site, which bear
no interest at present on about WSd 500,CCO.
54.       2. Cash Arrangements. While the Railways maintain their funds
in several commercial banks, the bulk of their cash is kept in the Bank of
Sudan where the Railways' account is automatically maintained at a low maxi-
mum level. All excess funds over LSd 2,000 are transferred on the first and
fifteenth of each month to the Government's account. All overdrafts are met
by automatic transfers back from the Government account. These transactions
are reflected in changes in the balance of the Railways' Current Account with
the Government.
55.       3. The Government Current Account.  All financial settlements, in-
cluding not only those of cash transfers by the Bank of Sudan but many other
items, are entered in a current account by both parties - the Government and
the Railways. Each party may charge or credit the other for numerous defined
transactions. The balance due the Railways, as shovm on the balance sheet,
was RSd 9.5 million on June 30, 1965.   It had increased from ESd 4.2 million
on June 30. 1963 and TSd 7.3 million on Fcbruary 29, 1964.
56.       W4hile the Government Current Account procedures are convenient,
they have few other advantages and many disadvantages. Only the effect of
thousands of transactions is disclosed in the financial statements. It
should be noticed that while the Railways have borrowed large sums at in-
terest (for example, 5-3/8 percent for IBRD Loan 202), the Government is
the beneficiary of the proceeds of these loans up to LSd 9.5 million without
interest.
57.       This matter was discussed during negotiations and in order to im-
prove the Railways' accounting and their financial relations with the Govern-
ment in this respect, it has been agreed that the current account will be
settled in the first instance no later than July 1, 1966 and periodically
thereafter on June 30 of each year until such time as the Railways are re-
organized as a body corporate, when transactions between the Government and
the Railways will be placed on a cash basis. The balance of the current ac-
count at the time of each settlement in the interim period will be deducted
from or added to, as appropriate, the Railways' Capital Account entitled
"Capital Provided by the Sudan Government". The interest payable by way of
dividend on such Government capital will be increased on the date of the in-



- 11 -
itial settlement of the current account from the present annual rate of
4 percent to an annual rate of 6-1/2 percent which is more in line with
the cost of money in the Sudan. The Railways on that date will establish in
their own name an account in the Post Office Savings Bank, as suggested
by the Ministry of Finance, to which the Bank of Sudan will transfer from
time to time all amounts exceeding LSd 2,000 standing to the credit of the
Railways to the end that the cash balances of the Railways may be identi-
fied and measured at any time and that the Governmrient may have the use of
such funds as may not be required by the Railways as set forth in the annual
budgets. These changes will reduce otherwise substantial railway cash bal-
ances on which the Government assertedly has found it difficult to pay in-
terest and on which interest would be paid in the future by the Post Office
Savings Bank.
2. Earnings
58.       The Railways have operated consistently at a profit after allow-
ance for depreciation of equipment. Since 1957/58 earnings have been parti-
cularly good as shown in detail in Table 7 which is summarized below in mil-
lions of Sudanese pounds.
Net                         %
Operating    Operating     Operating       Net       Operating
Year       Revenues     Expenses      Revenues       Income       Ratio
1959/60      13.5          9.8           3.7           2.8         73
1960/61      13.9          9.9           h.1           3.1         71
1961/62      15.9         10.9           5.0           h.O         68
1962/63      18.3         12.2           6.2          5.1          66
1963/6h      19.2         12.6           6.6          5.5          65
1964/65      17.0         13.1           3.9           2.6         77
Mote:  Operating expenses include depreciation, exclude interest.
59.       Following five successive years of financial improvement,  from
1959/60 to 1963/64, inclusive, the Railways experienced a sharp decline in
traffic, revenues and net income in 1964/65. This decline was caused pri-
marily by a very poor cotton crop of no more than about 0.535 million bales,
compared with 1.15 million in 1961/62 and 0.850 million in 1962/63. The
large dependence of Sudan's economy on this single crop led to lower incomes
generally, to some extent to restrictions on credit to private investors and
resulted in a general slowing down in economic activity in 1964. Railways'
traffic was materially affected with respect not only to export railings,
but in large measure also with respect to railway import and local traffic
as well as traffic through Port Sudan.
60.       Nevertheless, during the last six complete fiscal years, 1959/60-
1964/65, the interest earned ratio has not been less than 5 times; the debt-



- 12 -
service coverage has not been less than 3 times; and the over-all return,
on the average of net fixed assets at the beginning and end of the year,
has not been less than 6.9 percent, declining to that figure in 1964/65
from more than 12 percent in 1962/63 and in 1963/64.
3. Rate Structure
General
61.       Rates and fares are established by the General Manager, subject
to the approval of the Minister of Finance and Economics. All other regu-
lations ordered by the General Manager concerning conditions of carriage
of persons and property are subject to the approval of the Council of
Ministers.
Railways and Steamers
62.      VWith only a few exceptions, the same freight rates and passenger
fares apply to both rail and river services. For passenger traffic four
classes of fares are provided. Reduced fares are offered to frequent users,
students and youth groups. A consolidated tariff publication sets forth the
conditions and rates for transportation of freight by the railway and steamer
services. The freight tariffs are based primarily on the value of service
principle as measured by the value of the commodity.
63.       All goods are assigned to one of 17 classes, for which two rate
scales are provided; the first applies to shipments weighing a minimum of 10
kilograms up to full carloads; and the second applies to parcels weighing up
to 100 kilograms. Rates per kilometer fall sharply as distances increase.
In addition, a substantial volume of traffic, notably cotton and petroleum
products, is transported under special contracts at agreed rates.
6h.       The classes of passenger service and fares are too numerous; and
very few passengers, about 4 and 14 percent, respectively, use second and
third-class services. The number of classes should be reduced to three. The
reduction should coincide with improvements in service and in passenger
amenities; and the fares should be adjusted in accordance with these improve-
ments.
65.       The rate structure does not sufficiently reflect the differences
in costs as between rail and river services and between large and small ship-
ments. The wide spread between the classes (e.g., class 17 is only 8 percent
of class 1 at 165 kilometers) apparently exaggerates the differences in costs
for full carloads of each of these commodity groups; and the rates do not
reflect the differences in costs which vary with the size of the shipment.
Port Sudan
66.       Port rates assessed against ships consist of charges for the hire
and use of tugs, towage of ships not under main-engine power, local light



- 13 -
dues for entry to the harbor, port dues based on length of stray in port,
berthing, mooring and unmooring. Cargo is subj'ect to charges for the hire
of cranes and other cargo handling equipment; is subject to quay dues on
imports related to their value and on exports related to their weight; to
porterage or charges for handling on the quays in transit sheds and storage
areas, quay rent, local hauling per freight car, demurrage and other miscel-
laneous services such as wei.ghing and re-coopering. Quay dues on imports are
assessed at 1.2 percent ad valorem and collected by the Customs Department
for the account of the port administration. The basis for the assessment of
this charge is the value shown on the customs declaration. More than 50 per-
cent of port revenues are derived from quay dues.
67.       No attempt has yet been made to determine the costs of providing
port services; and the port tariff should be reviewed in order to attain a
closer relationship between rates and costs.
68.       All of these rate problems were discussed during negotiations. It
has been agreed that the Railways will hire consultants to carry out the
initial studies and to recommend appropriate rate structures for the railways,
steamer services and port operations in reasonable relationship to their
separate costs and that the Railways will engage an experienced traffic re-
search officer and another traffic research expert to train the Railways'
staff to carry out further continuing studies in view of their importance in
planning the Railways' future development.
4. Budget, Accounting and Auditing
a) Budget
69.       The Railways annually prepare a separate operating and capital ex-
penditure budget which is subject to the approval of the Minister of Communi-
cations and the Council of Ministers.  A single document is published by the
1HIinister of Communications containing memoranda of revenue, expenditure, ap-
propriations, and capital expenditure which shows the estimated costs of new
works appearing for the first time together with the means of financing them.
It also lists other works not yet completed, the amounts spent and the amounts
necessary to complete them. Completion of a program is assured when its budget
is approved and it is not specified in which financial year the expenditure is
to be made.
b) Accounting
70.       The Railways' accounts are separated from those of the Government
and they are kept,with some exceptions,in accordance with commercial account-
ing principles.  The accounts are accurately kept and internal audit proce-
dures are satisfactory.
71.       Depreciation,based on the straight-llne method related to reasonable
service lives,is charged to operating expenses, with respect to depreciable
assets which include rolling stock, motive power, road vehicles, floating
craft, workshop and other equipment. Non-depreciable assets include land,



- 14 -
buildings, permanent way, quays, and other works. The cost of non-depreciable
assets is chnrted to the propurty accounts and deducted from fixed
assets in the year in which the asset is retired. If a replacement is ac-
quired, the cost of the new asset is added to the fixed assets account. No
change is made in that account thereafter until retirement occurs.
72.       A special provision is made for the estimated increase in the cost
of replacing depreciable assets. This is akin to depreciation, although it
is not calculated on a formal basis, is not broken down as between the various
services, such as raiLways or port, and it is not charged to operating ex-
penses but treated as a charge against profit and loss. The contributions
have fluctuated widely - from LSd 750,000 in 1961/62 to LSd 110,000 in 1962/63.
Deductions from the provision are made when a particular job is completed,
regardless of its      duration, on the basis of the estimated difference
between the cost of the original item and the higher cost of its replacement.
73.       The Railways' present methods of handling non-depreciable assets and
of providing for the enhanced cost of depreciable assets should be modified
and improved. This subject has been discussed with the Railways and with
the Government. Since July 1, 1965, all depreciable assets have been made
subject to straight-line depreciation based on reasonable service lives.
c) Auditing
74.       The Railways' accounts are subject to annual audit oy the Govern-
ment's Auditor General, a department of the Ministry of Finance.   A statement
in the form of a letter to the Railways,with copy to the Ministry of Finance
Undersecretary,is issued but this contains no certificates that the accounts
are accurately kept in accordance with generally accepted accounting princi-
ples. Moreover, external audits usually have been delayed at times for a
year or more.
75.       This matter was discussed with the Railways and with the Ministers
of Finance and Communications. A commercial firm of qualified accountants
will be commissioned to audit the books annually.

IV. TIE RAILWIAYS DEVELOPYflNT PROGRA14
A, Description and Cost Estimates
76.       The Ten-Year Capital Development Program of the Sudan Railways
was inaugurated in 1961 as part of the Government's Ten-Year Plan of
Economic and Social Development, 1961/62 - 1970/71. The total expenditure
of the Program,which was later somewhat reduced, was originally set at the
level of LSd 35 million, of which LSd 8 million was carried over from
unfinished previous plans. The Program investment represented 12 percent
of the Government's plan and about 60 percent of the investments planned
for transport.
77.       The objective of the Ten-Year Program is to increase the Railways'
efficiency and capacity to cope with the system's increasing load during
the present decade. The investment includes acquisition of main-line and
shunting diesel locomotives, railcars, passenger and freight cars, roller
bearings and automatic couplers; station yards; improvements to signalling;
relaying Khartoum-Port Sudan line; the acquisition of rivercraft; and
facilities at Port Sudan.
78.       In preparing the Governmentts Ten-Year Plan it was assumed that
the Railways would be able to finance their own development program. In the
first three years of the Plan it became necessary to revise the Program
several times and adjust it downward in relation with the Governmentts
ability to provide foreign exchange. In 1962, the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development made a loan to the Railways of about LSd 7 million
equivalent, of which about iSd 5.7 million was used for the purchase of
30 main-line diesel electric locomotives, 13 shunting diesel locomotives
and a part of the 90-lb. rails needed for relaying of the Khartoum-Port
Sudan line.
79.       In April 1964, the Railways proposed a new Capital Development
Program for the last seven years 1964/65 - 1970/71 of the Ten-Year Plan,
under the assumption that additional funds from a Bank loan would become
available in 1964/65.  This Program,jas modified in October   1965 is shown
in detail in Table 3.  Its total estimated costs are:
Foreign Exchange expenditures      bSd 12.6 million
Local Expenditures                       4.3   "
Customs duties for imported
equipment                           2.7   X
Total               19.6 million
Contingencies on foreign
exchange components of
the Program in 1966/67
and 1967/68                       06 million
Grand Total           LSd 20.2 million



- 16 -
80.       According to their budget rules, the Railways do not include
contingencies in their Programs. Any increase for this purpose of the
local expenditure component of the Program could be covered by the Rail-
ways' cash generation (see Chapter VI). Contingencies are added to that
part of the foreign exchange cost of the years 1966/67 and 1967/68 of
the Program which would be financed by the proposed Bank loan (see para 101).
81.       The Seven-Year Program includes the dieselization of the Wadi
Halfa and of the Er Rahad-Babanusa lines. However, the Railways hope to
dieselize the entire system,should sufficient foreign exchange and trained
staff become available. There are also further extensions in the West
from lNyala to Geneina and in the South from Wau to Juba under preliminary
consideration. These are supplementary items in the Government's Ten-Year
Plan and in the Railway program.  If they are found to be economically
justified after further study and if sufficient funds are available,they
will be added to the last two or three years of the Program.
B. Future Traffic
82.       Estimates of future traffic, prepared by the Railways for the
rail, steamer and port operations, are summarized in Table 9, for the six
year period 1965/,66 to 1970/71. The forecasts were prepared in October
1965 with the assistance of an economist of the Ministry of Finance and
Economics and are a revision of those made in April 1964 during the initial
appraisal mission. The forecasts are based on the various goals of the
Government's Ten-Year Plan, as revised in the light of experience during
the first four years of the Plan. They are also based on a detailed eva-
luation of the volume of freight traffic during the recent past, parti-
cularly 1963/64 and 1964/65. Comparing the 1970/71 estimates with the
last complete year, 1964/65, rail revenue tons will rise by 59 percent;
ton kilometers by 53 percent and passenger kilometers by about 35 percent.
Steamer service freight tons are expected to increase by 42 percent and
no substantial increase is expected in steamer passenger traffic. Exports
through Port Sudan are estimated to increase by 74 percent whereas imports
would rise by only 16 percent principally due to import substitution.
Total tons through Port Sudan are expected to increase by about 38 percent.
The estimates of traffic are reasonably conservative, and they are accep-
table for the purpose of future planning and for estimating future finances.
More detailed explanations of the forecasts are set forth in Annex 1.
C. Economic Justification
1. General
83.       The Bank's economic mission to the Sudan stated in its
October 1963 report (AF-14a) that in the main the Ten-Year Plan of the
Government of Sudan is sound and realistic; that the major priorities
established in the Plan are in accord with the objectives and the magni-
tude of the proposed investments; that the investments are within the
capabilities of the country, provided appropriate aid is forthcoming from
abroad; and that since the railways will remain the dominant carrier -
at least during the Plan period and probably for many years beyond -
measures to increase its effective capacity must have top priority.



- 17 -
8L4.     Thus, the most essential element in the economic justification
of the Railways' Development Plan is that the Plan is necessary i-n order
to achieve the goals established bvy the Government's Ten-Year Plan for
the economy of the Sudan. IWithout the increased capacity and moderniza-
tion of the Railways inherent in its Development Plan, there would exist
a serious obstacle in the path of the country's economic development.
2. Specific Items
85.      a) Main-Line Diesels. The sixteen main-line diesel locomotives,
which will have 13-ton axl_eload in order to permit rumning on lines with
50-lb. rails, would completely dieselize: i) the Atbara-Wadi Halfa and
Karima line, which is nowi the onl-r steam traction section north and east
of lKhartoum; and ii) the Er Rahad-Babanusa section where the water supply,
always poor, has become even more difficult, as the existing wolls are
nearly exhausted. It is now necessary to carry water over a 350-kn section.
86.      The annual savings in eliminating water transport and in reduced
traction and maintenance costs are conservatively estimated to be 2Sd 157,000
based on recent  traffic data.  Assuming a 20-year life,the rate of return
would be about 22 percent on the cost of the equipment net of customs duties.
87.      b) Shunting Locomotives.  The procurement of 31 dilesel shunters to
replace existing steam equipment, ranging in age from 33 to 60 years and
due for replacement, would result in annual savings in traction, water
supply and maintenance of about LSd 175,000 annually, which may be compared
to an investment of 1:Sd 953,000 net of import duties. The return is
24 percent.
88.      c) Diesel Rail Cars. The three diesel rail car sets would be the
first to handle additional passenger traffic on the Khartoum-Aedani section
and represent an attempt to give better service for the public. as no
comparable cost data for rail cars and steam-hauled passenger-trains are
available in Sudan, it has not been practicable to estimate the savings over
steam traction now in use or the return on the investment. However, the
acquisition of this equipment is in line with the general trend in many
countries where substantial savings and improved service have been the
general result of rail car operations. It is fairly certain that the well-
known benefits of dieselization and the effects of additional traffic
induced by- better service will have in this case also favorable economic
results.
89.      d) Passenger and Service Cars.  Of the 68 new cars, 65 are replace-
ments of over-age stock.  The three additions to the fleet will help to
accommodate increases in traffic not met by other operating improvements.
90.      The 81 service cars, largely additions to the fleet, are necessary to
carry out the planned improvements in inspecting and maintaining permanent way
and structures.



- 18 -
91.      e) Freight Cars. Of the present, freight car stock (5,808 cars), about
1,600 or 27 percent are between 35 and 60 years of age and are due for re-
tirement. The 350 freight cars and 90 livestock wagons are replacements
but represent also improvements as they will have greater capacity and bet-
ter technical standards. The brake vans are also replacements. The 20
petroleum tank wagons are additions needed to meet increased traffic require-
ments. The estimated annual net earni-ngs of =Sd 72,000 related to net cost
of BSd 64,000 for the tank cars represent very substantial returns.
92.      f) Automatic Couplers. At present 55 percent of the rolling stock
is fitted with automatic couplers. Full benefits resulting from reduced
shunting time, fewer train breaks and ability to assemble heavier trains
will come only when the remaining 45 percent are equipped in a similar
manner. The cost of equipping the total fleet is approximately L-Sd 1.2
million.  The estimated annual benefits are ].Sd 138,000. The return over
a period of 20 years is 12 percent.
93.      g) Roller Bearings. Thle plan is to equip all passenger cars and all
freight cars not older than 20 years with roller bearings in order to facili-
tate increases in vehicle speeds, to reduce delays and maintenance expenses
due to "hot boxes" and reduce other materials costs such as those for oil
and packing materials   The annual savings are conservatively estimated at
1Sd 170,000. The rate of return from these benefits during the useful
average life of about 20 years is approximately 14 percent.
94.      h) Relaying Khartoum-Port Sudan Line.  This line wYas laid with 75-
pound rail from 50 to 60 years ago and the track is worn out. Rail breakings
occur frequently; renewal is urgent and should be completed as soon as
possible.  The heavier rail of 90-pound weight is necessary in order to
increase the maximum and average speed of trains, to improve utilization
of locomotives and rolling stock and to increase operating efficiency in
general. In 196h/65, about 95,000 locomotive and 2.8 million car-running
hours were required.  The re-railing of the main railway artery over which
the bulk of the traffic moves would permit increasing the maximum speed
from 60 to 80 km per hour, and the average speed from 34 to 40 Ian per hour.
For this same traffic as experienced in 1964/65, by the re-railing locomo-
tive hours would be reduced to 81,000 and the vehicle-hours would be reduced
to 2.4 million. The savings represent 560 locomotive and 18,000 car-days.
Based on the average capital and operating costs per running day, the
benefits would amount to =Sd 59,400 annually, for both locomotives and cars,
due only to the higher train speeds, which is equivalent to increased
line capacity of 17 percent.
95.      In addition, the foregoing 18,000 car days would release 35 freight
and 15 passenger cars for additional traffic, resulting in increased annual
net revenue from freight cars only of  _Sd 46,000.  Savings in track
maintenance due to the heavier rail, improved fastenings and welded joints
would reduce track maintenance costs by an estimated !Sd 25,000 annually.



- 19 -
96.       Taking into account that the benefits calculated above are for
the entire Khartoum-Port Sudan line (787 km) but only 600 km are included
in the Program, and that the benefits are chargeable only to the 20 per-
cent of the cost which represents betterments, it follows that the return
over the 25 years estimated life of the rails is 9.5 percent.
97.      i) Port Sudan Works. The construction of berths 8 and 9 has been
carried over from the 1961/63 program.  It is not part of the Government's
Ten-Year Plan, which does,however,include token provision for preparatory
plarning for a second port expected to become necessary in the future.
The construction of berths 8 and 9 is well advanced.   For reasons stated
later in this report the construction costs are not included in the
proposed Bank loan.
98.      The procurement of six cranes and lighit cargo handling eouipment
and the construction of a transit shed are ancillary to the new berths.
The two tugs, barges and pontoons are required for a proposed lighterage
operation in periods of peak shipping traffic and to utilize more fully
existing facilities along the shallow draft portion of the north quay.
No quantitative analysis of these facilities is necessary.   Being revenue-
earning equipment in a profitable port, the rates for their use will be so
adjusted as to yield a reasonable return.
99.      j) River Services. The river services have been recently rehabili-
tated and additional equipment will be made available by the discontinuance
of service on the northern reach. The relatively modest investments in-
cluded in the Plan cover replacement of a small amount of plant and
machinery.  Procurement of a sm2ll dredger is necessary in order to clear
portions of the southern reach which frequently becomes congested with
water hyacinths.
100.     Conclusion. The overall economic rate of return for the Railways'
Development Plan is almost 15 percent and this is satisfactory.
V. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
101.     The Project covers the three years 1965/66-1967/68 of the Railways'
Capital Development Program for the seven-year period 1964/65 - 1970/71,
which is shown in detail on Table 8. The first year, 1964/65, of the
Program has been eliminated from the Project because it is virtually
complete and 78 percent of the foreign exchange expenditure involved has
been financed from the unused balance of the Kuwait Loan, i.e., the first
lot of 8 shunting locomotives and 90 lb. rails for about 100 km of track.
The costs of the Project are summarized below:

including contingencies     5,286               11,091      16,377
The Project includes abouit 80 percent of the cost of the total
Program and 84 percent of its forei.gn exchange cost.
The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange cost
of the Project, except for the following items:
a)  the construction of new buildings and the improvement of
existing ones including electricity and water supply; and
b)  the completion of the construction of new berths Nos. 8 and
9 at Port Sudan.
102.     The reasons for excluding the above two items from the proposed
Loan are the following:  the construction and improvement of buildings
is a continuous operation with a small foreign exchange component but
involves a great nunmber of minor imports of materials and fittings;
and the construction of the new berths at Port Sudan is well advanced,
and in addition, there is litigation pending between the Railways
and a first contractor concerning a contract signed in October 1962 but
later cancelled.
103.     The proposed List of Goods is summarized below:



_ 21 -
(Amounts in 1Sd 1,000)
I. Railways:
Motive Power and Rolling Stock                   4,763
Other Works and Procurements                    4,502

Total allocated amount                            10,186
Contingencies                                        614
Total Loan                                        10,800
US$ million equivalent                             31.0
(Details are shown on Table 10).
104.      The biggest item in the List of uoods is the relaying of 500 Ion
of the Khartoum-Atbara-Port Sudan line with 90-pound rails which are to
replace the present 75-lb rails. The Railways would not have the full
benefits of the heavier rails by increasing the maximum speed if rails
were to be laid on inadequate crossties and without weldilng the rails at
lengths of about 120 to 150 feet. However, satisfactory understandings
havebeen reached during loan negotiations that the Railways will undertake:
a)  measures to improve the standards of the crossties supplied
by domestic sawmills and to import hardwood ties as far as
necessary;
b) welding of rail joints to suitable length of rails.
Procurement of a movable rail welding plant would be financed
by the proposed loan. It is included in Item 11 on Table 10.
B. Cost Estimates
105.     Cost estimates made by the Railways,reflecting recent prices, are
reasonable. An average of 6 percent for contingencies is added to items
financed from the proposed Bank loan.
C. Procurement and Construction
106.     Procurement of equipment which would be financed by the proposed
Loan will be on the basis of international competitive bidding. Construc-
tion of passenger and service cars on imported bogies and underframes;
the installation of automatic couplers and roller bearings; and re-railing
of the permanent way will be done oy the Railwayst own personnel.

VI. FUTURE EARTINGS AND FINANCES
107.,    The Railways have prepared estimates of future earnings and
finances, based on traffic studies. The estimated revenues and expenses
are shown in Table 119 Table 12 is the corresponding statement of con-
densed balance sheet data and Table 13 sets forth cash requirements and
availability for each of the sane fiscal years. The future earnings and
finances of the Railways will remain quite good.
108.     The earnings forecast, in millions of Sudanese pounds, is shown
below:
Net
Operating  Operating   Operating              Yet      Operating
Period    Revenues   Expenses    Revenues    Interest   Income   Ratio  %
1965/66      18.7        15.9         2.8       0.9       2.2       85
1966/67      19.7        17.0         2.7       1.1       2.0       86
.1967/68      20.3        17.1        3.1       1.3       2.h       84
1968/69      21.2        17.3         3.9       1.3       3.2       82
1969/70      22.0        17.5         4o5       1.3       3.9       79
1970/71      23.0        17.6         5.4       1.2       h.9       76
Notes:  Operating Expenses include depreciation.
Net Income includes non-operating revenues.
109.      The above forecast assumes that while various rate relationships
may be adjusted more in line with costs, little change will be made in
their general level or earning power, except for Port Sudan where a
reduction in revenues of 11 percent is assumed in 1967/68, recovering in
1970/71 to the level of 1966/67. The rates on imoorts appear on the high
side and should be brought into reasonable relationiship with costs.
The forecast also takes into account substantial improvements in the
Railways' depreciation policy, whereby much depreciable property, princi-
pally consisting of permanent way and Port Sudan facilities, will be made
subject to straight line depreciation.   Depreciation charges will rise
sharply in 1965/66 and again in 1966/67. Operating expenses are adjusted
upward in varying degrees. WTages and salaries reflect a 10 percent
increase in 1966/67, as a result of making the Railways autonomous,
The overall wage bill, including post-service benefits, is expected to
rise about 28 percent by 1970/71. During the period, fuel costs are
expected to rise by 36 percent; materials and supplies by 52 percent;
depreciation by 132 percent; and other expenses by 36 percent. Total
operating expenses would increase on average by 34 percent after giving
effect to the savings to be gained from the Development Program. Interest
expense does not include payments on Government capital which is considered
an appropriation of net income.



- 23 -
110.      Return on net fixed assets will be 5.1 percent in 1965/66, will
decline to 4.9 percent in 1966/67 and thereafter rise progressively to
8.8 percent in 1970/71. The return is materially affected by the substan-
tial increases in depreciation in 1965/66 and in 1966/67.   Times interest
earned would range betw.een 2.8 times in 1966/67 and 1967/68 and 4.9 times
in 1970/71. Debt service coverage never drops within the future six-
year period below a ratio of 2.7 times.
lll.      As shown in the balance sheet data set forth in Table 12, the
current and liquid ratios will remain quite good, even though they reflect
the annual settlement of the current account referred to earlier (paragraph
57).  The agreement to settle this account annually will also affect equity
by reason of the gradual reduction in Government paid-in capital but the
debt-equity ratios will remain satisfactory, never being less favorable
than 35/65 in 1967/68 and improving to 31/69 in 1970/71.
112.      For the period 1965/66 - 1970/71, Table 13 shows that the Railways'
cash will decline to !=Sd 1.2 million in 1966/67. This represents about
9 percent or about one month's estimated annual operating expenses in that
year, excluding depreciation. This is an adequate level of wdorking cash
capital for the Railways. After 1966/67 the cash position rises progressively
to ]Sd 3.3 million in 1970/71.
1130      Investments in capital improvements are relatively small in
the last three years of the development program, 1968/69 - 1970/71, repre-
senting less than 10 percent of the total. While the iIArestments in the
latter part of the program are in accordance with the Government's 10-Year
Plan, it is reasonable to assume that investments in the last three years
may be increased with Governrnent approval.  Assuming that about ISd 1.3
million is adequate for cash-working purposes, the cumulative cash balance
in 1970/71 would provide ISd 2.0 million for additional investments in this
period. Should investment requirements exceed LSd 2..0 million the money
could be obtained by reducing repayments of Government capital advances.
114.      Taking all factors into consideration, the future financial
position of the Railways will remain sound.
VII. COLICLIJSICONS AD RECOvIENDATIONS
115.      The Railways' program for the years 1964/65 - 1970/71 appears
to be sound but it will be necessary to re-examine it from time-to-time
in respect of later years' investments in order to keep it abreast of
developments. The Project, which is the three years 1965/66 - 1967/68 of
the program, is technically and financially sound, economically justified,
and will provide in a reasonable manner needed replacements and some
additional capacity to meet a growing demand for rail transportation.
The estimates of cost are realistic. Proposed procurement procedures are
acceptable. The Railways are well organized internally and well managed
and operated, although improvements in operations are possible and means
to this end are being initiated. The past earnings have been good and the
future financial position will remain sound.



- 24 -
u6.       The Government confirmed during loan negotiations its intention
to reorganize the Railways as a separate body corporate with such indepen-
dent financial resources, powers and legal status as are required to
enable it to carry out its responsibilities for the management, operation
and development of its various services, in accordance with sound business,
financial and transportation practices.
117.      Satisfactory understandings have been reached during negotiations
on the follotiing matters: (i) standards for railway crossties; (ii) welding
of rail joints; (iii) reduction in the distances between some crossing
stations; (iv) amendment of the depreciation accounting methods; (v) em-
ployment of independent commercial auditors; (vi) hiring of expatriates
and other personnel problems; (vii) costing of rail, river and port services;
(viii) establishment of rates more close'ly related to costs; and (ix) finan-
cial relations with the Government.
118.      The Project is suitable for a Bank loan to the Governmeint
of US$31 million equivalent, which would be made available to the Railways
on the same terms as the proposed loan.   A term of 25 years is recommended,
including a period of grace of 4-1/2 years.

SUDAN RAILWMAYS
Estimates of Future Traffic Volumes
l.o General
The Railways have estimated future passenger and freight traffic
in their export, import and internal services and for livestock, for the
years 1965/66 to 1970/71. The forecast shown in Table 9 in summary form
for all services is based on the following principal assumptions:
a) That the Government's aim, embodied in its Ten-Year Plan,
1960/61 to 1970/71, for an annual increase of 5.2 percent in gross
domestic product, and an annual increase of 2.3 percent in
per capita income will be achieved.  (During the four-year
period, 1960/61 to 1964/65, gross domestic product and per
capita income on average rose somewhat less rapidly than the
Plan objectives.)
b) That the Khashm El Girba Dam recently completed on the Atbara
River will permit the irrigation of 1509000 feddans ij of new
land in the year 1965/66, another 100,000 feddans in 1966/67
and an additional 100,000 feddans in 1967/68.
c) That the Roseires Dam on the Blue Nile will permit the irriga-
tion of new areas generally referred to as the Rahad project
totalling 430,000 feddans eventually, and 270,000 feddans by
1970/71.
d) That mechanized rainland.farming, should according to present
government estimates bring 800,000 feddans of virgin land into
production of dura, cotton and sesame.  It is expected that
300,000 feddans wfould be in production in 1968/69, 500,000
feddans in 1969/70 and 800,000 in 1970/71.
e) In the Gezira-I.anagil area some 200,000 feddans of new produc-
tion will be achieved, by 1970/71 principally as a result of
crop intensification and additional plantings of ground. nuts
and grain.
f) That in addition to increased over-all agricultural production
and exports, the economic structure of Sudan would. be broadened
by an industrial expansion ranging across a variety of items,
mainly consumer goods, building materials and petroleum products,
increasing the share of industrial production in the composition
of the gross national prcduct from 9 percent in 1960/61 to about
16 percent in 1970/71.
/ 1 feddan = 1.038 acres = 4,200 square meters.



Anmex 1
Page 2
g) That the target of the Plan to increase domestic production
so as to achieve a substitution for imports will be largely
attained by 1970/71; that the principal imports affected
annually would be sugar, cement, wheat, cotton yarn and
cloth, glass and glasswares, and paper and paper products;
and that imports and exports of Sudan would be approaching
a balance by 1970/71. The import substitution policy would
increase the railways' local traffic.
2, Railways
The Railways' forecast is set forth for various classes of ser-
vices for which varying income per ton-kilometer is earned and for the
principal commodities transported including those for which the traffic
pattern in the future will be subjected to specific factors.
A major factor in the forecast is proper evaluation of the rail-
way freight traffic volume transported in each of the Last five years,
when growth in ton-miles was 18.4 percent in each of the years 1961/62 and
1962/63 and 12.5 percent in 1963/64. In 1964/65, net ton-kilometers de-
clined by 17 percent in the aggregate. The traffic losses were 9 percent
on rail exports, 20 percent on imports, 26 percent on local hauls and
6 percent on livestock.
The 'arge increases in traffic during the 1961/62 - 1963/64
period, in addition to a natural yearly rise, were due principally to the
removal of import restrictions in 1961, the construction of the Khasm El
Girba and the Roseires dams, the construction of housing for many thousands
of people relocated from the Wadi H'lfa area to the Khasm El Girba area
because of the Aswan High Dam, an unprecedented building boom at Khartoum
and the very good cotton crop in 1962/63. The lesser increase in 1963/64,
while quite substantial, was affected by a less favorable cotton crop.
This, however, permitted the Railways to clear up backlogs of grain and
other produce stored in country warehouses and to reduce the accumulation
of imports at Port Sudan. The large reduction in 1964/65 was due in the
main to poor export crops generally including cotton. The forecast of
railwqay freight traffic in relation to the poor year 1964/65, varies with
the class of traffic.  The rise, from 1964/65 to 1970/71, for export
traffic is expected to be almost 75 percent for export ton-kilometers,
23 percent on imports, 22 percent on local traffic and 31 percent on live-
stock. The average is 53 percent for the period and the annual average
is about 8 percent.
3e Steamers
Because of the discontinuance of service on the Northern reach,
the Railways' steamer passenger traffic declined substantially in 1964/65.
As only a small amount of freight traffic had been handled on the Northern
reach, freight traffic was not.affected by the discontinuance of this
service nearly as much as passenger traffic. Passenger traffic, as showrn
in Table 9, is expected to continue to decline slightly in 1965/66 to
202,000 passengers and then to increase to 212,000 in 1970/71.



Annex 1
Page 3
Freight traffic on the river amounted to 127,000 tons in 196h/65 and
would rise, according to the forecast, to 181,000 tons in 1970/71, an
increase of 42 percent for the six-year period.
4. Port Sudan
The export traffic for Port Sudan is expected to increase by
15 percent in 1965/66 above the low prior year. From i964/65 to 1970/71
the rise in exports would be about 74 percent, equivalent to an average
annual rise of 10 percent. Imports through Port Sudan are expected to
decline in 1965/66 and to rise moderately thereafter. A decline in
general cargo tonnage of about 35 percent would be offset by an increase
of some 50 percent in the handling of petroleum products. Total tonnage
through Port Sudan, including both imports and exports, according to the
Railwayst estimates, will increase from 2,4 million tons in 1964/65 to
3.3 million tons in 1970/71, an overall increase of 38 percent.
