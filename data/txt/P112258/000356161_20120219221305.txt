                                 Restructuring Memo



1.     As requested by the Borrower in its letter dated February 2, 2012, the closing date
for the Mexico - Private Housing Finance Markets Strengthening Project (P112258),
Loan Number 7614-MX, will be extended from March 30, 2012 until December 31, 2012.

2.     The Project consists of two components: (1) debt restructuring; to provide long
term funding so that SHF can match the maturity and structure of its assets to fund its
planned expansion into lower income segments; and (2) technical assistance to expand
housing finance to underserved population. As of February 6, 2012, the loan has
disbursed 99% of the total amount (US$ 1,004,972,816 of a total of USD$ 1,010,000).
Disbursement ratios by component are 100% and 66% respectively.

3.      The proposed extension will allow SHF to finalize the implementation of the
planned reforms to increase access to low income segments; which remains a key
challenge towards achieving sustainable development in the sector. SHF has put in place
an action plan, acceptable to the Bank, to complete the activities within nine months.


4.    This will be the first extension of the project’s closing date, for a total of nine
months.
