                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         a) strengthening the financial capacity of SHF to stabilize mortgage markets in the short term and to expand mortgage access to lower income groups over the medium
                         term; and b) improving SHF's technical capacity to expand access to mortgages over the medium-term.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The overall rating before closing is considered to be Moderately Satisfactory (MS). The rating takes into consideration the following: (i) the target for the PDO's outcome indicator
                         (Number of housing solutions delivered per year) has been met each since Board approval despite the severe effect of the world financial crisis in the Mexican economy, (ii) the key
                         performance indicators associated to Component 1 were met prior to disbursement (June 2009) and, (iii) the medium term intermediate outcome indicators related to increased
                         lending volume and increased access for low-income households were not met reflecting flaws in project design and delays in the implementation of relevant reforms.
