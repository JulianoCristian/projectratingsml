                         Implementation Status Overview
                         During 2012 SHF has made progress in addressing lower income segments. The percentage of credits (including micro and long-term) to low-income households (1-6 Min wages)
                         from total number of loans has increased to 95%. This figure reflects SHFs efforts to promote products such as micro-credits, progressive housing solutions and credits for housing
                         improvement; however it is also the result of very low levels (US$8 million) of mortgage origination (traditionally for higher income segments) between Dec 2011 and April 2012.
