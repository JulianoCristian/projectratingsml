                         a) strengthening the financial capacity of SHF to stabilize mortgage markets in the short term and to expand mortgage access to lower income groups over the
                         medium term; and b) improving SHF's technical capacity to expand access to mortgages over the medium-term.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project successfully strengthened the financial capacity of SHF, notably during the first half of 2009 when it was most needed by the institution and when the crisis was severely
                         affecting Mexican markets. This increased financial capacity has yet to translate into further development and consolidation of private housing finance markets as envisaged in the
                         project PDO.
