The Gorgas Institute has prepared an\n            environmental impact assessment study to cover the expansion\n            in 2001. This plan covers activities related to the\n            expansion of and optimization of medical services to be\n            provided for local population. The Institute has its own\n            health waste care management plan for service expansion,\n            which includes: sorting, handling, transportation,\n            immunization and disposal of health care waste. Besides the\n            current health waste management plan currently under\n            implementation, the institute has decided to expand and\n            organize its procedures to manage the expected demand of\n            health care waste. The new version includes estimates on the\n            increase on health care waste due to the new services to be\n            provided. The health care waste management plan focuses on a\n            set of procedures to enhance the quality of management of\n            new volumes and sources of waste. As a standard practice,\n            the plan will include training and awareness activities for\n            involved personnel. Indicators to monitor its implementation\n            will also be developed and enforced through Bank supervision\n            activities. As a practice the Gorgas Institute has its own\n            procedures on how to handle construction activities. This\n            plan is very comprehensive and aims at protecting the\n            quality of the surrounding environment."}, "docdt": "2001-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
