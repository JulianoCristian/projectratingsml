                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to provide knowledge and tools to decision makers in all countries in the region to manage and control HIV/AIDS and other
                         opportunistic infections . This objective would be achieved by providing countries with: (a) better access to high quality diagnosis of HIV/AIDS infections; (b) a
                         regional second-generation surveillance system for the epidemic; (c) cross/fertilization of better practices in epidemic prevention and control; and (d)
                         mechanisms to reduce the mobile populations vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         This ISR is based on the findings of the last supervision mission that took place November 1-4, 2010. The project is closing on November 30, 2010
                         As reported in previous ISRs, the project implementation continued as planned and the four components reached and in many cases surpassed most of the intermediate indicators.

                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) was also achieved and the first Regional Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS (PDO) and its Monitoring Plan was presented and approved by
                         COMISCA in the context of the CA Regional CONGRESS for HIV/AIDS (CONCASIDA), March 1-3, 2010.
                         In addition 96% of the funds were disbursed (the Project is requesting the disburse of the remaining USD60,000 next week). All the remaining funds are already committed and the
                         project will execute all the funds in the original time frame defined in the PAD.
                         As was the case in the design stage, the project was implemented in direct coordination with the COMISCA, SG-SICA/SISCA, the Regional Coordination Commission for HIV, PAHO,
                         UNAIDS, CDC, USAID, PASCA, DFID, Global Fund and regional projects (Mesoamerican and REDCA) , and while there are various aspects and activities that will be affected (about
                         sustainability) by project closing many others are rooted in the above-mentioned entities and agencies that guarantee its continuity.
                         The Project supported the implementation of the Regional Laboratory for HIV/AIDS in Panamá. This laboratory implemented several new laboratory tests many of them were and
                         transferred to the national laboratories. It also tested several new laboratory methods and put into operation a quality control mechanism for the national laboratories. The project also
                         supported the establishment of a second-generation epidemiological surveillance system in the 6 countries, the political commitment and support to develop the mentioned Regional
                         Strategy and a Regional Plan to control the HIV and financed 23 sub-project for mobile population implemented by local NGOs.
                         COMISCA and SISCA did several efforts to implement a regional endowment fund to finance the Regional Laboratory but given the limited resources of the MOHs the resources to
                         implement such fund were not possible to obtain. In addition the region applied twice to the Global Fund and request support of other agencies without success. Therefore, the
                         regional Laboratory will not continue as originally envisaged. COMISCA is working on the development of other arrangements to transfer the functions developed by the Regional
                         Laboratory to a couple of national laboratories, that would continue the support to the region.
