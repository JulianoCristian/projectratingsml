The IPP\n            will ensure that these groups benefit from project\n            implementation in an equitable, and culturally adequate\n            manner, and ensure as well their active participation,\n            including that of nongovernmental organizations, and\n            community groups - in particular, health providers - for a\n            successful project implementation. The IPP consists of two\n            stages: the first, is a review of demographic,\n            anthropological, legal and institutional aspects, as well as\n            the HIV/AIDS epidemiological incidence among those groups,\n            supported by the participating countries' ministries of\n            health; the second stage complements the first, through\n            consultations with affected populations. The study concludes\n            there is no official data on the epidemic's incidence\n            among these groups, given statistics do not register ethnic\n            variables. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this project,\n            the incidence of HIV/AIDS was mapped geographically. Given\n            the increasing numbers of the epidemic in Central America,\n            it is suggested to include ethnic and gender variables in\n            the epidemic's prevention systems (financed by the\n            project under the second component). Furthermore, given the\n            current traditional health methods among indigenous\n            populations, and ethnic groups in health prevention, it is\n            recommended to review traditional networks, so as to build\n            capacities, to be able to collaborate in the prevention,\n            care, and assistance to HIV/AIDS affected people. It is\n            important to educate health workers, and community networks\n            on the rights and duties of affected people, because, as\n            certain rights are being questioned (e.g., confidentiality)\n            conducing to a negative reaction, the right precautions are\n            not being considered, but the fact remains that people\n            should be informed and educated on the use of their\n            obligations. Two major obstacles hamper the distribution and\n            marketing of condoms: the Church opposition, maintaining its\n            use engenders sexual promiscuity, and, the\n            (\"Machista\" male) idiosyncrasy that its use\n            promotes infidelity. In addition, two major groups\n            identified, particularly in Honduras, are HIV/AIDS affected\n            orphans - who need epidemiological monitoring, as well as\n            social protection - and house wifes infected by their own\n            husbands. Workshops are recommended (to be included under\n            the third component) where epidemic diagnoses within\n            indigenous populations, and afro-descendant groups, should\n            be discussed as part of current strategies (lessons learned,\n            and success stories), supported by regional partnerships\n            with nongovernmental organizations (to be financed under the\n            fourth component)."}, "docdt": "2004-12-22T00:00:00Z"}
