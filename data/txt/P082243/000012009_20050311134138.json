Component 1 - Regional\n            Laboratory and contingencies, will support the establishment\n            of a regional laboratory to implement highly-specialized\n            functions, as a single regional institution. These functions\n            include: a) acting as a regional reference diagnostic; b)\n            becoming a specialized regional training center on HIV/AIDS\n            related technologies for laboratory workers; c) developing\n            information systems for laboratories specialized in HIV/AIDS\n            tests; d) carrying out specialized research on technologies\n            for testing HIV/AIDS viruses; e) becoming the regional\n            center for quality control of HIV/AIDS national\n            laboratories; and f) assessing and transferring technologies\n            to national laboratories. Component 2 - Epidemiological\n            Surveillance - will support the implementation of a regional\n            second-generation epidemiological surveillance system, to\n            enable improved characterization of the nature of the\n            HIV/AIDS epidemic in Central America. The system will\n            include an integrated information system with country\n            information, and, will disseminate information throughout\n            the region, periodic HIV surveillance in high-risk groups,\n            behavioral risk factor surveillance, and a training program.\n            Data would be disaggregated, at least, by age, gender, and\n            ethnicity, and as possible, by population mobility.\n            Component 3 - Strengthening the Regional Response Capacity\n            will increase the harmonization of legal and institutional\n            frameworks needed to scale-up strategic interventions, in\n            response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It will also strengthen\n            leadership and political commitment leading to a Regional\n            Action Plan with common policies and strategies, addressing\n            the epidemic in a coordinated way. This component will\n            support shared best practices on prevention and\n            comprehensive care, including desk reviews, and workshops at\n            the regional level with health and non-health institutions,\n            and civil society representatives, to examine the HIVIAIDS\n            legal framework for civil rights, integrated treatment\n            access, and drug and lab supplies regulations. Component 4 -\n            Prevention in Mobile Populations - will focus on the\n            particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, i.e., mobile\n            populations, considered to be a key factor in the\n            epidemic's spread. Prevention programs focusing on\n            these populations are still few, and work at a small scale.\n            The main actions are: a) strengthening coordination across\n            sectors, both at the country and regional levels, organizing\n            periodic meetings and workshops of key actors and agencies;\n            (b) providing continuity to successful prevention\n            subprojects, and supporting the development of new\n            preventive interventions, through a competitive process\n            among sponsors, mainly nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)\n            or a group of NGOs working in more than one country; and, c)\n            strengthening human resources capacity involved in the\n            sector, through the provision of training programs. Finally,\n            Component 5 - Project Management will support project\n            administration, structure and practices. Moreover, it will\n            finance computer and office equipment, and furniture, and,\n            technical assistance of long-term technical consultants in\n            the Project Coordination Unit."}, "docdt": "2005-03-03T00:00:00Z"}
