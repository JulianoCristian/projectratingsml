The\n            objective of all three projects is to expand Mexico's\n            livestock and agricultural production by: (a) increasing the\n            flow of medium- and long-term credit into agriculture; (b)\n            encouraging private banks toward medium-term lending for\n            agriculture, which they have traditionally shunned largely\n            because of lack of experience; (c) expanding the processing\n            of agricultural and livestock products; and (d) providing\n            technical services to producers. An additional feature of\n            the new project would be the financing of rural works and\n            infrastructure designed to serve groups of small farmers and\n            cattle owners."}, "docdt": "1971-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
