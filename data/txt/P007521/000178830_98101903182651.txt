INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECO1NMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
NACIONAL FINAMCIERA, S.A., OF MEXICO FOR A
LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $75
million to Nacional Financiera, S.A., to assist in financing a
two-year program of credits for livestock and agricultural develop-
ment in I1exico to be administered by the Fondo de Garantia y Fomento
para la Agricultura, Ganaderia y Avicultura (FONDO), which is managed
by the Bank of Mexico. The loan, which would be guaranteed by the
United Mevican States, would be for a 20-year term, including rather
over four years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent.  The loan
would be used mainly to rediscount medium and long-term credits
extended to farmers and agro-industrial enterprises by private credit
institutions and the state-owned Banco Nacional Agropecuario (BNA).
2.       The status of previous loans to Mexico is summarized in
Annex I. An economic report on Mexico (CA-6a) was distributed to
Executive Directors on December 7, 1970. An appraisal report on the
proposed project (PA-82a) is being distributed separately. Country
and loan and project data sheets are attached hereto as Annexes II
and III.
PART I - COUNTRY CONSIDERATIONS
3.       Mexico has so far received $978.4 million in loans from the
Bank, net of cancellations, and in terms of effective loans held by
the Bank is now the Bank's largest borrower, although it may shortly
be overtaken by Brazil. The undisbursed balance of effective loans
at the end of March 1971 was $167.8 million. Over half of all lending
to date has been for electric power, one quarter for transport and
the remainder for irrigation and agriculture, including two previous
loans similar to the one now proposed. The most recent loan, for
highways, was signed in June 1970. No other loan will be presented
to the Executive Directors during the current fiscal year, but
substantial lending is being considered for FY72, including a further
power loan and loans for tourism, industrial credit, railways and
ports. The railway and port operations would be a sequel to the study
of the transport sector which the Bank carried out at the Government's
request last year. This study will be distributed to the Executive
Directors in the near future.



-2-
4.       Execution of Bank-financed projects in Mexico has been
satisfactory on the whole. Bank lending has played an important
role over a period of more than 20 years in strengthening the power
sector and consolidating its management and finances. The one
disappointing aspect of the Bankss association with the power sector
has been the long delay in implementing the program for unification
of frequencies in and around Mexico City, physical work on which is
now to begin towards the end of 1971. Apart from power, there have
been some delays in construction of highway and irrigation projects.
In addition, the economic returns on one irrigation project in the
north-east, financed under Loan 336-ME, are lower than expected as a
result of the elimination of cotton production because of a price
decline and problems of pest and disease control.
5.       IFt's total commitments to Mexico had reached $30.5 million
by March 31, 1971, consisting of $8.0 rillion of operational invest-
ments and $22.5 million of standby and underwriting commitments in
eight enterprises. From these commitments the Corporation still held
$3.8 million on that date, consisting of $2.1 million in loans and
$1.8 million in equity. IFC is considering several new projects in
Mexico, including an investment in the production of newsprint from
bagasse and a loan to Celanese Hexicana.
6.       Mexico has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for economic
growth, GDP having increased over the past 20 years at an average rate
of 6 or 7 percent a year. Since 1966, however, there has been a serious
worsening of the balance of payments, with a current account deficit
reaching around $850 million in 1970 as a result of rising imports
and a slow-down in export expansion. This deficit has been partly
financed in recent months by a large inflow of short-term private
capital attracted by relatively high interest rates, but there has also
been an upward trend in medium and long-term borrowing abroad by the
public sector. Total public external debt (excluding maturities of
less than one year) had risen by the end of 1970 to around $3.9
billion. The resulting debt service ratio (24 percent in 1970) is one
of the highest amongst developing countries, although as a proportion
of GDP both debt outstanding and debt service have remained more or
less constant over the past six years. The rise in external indebted-
ness has been linked with an insufficiency of public savings, and as
the economic report points out, unless more is done to increase both
domestic savings and exports, the growth of the economy will have to
be slowed down in order to protect the balance of payments. At the
same time, Mexico is confronted with difficult long-term problems
arising from rapid population growth, sharp inequalities in the
distribution of income and extensive poverty, especially in rural



-3-
areas. Little up-to-date information is available on income
distribution and employment, but approximately 40 percent of the
population is engaged in agriculture, which generates only about
12 percent of GDP.
7.       A new Mexican Administration, headed by President Luis
Echeverria Alvarez, took office last December for a six-year period
and has since been actively engaged in attacking the economic problems
inherited from the previous Administration. One of the first acts
of the new Administration was to introduce additional taxes estimated
to yield the equivalent of $180 million in 1971 (0.6 percent of GNP),
of which two-thirds would come from taxes on mineral waters and beer
and the rest from changes in income tax, special import duties and
taxes on manufactured tobacco and alcohol. Tax enforcement has been
strengthened, and special measures have been taken to discourage
contraband trade. Sugar prices have been raised so as to reduce the
subsidy to consumers, and attention is now being concentrated on the
possibilities for increasing prices charged by public enterprises,
particularly petroleum prices, railway tariffs and water rates. An
increase in power rates is also likely to be needed this year.
8.       High priority is being given to phased programs for
reorganizing the management, operations and finances of the railways
and ports, broadly along the lines recommended by the Bank's transport
mission. The Government is particularly concerned to reduce the
operating deficit of the railways which reached over $100 million in
1970, mainly as a result of heavy losses on passenger operations, and
required a further $100 million in government support to service past
debts and meet new investment outlays.
9.       Monetary and credit policies have been directed to restraining
the expansion of credit and channelling more of the credit available
to essential uses. The authorities have been concerned to prevent the
inflow of "hot money" from abroad from leading to an excessive expansion
of consumer demand and particularly demand for imports. The maximum
rate of interest payable on deposits by "financieras" has been reduced
from 11 percent to 10 percent,with a corresponding reduction in the
average interest rates which they are allowed to charge, and the reserve
requirements of commercial banks and "financieras" have been substan-
tially increased. The Bank of Mexico has also been urging the private
banks to provide credit on preferred terms for popular housing, to give
more help to small businesses, to finance the purchase of shares by
small and medium investors, to lend to students for higher education,
and generally to broaden the distribution of credit in favor of groups
and regions which have been largely neglected by the banking system
in the past.



-4-
10.      Exports have been made one of the top national priorities.
Fiscal incentives for export have been extended through increased
rebates of import duties and domestic taxes, an Institute of Foreign
Trade has been established, and the Bank of Mexico is looking to the
World Bank for assistance in creating a special fund to extend medium
and long-term loans on preferred terms to finance the development of
export industries. Particular emphasis has been placed on the need
for increased production and exports of cotton, and a program has
been initiated involving expanded credit, better crop insurance, a
supply of cheap labor, the relaxation of restrictions on imports of
certain chemicals and increased technical assistance for cotton growers.
The promotion of tourism also continues to receive special attention
from the Bank of Mexico which is developing new resort areas at Cancun
on the coast of Yucatan (with assistance from the Inter-American Devel-
opment Bank) and at Zihuatanejo on the Pacific coast, where a project is
at present being appraised by the World Bank.
11.      President Echeverria has been placing considerable emphasis in
his speeches on the need for social reforms, improvements in rural
conditions and the more equitable distribution of income. The Govern-
ment has not yet, however, worked out specific measures for dealing
with these problems. The whole public investment program is under
review, and a new six-year program should be completed this summer, in
detail for the first two years and in outline for the remaining four.
Meanwhile, public investment has been cut back to protect the balance
of payments, and 1971 and 1972 are seen as years of "consolidation"
during which every effort will be made to hold down public expenditures,
particularly those with a high foreign exchange component - if necessary,
with some sacrifice of economic growth. There is a new emphasis on
economy and efficiency in the public sector, and an effort is being
made to coordinate economic policy decisions and to exercise closer
control at the center over the activities of agencies such as the state
petroleum enterprise, the Federal Power Commission, the Federal
District and the M4inistry of Public Works.
12.      One sphere of activity in which greater coordination and
control are already evident is external borrowing. A committee on
public borrowing has been set up consisting of the Director of Public
Credit, a representative of the Bank of Mexico and the financial
directors of the entities which have traditionally looked abroad for
financing, and the Ministry of Finance is taking a much closer
interest than in the past in the financing plans of these entities.
To help meet their external financial requirements the Government has



-5-
recently arranged a $100 million loan from a group of European,
North American and Japanese banks; this will be for a term of eight
years, including five years grace, wfith a variable rate of interest
at 1-1/A percent above the rate for six months inter-bank money in London
(the rate applicable. for the first six months is 7-1/2 percent).
13.      A Bank economic mission now in Mexico is taking a fresh
look at the country's economic prospects, its likely external
financial requirements over the next few years and its capacity to
service additional external debt. The energetic way in which the
new Government has set about the tasks of increasing public savings
and exmorts affords grounds for confidence that Mexico will succeed
in maintaining a satisfactory rate of economic growth, while keeping
its external debt within manageable proportions. Provided that the
Government continues to follow sound policies with respect to internal
resource mobilization and external debt management, I consider that
the Bank would be justified in substantially increasing its lending
to Mexico. The loan now under consideration, together with previous
loans for power, highways and irrigation, should contribute towards
a rising flow of Bank disbursements which have averaged just over
$70 million a year during the past three fiscal years and are
projected to increase well above $100 million a year in FY71 and
FY72.
PART II - THE PROJECT
14.      The proposed livestock and agricultural development project
is a continuation and elaboration of the projects previously financed
under Loans 430-ME (for $25 million in 1965) and 610-ME (for $65
million in 1969). The first of these loans was fully disbursed by
December 1968, ahead of schedule, and the second also has been
disbursed more rapidly than foreseen at the time of the appraisal,
with nearly all the money now committed and disbursements to date
approximately 70 percent higher than projected. The objective of
all three projects is to expand Mexico's livestock and agricultural
production by: (a) increasing the flow of medium and long-term
credit into agriculture; (b) encouraging private banks toward
medium-term lending for agriculture, which they have traditionally
shunned largely because of lack of experience; (c) expanding the
processing of agricultural and livestock products; and (d) providing
technical services to producers. An additional feature of the new
project would be the financing of rural works and infrastructure
designed to serve groups of small farmers and cattle owners.



-6-
15.      Agriculture provides a livelihood for 40 percent of Mlexicols
population and accounts for more than 50 percent of export earnings
and almost 95 percent of domestic food consumption. Through improve-
ments in agricultural methods and expansion of acreage under
cultivation lMexico's agricultural output has almost doubled during
the last 15 years. Continuing rapid increases in agricultural output
are still needed, however, to meet domestic needs and for export.
The nutritional intake of many Mexicans, particularly in rural areas,
is still inadequate, especially in animal proteins. To the extent
that the Government succeeds in alleviating poverty and bringing
about a more equal distribution of income, the demand for food can
be expected to rise quite rapidly. In addition, further increases
in agricultural exports are required to help relieve the foreign
exchange constraint on the growth of the economy.
16.      The capital investment envisaged under the new project
amounts to approximately $190 million, excluding working capital
which would be financed from domestic sources. About 15 percent of
the capital expenditures would be financed by farmers and ranchers
(20 percent in the case of agro-industrialists), 16 percent by
participating banks, 39 percent by the Bank and 30 percent by the
FONDO; the latter's contribution would be provided by the Bank of
Mexico (generally from the proceeds of "cattle bonds" which banks in
the Federal District are required to purchase) and by the Government.
Of the proposed loan of $75 million, it is presently estimated that
$42.5 million would be used for livestock development, $18.5 million
for annual crops, $6.0 million for perennial crops, $4.5 million for
agro-industries, $2.0 million for infrastructure and $1.5 million for
technical services.
17.      The terms of loans to ultimate borrowers, and the terms on
which these loans would be rediscounted by the FONDO, would vary with
the size of the loans. For loans up to 250,000 pesos ($20,000) the
interest rate would be 10 percent and for larger loans 10.5-11
percent, with a 1 percent appraisal fee in addition for loans to agro-
industries exceeding 1,500,000 pesos. Rediscount rates would range
from 7 to 8.5 percent, providing the participating banks with a 3
percent spread, except on loans in excess of 2,500,000 pesos, where
the spread would be 2.5 percent. The proportion of loans eligible to
be rediscounted would range from 90 percent on loans of less than
250,000 pesos by small banks down to 70 percent on loans in excess of
500,000 pesos. The rediscount structure, which has been slightly
modified from the previous loan, is designed to encourage participating



-7-
banks to put more of their own money into the project and to give
priority to smaller loans, while still giving them adequate margins
to cover all risks except the foreign exchange risk which is borne
by the Government.
18.      The average size of loan has in fact decreased from
185,300 pesos ($14,800) under the first project to 133,800 pesos
($10,700) under the second. Bank lending through the FONDO has
nevertheless been intended to benefit mainly farms producing
for the market, where the best prospects exist for increasing
production in the medium term, rather than the subsistence farmers
and ejidos (land reform communities). To some extent the FONDO is
taking care of the needs of smaller farmers through a parallel credit
program for which it has been obtaining external assistance on
concessionary terms, initially from USAID and more recently from the
Fund for Special Operations of the Inter-American Development Bank.
The first IDB loan for this purpose, in an amount of $20 million, was
approved in 1968 and a second, for $32 million, is now being negotia-
ted. The interest rate on both loans is 3 percent, while the rate on
sub-loans is being increased from 7 percent on the first project to
7.6 percent on the new one. The sub-loans under the IDB project are
limited for the most part to borrowers with an annual gross income of
not more than $8,000 equivalent, and there is a maximum of $12,000
equivalent for any one loan. Under the IBRD projects there is no
minimum specified either for sub-loans or for farmers' incomes, and
approximately 80 percent of all sub-loans to date have been for
amounts of $20,000 equivalent or less.
19.      The Mexican authorities have not as yet developed an
effective program for tackling the related problems of rural poverty
and low productivity in subsistence agriculture, and the credit
programs of the FONDO have never been directed to dealing with these
problems to any significant extent. Nor has Mexico requested external
financial assistance for projects specifically designed to attack
these problems. However, the new Government has indicated its
intention of concentrating more resources on stimulating agricultural
production in the central plateau iwhere rural poverty is concentrated,
and the Bank economic mission now in Mexico is exploring the possibili-
ties for future IBRD assistance in this field.



-8-
20.      The organization of the FONDO, which has been strengthened
considerably under the first two projects, is reasonably well equipped
to appraise and supervise projects and extend technical assistance.
Some further organizational changes now proposed, particularly the
establishment of five new regional offices, will help in adjusting
the FONDO's structure and operations to the rapidly increasing lending
volume and in strengthening the technical services available to farmers
under the project. The number of technicians employed by, or approved
by, the FOND0 is now approaching 700, as against 500 when the second
loan was made.
21.      In order to build up the permanent capital of the FOND0, the
Government intends to provide the funds necessary to repay the principal
on the proposed Bank loan, as under the two previous loans. The FONDO
will use the difference between repayments it receives from participa-
ting banlcs and the payments of interest and service charges on the Bank
loan for further medium and long-term loans to farmers.
22.      As under the previous loans for agricultural credit in Mexico,
and as is common to most agricultural credit operations, purchase of
the equipment financed under the proposed loan will be made by the
beneficiaries themselves, who will individually buy quite small
quantities of widely diversified products, both foreign and domesti-
cally made, through local dealers and distributors. In these
circumstances, formal international competitive bidding is not
practicable. The Government has undertaken to issue promptly the
necessary permits for the import of machinery and equipment required
for the project.
23.      The proposed loan would cover estimated foreign exchange costs
of about $50 million and local costs of about $25 million, following
the pattern of the previous agricultural credit operation which also
covered a substantial element of local expenditure. In both loans the
Bank's financing constitutes less than 40 percent of total project
costs, exclusive of working capital. The fact that MIexico has a
diversified industrial structure capable of supplying a large propor-
tion of its requirements for capital goods, coupled with the high
external debt service, results in a need for some local cost financing
by international agencies to complement the Government's fiscal and
balance of payments efforts. Bank loans in the power, highway and
irrigation sectors have traditionally been tied to the foreign
exchange costs of projects; in other sectors, where the import
component of investment is generally low, I consider some local
currency financing to be justified.



-9-
24.      The project would have significant effects on national
agricultural production and on exports, increasing production by an
estimated $200 million a year at full development and exports by
about $15 million a year after five years.  The estimated rate of
return to the economy is about 24 percent and the return on
producers' incremental investments ranges from 21 to 32 percent.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
25.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Nacional
Financiera, S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between the United
Mexican States and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between
the Bank and Banco de Mexico, S.A., the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of
Agreement and a draft Resolution approving the proposed Loan, are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
26.      The Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements generally
conform to the patterns of previous agreements in Mexico, particu-
larly those for the first and second agricultural credit loans.
27.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
28.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
