PREFACE
This report presents the results of an audit of a project
supported by Loan 747-ME, signed in June 1971 for US$75 million and
closed, fully disbursed, in September 1975. The audit was based on
material incorporated in the Project Completion Report, covering the
same loan, prepared by the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office and issued in May 1974; on a review of the project's Appraisal
Reports, Supervision Reports and other material in Bank files, including
the Agricultural Credit Study completed by the Operations Evaluation
Department in which this loan was also evaluated; on consultation with
Bank personnel; on discussions in Mexico with officials of the
Fideicomisos Instituidos en el Banco de Mexico en Relacion con la
Agricultura (FIRA), the Banco Agropecuario, several private banks, and
the Instituto Nacional de Investigacion Agricola; and on visits to a
number of participating farms, ranches, and agroindustrial enterprises.
The excellent and kind assistance provided by Mexican institu-
tions and individuals during the audit mission in preparation of this
report is gratefully acknowledged. The direct support of FIRA's Planning
Office is especially appreciated. Comments on the draft report forwarded
by FIRA have been incorporated in the final copy along with those of the
Bank's Regional Office and the Central Projects Staff. The final copy
has been divided into two parts: a supplementary report in which details
are presented on the project, its historical and sector settings, and its
impact, and a short, main report which simmarizes that information and
discusses its principal implications.

Project Performance Audit Report
MEXICO THIRD LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 747-ME)
HIGHLIGHTS
In 1971 the Bank provided US$75.0 million in the third of a series
of five loans, which began in 1965, to support FIRA's institutional growth
and rediscounting operations for medium and long term lending to Mexico's
agricultural sector. This was the last loan in the series to concentrate
funds on the larger commercial producers: subsequent loans in 1973 and
1976 included increasingly important small farmer components. The farmer
credits (and some agroindustrial credits) under Loan 747 were fully
committed within two years and the loan itself was closed, fully disbursed,
in 1975. Altogether the series has absorbed US$400 million of Bank funds,
making the program one of the largest in the Bank's agricultural portfolio.
The audit focuses on the third tranche, but comments and conclusions apply
more generally to the entire period of FIRA's large farmer lending activity.
FIRA's institutional performance in the 1970s has been impressive:
continuing growth of staff, expansion of staff training facilities, decen-
tralization of regional credit operations, and increased support for the
private and public banks which on-lend to the commercial farmers. Updated
estimates of the overall economic rates of return to the program range
between 12% and 20%, with the livestock loans, which predominate in the
portfolio, lying at the lower end. Financial returns, improved by the
inflation of the early 1970s, have been considerably higher. The image of
success is disturbed by indications in the accumulating field data that
technical and managerial improvements have not complemented the use of
credits to the degree anticipated at appraisal. FIRA and the participating
banks have not been able to support the credits with strong technical back-
stopping. For this reason, for the impact on investor decisions of uncer-
tainties due to agrarian reform, and for other reasons that undoubtedly
reflect rational economic choices, the commercial farmer clientele has
tended to opt for farm and ranch development strategies with less emphasis
on intensification. FIRA and the Bank have been struggling to build a
monitoring system that can better identify the main patterns and causes
of on-farm change.
The Bank has good reason for satisfaction with the effective use
of the loan funds by FIRA, the participating banks and the farmers. The
Bank's supervision and analytical inputs to the implementation period
could have been strengthened, because the loan was large and behavior by
bankers as well as farmers has differed enough from appraisal expectations
to warrant concern. Also, the FIRA expansion must be evaluated in the
context of a general stagnation of total lending to agriculture in the



early 1970s, and evidence that some substitution of funds was occurring.
Nevertheless, with manpower constraints of its own, the Bank may have
correctly limited its input to the Mexican program, under the apparently
justified assumption that FIRA was competent to handle its principal
assignment of creating an effective rediscounting operation for the agri-
cultural sector.
The following issues may be of particular interest:
FIRA's progress with institutional growth and decentralization
(paras. 2, 9.01-9.03)
Shift toward purchase of breeding animals (paras. 3, 4.09-4.10,
4.12-4.16, 7.10 (2))
Impact of agrarian reform (paras. 4, 4.15)
Good rates of return without much technical change (paras. 5,
7.03 (6-19), 7.05, 7.10 (5-6), 7.13 (2, 5-7, 9-13), 7.14)
Development and use of the monitoring system (paras. 6, 8,
7.11-7.12, 9.05-9.08)
Emphasis on disbursements rather than impact (paras. 7, 7.05-
7.06, 9.16-9.18, 10.01)
Technical assistance efforts by FIRA (paras. 9, 10, 3.09, 9.12-9.23)
Use of on-farm investment models (paras. 11, 10.02-10.06)
Inadequate incentives for participating banks (paras. 13, 5.04,
5.12, 6.09)
Analysis of macro context and aggregate credit flows (paras. 15,
5.03, 5.12, 10.01, 10.07-10.10)
Comparison of private and public banking activities (paras. 3.07,
5.03, 5.07-5.09, 6.06, 9.19, 9.32)
Special problems associated with discounting formulas (paras. 5.04,
6.01-6.09)
Substitution of FIRA funds for other sources of finance
(paras. 7.10 (8), 9.26-9.31)
Impact of agroindustrial credits (paras. 8.04-8.07)

now totalling five, supported an ongoing program. executed by FIRA,V/ a
dependency of the Bank of Mexico, for rediscounting livestock, agriculture
and agroindustrial credits made by private and public banks to commercial
producers in diverse enterprises. The loan was fully committed on schedule,
and incorporated approximately 10,000 producers. As an agency, FIRA
expanded and upgraded the quality of its staff, increased the number of its
offices, improved its operating procedures and significantly strengthened
its institutional position during the period of the third loan, 1971-74.
2.        The Bank urged FIRA to decentralize its staff and operational
procedures. Given the tremendous diversity of agriculture in different
regions in Mexico, even within fairly small regions, the decentralization
of FIRA seems essential. Regional, state, and local offices can understand
and respond to local needs much more rapidly, and more effectively, than
could an administrative body which is farther removed. It appears that
decentralization has worked, that Bank encouragement was helpful, and that
the costs of undertaking the decentralization, however measured, have been
much less than the benefits.
3.        Most of the funds disbursed in the third project went for live-
stock enterprises, as expected, but, among loans to all enterprise types,
a higher than expected proportion of funds (40%) went for the purchase of
breeding animals, especially beef and dairy cattle. The total number of
beef and dairy breeding animals purchased with project funds amnunred to
approximately 108,000 animals per year. This number would appear to consti-
tute about 22% of the annual increase in the total beef and dairy herd during
this period. Assuming that 40% of said increase were breeding animals, FIRA
would have financed one-half of the latter.
4.        According to the evaluations of project impact, investments in
livestock enterprises yielded a lower rate of return than did investments
in other enterprises for which funds were also available. The heavy
investments in livestock occurred, however, for two reasons. First, a large
proportion of Mexico's agricultural area is suited only for livestock
farming and this sector, prior to the livestock and agricultural credit
program, had been starved for funds. Thus, FIRA tended to emphasize live-
stock development in its overall program. Second, an added emphasis on
1/ The Bank calls it the FONDO - see the footnote on page 8 of the supple-
mentary report.



- ii -
livestock occurred due to the prevailing uncertainty regarding the agra-
rian reform law which caused many commercial farmers and ranchers to
hesitate before making large investments in fixed land improvements. The
Bank was concerned with this problem, but believed at the time of appraisal
that the then incoming administration would clarify the land tenure
situation and thereby create a more favorable environment for long term
investments. This did not occur.
5.        The information regarding the rates of return obtained for on-
farm project investments is weak and should be improved. The available
evidence, however, suggests that the returns are satisfactory even if
somewhat lower than appraisal predictions. The financial returns appear
to have fallen between 13 and 20%, without adjustment for inflation, and
about 18 to 27% with such an adjustment. The economic rate of return was
slightly lower, about 12 to 20%. It appears that one of the better controls
on profitability is the fact that economic markets in Mexico function
reasonably efficiently in that part of the agricultural sector (commercial
producers) which was being assisted in the third loan. As loans were being
made in a reasonably inflation free environment, at rates of interest which
probably approximated market rates, there were strong contextual incentives
to guide funds toward efficient allocations. Nevertheless, the overall
pattern of investment differed considerably from that anticipated: farmers
and ranchers generally selected less intensive investment strategies than
those discussed at appraisal. The preference for extensive farming opera-
tions was reflected in smaller shifts in productivity indicators related
to technological change; which £n turn helps explain the shortfall from
appraisal rate of return targets.
6.        The Bank required that FIRA establish a monitoring system as a
condition of the third loan. FIRA was originably cool to this idea, but
it has become more enthusiastic during the last two years. FIRA seems to
perceive the monitoring system, however, as an instrument by which it can
demonstrate the impact of its lending to satisfy the Bank's conditions and
to improve its institutional position in Mexico. Such a perception is
understandable, however, given the type of stimuli which FIRA has received
from the Bank and from other institutions in Mexico.
7.        First, the Bank, like FIRA, has placed greater emphasis on sub-
loan disbursements than on the impact of the subloans, ex post. An impact
study was delegated to a consultant and, after-the report was completed,
relatively little discussion of the results or their implications seems to
have resulted within the Bank. The results also were not reflected in the
design of the fourth project, though the study and its conclu.sions are
mentioned in the text of the appraisal report. Thus, FIRA has not felt
strong pressures from this direction.
8.        Second, FIRA wishes to preserve and improve its institutional
position in Mexico. The agricultural sector in Mexico is highly complex
from an institutional and political viewpoint. Many agencies undertake
similar tasks and vie with each other for the abilitv to expand -their own
jurisdictions. FIRA apparently has seen the monitoring system, and the
resulting impact studies, as a means of answering its critics and of
demonstrating its successes. We feel that FIRA is rightfully proud of what



- iii -
it has accomplished. However, if the monitoring system is to be trulv
useful in formulating improved operating procedures, and agr'     ..
policies, greater emphasis must be put on analyzing the ?olic 'y imI:' CZons
of the farm level information collected.
9.        The Bank has continued to expect that FIRA would provide, in
addition to credit, a substantial amount of technical assistanza to ie s
borrowers.   FIRA, however, has focused the energies of its techanical sct`f
on technical assistance to the participating banks, particularly thrcugh
the training of their staff to undertake the evaluation of subloans; and
on whatever technical information may be conveyed to the borrower at the
time the on-farm investments are planned. Time has not been available to
FIRA's staff to provide intensive technical assistance to producers after
the subloans have been made; FIRA could have achieved this only by sub-
stantially increasing its staff - at a cost which its current lending
margins do not allow - or by substantially reducing the amount of loans
made. As mentioned before, FIRA's behavior has been consistent, given
the tradeoffs faced, with the Bank's own emphasis.
10.       A question remains whether technical assistance, if Frcvidad    or.:a
intensively, would actually increase the productivity of ranches sufficiently
to justify its cost, and whether such technical assistance ought to be
provided, by FIRA or other agencies, in connection with credit, or s-imply
made available to producers regardless of their interest in borrowing. This
is an issue on which strong opinions on both sides seem to be held and,
although very important to the structuring of the Bank's projects, relativzly
little definitive information is available.
11.       The Bank appraisal mission for the third project, with FIRA staff
assistance, devoted a tremendous amount of effort to developing a set of
diversified farm development models which it apparently felt would be useful
for achieving a perspective on the expected impact of the project's subloans.
This effort has been both applauded and attacked within the Bank. It appears
clear that the models developed were useful as illustrative models for
project evaluation to FIRA, which was training its technicians in these
techniques. It remains less clear whether the models were genuinely useful
either for estimating the rates of return which different investments were
expected to achieve or for identifying and influencing the types of invest-
ments made. The models do not appear to have had great impact in either
respect, and it is clear that the models, once developed, were not utilized
by the supervision missions to examine the degree to which on-farm objectives
were being achieved. The farm development which actually took place seems
to diverge from the farm development shown in the models. This divergence
may or may not have been desirable from the viewpoint of economic profit-
ability; the evidence is inconclusive. However, to the extent that the
models were expected to establish a strategy, they seem to have failed, and
they have not been used even to determine why that strategy was diverted.

12.       One of the implicit reasons for providing assistance to commercial
farmers in Mexico, as opposed to low income producers, was the assumption
that commercial farmers were more easily able to utilize credit rapidly,
making new investments, adopting new technologies, and adapting management
procedures - thereby raising output faster as well. None of the evalutions
undertaken to date, either by the Bank or by FIRA, has shed light on this
issue.
13.       The Bank has assumed since the beginning of the Mexican livestock
and agriculture credit program that private banks had avoided and were
continuing to avoid lending to the agricultural sector because of a lack of
knowledge of the sector's operations. Thus, it was assumed that if these
banks would be induced to build up a technical staff familiar with agri-
culture, and a set of responsible clients, their agricultural lending would
grow. This has proved to be true, but in a more limited degree than the
Bank originally hoped. The Bank's early reports speak of the need to
diversify the flow of lending to the agricultural sector by including the
private banks in addition to the official banks. We believe this was the
correct judgement. The competition between the private and public banks
appears to have had a healthy impact, stimulating both types of banks to
improve their services and efficiency.   Nonetheless, we believe that the
profitability of lending in the agricultural sector, even to commercial
producers, declined during the late 1960s and early 1970s. There has been
no detailed empirical examination of the profitability of lending by the
private banks to the agricultural sector, how this profitability varies
across different types and sizes of loans, or how the profitability of
lending to agriculture compares relative to that obtained by loans to other
sectors of the economy. Given the relatively slow growth of lending to the
agricultural sector during the early 1970s, it is surprising that this issue
was not raised explicitly in the supervision or subsequent appraisal reports.
14.       The official banks in Mexico have wanted to be able to borrow
directly from the Bank, thus by-passing FIRA. To date the Bank has refused.
The Bank has had confidence in the job FIRA is doing and had judged that
Bank funds could more efficiently be channeled through a single institution,
to both private and official banks. Given FIRA's operational efficiencies,
and the organizational tasks inherent in the merger of the official banks
in 1975, this judgement appears sensible, certainly for the near future.
The Bank, however, should continue to review the linkages between, and the
institutional evolution within, the various organi-zations involved or
important to the livestock and agriculture credit project.
15.       The Bank's supervision missions during the third project were
oriented almost exclusively toward institutional developments within FIRA,
and toward disbursements. The institutional developments occurred reason-
ably smoothly, and disbursements took place at essentially the rate which
had been projected in the appraisal report. However, given that the
Mexican livestock and agricultural credit program was one of the largest in



the Bank's portfolio, supervision could have been more intense. There is,
for example, in the supervision reports of the project no mention of macro-
economic variables and how these were affecting the project, although,
during the third project, the macrocontext was generally unfavorable. Also,
almost no time was given to an evaluation of on-farm impact. Even after
the submission of the consultant's final report on the impact of lending
under the first two projects, in September 1972, there is no discussion in
supervision reports that the questions raised in that report were being
examined, an omission just cited with respect to-the next appraisal report
as well. Thus enormous amounts of Bank funds were being moved through a
national credit system with very little direct evidence that they were having
their intended effect. Such a policy necessarily depends upon a strong faith
that the use of Bank funds for farmer lending in a relatively free market is
in fact as well as in principal fully justified.    Because of other commit-
ments, divisional and departmental management within the Bank felt unable to
allocate more staff to the project.
16.       The last paragraph leads to another level of analysis and a final,
important point. The foreign exchange component of Bank projects in Mexico
is an important factor in Bank country planning because the absolute size of
the large share of its funds directed toward that country is partly deter-
mined on the basis of resource gaps at the macro level. An informal-guide-
line on the Bank's annual overall obligation rates in Mexico enables country
programs and projects departments to try to identify lines of credit where
the required amounts of Bank funds can be moved relatively smoothly to
investments that are safe, and, apparently, of high return and development
content. The Mexican Livestock and Agriculture Development Program,
particularly as it developed in the third and fourth projects, was as good
an example of this sort of high capacity credit line that the Bank found
anywhere in the world. The question arises whether the flows to Mexico stimu-
lated by this process were as carefully appraised and supervised as they
should have.been. The audit conclusions are, as usual, mixed. The systematic
deviation of farm investments away from the intensive type of technical
activities described in the third appraisal report, and away from the high
rates of return forecast for them, is worrisome. But rates of return to
the actual pattern of investments seem nevertheless to have been good, and
the mix of Bank and Mexican funds obviously financed important economic
developments. Also, the Bank began to insist in Mexico as early as 1970,
earlier than in most other countries, that impact data be gathered to test
the appraisal assumptions. Insistence resulted-in the consultant's study,
and the monitoring system that followed it. Neither exercise was taken as
seriously as it should have been; supervision's attention was still mainly
attracted by rates of disbursement and immediate institutional- problems;
and the deeper analysis was postponed. Nevertheless, the trend was in the
desired direction. The question that remains is whether the Bank and the
Government could have moved more quickly, given the institutional and other
constraints on any rapid reform.






Project Performance Audit Supplementary Report
MEXICO THIRD LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 747-ME)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1965 the Bank approved its first loan to Mexico for livestock
and agricultural credit. The Bank has since approved four additional loans,
the last of these being signed in March 1976. The-five loans have totalled
US$400 million equivalent. Other Bank loans for irrigation, transportation,
electrification, and rural development, and loans from other institutions
such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) have assisted the livestock and agricultural
sector during the same period.
1.02      This report is an audit of performance under the Bank's third live-
stock and agriculture credit loan (Loan 747-ME, US$75 million equivalent,
signed in June 1971). The loan continued efforts begun in the first two
livestock and agriculture credit projects to establish an improved system
for medium and long term lending to commercial farmers and to agroindustries,
including the provision of technical assistance to borrowers. The third
loan also sought to: (1) improve Mexico's capacity to lend to the agri-
cultural sector, by increasing the geographical and organizational decentral-
ization of FIRA (Fideicomisos Instituidos en el Banco de Mexico en Relacion
con la Agricultura), the administrative body providing common management for
a group of trust funds within the Bank of Mexico which jointly promote the
flow of credit to the agricultural sector, and by upgrading its staff;
(2) provide for the economic evaluation of subloans made during the first
and second projects and establish a monitoring system to collect data from
borrowers, thus permitting the evaluation of future subloans; and
(3) initiate a tentative program for infrastructure assistance to low income
producers in isolated areas. In evaluating performance under the third
loan, we will discuss progress under the Bank's other loans in the series
insofar as is necessary to place the third loan in a historical and
institutional perspective.

II.  TEE RURAL SECTOR
2.01      Mexico is the third largest country in Latin America.    Latitude
ranges from about 15°N to 320N, and there are great variations in altitude,
with numerous ecological zones providing for diversity in agricultural
production. Of Mexico's total land area of nearly 200 million ha, about
45% is classified as range or pasture land; the latter supports only a
small proportion of the rural population. Excluding also forest land and
the area limited by inadequate rainfall, poor drainage and topography, only
about 30 million ha are considered potential crop land, and this may be
optimistic. On the average only 15.4 million ha are currently planted and
the remaining potentially cultivable land is mainly in the tropical zones
in Mexico, subject to factors which make its development difficult. Part
of the land already cultivated is marginal and should be returned to
pasture or forests. A wide variety of crops, tree crops and livestock are
produced, using sharply varying production practices. As a result, there
is no country-wide uniform pattern of on-farm investments which would
maximize agricultural production.
2.02      The population of Mexico, at just over 58 million, is increasing
at about 3.4%. Of the current population, 21 million, or 41%, are rural.
The agricultural population is divided among several distinct groups:
(a) landless agricultural workers (about 1 million) employed principally by
the larger private estates, but also by ejidos, (b) ejidatarios (approxi-
mately 2 million), who enjoy usufruct rights to what are usually small
parcels of land - in 1960 only 15% had more than 10 ha, (c) small private
landowners (approximately 1 million), where parcels are frequently extremely
small and below the level required for family subsistence, and (d) commercial
farmers and ranchers numbering somewhat less than 100,000, who possess a
high proportion of the land still in private hands and produce the bulk of
marketed output. Only a minor part of the private holdings are under lease-
hold or sharecropping; the large majority is owner operated. Ejidos control
approximately 50% of land suitable for cultivation and a somewhat smaller
proportion of other land.
2.03      One-half of Mexico's approximately three million landholdings are
classified as subsistence-type,producing only a negligible marketable
surplus or none: 40% are traditional peasant farms producing a small amount
of cash crops using primitive methods; only 10% use modern techniques. In
1967-69, the top 10% of producers accounted for 40% of total income while
the lower 50% had only 20% of the total income. A distinction is frequently
made between private farmers, as a group, and ejidatarios, but there is great
similarity between the resources held, the technology used, and the problems
faced by the majority of private farmers, who are very small, and most
ejidatarios. A few ejidatarios having greater resources may be, in contrast,
compared with the larger private farmers. Finally, within the ejidos
individual leaders frequently control, through quasi-legal methods, a dis-
proportionate share of the ejido's resources. There are many individuals
classified as agricultural producers, but, realistically speaking, production
is concentrated on less than 400,000 units.



-3-
2.04      Mexico's efforts to develop its rural areas following the 1940s
has featured two major themes: (1) efforts have been made to increase
agricultural production by expanding the area under irrigation and by
improving technology and management, chiefly within the irrigated areas,
and (2) the land reform efforts begun during the 1910 revolution have con-
tinued, although the rate of redistribution has varied at different moments
during the period. These two policies achieved relative success until
1965. During the three decades from 1935 to 1965, Mexican agricultural
production more than tripled, achieving an exceptionally high rate of long
term growth (approximately 4% annually), which placed it at the top of all
Latin American countries in this respect. During the same period, Mexico
managed to increase agricultural land in use by nearly 30%, almost all of
which (on a net basis) was distributed to ejidos. There was, however, no
net redistribution in absolute terms away from the private sector, not
even from private farms of more than 5 ha.
2.05      Mexico encountered major problems in the agricultural sector
after 1965. Rapid population growth resulted in a growing rural population,
with consequent pressure for further land redistribution. Increased rural
to urban migration clogged cities and increased the costs of urban infra-
structure. Rural land suitable for expropriation and distribution, without
a reduction in production, was thought to be more scarce. Efforts at collec-
tive production were only partially successful and were politically difficult.
Further, the growth rate in agricultural production slowed markedly, to about
0.7% per year, while internal demand continued to increase as a result of
growing population and higher incomes. The demand for agricultural products
rose about 4.5% and for livestock products at about 7%.

2.06      The decline in the growth of value of agricultural production forced
Mexico to increase its food imports. By 1974 wheat, corn and rice imports
amounted to 29%, 15% and 13% respectively of the domestic consumption of these
crops. The persistent deficit in corn production was especially serious as it
constituted an important part of the Mexican diet.

Further, because of increases in the international prices of these products,
the total value of agricultural imports climbed at an even faster rate than
did the physical quantum, exerting heavy pressure on Mexico's balance of
payments.
2.07      Adverse weather conditions affected crops in 1973 and 1974, but
the main reason for the continuing slowdown in the rate of growth of agri-
culture has been a decline of both private and public investment in the
agricultural sector. From 1,684 million pesos in 1950, private agricultural
investment rose to 3,722 million pesos in 1960, but by 1965 it had tumbled to
only 2,914 million (in nominal terms).   Public spending also declined.   Fully
20% of all public investment was destined for agriculture in 1947-1952, but
this proportion had fallen to only 10.5% by 1971.
2.08      The Government was caught with conflicting objectives, and chose
to give priority to those which favored the urban sector. It wanted to
stimulate agricultural production, but it felt a need as well to restrain
the prices of foodstuffs to benefit the urban population. During the late
1960s and the early 1970s, the support prices for a number of major crops
remained more or less constant in nominal terms, and they declined in real
terms. Domestic prices also lay significantly below foreign prices for many
of the same crops. In some cases, such as that of wheat where the ratio of
domestic to foreign prices was only about 0.55 between 1961 and 1972, the
difference was great. These policies were important contributors, we believe,
in the declining profitability of the agricultural sector.
2.09      Following the large imports required in 1972, the Mexican Government
moved to provide a greater stimulus to the agricultural sector.    Public
spending in agriculture increased steadily; by 1976, 26% of total public
investment was allocated to agriculture. Similarly, support prices were
increased sharply. Between 1972 and 1976, corn prices rose 102%, wheat prices
118%, and bean prices 242%. Since the consumer price index and the prices of
agricultural inputs in this period increased 79% and 50%, respectively, the
increased price supports represented a significant improvement in the terms
of trade for agriculture.

2.10      The Government also moved to sharply increase the budget alloca-
tions for the national agricultural and livestock research systems, and for
the national extension service. Additional funds were provided for agri-
cultural credit, a new national credit law was passed, and the existing
official banks for lending to the agricultural sector were merged into one
unit to increase the efficiency of operations.
2.11      Growing unemployment and underemployment remains a major problem.
In 1970, the labor force in Mexico was estimated at 13.0 million workers,
of whom 5.3 million (41%) were in agriculture, 3.0 million (23%) in industry
and mining, and 4.7 million (36%) in services. The annual addition to the
labor force is estimated at about 400,000. Reliable direct data on overall
unemployment and underemployment are lacking, but partial data as well as
indirect estimates indicate that finding employment, even at subsistence
levels, for the potential labor force is perhaps the toughest problem facing
Mexico for the next 15 years.
2.12      The situation is particularly difficult within agriculture where
a large part of the population growth is occurring. Between 1950 and 1970,
the availablf1agricultural labor force grew in absolute number from 4.9 to
5.3 million.-   During the same period, agricultural employment rose from
4.0 to 4.7 million. Thus, unemployment actually declined from .9 million to
.6 million. Underemployment in the agricultural sector also was reduced, as
is shown by a growth in the number of total productive days worked per year
of 2.8% over this period. However, much of the growth recorded during this
period took place before 1965.   From 1965 to 1970, agricultural employment
declined at about .5% per year. Although complete data are not yet avail-
able, it appears that employment in agriculture continued to decline through
1974. The decline occurred largely as a result of a decrease in the area
farmed by certain relatively more labor intensive crops such as cotton, corn,
and beans. The increase in agricultural output in 1975 and 1976 may have
reversed this trend.
1/ The available labor force in crop production actually declined; the
apparent growth in the agricultural labor force of 0.4% per year, or a
total of .4 million, took place entirely in livestock husbandry and-forestry.



2.13      Irrigation is considered the most effective employment-generating
instrument in agriculture, as 1 ha of irrigated agricuiture provides about
8 man-months of employment compared to less than 1 man-month per ha on a
non-irrigated farm taken on an annual basis. As of 1974, 13% of the agri-
cultural labor force was employed on irrigated lands; these individuals
supplied 19% of the effective days worked in the agricultural sector. In
the non-irrigated rural areas, 18% of the labor force cannot find employment
at prevailing wages and 44% cannot find more than three months employment.
2.14      Agricultural production contributed about 11% of GDP in 1969, crops
accounting for roughly 60% of the total. This contribution was dominated
by cereal grains, followed by fruits, cotton, sugar, oil seeds, and beans.
Cattle (beef and dairy) account for 80% of livestock production, although
poultry, pigs, and goats are increasing slightly in importance.
2.15      Agricultural production contributed about 65% of Mexico's merchandise
exports in 1960. By 1970, this percentage had fallen to 50. Thus, although
agricultural exports had been one of the most dynamic elements in Mexico's
trade performance from 1940 to 1965, poor agricultural performance reversed
this situation during the next ten years. In constant 1960 US dollars,
Mexico's net agricultural trade balance fell from US$523 million in 1965 to
US$222 million in 1973, and actually turned negative in 1974 at US$35 million.
2.16      Crops made up 79% of agricultural exports (total US$800 million)
in 1969, the major ones being cotton (US$203 million); tomatoes, strawberries
and melons (US$104 million); and wheat (US$12 million). Livestock expcrts
consist almost entirely of live beef cattle and boned and dressed meat. In
1969, the export of live cattle (mostly male weaners) earned US$66 million
and boned and dressed meat contributed another US$39 million, representing,
respectively, 4.6% and 2.7% of Mexico's total merchandise export earnings.
2.17      The structure of foreign trade in agricultural commodities has
changed considerably over the last few years. Grains and oilseeds accounted
for over two-thirds of total agricultural imports in 1974, a more than five-
fold increase over 1972, while more traditional imports such as milk powder
and skins increased only moderately. Cotton has lost its dominant position
but still accounts, together with sugar and coffee, for nearly half of
Mexico's agricultural exports. Feeder cattle and boneless meat exports have
declined drastically as a consequence of a temporary decline in prices in the
US market and, previously, Government restrictions-on exports. Tomatoes are
still the most important horticultural export crop but others such as melons,
strawberries and chillies have also shown good performance.
2.18      Mexican crop farming is done in two sharply distinct sectors;
irrigated and rainfed farming. Irrigated farming is concentrated in the
north and northwest and has experienced tremendous growth in output for
domestic and export markets, while farming in rainfed areas has lagged behind.



Upwards of 90% of public investment in agriculture has been in irrigation
works; irrigation districts now cover 2.8 million ha of the 15.4 million
ha of Mexico's crop area. Most rainfed crops are grown by the small farmer
who traditionally cultivates maize and beans. Intensive extension and
demonstration are needed to increase their output.
2.19      Livestock production occurs under a wide range of geographic con-
ditions. Production, particularly beef, is undertaken predominantly on
native grasslands, but improved pastures and intensive fodder production are
assuming greater importance in view of overstocking in semi-arid and arid
areas, the uneven geographic distribution pattern of livestock, and changing
market patterns in both domestic consumption and export markets. New live-
stock developments in the tropical zones have occurred in recent years. This
production has gone almost exclusively to the domestic market.

III. BACKGROUND OF THE PROGRAM
3.01      The main objectives pursued by the Government of Mexico and the
Bank in the livestock and agricultural credit program has been to increase
both livestock and agriculture production and also the further processing
of this production for market. The first three loans were almost exclusively
concerned with larger commercial producers who, within the size distribution
of Mexican farmers and ranchers, were thought to offer the most substantial
production opportunities. A special sub-program, however, for lending to
low-income producers was introduced into the fourth loan in 1973, and
expanded in the fifth loan in 1975. In addition, a separate loan for rural
development was made in 1975, which included a significant credit component
to finance on-farm development by low income producers in specific micro-
regions.
3.02      The first livestock and agricultural credit loan (Loan 430-ME,
US$25 million, October 1965) provided funds for medium and long term on-farm
investments to medium sized and commercial farmers operating in three prin-
cipal regions: the tropical zone, the central plateau, and northern Mexico.
Investments were made in a variety of different activities, with livestock,
annual crops, and perennial crops being the most important. Credit was also
provided for investments in the agrobusiness sector, i.e., for the processing
of the food and fiber outputs of the agricultural sector.
3.03      The first project operated through FIRA, as have subsequent
projects. The first of the Bank of Mexico trust funds for agriculture, which
now compose FIRA, was the Fondo de Guarantia y Fomento para la Agricultura,
Ganaderia, y Avicultura (FONDO)../
3.04      The FONDO was created in December 1954 to encourage the private
banking system to participate more actively in financing the credit needs
of the agricultural sector. The FONDO discounted subloans made by private
banks, allowing the latter to expand their portfolio of agricultural loans
and also, given the differential margin between the banks lending rate to
farmers and the FONDO's discount rate to the participating banks, permitting
higher rates of return on the private banks' invested capital. The private
banks bore the risk of lending and the responsibility for collection, but
their risks were greatly reduced by the development of the FONDO's offices
and staff, which carried out much of the technical analysis of prospective
borrowers and projects and thereby screened out prablem cases. Finally, the
FONDO also promoted the use of agricultural credit, informing prospective
borrowers that credit was available, indicating its potential uses and
benefits, and subsequently linking interested borrowers with local banks.
1/ The Bank's reports usually refer to the administrative organization
operating the livestock and agriculture credit program as the FONDO.
This is erroneous; FONDO is one of three funds which are under FIRA's
common management. FONDO was the first trust fund established, but Bank
funds were actually channeled through FEFA, as will be explained.



- 9 -
3.05      Initiated with Government funds, the FONDO originally restricted
its activities principally to short term agricultural credit, such as was
needed to finance the annual crop cycle in agriculture. The FONDO's
resources were later augmented by loans from AID and the IDB, and it also
began to discount longer term subloans. The real movement into on-farm
development lending, however, occurred only after 1965, when a second trust
fund was established within FIRA. This fund, the Fondo Especial para Finan-
ciamientos Agropecuarios (FEFA), was specifically designed to channel
foreign loans, such as those from the IBRD, to medium and long term lending
for agriculture, livestock and agrobusiness.
3.06      Apart from loans from external sources, both FONDO and FEFA receive
financing from the Government and the Bank of Mexico. Government equity in
both trust funds has increased through time because, as external loans are
repaid by the Government, the local currency equivalent has been allowed to
accumulate in the trusts as additional equity to permit increased agricultural
lending. Thus, under its current structure, FIRA has available funds from
both domestic and international sources for rediscounting development sub-
loans made by private and public banks to both commercial and low income
producers in the agricultural sector. As mentioned, FIRA also rediscounts
short term loans, which provide working capital to complement-its longer term
development loans. FIRA also gives subsidies for technical assistance and
partial guarantees for loans (made by private banks only) to low income
producers. The subsidies and guarantees are channeled through a third FIRA
trust fund, the Fondo Especial de Asistencia Technica y Garantia para
Creditos Agropecuarios (FEGA), which was established in 1973 to encourage
lending to low income producers.
3.07      The Mexican Government requested approximately US$40 million for
the first loan. This was scaled down to US$25 million by the Bank, which
feared that: (1) a shortage of technical personnel and, (2) the previously
conservative stance of private banks toward on-farm development credit would
make it difficult to undertake a larger loan. Shortly after the first loan
was made, however, the Government established a new official bank, the Banco
Agropecuario, for lending to agriculture. The principal official banks for
lending to agriculture previously had been the Banco Ejidal and the Banco
Agricola, both of which concentrated on ejidatarios or other small scale
producers, and whose lending operations were deficient in a number of
important respects. The two banks had a reputation for being inefficiently
operated, subject to corruption, and had substantial loans in arrears.
Because of these deficiencies, the Bank had judged them inappropriate for
the technically-based development lending which it and the Government sought
to stimulate. The new Banco Agropecuario, however, was designed to avoid
most of these problems and the Bank approved it as a channel for Bank
provided resources. Thus, by late 1965 the Bank, through FIRA, was supporting
on-farm development loans made by both private and official banks.
3.08      As it turned out, demand for project subloans was greater than
expected, partly because of the validation of the Banco Agropecuario for
lending.  The efficiency of FIRA in promoting and processing loan requests



- 10 -
also exceeded appraisal forecasts. By March 31, 1969, the closing date of
the first loan, the participating banks had disbursed M$1,016.2 million
(US$81.3 million). This amount exceeded the expected disbursement of the
project (US$50 million) by 63%. The lending period had been extended to
four years from the three years originally planned and FIRA utilized loan
repayments to continue lending after Bank funds were exhausted. The average
size of the loans granted was significantly smaller than had been expected,
but loans were made at a more rapid rate. The total number of on-farm loans
made in the first project was approximately 5,500, 80% of which were less than
US$6,700 equivalent. Loans above US$80,000 equivalent amounted to 2% of the
total loans granted and approximately 23% of the total amount loaned. There
were 319 loans to agroindustries. Livestock absorbed 60% of the funds dis-
bursed, annual crops 19%, perennial crops 5%, and agroindustries 16%.
3.09      With the creation of FEFA and the first Bank loan, FIRA became
increasingly a technical services agency. Its technical field staff, at
that time numbering 135, was responsible for appraising and approving each
loan eligible for rediscounting under the project and for giving technical
supervision to producers before and after each loan was made.l./ The Bank
hoped that FIRA, through the familiarity of its own technicians with modern
technology, would be able to introduce modern inputs and techniques to
borrowing ranchers and placed emphasis on this aspect of FIRA's development.
3.10      The second project (Loan 610-ME, US$65 million equivalent, signed
in June 1969) continued the lending activities begun under the first project,
supplementing these with a special sub-project for cattle development in
southeastern Mexico. The second project also marked the beginning of an
administrative reorganization of the FIRA, which the Bank encouraged. FIRA
established the first of its regional branches and also began to decentralize
its loan approval procedures.
3.11      The total number of loans in the second project rose to 11,651,
nearly double those made in the first project, and was implemented over
a shorter period, a span of two years. The distribution of subloans by
economic activity was similar to that in the first project: livestock
absorbed 61% of the funds disbursed; annual crops, 28%; perennial crops, 8%;
and agroindustries, 3%. The second loan was disbursed more rapidly than was
projected in appraisal documents. Lending to agroindustries fell short of
predictions. The Bank believed that technical and administrative staff
weaknesses were the principal reasons for this shortfall and urged FIRA to
upgrade its staff's capacity to promote and evaluate agroindustrial loans.
1/ Technical supervision after the loan has been limited, until relatively
recently, to only a few contacts in most cases, given the large number
of farmers which each FIRA technician has had to attend. This problem
is discussed in more detail in chapter IX, B, pp. 48-53.



- 11 -
3.12      Subloans granted in the second project were again smaller than
appraisal estimates; the average loan was approximately US$17,000, but the
lowest 85% of loans averaged US$6,400 equivalent. Loans in excess of 1
million pesos (US$80,000 equivalent), representing 1% of the total loans
granted, received about 10% of the funds disbursed.

IV.  IMLEMNTATION OF THE THIRD LOAN
4.01      The third loan (Loan 747-ME) was declared effective in September
1971.  It was expected to permit the continuation of the program begun with
the first two loans.   Investments were to be made to commercial farms (farms
and ranches, regardless of physical size, operating for sale to the market)
and to agroindustries. In addition, a small component was provided for the
construction of rural access roads and minor irrigation works, and for the
installation of intermediate electrical lines. As under the first two
projects, participating banks, both private and official, were expected to
grant subloans to farmers at interest rates established in the program,
which were thought to be close to market rates of interest. In addition,
FIRA was expected to continue to establish new administrative procedures; to
further decentralize its operations, bringing its system to 7 regional
offices and 28 state offices; to undertake a number of applied research
projects designed to provide borrowers with improved knowledge regarding new
techniques, especially in livestock production and management; and to estab-
lish a number of demonstration centers at which information on new techniques
could be more easily disseminated to producers.
4.02      The total cost of the third project, which had an expected commit-
ment period of two years, was estimated at US$192.5 million; US$50 million
(26%) represented foreign exchange requirements. The breakdown of these
costs is sumarized as follows:

4.03      These cost estimates were supported by a large number of detailed
models, contained in an appendix to the appraisal report. Different models
were provided for cattle, dairy, pig and poultry operations, and for annual
and perennial crop investments, each having a specific variation for six
distinct regions within Mexico. We shall comment more about these models
and their potential value in chapter X, pp. 56-57.
4.04      The financing of these on-farm investments was to be shared in
the following amounts and proportions:

4.05      On the average, farmers and livestock owners were expected to
contribute 15% of the cost of their investment projects. Agroindustry
owners were expected to contribute 20%. In 'each case, the rest of the
project would be financed by a loan from a participating bank. In turn,
the participating bank was expected to retain about 19% of the loan,
refinancing the balance with FIRA. Finally, the Bank would rediscount
56% of the amount loaned by FIRA. The Bank's total assistance would amount
to US$75 million equivalent, US$73.5 million for rediscounting subloans,
plus US$1.5 million for training and technical services needed by FIRA.
The total Bank assistance proposed was expected to cover the foreign
exchange costs of the project (US$50 million), plus about 18% of the local
requirements.



- 14 -
4.06      The third loan was closed on September 30, 1975, having been fully
disbursed in April 1974.1/ The loan was projected to have a commitment
period of two years and the actual commitment period was nearly that
projected. The fourth loan (Loan 910-ME, US$110 million, signed in June
1973) was approved in time to permit lending to continue without a break
after the third loan was fully disbursed.
4.07      The amount of investments by major enterprise categories, as
reported by FIRA, matched appraisal estimates quite closely, as did the
number of subloans. Both are shown in table al (appendix). The only
significant deviation from appraisal estimates occurs in the category for
rural works, e.g., access roads, minor irrigation and electrification, where
no investments were made. FIRA had previously made loans to low income
producers, principally under the ALPRO Program (partly financed by AID), but
the rural works investment program would have initiated FIRA's efforts to
overcome the shortages in communal infrastructure, which make productive
on-farm investments difficult in some areas. The problems encountered,
however, in organizing community action groups to undertake the proposed
work were very great. Because other Government agencies had specific public
funds and staff for this purpose, FIRA ceded this field during the third
project. Nonetheless, in 1973, FEGA was established within FIRA to stimulate
lending to low income producers. In the same year the government initiated
the PIDER rural development program, which contains funds for infrastrudture
investments in selected poor microregions. FIRA has participated in the
planning and administration of this project, which is also assisted by the
Bank.
4.08      Within the overall distribution, several smaller divergences from
appraisal projections appear. Cattle loans were fewer and slightly larger
than had been predicted, while dairy loans were double the number and
averaged one half the amount expected. Loans for pig and poultry production
were also larger in number, but smaller in average size than was predicted.
There were 93 loans to agroindustries, a greater number than the appraisal
predicted, but the funds absorbed were equal to those which had been projected.
4.09      As is shown in table a2, the utilization of loan funds can be
disaggregated in two additional ways, by type of enterprise, as defined by
FIRA, and by type of specific investment. Tables a3 through a6 provide the
percentage figures. For example, while table a3 indicates that the loan
funds utilized for livestock enterprises totaled 58% of the total loan
funds disbursed, table a4 indicates that the funds spent on breeding stock,
by all enterprises, totaled 55%. A further percentage breakdown is given
in tables a5 and a6. Table a5 shows that of breeding stock purchases, 70%
was spent within livestock enterprises, 17% within annual crops,-8% within
1/ The delay in closing was necessary to allow time for compliance with
prior agreements on the agroindustry component.



- 15 -
perennial crops and the like.   In table a6, it is shown that of all funds
spent on livestock enterprises, 68% was devoted to breeding stock purchases,
15% on buildings, 8% on machinery, 6% on irrigation, and 3% on land develop-
ment.
4.10      Some of the data have important implications.    For example, few
funds were invested in land development or in irrigation, although these
are the investments which would have been expected to have the strongest
impact on technical productivity. The bulk of investments went into breeding
animal, pasture seed, and seedling purchases, 55%; and agricultural machinery,
16%. The large investments in breeding stock, principally beef and dairy
breeding animals, coincide closely with the evidence on the land productivity
changes which occurred as a result of these loans, which have been low by
most measures. This evidence is discussed further in chapter VII.
4.11      The investment composition was not wholly within FIRA's discretion.
Most irrigation projects, for example, are legally placed in the hands of the
Secretary of Hydraulic Resources (SRH). FIRA was empowered to make small
irrigation loans, but only after clearance with the SRH. Although easier to
see with hindsight, the effort to achieve coordination of irrigation works
by requiring clearance with the SRH probably led to difficulties in planning,
and to delays in implementation.
4.12      Similarly, a large proportion of Mexico's agricultural area is, at
least currently, suited only for livestock farming and this sector had been
starved for development funds until the FIRA's establishment. Funds had
been more readily available for other agricultural activities, particularly
irrigation. Thus, FIRA tended to emphasize livestock development in its
overall program.
4.13      However, although FIRA was expected to place a large amount of
funds in livestock projects, the amount going to breeding animal purchases
was larger than projected. As shown in tables a2-a6, those loans classified
by FIRA as "permanent crop" enterprises devoted 58% of their funds to breeding
stock, the "diversified" enterprises spent 68% on breeding stock, and "agri-
cultural" enterprises spent 38% on breeding stock. These data suggest that
investments in livestock were the most attractive to prospective borrowers
throughout the country (and to the participating banks). As FIRA begun to
report information on the subloans made, the Bank became aware that a large
proportion of the credits were being utilized by livestock enterprises - and
for breeding stock. At one point in time, the .proportion going to livestock
enterprises reached 62% and the Bank cautioned FIRA that it should not over-
lend to this category. The final allocation in the third project shows a
decrease to 58%.



- 16 -
4.14      As shown in tables a2-a6, although large amounts were spent by
livestock enterprises - and on beef and dairy breeding animals - caution
must be used in interpreting the data reported by FIRA on breeding stock
purchases. The category reported for breeding stock includes not only
the purchase of beef and dairy breeding animals, and hog and poultry
breeding stock, but apparently also certain pasture seed and plant stock.
We do not have precise breakdowns for expenditures within this category.
It is impossible to determine exactly what investment different types of
enterprises were purchasing without knowing the latter breakdown. How-
ever, FIRA has provided specific data on the most important of these
items, indicating that approximately US$70 million equivalent was spent
on beef and dairy breeding animals which is 397, of the total on-farm
investments resulting from the project (from data in table al). Also,
from data in table a2, the US$70 million spent on beef and dairy animals
is approximately 75% of the total amount recorded in the generic category
of breeding stock. Some proportion of the remaining 25% went for hogs
and poultry, with the rest being used for selected plant stock.
4.15      Although a number of new regions have been opened to cattle
production during the last decade, the high rate of lending to livestock
requires further corment. Of the different econom.ic activities which the
Bank projects in Mexico were assisting, livestock production appears to have
been the least profitable, at least if the three evaluations which have been
carried out of the impact of project lending are correct. It appears that
a considerable part of the emphasis on livestock was due to the uncertainty
regarding the agrarian reform law which caused many farmers and ranchers
to hesitate before making large investments in land improvements as these
would have been highly illiquid and immobile. The Bank was concerned with
this problem, but at appraisal it anticipated that the then incoming
government would clarify the land tenure situation and thereby create a more
favorable climate for long term investments of the types shown in a number
of the appraisal investment models. However, the importance of this under-
lying assumption was not fully pointed out in the appraisal report, nor
were indications given of the impact to be expected if, as occurred, the
land tenure situation was not clarified. The land tenure problem in
Mexico has been and remains a critical variable for the livestock and agri-
culture credit program.
4.16      As mentioned, project loans were utilized to purchase beef and
dairy breeding animals worth approximately US$70 million equivalent, or
US$28 million equivalent per year. They were purchased at an average price
of US$257 per animal (beef cattle, US$219; dairy cattle, US$407), permitting
gross herd additions of 270,000 animals, or 108,000 per year during the 30-
month disbursement period. The national beef and dairy cattle herd is
estimated to have totaled about 22 million animals in 1972 and the annual
increment to the herd between 1965-69 and 1970-74 is estimated to have
averaged about 600,000 animals. Thus, the data suggest that FIRA was
financing nearly one-fifth the annual increment to the herd. This could be



- 17 -
reasonable insofar as the annual increment to the herd between 1960-64 and
1965-69 had averaged about 500,000 animals. Assuming that 40% of the annual
herd increment was composed of breeding animals, on average, FIRA would have
been financing nearly half of these, but this is about 11% of total breeding
animal purchases for both replacement and growth additions.
4.17      A significant proportion of the breeding animals purchased were
imported, particularly in the case of dairy animals. Nonetheless, the
impact of FIRA's financing must have had a strong. impact on breeding animal
prices. The third appraisal mission estimated, for example, that the unit
cost of beef cattle breeding stock would be US$150 equivalent; the average
price of the beef cattle actually purchased was instead US$219 equivalent,
some 46% more. This increase substantially exceeded the increase in the
general consumer price index during this period (13%) and, by an even
greater degree, the increase in most agricultural prices. We do not wish to
argue that less financing was necessarily desirable; we have insufficient
information to draw strong conclusions. The price increase for breeding
animals may provide another reason for the higher than expected investments,
by amount of funds, in breeding animals - although such an increase would
tend to decrease the rate of return expected by new investors unless fully
reflected in the price of slaughter beef.
4.18      The total loans made under the third project, including repeater
loans on which there is no specific data, were 12,326. This is approximately
the same number of loans as made under the second loan, 11,651, and in essen-
tially the same amount of time. Thus, there was little increase in the rate
of growth of lending by the FIRA between 1969 and 1973. This period, in
fact, was one of relative stagnation within Mexican agriculture. Although
FIRA was improving its own system and encouraging the flow of credit and
technical assistance to producers, the flow of credit did not greatly
increase on a net basis. This issue will be discussed in detail in
chapter V.
4.19      The size distribution of the subloans in the third project, in-
cluding those for agroindustries, is given in table a7. Most of the loans
were relatively small, 81% of the loans made were less than US$20,000
equivalent, averaging US$6,500.   They received, in total, 49% of the funds
disbursed. In contrast, 6% of the loans made were greater than US$80,000
equivalent, each averaging US$48,000, and received 29% of the funds dis-
bursed. This loan distribution appears somewhat less equal than those
for the first two projects, but much of this appearance is spurious, inso-
far as inflation during this time resulted in an increase in the unit cost
of most investment items, and in their dollar equivalent. A rising number
of the third project's subloans went to farmer groups, including ejidatarios,
and thus the amount received per individual seems to have become more equal
during this period.
4.20      The data in tables a8 through a14 indicate that the geographic
distribution of loans, both in terms of loan numbers and amounts disbursed,
is rather equal. This distribution reflects FIRA's efforts to promote
credit throughout Mexico, and to develop a system of offices and a staff
in keeping with this.

V. THE GROWTH OF LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
5.01      To put the growth of livestock and agricultural credit in pers-
pective, and FIRA's role in assisting this growth, we shall discuss the
growth of total bank credit in Mexico during the period from 1968 to 1974.
As shown in table al5, the total volume of credit granted by the banking
system in Mexico increased approximately 250% in nominal terms between
1968 and 1974. Although there was some variation in their rate of growth
from year to year, the expansion of short term and medium to long term
credits was nearly the same. Short term credit was 53% of total credit
offered in both 1968 and in 1974. The changes in the cost of living index
are also given in this table; discounting the increase in nominal credit by
the increase in the price level, we find that the increase in real credit
over the period was 48%, or approximately 7% per year.
5.02      As shown in table a16, the percentage of total bank credit which
agriculture received declined, even given the initiation of Bank assistance,
from 12.5% of total credit in 1964 to 8.6% in 1973. The credit flowing to
agriculture rose in nominal terms from 10,527 million pesos in 1968 to 17,563
million pesos in 1973 (table a17), but, discounted for inflation, real credit
rose only 19%, or slightly less than 4% a year. In 1974, after renewed
government effort, the amount of credit flowing to agriculture began to rise
more rapidly than that going to the rest of the economy; the percentage going
to agriculture in that year was 13.4.
5.03      The shift in lending away from agriculture during the late 1960s
was brought about partially by the higher priorities awarded to basic
industries by the Government, but also by a reduction of private investment
in the agricultural sector, caused by declining real product prices and by
land tenure problems which created uncertainty and an unwillingness by some
producers to invest. Financing by the public banks actually maintained
itself better than did that by the private banks, as is shown in table al8.
The real credit provided the agricultural sector by the public sector rose
by 27% between 1970 and 1973, or about 8% per year. In contrast, the credit
offered by the private sector actually fell by 11% in real terms, or by
nearly -4% a year. Although recovering slightly in 1974, it remained lower
in real terms than in 1970. Itis striking that npwhere in any of the
appraisal reports for the third or fourth livestock and agricultural credit
projects, nor in the supervision projects, is there any mention of the down-
turn in lending to the agricultural sector by the private banks, despite
the fact that an increase in lending by the private banks had been a



- 19 -
principal goal of the Bank's program since its initiation.-     In fact there
was almost no attention paid to the growth of overall agricultural credit in
Mexico, but only to that lending which was discounted by FIRA.
5.04      Looking now at the rates of growth of the amount of credit dis-
counted by FIRA, by type of credit and by financial institution (table a19),
we find that total lending activity has varied considerably from one year to
the next, both in the growth of different types of credit, and the type of
financial institution offering this credit. Note that these data indicate
only the sublending actually discounted with FIRA; both the private and public
banks undertake lending with their own funds, i.e., which they do not discount.
Changes in the amounts discounted by FIRA are due to changes in the amounts lent
out by the participating banks and to changes in the proportion which these
banks decide to discount. Efforts by the Government to encourage private
banks to increase the amount of their own resources loaned to agriculture
have resulted,on occasion, in fewer discounts with FIRA as the private banks
have sought to increase the size of their own portfolio of agricultural
loans in keeping with the new legislation. Similarly, the public banks have
altered the proportions discounted with FIRA, from time to time, for reasons
of internal policy. Despite the impossibility of making precise judgements
about the implications or causes of the changes in the amounts discounted
from one year to the next, a.number of important trends appear evident in
the data.
5.05      The amount of credit discounted by FIRA, as a proportion of the
total credit going to agriculture, declined over most of the period covered
by the second and third projects and then rose sharply in 1974 just as the
third project ended and the fourth project began. The proportion fluctuated
between 8.8% and 14.1%. FIRA's participation has been essentially equally
great for short term as for long term credits.
1/ The Bank authorized the participation of the Banco Agropecuario, a
public bank, almost immediately after its founding in late 1965. The
Bank has continued to be concerned to increase the amount of lending
by private banks, and to ensure that the private banks were not dis-
criminated against in terms of legal strictures, rediscounting terms,
and the like, by the Government. However, the Bank's files would
suggest that the Bank has been less and less concerned with this issue
as time has passed. Particularly after the initiation of the low income
producers' subprogram in 1974, at least some of the Bank'.s staff have
felt that increasing reliance would have to be placed on the public
banks because the private banks seemed particularly reluctant to lend
to this new clientele. Recent information suggests, nonetheless, that
the private banks have begun to increase their lending to this clientele
quite significantly.



- 20 -
5.06      The rate of growth of the development (medium and long term) credit
discounted by the private banks was higher than the rate of growth of their
short term credit rediscounts during the early period (see table a20), but
since 1972 their short term credit discounts have grown more rapidly. The
public banks have always discounted much more development credit than short
term credit with FIRA, but they discounted substantial amounts of short term
credit in 1973 and 1974, cutting back again thereafter. We do not know what
policy changes caused the variations in their rediscounts.
5.07      The participation in rediscounting to FIRA by the sublending banks
has changed somewhat in the 1970s, with the proportion discounted by the
private banks declining and that of the official banks rising. As shown in
table a19, the private banks were responsible for 79% of the development loans
rediscounted with FIRA in 1971, but only 53% in 1975. In contrast, the parti-
cipation of the public banks rose from 17 to 43%, and the participation of the
mixed (joint private-public ownership) banks remained constant at 4%. As it
has been the practice of the private banks to rediscount a larger proportion
of their development loans with FIRA than have the official banks, the growth
of development lending to agriculture by the official banks, relative to the
private banks, has been even greater than shown by these figures.
5.08      Looking at subperiods, we find that the amount of development
credit rediscounted by the private banks grew at 28% per year in 1970 and
1971, but actually declined in 1972 and 1973, and grew at about 15% per year
in real terms in 1974 and 1975. In contrast, the public banks increased
their discounted loans almost not at all between 1969 and 1972, but these
then grew at nearly 60% per year in real terms from 1973 through 1975. The
rapid rate of growth of discounted development loans on the part of the
official banks appears to have been associated with the switch in emphasis,
with the Bank's fourth loan in 1973, toward low income producers. Loans to
low income producers are handled much more by the public banks than by the
private banks given that the net profitability of such loans to the banks,
even with the subsidies for technical assistance and loan guarantees provided
by FEGA, has been said to be lower than that of other lending. We have no
direct evidence to confirm or reject this allegation.
5.09      As shown in table a21, in 1962 only 42 financial institutions dis-
counted subloans with FIRA. Of these, 30 were private banks and 12 were
financieras. No public banks operated with FIRA at that time. By 1973,
however, 165 financial institutions were working through FIRA, 102 private
banks, 52 financieras, and 11 official banks. It is interesting, however,
that in 1974 the number of private banks and financieras actually declined,
to 97 and 41 respectively. As the amount of credit financed by private banks
increased dramatically in 1974, the decline may simply reflect mergers among
private banks rather than movement out of the program.
5.10      If we examine the changes in the yearly rates of growth of total
credit discounted with FIRA, it is clear that the real increment (shown in
parentheses in table a20) was modest in each year except 1973 and 1974.



- 21 -
There was essentially no increase in dhe total real credit discounted by
FIRA from 1969 to 1972, there were big increases in 1973 and 1974, and
there was essentially no growth in 1975 and 1976. Development credit, to
which the Bank projects were devoted, grew slowly until 1973 and 1974, when
lending rose substantially, and then declined in 1975 and 1976, actually
becoming negative in the first six months of the latter year. Short term
lending followed the same pattern to 1974, then turned negative in 1975 and
rose significantly in 1976. For the entire period, the compound rate of
growth of credit discounted by FIRA has been about- 13% per year; short term
credit has grown at 12% and development credit at 14%, all in real terms.
5.11      As a final point in this section, table a22 indicates that the
assistance of the IBRD to FIRA declined substantially in relative terms over
the period 1970-1974. The amount of funds discounted with the Bank rose at
only 5%, in nominal pesos. The proportion discounted with the IDB remained
roughly constant over this same period, and the proportion of FIRA funds
coming from domestic sources rose.
5.12      What implications can we draw from these data?    First, it is clear
that the growth of credit discounted by FIRA from 1969 to 1972 was nil. This
phenomenon is consistent with the fact that the agricultural sector during
this period was neglected in terms of most policies, and the sector stagnated
as a result. The government attempted to stimulate agriculture via a number
of policy changes in 1973 and 1974, and credit was included. The increase
in the rate of growth of the short term capital discounted by FIRA, almost
all of which occurs after 1972, is due chiefly to the increased effort which
the government began to place on agriculture, as opposed to livestock, and
on low income producers. While much of the emphasis of FIRA had previously
been on development credit, in the effort to open new regions, increase
cattle stocks, and establish an improved physical infrastructure, after
1972 the Government, in contrast, placed great priority on increasing the
production of basic grains and other staples, and correspondingly attempted
to channel resources to producers who could utilize these funds immediately.
The latter often were low income producers, whose credit needs were handled
relatively more by the public banks than by the private banks.
5.13      Second, the slow rate of growth of real credit between 1969 and
1972 seems to have reflected a lack of demand as much as a lack of supply.
It is frequently stated in Bank reports that the latent demand for agricul-
tural credit in Mexico is large. Such may be the case. However, many of
the producers who are considered potential users of credit require
substantial assistance before they can organize themselves to utilize
credit, and afterwards as they attempt to introduce and operate new agri-
cultural technologies. Thus, it is probably not the case that much larger
amounts of credit, simply made available for use, will be utilized. Tech-
nical assistance is a necessary accompaniment, and the profitability of
investment must be acceptable, requiring favorable output/input price
ratios. Without these factors, additional assistance from the Bank may
simply substitute for credit previously available from other sources.



- 22 -
5.14      The data in table &23 provide another cross section perspective on
FIRA's development since 1962. One of the facts that is surprising is the
increase in the amount of credit discounted per FIRA technician during the
1970s. Although these data must be qualified to take account of inflation,
which essentially cancels out any real growth, it is still surprising that
FIRA has been able to increase the amount of credit discounted without a
larger increase in the number of staff. There are more producers per loan
in the low income producer category, but so also is more technical assistance
required on such loans.

VI. LENDING AND REDISCOUNTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
6.01    As under the first and second projects, FIRA was expected to re-
discount subloans made by participating private credit institutions and
by the regional banks of the Banco Agropecuario system. Lending and
rediscounting terms established for the third project were the same as
those which had been established under the second project. They were as
follows:
Table 6

6.02      These conditions were somewhat changed from the second loan,
which in turn had been altered from the first. In each case, the principal
reason underlying the alterations was the desire to increase the proportion
of the participating banks' capital flowing to agriculture, i.e., to reduce
the proportion of the subloans actually discounted with FIRA. The amounts
discounted in the first three projects were as follows:



- 24 -
First Loan   Second Loan     Third Loan
Private Banks        87.3           85.3          n.a.
Public Banks         71.0           68.5          n.a.
Aggregate             85.5          81.0          79.7
6.03      One of the primary purposes of the first project had been to
stimulate the participation of the private banks in making development
loans to the agricultural sector. To achieve this, an incentive system
was developed which provided the private banks with rediscounting oppor-
tunities through FIRA in which the interest rate charged farmers for the
subloan was higher than the interest rate charged the participating bank
when it subsequently discounted the subloan with FIRA. The differential
margin permitted the private bank to earn a return on its invested capital,
i.e., that part of the subloan which it did not discount, substantially
higher than the lending rate to the farmer himself. The system provided
private banks with rates of return which were much higher than they could
have obtained without the rediscounting facilities, and thus encouraged
them to make agricultural loans which they probably would not otherwise
have made. In addition, by providing the rediscounting facility, FIRA
made available substantially more capital for investment in agriculture.
This increase in lending was possible without a change in the reserve
requirements of the participating banks, in the capital of these banks,
or in the proportion of their capital invested in agriculture.
6.04      Once the discounting facilities had been established, the profita-
bility of investments in agriculture (assuming use of the discounting oppor-
tunity) could be varied by altering 1) the proportion of the subloan which
could be legally discounted, 2) the rediscount rates, or 3) the interest
rates to beneficiaries. For example, increasing the interest rate to bene-
ficiaries would be likely to reduce loan demand by (potential) borrowers;
increasing the rediscount rate will reduce the profitability of lending for
the participating banks and would likely result in a redirection of credit
away from agriculture; and increasing the proportion which could be redis-
counted would increase the total loans which a participating bank is able to
obtain with a given amount of its own resources, and thus would increase
both the pro,fitability of investing and the amount which could be invested
(assuming the rediscount and interest rates are fixed and that the bank is
able to rediscount with FIRA until it has reached the maximum loan portfolio
consistent with its own capital and the proportion which can be discounted).
6.05      The experience of the Bank's effort to alter these three parameters
to increase the contribution of the participating banks has already been



- 25 -
analyzed in a previous OED report written by Gonzalez.11 We shall not
repeat that analysis, although an understanding of his methodology may
be of assistance in what follows. In essence, the Bank, which was the
principal architect of the incentive system, sought to increase the
contribution of the participating private banks in making agricultural
loans, and also sought to increase the amount of credit flowing to the
agricultural sector. To a certain degree, given the instruments at hand,
the two objectives were in conflict. As Gonzalez emphasized, the Bank did
not discuss the nature of this tradeoff in its appraisal or supervision
reports, and it appears that the tradeoff was not fully appreciated.
6.06      The Bank attempted during the first three projects to encourage
the participating banks to rediscount a smaller proportion of their loans
with FIRA and thus make larger contributions from their own resources.
This was accomplished, at least in some degree (the only relevant data here
are those regarding private banks. Public banks have not been so concerned
with the profit motive as with direct Goverrment directives and thus have
been less susceptible to persuasion by changes in the profitability of
discounting). The potential loan portfolio of a participating bank is re-
lated to the amount which can be discounted (in a simple abstract model)
by the formula:
P   R -  (l-q),
where P is the potential loan portfolio, R is the initial amount of reserves,
and q is the proportion which is discountable. The total loans resulting
from $100 of reserves, with different proportions discountable, are:
Proportion Discountable           .90     .85     .80
Total Potential Loans           1,000     667     500
Total Contribution by
Participating Bank              100     100     100
Total Amount Financed by
Discounting                     900     557     400
6.07      By changing the proportion which was discountable, the Bank induced
the participating private banks to increase their contribution to project
lending by 5 or 6 percentage points over about 8 years. This required an
increase in the participating bank's invested capital, for a given amount

- 26 -
of loans, of roughly 50%. However, the Bank also wished to increase the
flow of total lending to the agricultural sector, which was made more
difficult by the reduction in the amount discountable. If, as a case in
point, the Bank hoped to bring about a real increase in the quantity of
credit flowing to the agricultural sector over these eight years of about
200% (15% per year growth), the decrease in the proportion discountable
which actually took place over the same period would have required an in-
crease in the amounts invested by the private bank.s of 350%. This would
have required a growth rate of their own contribution of about 21% per year.
6.08      Moreover, if the change in the percent discountable were intro-
duced quite suddenly, such as from the end of one project to the beginning
of the other, the necessary percentage increase in the amount of invested
capital on the part of participating banks would be much greater. For
example, if the Bank wished to increase real credit by 15% in one year,
e.g., from 1,000 to 1,150, and also reduce the amount rediscounted from
35% to 80% in that same year, an increase in the invested capital on the
part of the participating banks of 53% would be required. It appears
that such a substantial increase could be difficult to achieve in one year
and, as a result, that the total quantity of lending might instead decline.
The evidence discussed previously on the growth of private bank lending
does tend to support this view. The growth of on-farm development lending
discounted by private banks was actually negative in 1972, the year in which
the third loan became effective. It was negative in 1973, the year in which
the fourth loan became effective. And it was negative in real terms in
1975/76, the year in which the fifth loan became effective.
6.09      In the first two projects Bank missions explicitly attempted to
design a schedule of rediscount rates which would make it relatively more
profitable for private banks to rediscount a smaller proportion of their
subloans. The Bank's efforts had some success, as we have indicated, but
there has not been a massive increase in the resources placed in agricul-
ture by private banks, either in terms of their contribution to the lending
undertaken (80% of the funds loaned still come from FIRA), or in total cre-
dit lent. The effort of establishing different rediscount rates for different
proportions of subloan rediscounts was abandoned in the third loan and
different subloan size categories were given fixed rediscounting ratios. The
maximum amount a participating bank could rediscount was strictly determined
by the size of the subloan, with the smaller subloans having a higher redis-
count ratio. However, the lending rate to beneficiaries varied in the same
direction. Because the gross margin between the interest rate to the bene-
ficiary and the rediscount rate was the same for all but the very largest
loans, the variation in rediscount proportions meant that it should have been
relatively more profitable, gross of operating costs, to make smaller loans.
But even relatively modest operating costs have a striking effect on the net
profitability to the participating bank, and Gonzales has shown that it is
quite reasonable to believe that the relative cost of lending to smaller



- 27 -
borrowers was greater. Under the rate and rediscount structure adopted,
it appears that many agricultural loans might have been of marginal
profitability to the participating banks. This issue also does not
appear to have received adequate consideration within the Bank as yet.
6.10      The Bank also wished Mexico to increase the interest rates paid
by beneficiaries, but was generally unsuccessful. Interest rates to bene-
ficiaries were increased by one-half percentage point in one category and
decreased by the same amount in another. The Government consistently took
the position that for political reasons it did not wish to increase rates
to farmers. Rapid inflation in Mexico did not begin until 1973, the year
in which the fourth loan became effective. Interest rates were increased
in the fourth project, and again in the fifth project. By 1975, however, the
interest rates being charged to borrowers were clearly negative and the
rate of return on the capital invested by the participating banks was also
very low and possibly negative.

VII. IMPACT OF THE ON-FARM INVESTMENTS AND THEIR EVALUATION
A. The 1972 Consultant's Evaluation
7.01      The loan agreement for the third project specified that FIRA
would obtain a special consultant for the analysis of the impact of loans
granted in the first two projects. FIRA had attempted to study the results
of investments made with project subloans during the first two projects,
but these efforts had not been productive. After the third loan became
effective, FIRA again made an effort to undertake a study of the impact on
borrowers, but the Bank, in its supervision missions, judged that the com-
mittee of economists which had been asked to do the job would not be able
to carry out a quality evaluation which the Bank felt was imperative. The
Bank informed FIRA of its opinion and suggested three consultants who it felt
were competent to the task. FIRA delayed. The Bank finally sent FIRA a
telegram informing its director that the Bank would consider FIRA in default
of one of the conditions of effectiveness of the loan agreement if FIRA did
not immediately move to contract an outside consultant to undertake the
stipulated evaluation of project subloans. FIRA complied immediately. The
consultant chosen was a professor at the Department of Agricultural Economics,
University of Wisconsin. Previously he had done considerable work with-farm
monitoring systems and the analysis of their data in Wisconsin.
7.02      The consultant supervised two field surveys carried out in .May 1972:
a 4% sample of farm and ranch sub-borrowers (719 producers) and a 27% sample
of agroindustry loans (55 enterprises). Questionnaires were pre-tested before
they were utilized. All questionnaires were completed by personal interview
in the field, largely by local FIRA technicians.
7.03      The principal survey findings are known within the Bank.    They
concern the first two projects rather than the third, but, because the
first three projects were highly similar, and because the results of the
1972 survey established a basis at which other project studies have been
aimed and compared, we will summarize those results.
(1) The survey found that the average size of the participating
farms and ranches was large, 552 ha, although the variation
by region and by type of principal activity was substantial.
Considering the entire size distribution of farms and ranches
sampled, 19% were less than 50 ha and 10% were greater than
1,000 ha. The beef ranches sampled averaged 1,000 ha, dairy
farms 145 ha, and crop farms 400 ha. A 400 ha crop farm in
Mexico is very large.
(2) The sample was stratified by geographical area, but not by
size of farm. The distribution of farms within the sample,



- 29 -
however, is very similar to the distribution of farms
in the second project, suggesting that the random sample
provided a good representation of FIRA operations in at
least this respect. The same was true for the amounts
invested per farm, and by type of farm.
(3) The 719 farms sampled received 970 loans: 528 farms
received only one loan, 141 farms received two loans, 40
farms received three loans, and 10 farms received four
loans. Thus, the number of individual borrowers during
the first two projects was approximately 73% the number of
separate loans, or 13,500: 27% of these producers were
able to borrow at least twice between 1966, the first full
year of operation for the program, and May 1972, i.e., six
and one half years.
(4) The 27% of the farms which obtained repeater loans received
50% of the total loan funds disbursed to the producers in
the sample. Thus, it appears that repeater loans tended
to concentrate the lending distribution, as those who
borrowed in larger amounts per loan also borrowed more
frequently. The results also suggested, however, that a
number of borrowers wanted and were able to make repeated
investments to continue the development of their farms.
(5) Income and expense data reflecting the pre-loan situation
for each farm surveyed was taken from FIRA field office
loan files. These files did not consistently contain pre-
loan information on capital asset transactions and depre-
ciation, nor on inventory changes, nor were producers able
to produce reliable information from their own records or
from memory on these items. As a result, it was not
possible to calculate an accurate rate of return on invest-
ments. Instead, the consultant's analysis focused on alter-
native measures of loan impact: (a) change in annual net
farm income, (b) change in net worth, (c) change in the
gross value of annual farm production, and (d) change in
selected livestock and crop productivity coefficients. The
average time elapsed, however, since the first subloan was
30 months, with a standard deviation of nearly 15 months.
As a result of the variation in the period of maturity, it
was impossible to determine whether ranches were always on
target insofar as appraisal targets were concerned.
(6)  The average increase in annual net cash operating income by
the farm sampled was 45%. The largest proportional improve-
ment was for beef ranches (95%), followed closely by dairy



- 30 -
farms (90%).-   The variation among producers was marked,
however, as 230 farms (32%) experienced an actual reduc-
tion in net cash operating income. Considering the impact
of inflation, which was approximately 13% during this
30-month period, the number of producers who suffered a
decline in real net cash operating income is probabably
around 300. This phenomenon cannot have reflected the
long gestation period of cattle enterprises, for these
enjoyed large average increases in cash income, although
it could reflect the case of perennial crops. On the other
hand, a number of producers showed increases of net cash
income of more than 800%. The impossibility of determining
the exact causes of the variation among producers requires
caution in the interpretation of the average, and probably
warrants further investigation.
(7) The farms were also large when viewed in equity terms. Net
worth per farm, for the pre-loan situation, averaged
US$78,000. The average loan was US$18,000, or 23% of net
farm equity. As the loans were moderate compared to the
equity position, they do not appear to have been risky.
(8) There was some variation by area and by type of ranch, but
the 1972 survey indicated that farmers and ranchers were
investing about the expected amount to complement funds
received from the project credit. The number of pesos
invested per peso borrowed averaged 1.17 for the project
as a whole.
(9) The average farm increased its net worth by US$41,000.
The median increase was US$16,000.   The substantial
difference between the average and the median was caused
by a dual modal distribution with 137 farms showing less
than a US$4,000 increase, while 126 farms showed more than
a US$64,000 increase. The reasons for such a discrepancy,
and the interpretation of the significance of the increase
in net worth, is difficult to determine. Also, no data
was given on the size of the average farm's gross value, and
thus it is impossible to determine how much of the increase
in net worth is likely to have been caused by inflation.
Assuming that the net value of the-farm had been 75% of the
gross value, pre-development, and that the whole, value of
the loan was invested, plus an additional 20% contribution
by the owner, the increase in the value of farm-assets due
1/ This result is very surprising, given that the beef ranches were expected
to purchase breeding animals and to require a considerable period before
maturity of the investment permitted larger sales.



- 31 -
to 13% inflation would have amounted to about US$17,000.
This, however, is only 40% of the increase in average net
worth which was reported. Either other investments not
accounted for were being made on the farm or some substan-
tial change in valuation was occurring during the period.
(10)  There was an extreme variation among ranches in the change
in the value of gross production, as might be expected
given that this was a sample of investments taken at
different points in the development process, and which them-
selves had different expected maturation periods. To obtain
this figure, strong assumptions were required regarding the
magnitude of pre-development inventory, but the consultant
indicated that he believed that the sample of farms had
achieved a very substantial increase in total production
during the period following the (initial) loan. The average
value of annual gross production pre-loan was US$25,000 and
the average, post-loan, was US$50,000.
(11)  The consultant also undertook to ascertain data on a number
of physical productivity measures. This proved difficult
because (a) there was little information available for
productivity in the pre-loan situation and recourse was,
therefore, to the producer's memory, (b) the information was
not obtained from all producers. The estimates made were
grouped by type of farm.
(12)  The consultant found that the average beef breeding herd
had expanded by 37%, from 98 to 134 cows.
(13)  Data were available on weaning rates for 314 farms (227
specialized as beef ranches and 87 other ranches reporting
the same information). There was no significant improve-
ment in the average weaning rate reported for either of the
two groups. The weaning rate in the pre-loan situation
(for both groups pooled) was 65.6% and at the end of 1971
it was 66.5%. The appraisal documents had estimated that
the weaning rate would lie between 55% and 57% (depending
on the region) before the subloan and would rise, by the
fourth year, to between 60% and 65%. The average expected
increase was from 56.5 to 61.3 or a proportional increase
of 8% to 9%.
(14)  The stocking rate rose on farms in the post- as opposed to
pre-loan situation. This increase, however, was only 9%
on the average. Given that herds expanded by 37%, the data
imply that pasture area increased by approximately 28%.
Unfortunately, the consultant did not indicate whether



- 32 -
ranches expanded, whether existing unutilized land
was opened up, or whether land was taken out of other
types of production to be used for cattle. The appraisal
reports had predicted increases in stocking rates of
roughly 40% to 50%, so the sample would suggest a short-
fall in achievement here, or at least a radical departure
from the type of development expected.
(15)  The weight gain per calf was 7% greater in the post-loan
as opposed to the pre-loan situation, on average. The
appraisal report made no prediction for this measure.
(16)  For dairy farms, the number of cows rose by 55%, on
average, and production of milk per cow rose by 35%, on
average. The productivity on those farms which specialized
in dairy production was about 50% higher and herds were
larger than on those farms which did not specialize.
(17)  There were only 27 specialized hog farms and 18 poultry
farms. The information obtainable from the poultry farms
was especially limited. The hog farms expanded total
production by nearly 120%, but nearly all this increase
occurred as a result of scale expansion.   The consultant's
analysis indicated essentially no change in technical
efficiency in terms of pigs weaned per litter or per sow,
or in terms of feed conversion.
(18)  The data collected on changes in cultivated crops are
limited and their implications are difficult to deter-
mine. For cultivated feed crops (corn, wheat, alfalfa,
grain sorghum, etc.) the average yields reported
increased only marginally, about 3.5%. For cultivated
cash crops such as beans, cotton, coffee, cartamo, sugar
cane rice, etc., some yields rose (beans 13%; rice 32%)
while others fell (cotton 16%; coffee 12%; and cartamo
30%). The data in the sample, however, are poorly
structured to capture productivity change resulting from
investments which opened up new lands or caused changes
in crop mix, as well as an increase in the yields of crops
grown on land already in use. If the crop mix changes, it
is possible that average yields hive not changed for any
crops, but that the farmer has simply substituted new crops
for old and receives a higher value added per ha in that
form. The problem points up the need for information on
the changing crop mix on borrowing farms, as well as
information regarding changing yields of crops grown on
specific parcels.



- 33 -
(19) The yields of perennial crops (fruit trees in this case)
rose markedly, although this was expected given that
tree crop productivity would be strongly affected by
orchard age. No data was collected on the age of trees.
7.04      The consultant's final report was presented to the Bank in
September 1972. He has remained a consultant to FIRA, however, as the
latter have attempted to introduce a continuous monitoring system.
7.05      It will be useful to put the results of the 1972 survey in
perspective. The Bank previously had had information on subloan disburse-
ments, by economic activity and by specific investments, but little indica-
tion of the resultant impact. The Bank had sought to assist commercial
producers, which were quite large farmers within the Mexican context,
providing them funds at what were considered market rates of interest. The
Bank had also placed great emphasis on strengthening FIRA as an institution,
including upgrading the latter's ability to provide technical assistance.
This was implicitly reflected in the models developed by the Bank and FIRA,
and presented in the first, second and third appraisal reports as a guide
to the results expected from on-farm development lending, which predicted
increases in specific types of technical efficiency. The 1972 survey
suggested that many of these increases in technical efficiency were not
occurring. For example, changes in calving rates, animal weight gain and
pasture carrying capacity, as well as in the yields of a number of important
crops, all seemed to be below predictions. The 1972 consultant's analysis,
however, did not explore in detail why these changes were not occurring,
nor what the policy ramifications might be. Disturbingly, there was also
little response from FIRA, or from operating divisions within the Bank, to
indicate that much of a stir was created. In the fourth appraisal report,
for example, the survey's results are summarized and disappointment is
expressed that productivity increases had been no greater, but there is no
suggestion that a number of major policy issues had been implicitly raised.
7.06      In many respects, the survey merely opened the door on a number
of issues. The survey did indicate that the agricultural enterprises to
which project subloans had been made appeared to be beneficially affected,
at least as judged from changes in net worth, annual gross output, etc.
But the survey did not indicate how these changes had occurred. The data
collected showed substantial variation across farms, and the analysis was
not able to explain this variation, or to provide a comprehensive descrip-
tion of the operation and impact of the subloa s on borrowers, especially
so as to distinguish them from non-borrowers1' Nor did the survey analysis
1/ The 1972 impact study influenced the design characteristics of the
pilot monitoring system, which was subsequently implemented, by
indicating information which was needed from producers if certain
questions were to be answered.



- 34 -
put the project within the context of Mexican agriculture as the latter
was developing. The consultant's evaluation contained no discussion of
the trends in agricultural prices, technical assistance, public investments,
land tenure, agricultural research, the diffusion of new technology, exports,
domestic consumption or even the demand for credit. His analysis was what
had been requested by the Bank (although data problems made it impossible to
obtain some of the answers sought), but this was a limited view of the issue.
B. The 1974 OED Agricultural Credit Evaluation
7.07      One and one-half years after the 1972 survey, OED undertook a
study of the impact of the Bank's lending for livestock and agricultural
credit in Mexico. This study was based on a survey of 243 borrowers - 125
borrowers from the first loan (1968) and 118 borrowers from the third loan
(1973) - sampled from three geographic regions. It was hoped that the 1973
group would serve as a control group, assuming that their development would
have been distinct from the 1968 borrowers during the period 1968-1973 and
that their borrowings in 1973 would have occurred too recently to permit an
effect at the time of the OED survey (December 1973-January 1974). The
1973 group did not serve the function of control as well as had been
desired. On examination, the 1973 group had already implemented most of the
investments for which they had borrowed by the time of the survey and,
since much of this investment, such as the purchase of livestock, had at
least some immediate impact, certain of the survey's results were left
inconclusive.
7.08      Nonetheless, several of the results were surprising.    It was
found that the 1973 farmers had had access to credit during the intervening
period, though from other sources, and had developed their farms and ranches
as rapidly as those who had received FIRA assistance in 1968. And there was
no evidence that technical change had occurred in one group more rapidly
than in the other.
7.09      The OED sample was smaller than that in the 1972 survey, more
restricted geographically, and less rigorously drawn. Nonetheless, it
repeated a number of questions asked by the 1972 consultant permitting a
check of earlier results, and it also attempted to examine a number of the
issues which had not been confronted in the earlier analysis. In parti-
cular, the OED study considered the evidence on (1) the substitution of
project credit for other financing previously available, (2) the relation-
ship between mechanization and employment, (3) the origin of all technical
assistance provided to producers, (4) the effect of such technical assistance,
and (5) the rate of return being achieved in different activities.
7.10      The OED evaluation obtained the following results:
(1) The farms surveyed were large, averaging 1,266 ha for
those borrowing in 1968 and 1,470 for those borrowing



- 35 -
in 1973. Although project subloans could not be used
directly to purchase land, both groups had expanded the
size of their farms (ranches) between 1968 and 1973, by
about 7%.
(2) As in the 1972 survey, cattle herd buildup between 1968
and 1973 was rapid, 42% for those borrowirg in 1968 and
62% for those borrowing in 1973. Thus, the amount of
buildup was inversely associated with the duration of
the project loan. OED could not determine to what
extent this buildup permitted the utilization of pasture
previously available, but under-utilized, and to what
extent investments were opening up new land.
(3) The OED survey found little increase in weaning rates or
calf finishing rates and was consistent with the 1972
survey here as well.
(4)  The OED survey found that both groups of borrowers had
increased the amount of land under crops by about 25%
between 1968 and 1973, but that cropping intensity had
remained essentially unchanged. The cropping pattern
had shifted toward higher value crops, but specific crop
yields enjoyed little improvement. It was impossible to
control for land quality or for water availability.
(5) Although the OED study did not collect financial data,
concentrating almost exclusively on physical production
data, it did substitute the production data obtained into
the models presented in the appraisal reports to determine
what sort of rates of return would be received if producers
obtained the physical productivity which the survey indi-
cated, along with the increase in scale which was also
indicated. The world-wide OED evaluation, which focused on
livestock and tractor credits in five countries, calculated
rates of return only for beef livestock investment in
Mexico and did not attempt to calculate separate rates of
return to irrigation, plantation crops, or other agricul-
tural crops. However, insofar as approximately 40% of
project funds in the third loan went specifically to beef
cattle enterprises, this was an important indicator.
(6) The rates of return estimated for on-farm investments in
beef cattle enterprises were:
Financial Rates               Economic Rate
Investment Package Farmer's Equity Investment Package
13                 14                 12



- 36 -
These rates were below the appraisal rates of return
projected for beef cattle investments which had been
30% in the second loan (1969-71) and about 22% in the
third loan (1972-73). In part, the shortfall in the
rates of return was due to the fact that productivity
did not rise as much on ranches as had been predicted.
This resulted, in part, from the fact that FIRA was
not able to provide the intensive technical assistance
which the Bank, over-optimistically, had expected. In
addition, ranchers had found that a policy of expansion
onto previously un- or under-utilized lands was more
profitable, and easier, than the intensification of lands
already in use. It is also true that the period 1968-72
was one of relatively poor incentives for the agricultural
sector, providing less motivation for producers to move
toward intensification when other alternatives were
available to them. The rate of return estimated by OED
is nonetheless above the rate at which producers were
borrowing and probably close to the rate of return on
capital in Mexico. And the rates quoted above include
no adjustment for inflation. This adjustment would have
increased the financial rates of return, since loan
principal and amortization payments are fixed in nominal
pesos, making the livestock investments more attractive
within the Mexican context.
.(7) Although the OED evaluation attempted to obtain evidence
on mechanization and employment in its survey, the
evidence turned out to be limited and difficult to
interpret. It appeared that employment on the farms and
ranches of both 1968 and 1973 borrowers increased during
the period 1968-73, and that no substantial difference
between groups existed. However, insofar as the amount
of mechanization on farms in both groups also had been
roughly equal, this evidence shed no light on the impact
of mechanization on employment.
(8) We will commpnt more on the issue of substitution in
chapter IX, D, pp. 54-55, but it was clear from questions
to producers regarding alternative sources of financing
that a large number of the 1968 borrowers felt they would
have been able to finance the investments carried out
with project subloans even had the project credits not
been available. Most of the borrowers also comprained that
the FIRA credits received were too small, reflecting perhaps
the size of the operation which most of the borrowers had
or perhaps a reasonable conservatism by FIRA technicians.



- 37 -
C. The 1975 FIRA Evaluation
7.11      A number of these same issues have been examined once more using
data obtained from the pilot monitoring system established by FIRA in 1975.
The Bank had encouraged FIRA to establish a monitoring system during both
the first and second projects. In the first project the Bank and FIRA agreed
to establish in FIRA an economic evaluation unit as a precursor to the
monitoring effort. This was done and some effort was made to collect
information, but the progress desired by the Bank was not fully achieved
and this resulted in insistence by the Bank that FIRA engage an outside
consultant to assist in this effort. Following completion of the latter's
evaluation, a pilot monitoring system was established with the help of the
same consultant: 98 farms and ranches were selected and basic data was
obtained from them in July 1973 and again in July 1974.
7.12      The 1973-74 pilot monitoring system was designed primarily to
determine the feasibility of a continuous record-keeping program with farm
borrowers, not to provide a comprehensive sample for impact study purposes.
The farms monitored provide a 2% sample of the approximately 5,500 farms
which had received subloans under the third project (to the date of the
initiation of the establishment of the monitoring system), but the sample
is too small to allow statistical significance to be achieved for most of
the categories at which the subsequent evaluation looks. Further, of the
98 firms originally selected, only 80 firms recorded a sufficient number of
the data requested to permit their inclusion in the final analysis. As the
analysis was stratified by four basic types of farm enterprises, and by
three regions of the country, the data were divided into 12 cells. The
original sample would have allowed for an average of only 7.5 observations
per cell and the final sample allowed an average of less than 7 observations.
The firms selected also seem larger than the average firm participating in
the project. Nonetheless, the sample and the analysis provide interesting
information on the impact of the project, as well as being a necessary step
prior to the establishment of a larger and more detailed monitoring scheme.
7.13      The major points raised in FIRA's analysis of the survey's
results are:
(1)  The total amount of bank credit held by the 80 farms
sampled rose from M$2.5 million before receipt of their
first project subloan, to M$17.5 million at the time of
the survey. The project loan accounted for 65% of the
increase. Thus, in the post-loan situation, 56% of the
funds owed banks were from the project and 44% from
other sources. The project seems to have increased the
amount-of funds available, although it is not clear to
what degree it substituted for other funds which would
have been available in any event, or, conversely, to what
degree receipt of the project loan made possible the



- 38 -
receipt of other loans. The sample found that two-thirds
of the borrowers had not received supervised credit before
obtaining the project loan. It is not clear within the
context of the report whether some of these firms had
received other credits which were "unsupervised", nor is
it clear what "supervised" meant.
(2) The average gross assets of the farms sampled rose by 122%.
Gross assets averaged US$64,500 in the pre-loan situation
and US$143,200 approximately two and one-half years later
(the 1972 survey did not report data on gross assets). The
increase in gross assets was decomposed into (a) inventory
changes (43% of the total increase), such as any increase
in the physical size of the cattle herd above that resulting
from the loan purchases of cattle. or any real increase in
the value of perennial crops after they were planted,
(b) price increases caused by simple inflation (25%),
(c) investments made with program development credit (12%),
(d) investments made with funds provided directly by the
owner (10%) and (e) investments made with credits from non-
FIRA sources (10%). As can be seen immediately, these
figures appear quite different from those in the 1972
consultant's analysis, as well as from the other data avail-
able on the livestock and agriculture credit program. For
example, although the third appraisal report had predicted
that producers would contribute about 15% of the total cost
of on-farm investments, and the 1972 survey found that
producers in that sample had invested 17%, on average, the
FIRA sample found that producers were investing equally as
much as the FIRA credit with their own funds, and another
equal part with funds borrowed from third sources. Note
that, according to the survey, these investments were in
addition to the natural buildup in the herd due to subse-
quent animal retention, and in addition to inflation. The
fact that producers had such substantial financial resources
at their disposal is surprising and perplexing; the FIRA
evaluation does not analyze how or why this occurred.
(3) The farms in the 1975 FIRA sample averaged 1,101 ha versus
552 ha in the 1972 sample. It has been thought that the
size of the borrowing farms in the livestock and agricul-
ture credit program has gradually declined, but the
apparent difference between the two sample means may be
explained by the fact that the 1975 FIRA evaluati6n is
based on a more restricted geographic sample than was the
1972 consultant's evaluation. The average farm in the
FIRA sample also declined in total acreage by 4%, from the
pre- to post-loan situation, in contrast to the increase
found by the OED study.



- 39 -
(4) The composition of land use changed considerably for the
farms sampled in the pilot monitoring system, with cul-
tivated land increasing, especially that under irrigation
(17%); artificial pastures rose in amount by 37%, and
natural pastures declined by 37%. Land in other uses,
including unutilized land, declined by 80%. The invest-
ments made clearly shifted land toward more intensive use.
(5)  Net assets rose by 102%, from US$61,800 in the pre-loan
situation to US$125,300 in the post-loan situation. In
the 1972 survey, net worth averaged US$78,474 in the pre-
loan situation versus US$119,052 in the post-loan situation.
However, the FIRA report states that net real assets,
adjusted for price changes, rose by 52%. Thus, roughly
half the increase in nominal net assets of the farms
sampled in 1973/74 was due to price changes. In an earlier
section, the FIRA report suggested that inflation had
explained only 25% of the increase in gross assets. Since
net assets rose by US$63,500, half of which is US$31,750,
and gross assets rose by US$78,700, one-quarter of which
is US$19,675, the information given appears contradictory.
(6) Net income per farm in the FIRA sample rose from US$4,350
per year, pre-development, to US$11,560 at the time of the
survey. The figures would seem to understate development,
however, insofar as US$11,560 is only 9% of the net asset
position at the time of the survey. It appears that this
figure represents income before maturation of the invest-
ments because, in the 1972 survey, net income was US$9,040
pre-loan and US$13,092 at the time of the 1972 survey.
Given inflation during the two years between the 1972 survey
and the FIRA survey carried out for the third project, and
the fact that the farms in the 1975 sample have larger net
assets in nominal terms, one would expect the latter survey
to show higher net incomes.l/
1/ Based on a household survey undertaken by the Bank of Mexico in 1969,
the following data were obtained for the size distribution of net
family incomes in Mexico:
Percent of
Income Bracket           Population       Rural Population
(UJS$ per family)         (millions)
Less than $381              6.3                   30
381-482                     2.3                   11
482-728                     3.8                   18
728-952                     2.9                   14
952-1,904                   4.2                   20
over 1,904                  1.5                    7
As can be seen, the farms contained in the FIRA sample were within
the upper 7% of the income distribution before they received their
loans, even assuming that their farm income represented their total
family income. After the loan, their incomes were higher.



- 40 -
(7) Gross farm production per year rose from US$18,272 to
US$35,776.
(8) The FIRA report found that labor intensity (measured as
the amount spent on labor per year as a percent of the
value of land) doubled in two regions and remained un-
changed in a third. However, as a result of the labor
employed on newly incorporated land .(which had been
previously unutilized), total labor utilization on the
farms sampled rose even in the third region. The
smallest increase in labor use per land area occurred in
cattle enterprises; higher increases, approximately double
that associated with cattle, occurred in dairy, crop and
mixed enterprises. The FIRA report found that the largest
absolute increase in the stock of labor, per farm, occurred
in the region wherein mechanization was greatest. It
concluded that selective mechanization might be desirable
as one part of the farm development process, and that the
total effect on employment could be positive.
(9) The FIRA report also examined several indicators of physical
productivity. It found that the calving rate on the ranches
sampled had risen from 61% to 66% (the 1972 consultant's
sample had shown arn increase from 65% to 66%; the OED study
had, after its sample and discussion with Mexican experts,
estimated an increase from 1968 to 1973 of 61% to 66%, the
same as FIRA). The appraisal models had predicted
increases in the weaning rates of from 57%-60% to 60%-65%.
(10)  The data on stocking rates are confusing.    It is clear
that a good deal of previously underutilized land was
brought into production. It is not clear whether the
total amount of land devoted to cattle expanded more or
less than did the size of cattle herds.
(11)  The amount of milk produced per cow on dairy farms rose
about 30%.
(12) The FIRA report showed increases in the amount of cultivable
land on the farms sampled, and in the amount of land
actually cultivated, with the proportion of cultivable
land actually cultivated rising in two regions and falling
in the other. They also showed yield increases for a
number of major crops, including corn and sorghumi.
(13)  FIRA estimated the rate of return to investments by region
and by type of economic activity. The FIRA report estimated
rates of return by sunmming the average annual sales plus



- 41 -
inventory changes over the period between the granting of
the loan and the sample, and dividing by the incremental
amount of capital invested since the loan. This is a
different methodological approach than that used by the
Bank to calculate internal rates of return. The estimated
rates of return ranged from 15% to 18% by region, and from
15% to 23% by activity (beef cattle, 15%; dairy cattle, 23%;
annual crops, 16%; and mixed activities, 20%).
D. Rates of Return
7.14      The information provided by the three evaluations to date is
mixed. It is clear that the first three Bank loans assisted in the capitali-
zation of a significant proportion (6%) of the commercial farms and ranches
in Mexico; we estimate that about 20,000 separate enterprises were granted
loans. The project's credit went largely to expand agricultural enterprises
through the purchase of cattle to stock lands previously underutilized;
lesser but still important amounts went for the purchase of machinery and
the construction of farm buildings, other installations, and irrigation
facilities. The rates of ret,urn predicted in the third appraisal report
were higher than those which seem to be occurring, but the rates of return
are nonetheless satisfactory. The profitability of the investments appears
to have fallen between 13% and 20% on financial return, without adjustment
for inflation, and about 18% to 27% with adjustment for inflation. The
economic rate of return was slightly lower, about 12 percent to 20%. The
bulk of the investments were in cattle, which offered one of the lower
profitabilities. However, a considerable amount of land which could not be
utilized for other economic activities could be used for cattle. In some
cases it is expected that ranching will be a transitory activity, being
phased out over time and more intensive activities introduced as the land
becomes more developed.

VIII. AGROINDUSTRIES
8.01      The livestock and agriculture   credit program has provided funds
for subloans to agroindustries, as well as to farms and ranches, since its
initiation. During the first loan, 15% of the funds disbursed went to this
category. However, during the second project the proportion going to agro-
industries fell to 3% (as the second project disbursed more than twice as
many funds in approximately half the time period, the amount of funds dis-
bursed annually remained about the same). The Bank was concerned with the
relative decline in this category, as it considered that there was a need in
Mexico for development of the agroindustrial sector. Moreover, agroindustrial
loans were being financed through other credit programs. These other credit
programs were being promoted more aggressively, and enjoyed slightly better
terms than those which the Bank had agreed with the Bank of Mexico that FIRA
would offer. The Bank felt that agroindustrial lending should be coordinated
through FIRA and prevailed on the Government to alter the terms offered by
the competing credit programs so that they would not be more attractive than
FIRA's. The Bank then put considerable pressure on FIRA to increase its
capacity to evaluate agroindustry loans, both by improving the quality of
its in-house staff assigned to this activity and by increasing the utiliza-
tion of outside consultants. Although FIRA agreed, the improvements
requested were some time in coming. After considerable correspondence, a
number of FIRA staff were sent abroad to attend training courses, of
different type and duration, and additional staff positions began to be
created. The longer-run result seems now to have been quite satisfactory.
8.02      FIRA made 232 loans to 205 agroindustries during the first two
projects. During the third project it made 93 loans to agroindustries, some
of which were repeater loans. We do not have data on the number of new
industries, as opposed to loans, which were assisted. Project three ended
in February 1974 and FIRA has reported that it made a total of 211 loans to
agroindustries during 1974. It appears from the above data,therefore, that
FIRA made approximately 40 agroindustrial subloans per year through the
first three programs, but this rate accelerated in 1974 to about four times
this level. FIRA continued to lend actively in this category during the
fourth project. The fifth has only recently begun.
8.03      FIRA now has a technician in each of its regional offices trained
to evaluate agroindustry loans, in addition to a larger back-up staff in
its central office. The quality of these technicians has improved con-
siderably in recent years, although increased training in engineering,
economics, and marketing is still needed. The selection of industries is
a difficult task and we feel that considerable analytical work is yet to
be done on this issue in Mexico. FIRA's technicians are now charged with
the preparation of background studies on prospective industries, in which
they analyze both the economic and social need for such an industry in the
region, but more detailed and sophisticated evaluation is needed.



- 43 -
8.04      The 1972 consultant, in his evaluation of the first and second
projects, took a sample of 54 enterprises, comprising 26% of the 205
enterprises assisted in these projects. The firms sampled covered 13 of
the 15 industrial groupings used by FIRA to categorize its agroindustrial
loans. The variation among the firms sampled is very great, in practically
every dimension. Some of the firms existed before the FIRA loan was
granted, others were initiated along with the loan. Some firms operated
on a profit basis, others were non-profit. Some serviced a large number
of agricultural producers, others bought from only 1 to 3 sellers. And so
forth. The information collected, however, do niot permit judgements
regarding a number of the more important issues. For example, no informa-
tion was solicited regarding the impact of the creation or expansion of
these industries on the prices paid to producers for their output, although
the creation or improvement of regional markets was one of the principal
justifications for entering this area of lending. Nor was data obtained
regarding the impact of the investments on other industries in the region,
whether complementary or rival. Finally, given the shortness of the
period since the initial subloan, no information on the actual expected
rates of return of these industries could be calculated, nor are data now
available to permit this.
8.05      Despite these deficiencies, a number of interesting findings are
evident in the 1972 sample. One of the most striking results was the
discovery that 70% of the enterprise receiving subloans had not existed
prior to the granting of the subloan. It is clear that FIRA's efforts, and
credit, were important in the initiation of a number of new enterprises.
There is no data, however, to determine the principal justification of the
industry. In some cases new industries were established (or existing
industries expanded) to process existing supplies of raw materials. In
other cases they stimulated the regional production of products which
previously had not had a market. In yet other cases, existing industries
were too small, or utilized inefficient technology, or exercised monopsony
power over the producers. The Bank has urged FIRA to consider factors such
as these in taking decisions regarding the granting of subloans, but we
believe that adequate information has not been collected, and that an
adequate methodology for so doing has not yet been developed in FIRA.
8.06      The average annual sales of the 40 firms in the 1972 sample for
which data were available on this item was US$1.25 million. The average
number of agricultural producers who sold their output to the 16 firms
which reported such data was 130 per firm, on average, but with a standard
deviation of 211. The average increase, per firm, in the number of pro-
ducers served in the post-loan situation was 107%. The workers employed per
firm averaged 17 pre,-development (standard deviation 26) and 26 post-
development (standard deviation 38). The incremental investmient per new
job created was US$26,000 for the pre-existing firms and US$6,000 for the
new firms. The data suggest sufficient variation between the number of



- 44 -
producers served by different industries, and the amount of incremental
employment generated per peso invested, that these criteria also might
be incorporated into the pre-loan analysis of proposed investments.
8.07      No evaluation of agroindustrial loans has been made for the
third project as yet. Although the OED audit mission visited a number of
agroindustries which had been financed, and discussed the program with
members of FIRA's staff, managers of the agroindustries, and with producers
who sold to these industries, OED has no detailed, systematic data on hand
to allow a comprehensive evaluation. This is a complex issue and we
believe, given its economic importance in Mexico and the quantity of funds
allocated, that additional study would be useful.

IX. OTHER ISSUES
A. Institutional Development
9.01      The third Mexican livestock and agricultural credit loan continued
lending to commercial producers along lines closely similar to those begun
in the first two projects. Lending was expanded only slightly in terms of
the amount of funds and the number of borrowers expected to be assisted,
but considerable emphasis was placed on making credit available in new
geographic regions, and on improving FIRA's organizational structure.
9.02      First, to increase the effectiveness not only of farm technical
services, but also of lending and promotional activities, FIRA agreed to
establish at least five more regional offices similar to the regional
office established in Villahermosa, Tabasco during the second project in
keeping with the regional subproject on livestock development which was
then initiated. These additional regional offices were to be staffed with
senior technicians capable of supervising the evaluation of on-farm
investment plans in their region without remanding these to the central
office. It was expected that this decentralization would allow FIRA's
staff to become more intimately familiar with the characteristics of the
regions in which it was working, and ultimately to initiate a number of
studies of specific development projects within these regions. These
regional offices were to be established within six months of loan effective-
ness. FIRA also promised to develop a separate project evaluation manual
for each of the regional offices to assist the evaluation of on-farm
investments.
9.03      FIRA complied with this agreement.   By late 1976 it had 7 regional
offices, 36 state offices (subordinate to the regional offices), and 79
agencies (subordinate to the state agencies). Its field staff work out of
these offices, assisted by the central office in the Federal District. In
addition to decentralizing the physical location of its offices and staff,
FIRA has increasingly decentralized its operational procedures, allowing its
field technicians to approve on-farm development loans of larger amounts,
and delegating this same authority to FIRA-trained or approved technicians
working for the private and official banks. The Bank has continued to
encourage FIRA to give its regional and local offices greater authority,
and to upgrade its staff to exercise this. Good success has been achieved.'/
1/ Many of FIRA's technical staff are young, having completed their
academic training within the last five years. Few have yet become
highly specialized. As a rule, they appear intelligent, responsible,
and motivated, but they require experience and many will benefit from
additional formal education. Large strides have been made in upgrading
FIRA's staff during the last 10 years, and this work should be continued.



- 46 -
9.04      Second, being concerned with the relative slowdown in lending to
the agroindustrial sector during the second project, which the Bank attri-
buted largely to the technical weakness of FIRA's staff in this area, the
Bank required that FIRA employ, in consultation with the Bank, an experienced
agroindustry expert. This expert was to monitor agroindustry investments
made under the first two projects as well as oversee the evaluation of
prospective new investments. FIRA made efforts to employ an agroindustry
specialist, but without success. It finally requested that, in lieu of
employing such a specialist, it be permitted to send one of its existing
agroindustry technicians for further training outside of Mexico. It felt
it would be impossible to hire a competent agroindustrial expert from
private industry, given that its own salary scale at this level was not
competitive. The Bank agreed. Despite continuous pressure from the Bank,
however, FIRA was still negotiating with Harvard Business School in late
1973 about the possibility of having one of FIRA's staff members accepted
there for training. At that time, the Bank agreed that FIRA would employ a
Bank-approved consultant for a six months period to assist in the evaluation
of agroindustry credit proposals. Since that time, however, FIRA has sent
three of its technicians abroad for graduate work relating to the agro-
industry area, upgraded other of its technicians in this field, and its
lending has picked up noticeably.
9.05      Third, as mentioned earlier, the Bank insisted that FIRA contract
a consultant to assist it in conducting a statistical analysis of the on-
farm impact of the lending under the first two projects and also in estab-
lishing a permanent monitoring system of program borrowers. The Bank had
already encouraged FIRA to undertake an evaluation of project impact, but
FIRA's efforts had not resulted in a satisfactory report. It seems wise to
us that the Bank included this condition. The Mexican livestock and agri-
culture credit program was very large, in terms of borrowers and funds
disbursed, and diverse in terms of the regions and activities which it
covered. Neither the Bank nor FIRA had sufficient information to determine
whether the project was in fact achieving its aims in terms of production
increases, or how it might be altered to become more effective. FIRA
agreed, under pressure from the Bank, but was not eager to devote the funds
and staff necessary to this undertaking which it appears to have felt
esoteric and perhaps impossible to implement. It also ceems important to
us that the Bank chose to have FIRA conduct the evaluation itself, rather
than directing the Bank's own staff members to assist FIRA in this task.
On the one hand, the decision reflected the fact that the Bank did not have
staff freely available for such a long assignment. On the other hand, the
Bank hoped that a consultant would be able to work more closely with FIRA
in instituting the monitoring system which was to come later.- Bank staff
assisted in the effort at various times.
9.06      After its initial hesitation, FIRA has become more enthusiastic
regarding the monitoring system, largely because, through the monitoring
system, FIRA expects to have more demonstrable proof of the fruits of its



- 47 -
efforts. The monitoring system is expected to show the impact of various
agricultural policies on the income and welfare of producers throughout the
country, and accordingly, would offer FIRA an opportunity to speak more
forcefully on policy issues within the agricultural sector. There is, to
our knowledge, no other Government agency working on the same type of
information collecting system. Although an argument could be made that
this effort would be better situated in a different agency, such as the
Secretary of Agriculture and Livestock, we believe that the monitoring
system is most likely to work at FIRA.
9.07      The establishment of a monitoring system in Mexico has been and
probably will continue to be quite difficult. Few producers in Mexico,
even at the commercial level, maintain a system of farm records and few
have been willing and able, without continuing intensive technical
assistance, to implement such a system even once it had been designed and
carefully explained. FIRA is now attempting to monitor the development of
a much larger sample of producers than that covered for the third project,
and to obtain more detailed data from them. We understand that this effort
encountered severe early difficulties in convincing producers to record the
detail regarding current transactions which was requested. Accordingly,
data often had to be provided by estimation, or from memory, with direct
intervention by FIRA technicians who have called on the producer regularly
to collect the transaction records. The 1972 consultant, who is continuing
to assist FIRA in this area, believes that the monitoring system is over-
coming these problems and he is optimistic about the outcome.
9.08      Given the difficulties inherent in the establishment of a monitoring
system, and the importance of livestock and agricultural credit in many
countries to which the Bank lends, it might be wise for the Bank to establish
a group which could more systematically work with the lending agencies to
implement the monitoring systems desired. Further, if the monitoring system
is to be a success, the information which it produces must be returned to
the producer in a form which is intelligible and useful in managing the farm
enterprise, and the information must be placed within the macrocontext of
Mexican agriculture so that Government understands how different policies
are affecting the profitability of investments, and thereby the demand for
credit, new technologies and new management techniques. FIRA has not yet
developed a system to return the farm records to the producers, in a format
permitting analysis of operations, nor has it encouraged producers to meet
to discuss their progress with technicians. Were this to be done, additional
producers might find it worthwhile to maintain farm records and to partici-
pate in the monitoring system. However, additional staff time, and more
intensive staff time, would be required with the producers involved, and
such efforts would be costly for FIRA. FIRA also has devoted relatively
little effort to analyzing the policy implications of its monitoring system,
either in terms of how its own operations ought to be changed to obtain
greater efficiency and productivity, or how national policies ought to be
changed to make credit and technical assistance more effective. The
monitoring system has been perceived as a means to demonstrate the benefits
of FIRA's lending rather than an analytical instrument to help improve policy.



- 48 -
9.09      FIRA has continued to upgrade its planning division.   Subloans
have been computerized and much basic data are easily accessible. The
control of operations is apparently tight, and projections are made for
future credit demand. This division has also assumed much of the burden
of preparing the background information which is incorporated into Bank
appraisal reports. The division was originally responsible for carrying
out the project impact evaluations, and for establishing the monitoring
system. The latter responsibility was shifted to an independent division
in 1975.
9.10      Most of FIRA's staff are well qualified in terms of formal
training, at the university level, but few staff have received specialized
training. A number of students have been sent for additional education, but
most do not appear yet to have returned to work for FIRA. In 1974, for
example, FIRA had three students studying toward the doctorate in tropical
fruit production, planning and economic development, and in pasture manage-
ment, and nine students studying toward the master's degree in animal
sciences, agriculture extension (2), administration of agroindustries,
agricultural economics (2), food technology, temperate fruit production, and
animal nutrition. The doctoral students and three of the master's students
were studying abroad. FIRA also has developed special courses taken by its
own technicians to upgrade their skills. The courses offered are quite
extensive. And all new technicians receive six months of instruction at
the time of their employment. Nonetheless, as shown in table a24, the number
of employees with post-graduate degrees actually declined from 1970 to 1974.
In 1974, FIRA employed no doctorates on its staff, and only 21 individuals
with masters degrees, out of a total technical staff of 604. Given the
specialized technical decisions which FIRA is required to take, we believe
it strongly needs additional skilled staff.
9.11      Towards the end of the third project, in late 1973, FIRA's third
trust fund, FEGA, was established to provide partial guarantees for subloans
made by private banks to low income producers; to provide subsidies for
technical assistance given to low income producers by FIRA technicians and
by technicians of the participating banks, both public and private; and to
intensify FIRA's efforts in organizing low income producers and providing
them training. This effort marked a substantial expansion of FIRA's
institutional system. This expansion was fundamentally oriented at giving
assistance to low income producers, which the Bank supported in the fourth
livestock and agriculture   credit loan, and we shall say no more about it
in this report.
B. Technical Assistance
9.12      When FIRA was established, its first trust fund, the FONDO, was
designed as a rediscount agency which would improve the financial incentives
to private banks for lending development credits to the agricultural sector.
It might have been expected that a rediscount agency would have little direct



- 49 -
contact with the final borrower, as this contact would instead take place
between the borrower and the commercial bank. However, FIRA had substan-
tial direct contact with the final borrowers from its initiation. Extension
services in Mexico have traditionally been very weak. They have been con-
centrated in irrigated areas of commercial farming, to the neglect of
temperate and tropical areas, on the one hand, and of smaller producers, on
the other hand, but they were badly inadequate in almost all areas.
Different federal and state agencies have been jointly responsible for
providing technical assistance, but a low level of priority has led to a
severe lack of funding, low salaries, poorly trained, insufficient, and
underequipped staff, and an inability to service the vast majority of
Mexican producers.
9.13      Due to lack of qualified technical staff among the participating
banks, both private and public, and the lack of a functioning national
extension service, FIRA was forced to develop its own field staff to
evaluate individual farm and ranch development plans. It was also hoped by
the Bank that this staff would provide borrowers with continuing technical
assistance to improve managerial practices and reap added benefits of the
on-farm investments being made. In fact, while FIRA seems to have done an
excellent job of evaluating applications for on-farm loans, it has not been
able to fill the need among producers for help in resolving the regular
technical and managerial problems associated with the modernization of the
livestock and agriculture sector. This is not to say that FIRA has been
insensitive or unaware of these problems, or that it has done less than
other agencies in this respect. To the contrary. There simply are insuf-
ficient resources to the task.
9.14      It is important to separate the discussion of technical assistance
into two periods and into two programs. For example, FIRA provided less
continuing technical assistance of the post-loan type during the first three
loans than it has during the last two Bank loans. The change is due to the
fact that such technical assistance was deemed less essential to determining
the absolute success or failure in the case of loans made to commercial
producers than in the case of loans made to low-income producers. In the
former case it appears that additional technical assistance might have
increased the productivity of investments made, but these investments already
exceeded the market rate of interest in profitability. In the latter case,
without intensive technical assistance, first to organize producers in
operating groups and second to advise them with regard to operating problems,
the loans would not have been made and, once made, would probably have
failed. This judgement may be too harsh for some subloans, but we believe
it is accurate in most cases. The technical assistance provided by FIRA
has begun to change significantly during the last two and one-half years
in response to the increased volume of lending to low income producers, and
by the emphasis which President Echeverria's administration placed on
increased technical assistance to the agricultural sector. FIRA is now
providing more, and more intensive, technical assistance to low income
producers than it has provided to commercial producers.



- 50 -
9.15      Another important factor is that FIRA substantially improved and
expanded its staff and organization system during the last 10 years and now
has the capability to provide more technical assistance than it did before.
FIRA is always under pressure, however, in allocating resources, to decide
between making additional loans and using the same personnel for providing
additional technical assistance. The pressures for increased lending have
usually been greater.
9.16      During the first three projects, the technical assistance efforts
of FIRA were focused on the promotion of credit programs rather than new
technologies or managerial improvement. This is evident in the breakdown
of project lending, where most funds went for the purchase of livestock.
FIRA's technicians spent much of their time informing producers about the
availability and terms of credit, a lesser amount of time discussing the
types of modernization which they could achieve with investments supported
by project subloans, and a considerable effort in evaluating farm and ranch
development plans. All of these tasks have been very important. Mexican
livestock and agricultural producers were frequently not aware that this
type of credit was available (although among commercial producers it
appears that many project borrowers did have alternative sources of credit),
and also needed assistance in preparing a development program which would be
technically and financially sound.
9.17      FIRA staff usually made one to two visits to the farm or ranch of
a commercial producer to discuss with him the possible investments which
appeared to make the most economic sense given his current operations and
interests. If an investment program appeared feasible, a loan application
was prepared, including a general layout of the investments,a time-table
for implementation, and financial projections for costs and sales. FIRA
then directed the producer to one or more banks which it believed might be
interested in lending for the project (assuming that the producer was not
already in contact with a participating bank) and, after approval by all
parties, the FIRA technician usually returned once to visit the farm or
ranch to see that the funds borrowed were used as designated, that the
installations had been made correctly, and that they were being utilized
correctly. If the project was not in order, an effort was made to explain
to the producer what he was doing wrong, and its consequences, and to get
him to alter his practices. Rarely, however, was there time to return to a
ranch more than once a year, and sometimes only once after the loan was made.
Producers could obtain additional assistance by taking a repeater loan,
bringing themselves in contact with FIRA staff again. However, some farmers
have learned that they can obtain assistance simply by requesting information
from a FIRA technician. FIRA technicians do not have time to schedule regular
visits with all borrowers, but it is our impression that they are willing to
assist borrowers who ask for help in resolving specific issues. The initia-
tive must come from the producer.
9.18      It is readily apparent from comparing the number of technical
field staff with the number of loans approved (and noting that one or two



- 51 -
days of visits, plus several days of paperwork, are required for each
loan) that FIRA's staff is not physically able to visit each new borrower
repeatedly, let alone maintain a close relationship with most borrowers
from previous years. During the third project, for example, FIRA had
approximately 450 technicians, 400 of whom worked in the field (some worked
in administrative positions in the central office). It made, in 1973, about
6,000 development subloans to commercial producers, assisted by Bank funds.
Assuming that 400 technicians made 6,000 subloans, each staff technician
would have been responsible for 15 new development loans. If the term of
the loans averages six years, a technician would have 90 loans to supervise
at any point in time. Assuming that he spends a total of five working days
on each new loan, he would have less than two days a year to spend on each
of the additional loans. Other activities associated with the general
promotion of credit, his own training, organizational work within FIRA, Bank
missions, etc., also require his time. Moreover, FIRA is responsible for
other loans and programs in addition to those of the Bank's, so its tech-
nicians are not fully dedicated to the program for commercial producers.
As shown in tables a23 and a25, FIRA's loans went to a total of 46,636
borrowers in 1973. Some of these borrowers took joint loans (we do not
have data on the number of separate loans) and some of the loans were
short term, thereby requiring less attention from FIRA's technicians than
do the longer term development loans. Regardless, the number of new loans
made each year, per technician, is very high, and it is rising.
9.19      There is a need for significantly expanded and more intensive
technical assistance in Mexico. FIRA has introduced a number of innovations
quite important to this effort. FIRA has encouraged the participating banks
to form their own technical staffs to undertake the promotion of agricultural
loans, to prepare loan development plans, and to provide continuing technical
assistance afterwards. FIRA has trained the participating bank technicians
in its methodology approach to ensure that the work is done as FIRA wants
it done, but such training has focused on project evaluation (ex ante), not
continuing technical assistance after the loan. Further, unless a subsidy
is received, the amount of total staff time which a banking institution is
willing to invest will be limited by the amount required to ensure that
the borrower obtains a satisfactory return and, more importantly, is able
to repay. The participating bank has no strong incentive to help the pro-
ducer adopt new technologies and further increase his own profits if, in
doing so, the participating bank merely occupies its own scarce resources
and thereby makes fewer loans and lower profits. Official banks can follow
a policy of providing additional assistance if the Government is willing to
cover the deficit on operations which must result.
9.20      If loan evaluations were taken over by the participating banks,
FIRA expects that its own technicians would be freer to provide more
specialized technical assistance, both to help borrowers directly and to
provide backup assistance to participating bank technicians. However, when



- 52 -
FIRA announced a policy change in 1975 that it would cease to evaluate loans
larger than M$250,000 pesos, leaving them to the responsibility of the
participating banks, discounting with FIRA by the private banks fell rather
sharply in some areas until FIRA decided to initiate the evaluation of sub-
loans by its own staff again. This indicates, we fear, that the private
banks have not yet found lending in the agricultural sector sufficiently
attractive to make it self-sustaining on the existing terms.
9.21      Fortunately, as part of the increased emphasis being put on the
expansion of the agricultural sector during the last three or four years by
the Government, the organized extension services provided by the Secretary
of Agriculture and Livestock (SAG), the Secretary of Hydraulic Resources
(SRE), the state governments, and public agricultural banks have all
expanded considerably. SAG staff alone rose from 367 extensionists in 1970
to 3,227 in 1975, and efforts have been made to improve the training,
organization, and mobility of these staff. The public agricultural banks
increased the technicians they employed to about 1,800 in 1975. Thus, FIRA's
staff, while growing in numbers, is shrinking as a proportion of total agri-
cultural technicians. However, even if allowance is made for farmers who
are not likely to be potential candidates for extension assistance, there is
need to greatly expand the scope and the quality of extension services in
Mexico - by all the agencies involved. FIRA appears to us to offer a
higher level of training and organization than these other agencies have yet
achieved.
9.22      FIRA has also developed a number of centers for applied agricultural
research and for the demonstration of proven techniques to producers.
Mexico's research system for crops, and especially for livestock, remains
weak. An effort has been initiated by the government in the last three
years to strengthen the research system. However, FIRA, motivated by fre-
quent encouragement from Bank staff, recognized the high payoff to relatively
simple applied research some years ago and has for a number of years sought
to establish centers which, operated as actual production units with
installations identical to those proposed for normal producers, and
utilizing the same amount and type of labor available to the latter, can
serve as combination research-demonstration centers. Most producers in
Mexico are not accustomed to seek out information regarding production
problems, nor to accept information which comes to them through the abstract
written or spoken word. Visual demonstrations of new installations or
managerial techniques can be comprehended more quickly, and are more con-
vincing. Many producers can visit the demonstration farms in a relatively
short time, and are sometimes given specific courses, and they can return
to observe and ask questions later if problems in their own farms arise.
FIRA has concentrated its efforts on beef and dairy production, Ehe area in
which the majority of its own lending has been placed, and an area in which
Mexico's research and extension system has been particularly weak. The
successes achieved in the dairy cattle area are judged by Bank staff to be
particularly notable. Thus, FIRA, a rediscount agency, has moved into tech-
nical assistance, research, demonstration and farmer training, attempting to
provide components which are needed to make lending viable, and which have
generally been lacking in Mexico.



- 53 -
9.23      The linking of credit and technical-assistance through FIRA was
an innovative move necessary to encourage the development of Mexican live-
stock and agriculture. However, FIRA is not able to provide technical
assistance to all producers, nor is it likely to want to do so. The role
currently played by FIRA may change with time, and a number of its functions
related to technical assistance, research and demonstrations may some day be
taken over by other institutions. At the moment other institutions do not
seem to have the institutional structure and directions which this would
require. We see no reason, accordingly, to discourage FIRA in these
endeavors. However, the Bank must be increasingly aware that a dynamic
agricultural sector will require much more research and technical assistance
than FIRA can provide, and an increased emphasis on these needs in future
Bank projects, and on building the bases to fill these needs, may be desirable
C. Basic Research
9.24      Despite the international reputation for the successful breeding
of hybrid maize and wheat strains, the contribution of agricultural research
in Mexico has been deficient. It has concentrated on the needs of commercial
farmers in irrigated areas and has neglected both the area of rainfed cul-
tivation, in -which the bulk of Mexican farmers live, and the problems of
those relatively unexploited tropical areas whose development will be
essential for future growth. The livestock and agricultural research system
has traditionally received insufficient funds to mount a large scale program,
both in terms of staff, equipment, and investigation, and its research,
when complete, has not been sufficiently tied to extension so as to achieve
rapid diffusion. The resources allocated to livestock and agricultural
research have been increased since 1972, permitting an increase in staff and
an improvement in its quality. There is further need to strengthen the
research effort, integrate individual research findings into technological
packages which can be utilized by producers, and increase the interaction
with the extension service. The research system for agriculture is stronger
than that for livestock.
9.25      The Bank has not been as active in its lending support to agri-
cultural research as in other areas, although the Bank has continued to
point out that the agricultural and livestock research systems are defi-
cient. Bank staff feel that the Government has been lukewarm to sugges-
tions for an agricultural services project which would provide assistance
for such needs. However, we believe that the Bank might further examine
the amount of direct support and encouragement which it could give to com-
plement the Mexican livestock and agriculture credit project. Additional
research findings may be necessary component if the project is to have the
impact which the Bank has expected. An improvement in the specificity of
the technological packages available would make technical assistance more
beneficial, but we are pointing here more toward an investment in basic
research. The latter is unlikely to have an immediate impact, but when a
project is expected to continue for a decade or more, a longer term view
probably should ensure that new technologies will be available.

D. Substitution
9.26      The Bank is concerned with the issue of substitution, i.e., the
degree to which lending supported by the Bank substituted for funds from
different sources which would otherwise have gone to the same producers,
with only marginally different results. The Bank is concerned with substi-
tution because it wishes to know whether its lending programs are in fact
having an impact which is measurable through the physical development
specifically linked to such loans. If project loans merely substitute for
other credits which would have been forthcoming, such a linkage is not
possible. The Bank would have to determine instead where, within the
financial and economic systems, the additional funds provided by Bank
assistance are being utilized.
9.27      The evidence on substitution within the context of the Bank-
supported agricultural subloans in Mexico is incomplete, but a number of
pieces of information suggest that substitution has been substantial,
particularly in the early stages of the program when subloans went over-
whelmingly to commercial producers who already had at least some access to
institutionalized credit.
9.28      OED, in its study of the Bank's agricultural credit program in
Mexico, determined through questionnaires that the 243 borrowers in its
sample, before borrowing project funds: (1) had had access to credit and/or
had had available own funds for investments, (2) continued to borrow or
utilize funds from these alternative sources despite their project
borrowings, and (3) expected to continue borrowing from other sources. OED
estimated that as much as 40% of the funds lent by FIRA represented
substitution of other funds.
9.29      We believe this judgement is likely to be accurate, although several
aspects of the substitution issue remain to be discussed. First, as credit
from the Bank's livestock and agriculture credit program first became
available, e.g., projects one and two, it flowed to those producers who had
the best opportunities for investment, many of whom were already utilizers
of credit. Because FIRA was still lending to a small proportion of the
commercial producers during the third project (4-7%), it is almost certain
that some substitution was going on.I/ Unfortunately, we have almost no
1/ There are about 3 million individuals classified as farmers and ranchers
in Mexico, of which .3 million are commercial producers. By the beginning
of the third loan, FIRA had made 17,000 development subloans to commercial
producers within the Bank-supported credit program. Assuming that one-
third of these were repeater loans, approximately 12,000 commercial pro-
ducers would have been assisted at this time. The cumulative number of
project subloans had risen to about 29,000 commercial producers by the end
of the third loan, or perhaps 20,000 individual producers. As of 1973,
FIRA was making about 6,000 development subloans annually to commercial
producers by which it would have been adding about 4,000 commercial--
farmers to its system each year.



- 55 -
information on where the funds for which substitution may have occurred
ended up within the financial and economic system.   However, as FIRA's
lending increases in magnitude, it is increasingly likely to lend to
producers who have not previously been recipients of commercial credit.
9.30      Second, the poorer are the borrowers, the less likely that they
previously had access to credit. In the fourth program, FIRA's lending
expanded to include increasing numbers of low income producers. We feel
that substitution by these producers must have been considerably lower,
although we have no data by which to calculate the specific amount remaining.
Because roughly half the funds included in the fourth and fifth loans are
still directed to commercial producers, the issue of substitution nonetheless
remains important.
9.31      Third, as FIRA has matured, it also has ventured into new geographic
areas, and begun, in a number of cases, new agricultural activities. In
encouraging new agricultural activities, there is much less reason to expect
substitution. The activities were not traditional, and past sources of
finance may not have been feasible for the new activities. Similarly, where
regions have been literally opened up during the last 10 years, as is the
case with cattle development in much of southeastern Mexico, the available
credit was smaller before FIRA's arrival.
E. Loan Arrears
9.32      FIRA has collected all rediscounts granted to the participating
banks at maturity. Thus, it has no problem of arrears. The overdue
subloans of private participating banks were reported in 1974 as being about
5.5%, with 4% overdue more than six months. The respective figures for the
Banco Agropecuario, the only public bank participating in the third project,
were 7.2% and 4.1%.
F. Procurement
9.33      All procurement by individual sub-borrowers was expected to take
place through normal commercial channels in Mexico. The small size of
individual purchases and contracts, the great variety of goods to be
procured, the phasing of loans to sub-borrowers and their investments, and
the need for standardization, especially in the expansion of agroindustries,
was felt to render the bulking of procurement and international tendering
impractical. The Bank felt that there was, within Mexico, an adequate
selection among local and international suppliers of machinery, equipment
and tractors. Import permits were not granted for machinery, tractors,
and equipment of the sizes and types manufactured in Mexico, but assurance
from the government was obtained that, where not locally manufactured,
import permits would be promptly granted upon recommendation from FIRA.
Breeding stock, mostly female dairy cattle, were to be imported by individual
farmers through normal commercial channels. FIRA agreed to encourage sub-
borrowers to obtain quotations from at least three sources of supply, but it
was expected that most purchases would be from the US or Canada. In
general, the system adopted seems to have worked well.

X. BANK PERFORMANCE
10.01     The appraisal mission for the third project concentrated its
efforts on several issues concerning FIRA's institutional growth and on
the preparation of a series of on-farm investment models. The analysis of
developments in Mexico's livestock and agricultural sectors, and how these
affected the proposed project, is rather superficial, at least insofar as
covered in the loan documents. Although substantial work was being done
by the Bank with the Government on Mexican sector analysis in the 1960s,
little of this comes through in the project documents. Given the amount
of funds devoted to the livestock and agriculture credit program, and the
fact that the agricultural sector had been stagnating - with serious con-
sequences for the Mexican economy - for five years at the time of the
appraisal mission, it seems surprising that more emphasis was not placed on
these issues.
10.02     In preparing the appraisal report for the third loan, the appraisal
mission, with considerable assistance from FIRA staff, constructed a series
of models to demonstrate the types of investment which were expected on farms
and ranches as a result of the receipt of project subloans, and to show the
physical, financial and economic impact of such investments.   It was    -
expected that on-farm investments would be accompanied by certain managerial
improvements, brought about when necessary by technical assistance to the
producer. Given the great diversity of the regions and types of farms and
ranches to which subloans were expected, a large number of detailed models
were prepared. In this respect, the third appraisal report provides
substantially more information than any of the other project appraisal      1/
reports. Indeed, few of the Bank's appraisal reports contain such detail.-
10.03     Estimates, for each of six different regions, were prepared for
the total investments expected in beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs, poultry,
annual crops and perennial crops. Following these estimates, which summed
to the total on-farm investments expected in the project, models were
developed to yield physical and financial projections: 11 models for live-
stock farming and ranching (4 beef cattle ranch models for 4 different
regions, 3 dairy cattle farms for 3 different regions, 2 pig farms for 2
different regions, and 1 egg and 1 broiler farm); 14 models for crop
farming (7 models for annual crops in 6 different regions and 7 models for
perennial crops in 6 different regions); and finaljly 14 distinct models for
the principal types of agroindustries to which FIRA expected to lend.
1/ This appraisal report's large set of models has been subjected to both
approval and criticism within the Bank. The criticism, some from
persons who had been engaged in the appraisal exercise, has alleged that
the number of models was excessive.



- 57 -
10.04     The rate of return for each of the enterprise subcomponents (e.g.,
livestock, annual crops, etc.) was constructed as a weighted average of the
rate of return expected in different regions for that enterprise. The
rates of return by enterprises were then weighted and summed to obtain a
weighted average rate of return for the project as a whole. In this sense,
the appraisal report provided precisely the information which has been
sought by Bank management. As it has turned out, however, the most
important use of the models was not to provide an indication of the rates
of return, but to give a framework of reference for lending activities to
FIRA's technicians. The models were constructed at a time when FIRA was
expanding its staff and moving into new geographical areas. Many of its
staff were just learning the techniques of project evaluation. These
investment plans served as the basis for the project evaluation manuals
which FIRA agreed to produce to guide investment planning in the seven
regional offices being created during the third project. It was important
to be able to show the types of investment, the final constellation of
assets after farm development, and the approximate impact expected from the
investments, all varying across regions.
10.05     Unfortunately, the replications of these models, which were
generated in support of each of the subloans, have not been distributed to
borrowers. It is doubtful that many of the borrowers would fully under-
stand the projections, but we believe that such information, accompanied by
an explanation of the methodology and implications by a FIRA or participating
bank technician, would assist the producer in monitoring the impact of his
investments, and seeing beforehand the financial implications of achieving
better or worse results than those which are predicted, particularly as
determined by changes in management practices. The model might also stimulate
the producer to maintain a set of farm records as a means to monitor his
enterprise's progress.
10.06     Bank and FIRA staff feel that the development of the project
models has served as a useful instrument both in stimulating the gathering
and refinement of relevant projection data and in providing useful examples
of model construction for FIRA staff. And indeed, some models were developed
by FIRA which were not formally included in the third appraisal report. It
remains less clear whether the appraisal report models, as originally
generated, were genuinely useful for estimating the rates of return different
investments were expected to achieve, or for identifying and influencing
the types of investments actually made. If not, a more efficient method of
training FIRA's staff in project evaluation might have been devised.
10.07     The supervision missions filed brief reports on the third project.
The focus again was on FIRA's institutional developments, especially the
hiring of the consultant to undertake the impact study and establish the
pilot monitoring system, and on the hiring of the agroindustry expert. It
appeared early in the commitment period that the loan would be fully dis-
bursed well before the closing date which had been established, and credit



- 58 -
disbursements were never a major source of concern. The reports did not
try to place the project within its larger financial context, however, to
examine the trend of overall credit to agriculture, of that provided by
FIRA, of the proportional contribution of private banks, or even of the
contribution of the Bank to FIRA's operations. All were declining.
10.08     The Bank put much of its emphasis during this period on the design
of the fourth loan, which followed two years behind the third. The fourth
loan introduced a separate component for lending to low income producers.
However, more attention to the impact of on-farm lending during the third
project - to changes in productivity, technical assistance, the adoption of
new technologies, and to agricultural research - would have been of great
use in the fourth project as well. Eighty percent of the fourth project
went to commercial producers.
10.09     The supervision missions also did not comment on the macrocontext.
As the supervision missions did not raise issues in that context, the Country
Programs Department did not focus on these insofar as they relate to project
activities. Together this resulted in less informational transfer than we
believe was needed, and a general dearth of information and analysis at the
macro level in direct support of project progress.
10.10     Given the size and complexity of the Mexican livestock and agri-
culture program, we believe that the number of staff hours devoted to it
were too few. Because of other commitments, divisional and departmental
management within the Bank felt unable to allocate more staff to the project.
10.11     In September 1971, the Bank was requested by the Bank of Mexico,
with agreement by FIRA, to consider the inclusion of the Banco Ejidal and
the Banco Agricola in the list of institutions through which Bank funds for
agricultural credit could be channelpd. The reque3t thus arrived after the
third loan had been signed, at the moment in which it became effective. It
was not clear at the time whether the Government of Mexico wished to bring
about substantial institutional change in these two banks, which tradi-
tionally had been considered important political instruments of the Govern-
ment and had been weak in terms of technical staffing, lending and collec-
tions. The Bank felt that the two banks might be appropriate channels for
lending to smaller producers, assuming that they could be upgraded as
technical institutions. Rather than amend the third loan, already in
operation and lacking a specific component for low income producers, the
Bank decided it would be more appropriate to postpone the participation of
the Banco Ejidal and the Banco Agricola until the fourth project, requiring
during the interim that the two banks bring about substantial changes in
their institutional and operating structures. The Government agreed and
a number of important reforms were begun. These banks did then partici-
pate in the fourth credit project.

11   The number of b'orrowers may exceed the number of loans made because some loans are made to more than one
borrower.
2/   The cumulative sum of loans made, by type of loan, is not an accurate indication of the total number of
individuals which have received subloans.     Repeater loans are not separated out.    The 1972 consultant's
survey indicated that approximately 25% of the development subloans in the general program between 1965-71
were repeater loans.    This proportion has doubtlessly risen somewhat in more recent loans.      We have no
data on the proportion of repeaters for short-term working loans, although this should be very high.      Also
note that the numbers given refer to all of FIRA's credit programs, not just those of the Bank.
