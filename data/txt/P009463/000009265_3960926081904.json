         aims to: (a) reduce energy consumption per unit of output in\n            economically and financially viable industrial and power\n            plants, thereby reinforcing the overall industrial sector\n            objectives of higher efficiency and increased\n            competitiveness. It also seeks to (b) promote development of\n            appropriate policies, technologies and institutional\n            framework to further strengthen the country's energy\n            rationalization program. The project consists of two\n            components: (a) a line of credit for financing about 50\n            energy conservation subprojects; and (b) technical\n            assistance for further strengthening of EMU and improving\n            appraisal capability of Agrani Bank for energy conservation subprojects."}, "docdt": "1988-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
