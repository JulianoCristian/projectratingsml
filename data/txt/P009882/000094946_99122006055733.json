{"cdata!": "The outcome of the project is\n            satisfactory, having exceeded the level of activities\n            expected at appraisal, and the benefit analysis from\n            treatments to arable areas, show significant positive\n            impacts on farm incomes. Furthermore, the project was\n            instrumental in promoting vegetative methods of soil, and\n            water conservation. Several key lessons are conveyed by the\n            project, namely, that addressing the communities'\n            priorities proved successful, for, following the Mid-term\n            Review, special attention was given to water supply\n            provision for rural communities, in direct response to the\n            villagers request. And, while considerations for natural\n            breeding centers were geographically correct, the response\n            from villagers proved the contrary, for bulls were lightly\n            used in the area. A degree of flexibility in project design\n            is needed, particularly for participatory projects, for this\n            flexibility, enabled the project to be broadened according\n            to the communities' needs, consequently, achieving a\n            greater community commitment. It is paramount to build, at\n            an early stage of the project, an activity, and/or\n            investment, as a focus of interest for a village community\n            committee to attain success. Consensus build-up in villages\n            implies a consuming process to engineer the social aspects\n            of a project, thus a pre-construction phase is suggested,\n            for full involvement and consultation, and technical\n            assistance should be a condition for negotiations."}, "docdt": "1999-11-03T00:00:00Z"}
