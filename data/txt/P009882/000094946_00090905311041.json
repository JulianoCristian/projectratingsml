audit concurs with the\n            Implementation Completion Report's ratings of both the\n            Integrated Watershed Development (Hills), and (Plains)\n            Projects, assessing satisfactory outcomes, likely\n            sustainability, and substantial institutional development\n            impacts. Regardless of success, lessons drawn from the\n            projects indicate the practicality of watershed, or\n            sub-watershed units, within which to plan, and implement\n            natural resource management projects in rain-fed areas,\n            since collective efforts by the community, focus on\n            improvements in water availability, with immediate impacts\n            on their livelihoods. In addition, these communal efforts,\n            are essential in conveying the sense of ownership by\n            beneficiaries, which should be strengthened by the\n            collaborative partnership between project staff, and\n            beneficiaries. Maybe, this requires a change of perspective,\n            particularly by project staff, to enhance participatory\n            methodologies. It is important to note, that for the various\n            government services departments (soil conservation,\n            forestry, agriculture, and animal husbandry) to be\n            sustainable beyond project completion, the establishment,\n            for instance, of village development committees, with\n            permanent, lasting arrangements with governments, would\n            facilitate incentives in an integrated approach. Similarly,\n            sustainable long-term conservation objectives require the\n            realization of short-term benefits from project interventions."}, "docdt": "2000-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
