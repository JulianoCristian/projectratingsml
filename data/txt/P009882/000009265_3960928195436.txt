MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON THE PROPOSED CREDIT AND LOAN TO INDIA
FOR THE INTEGRATED WATERSHED DEVELOPMENT (HILLS) PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on the proposed Dev4lopment
Credit of SDR 56.8 million (US$ 75.0 million equivalent) and Loan of US$ 13
million to India is submitted for approval. The Credit and Loan would both be
on standard terms, the IDA credit with 35 years maturity and the Bank loan
with 20 years, 5 years grace to help finance an Integrated Watershed
Development (Hills) Project.
2.    Background:  India is the world's second most populous country wizh a
population exceeding 800 million, and growing at an average rate of 2.2% per
year. About 65% of the labor force is employed by the agriculture sector.
Agriculture accounts for about 37% of GDP and 25% of exports. Agriculture
production has increased steadily at an annual rate of about 2.5% from 1971 to
1984, but lower than the GDP annual growth rate of 4.5% over the same period.
Despite these impressive growth rates, there has been only marginal reduction
in the high incidence of poverty and under-employment, especially in the rural
areas. To attain India's long run objective of 6% overall GDP annual growth
and improved incomes in the rural areas, accelerated agricultural growth will
be an essential element, particularly in the rainfed sector which has still a
lot of potential for improvement.  Rainfed farming is receiving increased
attention, because of its importance in food production for about half of the
rural population. A key element of the Government agricultural strategy, as
set forth in the Seventh Five Yea. Plan (1985-90; and tha f.a.,.wvrk paper for
the eighth plan (1990-95) is to stabilize natural resources systems in the
rainfed sector. Investments would be directed towards treatment of
watersheds, with the objective of increasing their capacity for producing food
crops, fodder and fuelwood, and protecting the land from further degradation.
The Bank has previously supported three projects (Cr.1424 and Loans 1897 and
2295) in the watershed areas which have applied an integrated approach for
treating the degraded lands. The Bank has also financed Social Forestry
projects, all geared to protecting the environment and enhancing its
productive capacity. The performance of these projects varied considerably.
In places where alternative methods for soil and moisture conservation were
used, for example the use of vejetative barriers in combination with contour
cultivation, success has been recorded. While this could be a breakthrough in
stabilizing rainfed farming, technology for treating non-arable lands is still
in the initial stage of development.
3.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy to India
is to support policies and investments that will encourage economic growth and
poverty alleviation in a context of macro economic stability. The emphasis is
on efficient resource allocation, increased efficiency in the public sector
and the appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor. An
increasingly important element of the strategy is to promote sustainable
programs, especially in agriculture, that will protect and enhance the natural
resource base. The project clearly fits within this strategy with the
majority of beneficiaries being the rural poor of a relatively neglected,
poorly endowed and degenerating area.
4.    Treating the severely degraded sub-watersheds (clusters of contiguous
forest, non-arable and arable lands falling for the most part, into a common
catchment) will help conserve the basis for survival and the production for
future generations. It will help increase present yields of crops,
horticulture, forest, fodder and livestock and thus benefit poor small



- 2 -
holde.s, landless people and livestock owners.  It will also reduce erosion
damage caused to roads, bridgea and farm land. Bank involvement will heLp
also promote the technical, organizational and institutional adjustments which
are needed for the integrated approach in resourue management. A companion
project in the plains areas is beins prepared.
5.    ProILnt nbWCtivam.  The project aims to slow and, reverse degradation
of the natural environment through the use of appropriate soil and moisture
conservation methods, and thereby improve the production and income from grain
crops, horticulture, fodder, fiber, fuelwood and livestock. It will also
reduce flooding and other devastations caused by the degradation in both the
Project area and adjacent plains. The aim will be to lay the foundation for
sustainable increases in production to keep pace with the population growth.
The project would promote known technologies and verify others, develop
approaches for coordinated interactive planning, and strengthen the management
and use of non-arable lands.
6.    Pr,gept fctriLtion.  The project will provide resources to the
participating states of Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and
Punjab to treat and conserve the resource base of the sub-tropical Shivaliks
and the temperate Karewas in selected sub-watersheds, which include several
micro-watersheds. Funds under the project would also be used to (a) promote
vegetative rainfed farming technologies in the districts implementing the
project, but outside the sub-watershed; (b) treat the upper catchment of the
watersheds in Punjab; (c) involve State Agricultural Universities in carrying
cut on-fa-  appli_cd _ezz . to rafin6t ,&at.er.ata   ua6d in Lnh  bub-watersheds,
and (d) strengthen the capacity of participating states to plan, coordinate,
execute, monitor and evaluate watershed development efforts and enhance the
capacity of village institutions to manage non-arable lands. Project funds
will be used for field operations in treating the arable and non-arable lands,
for civil works, for offices and staff housing, vehicles, equipment and
incremontal staff and other operating costs.  Other project components
include:
a)    Nursery Development -  To ensure that an adequate supply of planting
material is available for treating degraded lands, nurseries for grass,
forage species and for horticulture and tree seedlings would be
established;
b)    Training -  The project would strengthen training facilities at Ballowal
Saunkheri and Ludhiana in Punjab by providing funds for equipment and
training materials and improvements in offices and housing. The
facility at Ballowal Saunkheri would provide training to officials from
participating states in interactive planning, demonstrate treatments for
arable and non-arable lands and would be used as a retreat center for
states to exchange experience in integrated watershed resource
management. The facility at Ludhiana would be used to train officials
from participating states in interpreting aerial photos and imagery and
in using geographic information system for planning purposes.
c)    Technical Assistance -  The project would provide funds for technical
assistance to train and assist participating states in interdisciplinary
and interactive watershed planning and in establishing village
organizations including women groups for sustained management of common
property resources.

7.    Part of the proposed project would be carried out in the state of Jammu
and Kashmir, which includes areas over which India and Pakistan have been in
dispute since 1947. In making the proposed Loan/Credit to India, the Bank
does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the claims of the
parties involved.
8.    Project Costs and Financing.  The total project costs is estimated at
US$ 125.6 million which includes US$ 4.7 million in duties and taxes, and US$
30.1 million in physical and price contingencies. A breakdown of costs and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Procurement categories and
disbursement percentages and projections are shown in Schedule B. A time
table of key processing dates and status of Bank Group operations in India are
attached as Schedule C and D.  A map showing the project area is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed separately.
9.    Actions Agreed.  The project includes several actions relating to
various components on which understandings have been reached with
participating states. Main agreements reached at negotiations are summarized
below:
a)  GOI will appoint consultants not later than December 31, 1990 to
train staff of participating states in interactive planning, assist
them in preparing such initial plans and advise on the formation of
village organization.
b,   Participating states would establish Dam Review Panels in
accordance with Bank's Terms of Reference and standards for the
design and construction of water harvesting tanks would be
acceptable to the Bank/Association.
c)   State Governments would make adequate provisions in their budgets
to cover incremental recurrent costs of implementing agencies
during the life of the project.
d)   Disbursements of loan/credit proceeds to a participating state
would be made after the individual State Government has met the
following conditions:
(i)          establishment of project offices and associated
committees;
(ii)         appointment of Head of the project with qualifications
acceptable to the Bank/Association; and
(iii)        appointment of an independent agency for baseline
surveys and for project evaluation.
e)   Implementation of additional sub-watersheds/additional micro-
watersheds would depend on satisfactory performance of individual
participating states in implementing initial sub-watersheds.
f)  State Governments would cause project and line department staff to
interact with village representatives and agree on the choice of
treatments and on cost and benefit sharing arrangements. Also
State Governments would recover from beneficiaries of sub-watershed
treatments at least 10% of the cost of treatment.

10.   DeaefLL.  The project is designed to help alleviate one of India's
worst envixonmental problems -- watershed degradation. The project would
treat and protect the sub-tropical Shivaliks and the temperate Xarewas areas
from further degradation and in the process would increase the production of
food crops (wheat and maize) by about 224,000 tons, and fuelwood, fodder, and
fiber, all valued at US$ 40.0 million over the project period. It would
create substantial employment opportunities for landless, women and livestock
owners. To make the protection of common property resources sustainable, the
project would introduce interactive planning with beneficiaries through
suitable institutional arrangements to enlist their commitment and
involvement. This will facilitate reaching agreements between implementing
units and beneficiaries in the cost and benefit sharing arrangements.
11.   The economic rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 17%.
Financia] benefits to farmers, the landless and women are adequate to
substantial. The project is also expected to improv^ the environment greatly.
12.   Risks.  The project faces one major risk which is associated with the
scale of operation. Although the technology of vegetative soil and in-situ
moisture conservation has been tried elsewhere in India and was found to be
successful, it has not been replicated in a wide area, as proposed under the
project. It will need to be demonstrated that the technology can still be
sustained. However, with government support, including a provision for mid-
term review, and with built-in safeguards in the project for sustained
management of the common property lands, and retroactive financing up to US$ 3
million, to expedite start-up activities, the project has a good chance of
succeeding.
13.   The reasons for going ahead in the face of these difficulties
underscores the necessity of coming to terms with important problems of
natural resource conservation. An integrated watershed approach promoted
under the project would appear to be best suited to treat these complex
issues. Also, the project represents the next step in an important joint
learning process, and should generate improved awareness both of the problems
and possible solutions.
14.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and Association respectively
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.
