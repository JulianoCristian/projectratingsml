IWDP aims to\n            halt degradation in some 75 sub-watersheds of the Shivaliks,\n            spanning some 200,000 hectares (ha), and to improve their\n            potential for productivity. The sweep of IWDP covers\n            improved cropping practices in the target watersheds, soil\n            and water conservation, drainage line treatments through\n            training and protection of water streams and livestock\n            improvement. It also supports pasture development and the\n            plantation of forests (on both private and community lands)\n            for fuel wood and fodder, and experiments in innovative\n            on-farm activities for soil and water conservation,\n            including organic farming, composting and integrated pest\n            management. The Project sought to encourage onsite water\n            conservation on croplands and community lands in this region\n            which gets an average annual rainfall of 800-1,200 mm."}, "docdt": "2005-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
