This will\n            be done by aiding in the finance of remedial programs in\n            some of the country's most important agro - economic\n            zones.  The main project objective is to slow and reverse\n            degradation of the natural environment through soil and\n            moisture conservation technology.  This will improve\n            production and income from grain crops, horticulture,\n            fodder, fiber, fuelwood and livestock.  It will also reduce\n            flooding caused by degradation.  Known vegetative\n            technologies will be promoted and the management and use of\n            non - arable lands will be strengthened."}, "docdt": "1990-02-07T00:00:00Z"}
