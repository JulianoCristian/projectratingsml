construction of water points in about 50 villages; (e)\n            development of ten livestock development centers for the\n            multiplication and supply to farmers of improved stock,\n            pasture seeds, artificial insemination services and\n            practical pasture and livestock production research studies;\n            the importation of improved cattle, pigs and poultry,
