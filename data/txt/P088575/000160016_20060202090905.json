insurance coverage to targeted low-income groups in order to\n            reduce infant, child, and maternal mortality, and reduce\n            health inequalities between provinces and income levels. The\n            project also aims to meet to change the operational culture\n            of the health care systems by providing a new incentive\n            framework that sets up new payment arrangements and takes a\n            market approach to contracting for health services,\n            promoting operational effectiveness, quality improvements\n            and efficiency. The project should also set the correct\n            incentives for enrollment, monitoring and service delivery.\n            There are two project components. The first strengthens\n            monitoring, evaluation, and the auditing capacity of the\n            Universal Health Insurance Program (PROAUS).
