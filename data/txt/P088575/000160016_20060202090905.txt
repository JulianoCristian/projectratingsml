Project development objective Re$ PAD B.2, TechnicalAnnex 3
The main objective of the proposed project i s to assist the GOE to implement health insurance coverage
to targeted low-income groups who otherwise have no access to health care with the goal o f reducing
infant, child and maternal mortality, as well as reducing the level o f health inequalities between provinces
and income quintiles. The APL would support and ensure the implementation o f PROAUS, extending
health insurance coverage to individuals in income quintiles 1 and 2 over a period o f 8 years or less. I n
the first phase of the APL, PROAUS coverage would be initially extended to 400,000 individuals in
income quintiles 1 and 2 living in the municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil and from the provinces o f
Tunguragua, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Bolivar and Manabi. By the end o f the implementation o f APLl,
 1.4 million people would be covered and served by PROAUS. Extending coverage should be
accompanied by changes in project outcome indicators during the first phase o f the project: measured
decreases in IMR and USMR in enrolled population o f 25 percent from the baseline; 210 percent
decrease in M M R in enrolled populations from the baseline; a 2  5 percent reduction in the ratios o f IMR,
USMR and M M R between income quintiles 1-2 and 4-5 in enrolled areas; and a 2 5 percent reduction in
out-of-pocket health care expenditures o f enrolled population. The project would contribute substantially
to Ecuador’s ability to meet the MDGs for health by 2015.

The project should also meet a secondary but similarly important objective o f changing the operational
culture o f the health care systems. The implementation o f this project should provide a new incentive
framework through new payment arrangements and a regulated market approach to the contracting of
services by the SODEM, promoting operational effectiveness, quality improvements and efficiency. The
project should also set the correct incentives for enrollment, m,onitoring and actual ,delivery o f services.
By the end o f APL Phase 1, contracts including this new incentive framework would be signed with the
municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil, and with providers in at least 5 provinces. Further, the project
should also contribute to the process o f deconcentration in the health sector by transferring responsibility
to contract services from the M O H to the SODEM and to selected municipalities.

Lastly, the project should contribute to strengthening the monitoring, evaluation and audit network of
PROAUS. This would include the strengthening of the Health Management Information Network for
both the SODEM and i t s providers, as well as supporting external financial and technical audit.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country and sector issues

Ecuador's health care market suffers from a number of distortions, in particular the fact that i t i s highly
fragmented, which has led to an inefficient, inequitable, poor quality and largely inaccessible system with
over 70 percent o f the population uninsured. The share o f the population currently covered by
contributory health insurance i s amongst the lowest in L A C and the poorest socio-economic groups have
very little access to health care. More than two-thirds o f the population has no contributory health
insurance, and the Ministry o f Health and other public institutions face severe constraints to provide
                                                       n recent years, there have been several attempts to
healthcare services to nearly half o f the population. I
bring about improvements, but in most cases, those attempts have been partial and their results
insufficient. This proposed Project would serve as an important step in tackling some o f these distortions
by targeting health insurance to poorest and most vulnerable and by setting down the foundations for an
envisioned Universal Health Insurance System.

Due to general trend o f demographic and epidemiological transition factors, some o f Ecuador's health
indicators have improved in recent years unlike trends in other social indicators. Between 1970-2000, life
expectancy increased from 58.8 to 70 years. Infant mortality fell from 30.3 per 1,000 live births in 1990
to 23.3 per 1,000 in 2004 according to official statistics (INEC and MSP). Maternal mortality also
showed a downward trend, falling from 117 deaths per 100,000 births in 1990 to 76.4 per 100,000 in
2004 (INEC and MSP). However, the reliability o f infant and maternal mortality data based on vital
statistics records has been disputed and estimates based on demographic surveys indicate rates that are
significantly higher.'

Although these overall improvements in national health indicators, underlying inequalities in access to
health services and health status remain mainly a consequence o f the high rates o f uninsured and the
heterogeneity of the health care system. Ecuador's demographic, cultural, and social heterogeneity
continues to constitute fertile ground for economic inequality and stark differences in living standards and
health conditions. I n the Amazon region, for example, where there i s clearly a higher concentration o f
indigenous and poor populations, premature deaths are frequent and life expectancy from 1995-2000 was
unchanged at 59.6 years. An estimated 21 percent of the population in Amazon w i l l not survive more than
40 years, whereas at the other extreme, in the province o f Pichincha, life expectancy was almost 15 years
longer (74.5 years), and only 6.8 percent were expected to die before age 40. Similar inequalities can be
seen when life expectancies are compared with household consumption per capita, where the populations
of "poor" provinces have a lower life expectancy than those o f provinces with greater resources.

Despite the efforts of the Government o f Ecuador (GOE) to improve maternal and child health through
the program of the Free Maternity Law (Ley de Mutemidud Grutuitu), maternal and infant mortality rates
also continue to be a serious problem and are indicative o f the continuing poor coverage and access to
health care. Nationally, approximately 20 percent o f pregnancies run their course without prenatal care;
this national average disguises rates as disparate as that between Guayaquil, where 7 percent of mothers
receive no prenatal care, and the Amazon provinces, where 34 percent go without care. I t i s estimated
that approximately 30 percent o f deliveries take place at home, but here again specific rates vary between
5 percent in Guayaquil and Quito, and 50 percent in the Amazonia region (in the provinces o f
Chimborazo, Bolivar, and Cotopaxi the figure i s 60 percent).


' For example, in 2004, the infant mortality rate was estimated at 40 per 1,000 b y the United Nations Population
Division o f the Department o f Economic and Social Affairs, almost twice the official figure, while PAHO estimated
a maternal mortality ratio o f 81 per 100,000 births in the same year.


                                                        1
Ecuador s t i l l has high rates of premature, infant and maternal mortality from preventable causes. A lack
o f access to basic health services, particularly amongst the poor, continues to drive health inequalities and
creates a scenario where life expectancy of those living in the poorest provinces i s on average 15 years
less than those in the richest provinces.

Currently health insurance i s provided through four public social insurance or “quasi-insurance’’ systems,
covering different segments o f i t s 12.8 million people: (i)Seguro Social Obligatorio (SSO) covering 1.3
million, managed by the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS); (   ii)
                                                                              the Seguro SociaE Campesino
(SSC) covering 0.9 million, also managed by IESS; (         iii)the Armed Forces personnel social security
scheme; and (iv) the National Police social security system that covers 0.4 million. Private health
insurance i s available but only used by a small proportion o f the population (0.3 million). Recently, the
government created a health program to finance services to pregnant women and infants (the Ley de
Maternidad Gratuita -Free Maternity Law, LMG). The GOE i s launching Aseguramiento Universal en
Salud (AUS - The Universal Health Insurance initiative) that aims to increase coverage by coordinating
through existing social health insurance schemes, as well as introducing a new nominal publicly
subsidized health insurance-Programa de Aseguramiento Universal en Salud (PR0AUS)-that                  will
extend coverage to those in the first and second income quintiles not otherwise covered b y existing
insurance. PROAUS would finance a set of Guaranteed Services included in the National Health System
Law, for the first and second quintile of the population, which cannot be reached b y other forms o f
insurance, paying providers expenses for those services. In this way, PROAUS would be an important
first step towards a universal health insurance system, which would serve to address key problems o f
efficiency and equality in the system.

                   Expanding Health Coverage to the Poor: Lessons from Colombia

        Colombia expanded health coverage to the poor in much the same way as Ecuador plans, with an overall
         positive experience but some pitfalls should be avoided.
        Prior to 1993, the Colombian health care system was segmented according to social groups in three
         categories - Ministry o f Health, Social Security Institute, private sector - with much o f the population
         without coverage (76%) as it i s currently in Ecuador.
        B y 2000, following radical reforms Colombia was ranked first o f 191 countries by WHO in terms o f
         fairness in financing with health insurance coverage expanding to 54% o f the population.
        The reforms involved the creation o f a new system characterized by universal health insurance coverage
         with cost-sharing on the financing side and pluralistic publiciprivate provision.
        Quintiles 1 and 2 are covered under a subsidized scheme and receive basic benefits.
        Despite i t s successes, some key problems have arisen:
         o A complicated transfer system led to payment delays from the implementing agency and providers;
         o One-third o f the eligible population was not covered because o f a lack o f basic information o f the
              affiliation process;
         o There has been manipulation o f the enrollment system through connections. It has been difficult to
              verify enrollment information. If economic situation o f enrollees improves it i s unlikely they w i l l
              acknowledge this and loose subsidy.



2. Rationale for Bank involvement

The World Bank has been highly active in Ecuador in recent years, maintaining a constant dialogue with
authorities and supporting reform efforts through analytical and lending operations. The Bank’s
involvement in the health sector dates back a number o f years, although the focus has mostly been on
public provision and management o f services, and only marginally on insurance and financing. Over the
past 10 years, the Bank has financed investment programs in the health sector, promoting the reform o f


                                                          2
health care provision mechanisms through two loans: the Strengthening and Expansion o f Basic Health
Services program (“FASBASE”) and the Health Sector Modernization program (“MODERSA”). I                  n
addition, since 2003, the Bank has supported a reform program in welfare services, health, education, and
social security through the Programmatic Human Development Loan, which, among other goals, aims to
integrate and reorganize coverage in health provided by the Free Maternity L a w (LMG), Ecuadorian
Social Security Institute (IESS) and other institutions. Sector studies and analyses have also been
prepared, including Policy Notes on Health (presented to the Government when i t took office in early
2003), a Labor Markets study, a Poverty Assessment, and a Public Expenditure Review. MODERSA has
supported an analysis and design o f health insurance options that established the foundation and backbone
o f the PROAUS.

The discussion presented in the Policy Notes prepared in early 2003 i s still relevant, and
recommendations are applicable and consistent with those included in the World Bank paper “Policy
Options for the Social Insurance System”. The development o f the health insurance program for the poor
would be a key improvement in the health policy framework, and has received full support o f the
Government that considers i t a priority intervention. In this context, the World Bank would be involved
in supporting and implementing all aspects o f the Project and given i t s experience in supporting similar
efforts in other countries, it would also have an important technical role assisting in the design and
development o f PROAUS through knowledge transfer, and contribute to providing stability in the
medium-term to an incipient Project.

The proposed Project i s highly complementary with other World Bank activities in Ecuador, as well as
with the World Bank overall strategy for the social sectors in the country. The Project, b y supporting
interventions aimed at expanding access to primary health care among poor families, would contribute to
the successful completion o f several actions included under the health component o f the policy matrix o f
the Programmatic Human Development Reform Loan I1 currently under preparation. I t would also
provide a complementary supply-side intervention to demand-side policy actions (within the PHDRL I1
and the Results-Based Transfer Project) that seek to increase use of primary health care facilities among
mothers and young children through the Bono de Desarrollo Humano, a conditional cash transfer
program. More broadly the Project i s in line with the World Bank strategy for the social sectors in
Ecuador, which focuses on improving access to and the quality o f social services among poor families.

The current situation in Ecuador provides an excellent window o f opportunity for the Bank to support the
Government in i t s efforts to consolidate and build on sectoral achievements b y addressing health
insurance reform. The development o f PROAUS provides a key opportunity for the Government to
improve health coverage for the poorest and reduce the huge inequity in crucial health indicators.
Proposed Bank support would be provided under an A     PL framework that would support the longer term
implementation o f PROAUS, anticipated to occur in two phases over the next 7 years: phase 1 includes
the initial launching of the health insurance scheme and enrollment o f prioritized populations in quintiles
1 and 2; phase 2 would involve full scale up to cover a larger number o f persons in quintiles 1 and 2 in
more geographic areas subject to quantitative and qualitative progress and evaluation o f the initial phase
with some changes made in accordance to lessons learned.

The implementation o f PROAUS i s a key strategic development for poverty reduction in Ecuador in line
with CAS objectives. The Project would increase the very low level o f health investment, focusing
incremental demand and targeting o f the more vulnerable and the poorest (Indigenous and rural people).
The Project would also contribute to the decentralization o f the health system, and contribute in the
                                                                                                        n
medium term to the financial and political sustainability o f PROAUS over Presidential administrations. I
the first phase, it i s anticipated that service providers would be principally the MOH, SSC and the
municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil. Services may also potentially be delivered b y NGOs, IESS and
other private institutions.

3. Higher level objectives to which the Project contributes

The proposed Project i s a high priority for the current government. The government sees the introduction
o f universal health insurance as an important tool to increase the demand for health services especially by
the poor and for reaching MDG targets. A Presidential Decree in July 2005 (No. 294), led to the
establishment o f the Secretaria Nacional de 10s Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio (SODEM) under
which was included the Consejo Consultivo del Sistema de Aseguramiento Universal en Salud,
reestablished by a Presidential Decree on October 13,2005 (No. 692), and charged with the responsibility
o f defining the regulations and policies o f the universal health insurance system (Aseguramiento
 Universal en Salud, AUS) to be established by a Presidential Decree. I         n December 16, 2005 the
Presidential Decree No. 962 modified the Decree No.294 to include under SODEM the responsibility for
the implementation and administration o f the Universal Health Insurance System including the PROAUS.

Included within the MOH’s action plan for 2005-2007 i s support for the implementation o f AUS and the
strengthening o f M O H capacity to be able to participate in the first phase o f AUS to cover persons in
quintiles 1 and 2. The development of a new health insurance targeting the poor i s also a priority o f the
World Bank as outlined in the policy note that was prepared for the new government when i t took office
in 2003.

The proposed Project operation i s consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Ecuador for the
period of 2003-2007. Poverty reduction and increased access to accountable and efficient government
services for all Ecuadorians are amongst the key goals o f the CAS. The CAS specifically highlighted
analytical and advisory activities related to health insurance paving the way for related lending activities.
Having developed a framework for health insurance targeting the poor under the World Bank funded
MODERSA project, the proposed Health Insurance Project i s therefore the next step in accordance with
the CAS to improving the quantity and quality o f health sector expenditures to better serve the poor.



B. PROJECT D E S C R I P T I O N

1. Lending instrument

The proposed World Bank investment lending for the implementation o f Health Insurance Strategy for the
Poor (HISP) would be carried out through a two-phase adaptable program loan (APL) to be implemented
over a period o f eight years or less. This lending instrument would permit that lessons learned during the
first phase contribute to the following phase as the HISP i s rolled out incrementally in additional
communities and population groups, thereby ensuring program sustainability. The overall national goals
to reduce health inequities such as maternal, infant and child mortality and to improve the financial access
o f the poor to health services would be reached progressively over a period o f up to eight years through a
process of expanding the HISP. Equally important, implementation in phases would allow a fiscally
prudent approach so that the Government can take stock o f the actual financial impact o f the program in
phase one and make adjustments for the nationwide scaling-up.

2.   Program Objective and Phases

Program objective

During the first phase, the Project would aim to support and ensure the implementation o f the Health
Insurance Strategy for the Poor (HISP) to cover 400,000 (20% o f target population) o f the poorest persons
(in quintiles 1 and 2) to be included in the first year, scaling up to 1.4 million (40%) persons over the



                                                     4
subsequent 3 years in the f i r s t phase of the Project. In the subsequent phase, it would reach the entire
national population in the first and second quintile. As a result, the Project should support the
implementation o f the strategy: a) to reduce in the health indicator gap between the poorest and the richest
(specially the infant and maternal mortality gap); and b) to support the implementation o f a significant
change in health service financing, deconcentration, and management at local and regional level.
Enrollment in the HISP would be available for those included in the first and second quintiles (SELBEN)
without any other health insurance, on a voluntary basis in the participant areas. Enrollment would be
renewable.

Program phases

The APL would span 8 years (2006-2013) with implementation in 2 phases.

Phase 1 (2006-2009) ($90 million) would (i)provide financial support for the implementation o f
management information systems for monitoring, evaluation and continuous auditing not only for this
Project but also for the wider network o f health care sub-systems, (ii)
                                                                       and provide financial support to
GOE in order to support the implementation of the HISP to include 1.4 million in quintiles 1 and 2 from
at least the provinces of Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Manabi and Bolivar2, and the municipalities
of Quito and Guayaquil. Should the implementation and disbursements move at a faster pace, the second
phase could start earlier.

Phase 2 (2010-2013) (estimated $105 million) would (i)
                                                     strengthen the structures introduced under phase
1 according to lesson learned (  ii)and support the GOE to extend coverage o f PROAUS to 3.1 million
(70% of the target population) in quintiles 1 and 2 from a wider geographic area.

Triggers and Exit Strategy: The second phase of the AP L would be initiated under three conditions: (i)
that the GOE presents data demonstrating that PROAUS has been implemented and i s effectively
                that the Management Information Systems are effectively functioning; and (
functioning; (ii)                                                                            iii)
                                                                                                that the
GOE i s financially supporting the HISP. Specific indicators for these triggers are outlined in Table 1
below.

3. Project development objective and key indicators

The main objective o f the proposed Project i s to assist the GOE to implement health insurance coverage
to targeted low-income groups who otherwise have no access to health care with the goal of reducing
infant, child and maternal mortality, as well as reducing the level o f health inequalities between provinces
and income quintiles. The A   PL would support and ensure the implementation o f PROAUS, extending
health insurance coverage to individuals in income quintiles 1 and 2 over a period o f 8 years or less. In
the first phase o f the AP L, PROAUS coverage would be initially extended to 400,000 individuals in
income quintiles 1 and 2 living in the municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil and from the provinces o f
Tunguragua, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Bolivar and Manabi. B y the end o f the implementation o f AF'LI,
 1.4 million people would be covered and served by PROAUS. Extending coverage should be
accompanied b y changes in Project outcome indicators during the first phase o f the Project: measured
decreases in IMR and U5MR in enrolled population of 25 percent from the baseline; 210 percent decrease
in MMR in enrolled populations from the baseline; a 2 5 percent reduction in the ratios o f IMR, U 5 M R
and MMR between income quintiles 1-2 and 4-5 in enrolled areas; and a 25 percent reduction in out-of-
pocket health care expenditures o f enrolled population. The Project would contribute substantially to
Ecuador's ability to meet the MDGs for health by 2015.

The Project should also meet a secondary but similarly important objective o f changing the operational
culture o f the health care systems. The implementation o f this Project should provide a new incentive
framework through new payment arrangements and a regulated market approach to the contracting o f
services by the SODEM, promoting operational effectiveness, quality improvements and efficiency. The
Project should also set the correct incentives for enrollment, monitoring and actual delivery of services.
B y the end of A P L Phase 1, contracts including this new incentive framework would be signed with the
municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil, and with providers in at least 5 provinces. Further, the Project
should also contribute to the process o f deconcentration in the health sector by transferring responsibility
to contract services from the MOH to the SODEM and to selected municipalities.

Lastly, the Project should contribute to strengthening the monitoring, evaluation and audit network o f
PROAUS. This would include the strengthening of the Health Management Information Network for
both the SODEM and i t s providers, as well as supporting external financial and technical audit.



4. Project components

A two phase AP L project i s proposed in the amount o f US$90 million in the first phase (2006-2009), with
two components: component 1 would strengthen monitoring, evaluation and continuous auditing capacity
o f PROAUS; and component 2 would support the implementation o f HISP o f which PROAUS i s a part.
Should the Project be implemented more rapidly than anticipated, i t would be possible to move into the
second phase more quickly.


     Component 1. Institutional Strengthening of Management Information Systems for
     Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuous Auditing (US$13 million)

     This component would support: (i)      the strengthening of the Health Management Information
     Network for both AUS and i t s providers and coordinating with other health care sub-systems; (     ii)
     provide technical assistance and personnel training that would support the setting o f contracts,
     provider payments and Project transfers; (iii)this component would also support external financial
     and technical audit @e., medical audits, household utilization audits); and (iv) this component would



                                                     6
support the implementation o f a communications strategy to strengthen awareness, utilization and
support for PROAUS at the grassroots level. T h i s component would fund software, hardware,
technical assistance and training. Disbursement under this component would be based on standard
mechanisms for investment projects via a special account subject to documentation o f eligible
expenditures. SODEM would begin by using the existing information system o f the ISSFA. As
well, SODEM through its technical assistance would learn from best international practice
implementing similar information systems.


Component 2. Provision of support for the implementation and development of the Health
Insurance Strategy for the Poor (US$77 million)

This component would support the implementation o f the HISP through conditional transfers to the
GOE where the amount o f disbursement would be subject to the achievement o f the performance
matrix (which i s based on defined capitation premiums and performance indicators). These transfers
would also contribute to guaranteeing human capital protection by the GOE.

The conditional transfers would be based on the negotiated capitation premium, the achievement o f
the full implementation o f service arrangements and on PROAUS performance goals defined in the
Performance Matrix (Mutriz de Desempeffo). Each quarterly disbursement w i l l be based on the
achievement o f aggregate capitation expenditures given current enrollment. PROAUS w i l l finance
less than the full premium if health care delivery performance as measured b y the production tracers
does not fully meet production tracers (see Annex 4).

Secondly, to provide incentives for the full implementation o f enrollment targets and supervision
arrangements of the HISP, the GOE can request disbursements for this component under three broad
disbursement categories where progress w i l l depend upon achievement o f the previous category o f
the performance matrix:

    The HISP and in particular the design o f the PROAUS, supported by this component, includes the
    following core items:

          1. Eligible population
             Persons (any age) in the f i r s t and second quintile. The beneficiaries should be registered in
             the first and second quintiles o f Sistema de Identificacidn y Seleccidn de Benefciarios de


                                                          8
    10s Programas Sociules (SELBEN) with 400,000 to be included in the first year, scaling up
    to 1.4 million over the subsequent 3 years in the first phase of the Project. In the first phase
    the Project would include populations in quintiles 1 and 2 from at least the provinces o f
    Tunguragua, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo, Manabi and Bolivar; and in this phase the
    municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil to take advantage local capacity.

2. Guaranteed Health Benefit Plan
   The initial plan of benefits to be covered by PROAUS would cover prevention at individual
   and community levels, and treatment o f prioritized health conditions as identified in the
   Conjunto Garantizado de Prestaciones (CGP) o f CONASA in 2004. The cost o f the
   benefits guaranteed by the government per capita was estimated at US$45 per annum in a
   consulting study by the Consortium CARE and Johns Hopkins University; this per capita
   rate w i l l be effective for the first phase o f the Project. However, the SODEM would pay
   only 20 percent o f this cost to the M O H which i s the incremental cost o f additional care per
   patient above the financing for fixed-costs already received through budget transfers. As
   well, where another provider i s also already receiving funding from the government to pay
   for patient services (Le., Sociedad de Lucha Contra el Cancer (SOLCA), Sociedad de
   Benejkiencia, municipalities and armed forces), the SODEM would negotiate to pay a
   reduced percentage o f the per capita rate to reflect the incremental cost o f services
   delivered.

3. Payment mechanism from SODEM to providers

    The SODEM would use a mixed approach to the payment o f providers following technical
    and financial verification:

         i.    Community and individual level preventative and curative services at the primary
               care level: capitation at an estimated rate o f US$35.2 per capita.
         ii.   Individual level secondary and tertiary care curative services: payment per
               service estimated to cost the equivalent o f a capitated rate o f $13 per capita.


4. Evaluation of results

    A monitoring, evaluation and audit system would be developed with the support o f
    component 1. I t would be comprised o f a register o f enrollees, including demographic data
    and the reference provider, indicators o f service production, and data on community
    monitoring such as satisfaction surveys and household utilization audits. These data would
    form the basis of disbursements to providers subject to verification o f enrollment and
    service production. In addition, the system would contribute to the further refinement o f the
    resource allocation formulae.

5. Impact of the purchasing agent on the provider side

    A n essential part of the reform i s the creation o f a new institution (SODEM) that would
    receive resources from the central government for the purchase o f essential services from
    providers for the poor. This design raises potential questions regarding: (i)   availability o f
    provider capacity to meet the additional demand for services; (    ii)increased funding to the
    public sector and its potential fiscal implications; (iii)  generating o f a non-competitive
    environment for private providers; and (iv) additional fragmentation in an already
    fragmented health system.


                                            9
             The reform i s being designed taking into consideration supply-side constraints and attempts
             to avoid potential inflation o f health services generated b y the purchase o f essential services
             for the poor. During the first A     P L phase, services would be purchased for the targeted
             population mainly from Ministry o f Health facilities and Social Insurance institutions.
             Given that the targeted population would be largely located in marginal urban areas and
             rural areas, a large part o f the provision o f services would come form the SSC which has an
             estimated excess installed capacity o f about 40 percent. Investments in additional public
             sector infrastructure are not considered in this proposed Project but the MOH included in i t s
             budget request some resources to continue a basic certification process o f primary health
             care facilities. Thus, the purchase o f services for the targeted population constitute an
             additional demand for health services from population groups which are currently not
             covered by social insurance and the additional demand would be met using idle health
             providing capacity.

             An additional concern i s that the purchase of services from public sector facilities and social
             insurance institutions would imply an increase in supply-side subsidies generating unfair
             competition for the private sector providers. The purchase scheme has been designed to
             minimize this risk. As mentioned previously, only 20 percent o f this cost would be paid to
             the MOH, which i s the incremental cost o f additional care per patient above the financing
             for fixed-costs already received through budget transfers. However, if other contracted
             providers already receive funding from the government to pay for patient services in such
             cases SODEM would negotiate to pay a reduced percentage o f the per capita rate to reflect
             the incremental cost o f services delivered.

             Finally, PROAUS would not constitute additional fragmentation o f the health financing
             systems in Ecuador. The beneficiary population o f PROAUS i s currently not covered by
             insurance and the health services would be paid out o f general revenues. Thus there i s no
             additional fragmentation o f risk pools.

5. Lessons learned and reflected in the Project design

The Bank has drawn three main lessons from i t s past experience in supporting Ecuador’s health sector
which i s reflected in the design for this Project. First, the focus on the supply side in the reform o f the
health sector in past projects has not sufficiently addressed the health needs o f the poor. The system i s
now better able to provide health services, but access to these services i s s t i l l limited for the poor. For
this reason, the proposed Project focuses on creating a mechanism by which health care coverage would
be provided for the uninsured poor. Additionally, the new system provides incentives to more efficiently
deliver guaranteed health services so as to improve critical public health indicators.

Second, past projects and programs have failed to target the poorest. Those that already had less access
to basic health services benefited less from the national strategies and programs introduced. (Le. LMG).
This proposed Project would support a clearly targeted Government strategy that would implement the
program by phases, prioritizing the poorest in the poorest communities.

Third, in the past decades, Ecuador has suffered political, economic and social instability that has limited
the development health policy with a long-term vision. In this political context, projects supported by
external funds were more likely to survive and maintain mediudlong term development objectives. This
proposed APL would provide support to the implementation o f the HISP and technical short and
mediudlong term assistance needed to establish and implement PROAUS in phases over the next 8



                                                      10
years assuring a more sustainable health insurance policy in general and in particular health coverage for
the poor.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

A key strategic decision by the Government has been to focus this Project on improving access to health
care for the poorest in Ecuador through the introduction o f a new insurance that should strengthen the
demand for health care. An alternative design would have been to focus on expanding access through
supporting improvements in the supply of ambulatory and hospital services building on the strategic
direction taken in previous World Bank-financed projects, namely Social Development 11-Health and
Nutrition (FASBASE) and the Health Services Modernization Project (MODERSA). Although these
two projects made important contributions to improving the quality and efficiency o f health service
provision, access t o health care particularly by the poor remains l o w and inequalities in basic health
indicators remain problematic. The major reason for this barrier to access i s a lack o f health insurance to
cover the poorest and most vulnerable, and reason for the proposed strategic direction of this project.

A second strategic direction has been to opt for an adjustable program lending (APL) approach rather
than a Single Investment Loan. The A        P L gives the Government the advantage o f implementing a
national program, in several phases, over a longer period (8-10 years). The full implementation o f
PROAUS would need to occur in realistic phases and an A     P L would contribute in the medium term to
the financial and political sustainability of PROAUS over Presidential administrations. Finally, it would
enable the Government to learn and assess the effectiveness o f PROAUS in the early phase and make
any necessary adjustments before embarking on a full implementation o f the insurance.



C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnership arrangements

Not applicable.

2. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

Institutions: Different actors and institutions would take on various roles across principal functions:
regulatory standards, inter-institutional coordination, financing, provision, control and monitoring and
evaluation. The Project would be implemented by the SODEM. The SODEM i s a National Secretariat
within the Office o f the President that would have the responsibility to purchase services on behalf o f
PROAUS beneficiaries. The SODEM w i l l be responsible for administering the payment network for the
reimbursement o f services and for the execution o f expenses. Further, it w i l l also be the responsibility of
the SODEM to execute the policies for AUS and PROAUS and to implement the norms o f internal
control as defined in their legal basis (Executive Decree). The SODEM w i l l also be expected to make
recommendations to Consejo Consultivo del Sistema de Aseguramiento Universal en Salud to adjust the
regulatory framework.

MEF would finance PROAUS and be required to transfer resources to cover the operation o f the SODEM
(financing guaranteed services, operating costs, guarantee fund, investments required for the functioning
o f AUS), as well as to transfer resources to sustain a baseline o f financing to PROAUS service providers
and to strengthen the service provision network o f the MOH and other public sector actors. As well,
MEF would be responsible for monitoring the achievement o f the performance matrix.



                                                      11
PROAUS w i l l partially rely on the existing LMG that finances a set of services targeting mothers and
children under 5 years of age delivered by the MOH. The objective o f LMG i s to promote the financing
and delivery o f services targeting maternal and child health; this program i s currently financed and
delivered b y the M O H through earmarked funds. The services covered by the LMG are considered as
part o f the set o f services covered by PROAUS for those in quintiles 1 and 2. There i s no duplication in
financing as the resources of the LMG and other resources o f the M O H are considered to cover 80percent
o f the cost of the benefits plan that the MOH w i l l cover for PROAUS using funds assigned from the
regular budget and via other specific laws.

Implementation Arrangements: Consejo Consultivo del Sistema de Aseguramiento Universal en
Salud (CCAUS) would be responsible for overseeing the implementation o f PROAUS. CCAUS would be
expected to define the specific regulatory procedures for AUS. It would also be responsible for
determining standards of internal control and for monitoring and evaluation.

Other regulatory responsibility would be undertaken by the MOH with the support o f CONASA and the
IESS. The responsibility for coordinating between the diverse actors across the National Health System
would be that o f CONASA, who would provide the regulatory criteria with respect to coordination o f
services. The M O H would be responsible for establishing the policies and technical norms treatment,
service provision and licensing in accordance with the legal standards currently in force. The IESS would
define the technical instrument for the accreditation o f providers.

At the provider level a number o f actors would be involved in the provision o f services: MOH, IESS,
SSC, municipalities and other private providers. Providers would be responsible for the administration o f
the global service contract, verification and application o f the regulations for internal control and
administration of the provider information system.

In order to carry out i t s mandate, SODEM w i l l execute several Institutional Cooperation Agreements with
all participating entities including the MOH, CCAUS, IESS, ISSFA, ISSPOL, SELBEN. I t w i l l also
execute contracts with health service providers.

Zmplementation Capacity: The SODEM i s a new institution and a Financial Management and
Procurement Assessments performed during the appraisal mission shows that some technical assistance i s
needed. The loan would finance the key Management Information Systems for Monitoring, Evaluation
and Auditing, and the GOE would finance the staff, equipment and operating costs. The GOE would
promote cross support from other external financed projects and the loan would finance some key
technical assistance during the f i s t steps o f the PROAUS implementation.

Flow of Funds and Reporting:
Component I : Funds would be disbursed under standard Bank procurement rules.
Component 2: Funds would be disbursed from the Bank’s loan to the MEF via a Special National
Treasury Account on the basis of quarterly transfers. Disbursement o f loan proceeds would be executed
upon the presentation o f quarterly disbursement reports from MEF that would include: an aggregate
capitation expenditure, a certified enrollment l i s t o f PROAUS and performance indicators achieved b y
contractees. T h i s i s similar to the approach applied in Argentina-Provincial Child Health Investment
Project, previously approved by the Board. Funds under component 2 w i l l be disbursed under three
categories: the GOE can request disbursement up to the amount under category (2.1) upon loan
effectiveness; the GOE can request disbursement up to the amount in categories (2.2) and (2.3) according
to reporting o f defined performance indicators.




                                                    12
3. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results

The monitoring and evaluation system being established would strengthen the wider monitoring and
evaluation capacity o f the health network and would also benefit the second phase o f the project.
Indicators of program results would track levels o f coverage o f the beneficiary population and the
effectiveness o f the services provided. Data on the level o f coverage would be initially generated by
base-line surveys and later by Health Management Information System. The SODEM would consolidate
this information through quarterly project implementation reports. Data on the performance would be
collected from periodic reports made by service providers from their service records that would be the
basis o f their capitation payments and payments o f the incentive bonus. These reports would form the
basis o f the performance matrix which would be sent to MEF quarterly. In addition, the SODEM would
perform quality evaluations along with external and household surveys to verify these reports.

4. Sustainability

The focus of the current Government on the development o f PROAUS as a priority in its agenda, i s a
window of opportunity to provide health coverage for the poorest and reduce the large inequalities
Ecuador has in crucial health indicators. The proposed Project i s based on an A    P L instrument to support
the medium term implementation o f HISP which i s planned in two phases (2006-2009, $90 million),
2010-2013, estimated in US$lOS million) over the next 8 years. An A      P L i s the most appropriate lending
instrument to enable not only the short term implementation o f the first phase of the HISP, but would also
contribute to the financial strengthening and political sustainability o f the HISP in its longer-term
implementation.

The Project would increase the very low level o f health investment, focusing on increasing demand and
targeting the most vulnerable and poorest particularly the indigenous and rural populations. The fiscal
impact should be minimal for the current and next administration as the GOE monies for this Project
represent only 19.8 percent o f the 0.32 percent o f GDP put aside for tackling MDGs. Further financial
sustainability would result from the implementation o f FONAUS that i s being created b y the GOE to
provide assurance to providers that services being provided by PROAUS would be covered despite any
economic crisis. The Project would also contribute to the decentralization of the health system, and
contribute to sustaining, in the medium term, PROAUS once a new government takes office. Rapid
implementation o f this Project i s vital to ensure grassroots support b y beneficiaries and communities o f
PROAUS further strengthening and mitigating risks of longer-term political support. In addition, the
communications strategy as implemented under component 1 should help to build consensus and support
at the grass-root beneficiary level and mitigate labor fall-out and union actions.

5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

The proposed program faces several risks related to Ecuador’s economic and political uncertainty.
Mitigation measures are being taken to contain these risks, although some uncertainty remains. An
addition key risk i s to mitigate the misallocation o f funds which would be dependent on the M&E system
and in particular population level surveys on perceptions o f service quality and access. Additional
implementation risks have also been recognized and have been taken into account in the design o f this
investment program.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

Economic Analysis:

Component I: Institutional Strengthening of          Management Information         Systems for Monitoring,
Evaluation and Continuous Auditing

Essential to the implementation o f HISP i s the investment in a Health Management Information Network
for AUS and i t s providers including technical assistance and training to support the setting o f contracts
and provider payments, external financial and technical audits, and the implementation o f a
communications strategy. The related economic benefits o f this strategy would be increased b y i t s timely
and effective implementation. Without an appropriate and reliable information system, information on
enrollment, payment, performance and audit reports would be unreliable. An economic evaluation o f the
component was undertaken following accepted international standards for estimating the present value o f
benefits due to the implementation o f HISP with and without adequate institutional strengthening o f
management information systems. The evaluation gave an estimated net present value o f US$146 million
and a rate o f return o f approximately 948 percent using a discount rate o f 12 percent.

Component 2: Provision of support for the implementation and development of the Health Insurance
Strategy for the Poor

Benefits from implementing HISP are reflected in the preservation o f human capital through specific cost-
effective health interventions during a person’s life cycle which will increase their capacities,
opportunities and functional life expectancy. The HISP includes the implementation o f a benefit package
which comprises mainly cost-effective interventions, including those that target the main causes of
neonatal and infant mortality (diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases, as well as malnutrition and
inadequate prenatal care) and maternal mortality (hemorrhage and infections linked to unsafe deliveries
and complications from unsafe abortions). The benefit package also includes cost-effective interventions
for primary health care promotion, prevention and early detection o f illness to prevent complications. An
economic evaluation of the HISP that w i l l be supported b y this component, undertaken following
accepted international standards for estimating the present value o f future costs avoided in the targeted
population, has shown a substantial net present value o f US$354 million and a rate o f return o f
approximately 109 percent using a discount rate o f 12 percent.

Financial Analysis and Fiscal Impact: Implementing Management Information Systems for Monitoring,
Evaluation and Continuous Auditing, with a cost o f $13 million, w i l l increase the rate o f return o f the
investment made by the GOE in implementing the HISP, as shown in the economic analysis under
component 1. Therefore, fiscal impact i s assumed to be minimal. Under component 2, conditional
transfers w i l l help to reduce financial stress while improving the quality of health expenditure, which w i l l
be reflected in the achievement o f the goals established under the performance matrix.

The fiscal impact of this Project over 10 years i s estimated to represent 0.32 percent o f GDP, assuming an
average real annual growth rate of 3.5 percent. This analysis also indicates that an incremental amount of
resources (US$871 million) required for investing in the new programs needed for meeting the MDGs i s
feasible. The estimated investments in a 10-year program represent 19.8 percent o f this amount. Under
these circumstances the fiscal impact of the program could be considered moderate under a realistic
economic scenario.

2. Technical

The information system being supported under component 1, which i s based on the strengthening of
existing systems, i s a key part o f the implementation o f the HISP. The program includes as a key
technical feature a clearly defined package of health services, Conjunto Garantizado de Prestaciones
(CGP). The initial benefits to be covered by PROAUS, are those defined in the Conjunto Garantizado de
Prestaciones (CGP) in 2004 and would include prevention at individual and community levels, as well as
treatment of prioritized health conditions. The cost o f providing these guaranteed benefits has been
estimated in a consulting study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School o f Public Health at USW5 per
capita annually. Those providers who already receive funding from the government for health care would
only receive a portion o f this amount equal to the incremental cost for additional care received by the
beneficiaries. A full listing o f the interventions would be contained in the Project Operational Manual.

Other technical issues included in the Project are the design of the contracts to be implemented between
the SODEM and municipalities, NGOs and health providers. The health financing design that supports
the PROAUS reflects the latest lessons in the region on contracting and provider payment mechanisms.
Models of the contracts would be also part o f the Project Operational Manual.

3. Fiduciary

Financial Management
Two different disbursement mechanisms w i l l be used each of the Project components. For Component 1
the Project w i l l have access to funds advanced by the Bank through a special account for processing
disbursements for eligible expenditures under the project.

Project design and implementation require a robust financial management system, which at this time i s
not yet in place, given that the implementing agency SODEM, has only recently been formed.
Nevertheless, Project design (component 1) provides for institutional strengthening and capacity for
continuous auditing, therefore on the basis of proposed Project design the, financial management team has
identified a minimum set o f actions needed to ensure proper financial management arrangements,
oversight and accountability.

For component 2, funds w i l l be disbursed to the GOE, through a special National Treasury account on the
basis o f quarterly transfers. The transfers w i l l be made effective once the Bank receives satisfactory
disbursements reports, which include series of performance indicator matrix described in annex 4.
Transfers from the World Bank to MEF w i l l be subject to reporting documentation on the relevant
population, purchase of services and other pre-arranged indicators, which w i l l be reflected in the
operating agreements between SODEM and the service providers. In addition, the performance matrix
w i l l form the basis of requests for disbursement under categories 2.2 and 2.3 o f this component.




                                                    16
Procurement
Procurement for Component 1 of the proposed Project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank’s “Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits” dated May 2004; and
“Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers” dated May 2004, and
the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure
categories are described in general in annex 8. For each contract to be financed b y the Loadcredit, the
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the
Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the
actual Project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity (see Annex 8 for further
detail).

4. Social

The social assessment has been a participatory effort carried out by the AUS Team, which has included
the MOH, the National Directorate of Indigenous Peoples at the MOH, and the Council for the
Development o f the Nucionulidudes y Pueblos Indigenus of Ecuador (CODENPE). Consultations were
also carried out with SELBEN, UN Population Fund (UNFPA), and the Millennium Development Goal
Commission.

As part o f Project preparation, an “Assessment of the Needs and Demands o f Health Services,
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices o f People with Regard to Health Insurance” was carried out by the
CARE-Bloomberg Consortium o f the School of Public Health o f Johns Hopkins University (February
2004). Based on the population distribution o f the 2001 Census, the study included a survey o f 10,000
households in urban and rural areas of 16 provinces (10 in the Highlands, 5 in the Coastal Region and 1 in
the Amazonian Region.) The random sample consisted o f households in urban and rural areas. I t included
all quintiles of the population, but did not disaggregate population b y ethnicity. The purpose o f the
assessment of the general population o f Ecuador was three-fold: (a) to identify the needs and demands o f
health care services; (b) to establish the health insurance situation o f interviewees; (c) to analyze the
levels of satisfaction with the quality o f existing health care services. The study examined knowledge,
attitudes and health care practices during the previous year. Other sources o f consultation included: (a) the
2004 Demographic and Maternal-Child Health Survey (ENDEMAIN) conducted by the Center for
Population and Social Development Studies (CEPAR) in 29,000 households in 22 provinces, and
disaggregated by ethnicity; and (b) the Integrated Social Indicators System (I1SIISE), 2004.

Given that the present Project would benefit the bulk o f the Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples, the
O.P. 4.10 applies. With technical assistance from the Bank, the Ecuadorian Government prepared an
Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) which includes autochthonous peoples during Project design and
particularly during implementation, monitoring, social auditing, and evaluation o f AUS. The IPP has been
approved by the GOE and SODEM and other Government agencies w i l l finance i t s execution. The P P
was disseminated through the SODEM web page and through the Bank InfoShop and has been
incorporated in the Project Operational Manual.

5. Environment

The Project would not finance any health care infrastructure or directly procure medical supplies.
Consequently, the Project i s not expected to have any significant or direct environmental safeguard
impacts. I t i s recognized, however, that the increase in coverage could potentially lead to increased
generation of healthcare wastes in health establishments that participate in the insurance scheme that
would be supported b y the proposed project.


                                                     17
In this respect, regulations exist for the adequate management o f wastes from health establishments,
includinginfectious and special wastes (Registro Oficial No.106., January 1997). Furthermore, according
to information received from the Ministry of Health, implementation o f a Program for Management of
Hospital wastes (Program de Manejo de Desechos Hospitalarios) was initiated by the Ministry o f
Health in 1996. Information presented by this program indicates that there have been improvements in
healthcare waste management.

In order to take precautions against any potential environmental impacts of the proposed project, as part
o f the contracts between the SODEM and the healthcare providers, the healthcare providers provide
evidence that their existing or planned healthcare waste management, storage, collection and disposal
systems are adequate and can accommodate any additional waste quantities that could occur as a result o f
the expanded coverage. This requirement would also be reflected in the Loan Agreement.

       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

Ecuador’s health care market suffers from a number o f distortions, in particular the fact that it i s highly
fragmented, which has led to an inefficient, inequitable, poor quality and largely inaccessible system with
over 70 percent o f the population uninsured. The share of the population currently covered b y
contributory health insurance i s amongst the lowest in LAC and the poorest socio-economic groups have
very little access to health care. More than two-thirds of the population has n o contributory health
insurance, and the Ministry of Health and other public institutions face severe constraints to provide
healthcare services to nearly half o f the population. In recent years, there have been several attempts to
bring about improvements, but in most cases, those attempts have been partial and their results
insufficient. This proposed Project would serve as an important step in tackling some o f these distortions
by targeting health insurance to poorest and most vulnerable and by setting down the foundations for an
envisioned Universal Health Insurance System.

Due to the ongoing momentum o f demographic and epidemiological transition factors, some o f Ecuador’s
health indicators have improved in recent years unlike trends in other social indicators. Between 1970-
2000, life expectancy increased from 58.8 to 70 years. Infant mortality fell from 30.3 per 1,000 live
births in 1990 to 23.3 per 1,000 in 2004 according to official statistics (INEC and MSP). Maternal
mortality also showed a downward trend, falling from 117 deaths per 100,000 births in 1990 to 76.4 per
100,000 in 2004 (INEC and MSP). However, the reliability of infant and maternal mortality data based
on vital statistics records has been disputed and estimates based on demographic surveys indicate rates
that are significantly higher? Chronic malnutrition measured in terms o f wasting and stunting i s also
above i t s predicted level. In addition, there are severe inequalities in the system, particularly in terms o f
access to healthcare for the indigenous population, the poor and those living in rural areas.

Ecuador exhibits a polarized pattern of epidemiological transition, in which problems common to
developed populations go hand in hand with problems typically seen in developing populations (high
rates o f mortality due to infectious disease or external causes (violence and accidents), cervical cancer,
infant mortality, deaths o f children under 5 years o f age and deaths related to pregnancy, childbirth or
puerperal deaths). T h i s does not mean that the same population i s suffering from both types o f problems.
Rather, it suggests that certain population groups with better health indicators, longer life expectancies,
and an epidemiological pattern more typical o f a developed country, coexist with other population groups
that, owing to adverse life conditions, situations o f inequity, and lack o f access to basic health services,
suffer from premature mortality whose causes are preventable.

But an overview o f this overlapping o f a population group presenting the pattern o f a developed
population and a larger group with a profile o f a developing country dilutes the substantial inequities in
access to health services and health status that exist in Ecuador. Ecuador’s demographic, cultural, and
social heterogeneity constitute a fertile ground for economic inequality and stark differences in living
standards and health conditions. In the Amazon region, for example, where there i s clearly a higher
concentration o f indigenous and poor populations, premature deaths are frequent and life expectancy in
1995-2000 was 59.6 years. An estimated 21 percent o f the population in the Amazon does not survive
more than 40 years, whereas at the other extreme, in the province o f E’ichincha, life expectancy was
almost 15 years longer (74.5 years), and only 6.8 percent were expected to die before age 40. Similar
inequities can be seen when life expectancies are compared with household consumption per capita. The


  For example, in 2004, the infant mortality rate was estimated at 40 per 1,000 b y the United Nations Population
Division o f the Department o f Economic and Social Affairs, almost twice the official figure, while PAHO estimated
a maternal mortality ratio o f 81 per 100,000 births in the same year.

resources (Graphic 1).

Despite the efforts o f the Government o f Ecuador (GOE) to improve maternal and child health through
the program o f the Free Maternity Law (Ley de Matemidud Grutuita), maternal and infant mortality rates
also continue to be a serious problem and are indicative o f the continuing poor coverage and access to
health care. Nationally, approximately 20 percent o f pregnancies run their course without prenatal care,
but once again this national average disguises rates as disparate as that for Guayaquil, where 7 percent of
mothers receive no prenatal care, and the rate for the Amazon provinces, where 34 percent go without
care. I t i s estimated that approximately 30 percent o f deliveries take place at home, but here again specific
rates vary between 5 percent in Guayaquil and Quito and 50 percent in Amazonia region (in the provinces
of Chimborazo, Bolivar, and Cotopaxi, the figure i s 60 percent).

Difference among provinces shows the effect of the socio-demographic profile o f the population i s clearly
linked to health inequities. Table A l . l shows that infant and child mortality i s two to three times higher
among indigenous, those living in rural areas and those with highest levels o f unsatisfied basic needs
(UBN). Sadly, the table also shows that the gaps between the groups, measured as ratios, seem to be
increased or unmodified. Similar pattern o f inequities can be seen in the distribution of chronic
malnutrition (stunting - low height for age) in children under 5 years old.

Social Security Institute - ISSFA and National Police Social Security Institute - ISSPOL), and the Health
Service o f the Police (each with i t s own institutions). One can also consider some o f the institutions o f the
Ministry o f Social Welfare and certain municipal services as part o f this sector, along with those o f some
private, nonprofit institutions, such as the Welfare Council o f Guayaquil, the Guayaquil Children's
Protection Society, the Red Cross, and the Society for the Fight Against Cancer.

The Ministry o f Public Health provides health services to approximately 31 percent o f the population; the
IESS to 18 percent (10 percent through SGO and 8 percent through the SSC); the Armed Forces (ISSFA
and ISSPOL) cover close to 1 percent; and the rest o f the institutions cover 10 percent. The private sector,
with a number of independent institutions, covers 10 percent, while as much as 31 percent o f the
population (or more if one takes into consideration that part o f the population covered by the IESS also
receives services from the Ministry o f Public Health), have no access to basic services.

Ecuador’s health coverage and insurance system suffers from a number of major shortcomings that affect
access and quality of services provided. Coverage i s among the lowest in the LAC region and the
population groups showing higher disease risk and infant mortality (indigenous, poorest and those living
in rural areas) also have greater difficulty to access qualified basic and secondary health care.

Currently health insurance i s supported by four public social insurance or “quasi-insurance” systems,
covering different segments of the population. These are the General Obligatory Insurance “Seguro
Social Obligutorio” (SSO) covering 1.3 million, managed by the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security
(IESS); the Rural People’s Social Security Insurance “Seguro Social Campesino” (SSC) covering 0.9
million, also managed by IESS; the Armed Forces personnel social security scheme; and the National
Police social security system that cover 0.4 million. A private health insurance i s offered but used by a
small proportion o f the population (0.3 million).

The General Obligatory Insurance covers formal sector wage earners, including private and
government employees. The Social Security law approved in 2001 made enrollment compulsory for the
self-employed but this has not been regulated or enforced and voluntary affiliation continues to be
minimal. SGO i s an individual insurance that does not cover one’s immediate family. The only exception
i s that for female affiliates, their children’s healthcare i s covered, but only during the first year o f life.
T h i s scheme covers approximately 1.3 million members (1.1 million o f whom are economically active,
i.e., in the labor force, and 0.2 million are retired), and health services are provided mostly through IESS
facilities. While the 2001 law ordered the extension o f coverage to affiliates’ spouses and children under
6, no actual steps were taken in this direction until late 2004. Preliminary results of a study under
execution by IESS suggests that including spouses and children younger than 6 years who are part o f the
first, second, or third quintiles would extend the coverage to about 225,000 spouses and 95,000 children.
Considering that the SSO spent US$164 million in 2003 (around US$126 per capita), if efficiency does
not increase, full coverage of these 320,000 relatives would require about US$40 million a year in
additional funds, to be financed by increasing employer and employee contributions.

The population generally considers this insurance to be o f poor quality. Many people consider the
insurance to be useful to them for situations necessitating major expenses, but not for minor health
problems. I   n fact, many people have additional private insurance. SGO had a financial deficit o f close to
50 percent in 1997, 24 percent in 1998, and 29 percent in 1999, which was covered using investment
returns. Under the dollarization of Ecuador’s currency, and calculating contributions on the basis o f the
totality o f revenues from private workers, the financing o f SGO grew significantly, from U S 5 9 . 8 million
in 2000 to US$88.1 million in 2001 and approximately US$187 million in 2002. The Social Security Act
prohibits cross subsidies between the pension funds and the health funds o f the 1ESS.

The Rural People’s Social Security Insurance covers rural workers organized in cooperatives,
communes, or agrarian associations who are not employers or dependent workers and therefore do not
qualify to join the SSO. This insurance i s also managed by the LESS. Participation i s voluntary and
benefits include a basic pension for heads o f households and health services for all members o f the
household. While the system i s contributory, it i s strongly subsidized. The required contribution from
heads of household i s only a symbolic contribution o f 1 percent o f the minimum wage (salario minimo
vital), and actual financing for the SSC i s provided in the form o f a 0.7 percent payroll tax for those
affiliated to SSO, with equal contributions from employers and employees, and a subsidy o f 0.3 percent
of payroll subject to SSO, paid by the government. The population covered b y the SSC comprises some
200,000 direct affiliates, 20,000 retirees, and 700,000 relatives (around 3 relatives per affiliate). The
SSC’s potential membership i s approximately three times larger than i t s current coverage, and the Social
Security Act extended the application o f the insurance to the entire rural population either working in the
fields or involved in fishing, but due to financial constraints enrollment has been closed for the past


                                                      22
decade, excluding nearly 700,000 heads of households and 2.4 million family members. The insurance
covers medical and pharmaceutical services, with no maximum limit, and includes prevention and health
promotion activities. The services are provided through 575 first-level health centers o f the SSC, while
the second and third level referrals are usually handled by LESS hospitals service centers in the rural
zones, and for more complex healthcare problems through the LESS’S General Obligatory Insurance
establishments, as opposed to those of the Ministry o f Public Health.

This insurance, which i s older than the Ministry o f Public Health itself, has a great deal o f meaning for
the peasants, who consider i t to be a social victory. Unlike the General Obligatory Insurance, i t s affiliates
consider it to be ”good insurance.” Nonetheless, the SSC i s facing serious financing difficulties, along
with problems in the provision o f supplies and medications. Moreover, many o f i t s service units require
maintenance, and obsolete basic equipment also needs to be upgraded.

The Armed Forces and Police systems are managed by two independent institutions (Instituto de
Seguridad Social de las Fuerzas Armadas - ISSFA, and lnstituto de Seguridad Social de la Policia
Nacional - ISSPOL). These schemes offer protection to the military and police officers. Health services
include family members. They cover approximately 50,000 active members (1 percent o f the labor force)
and have 45,000 retirees.

The Free Maternity Law. The government also provides health protection outside o f the social
insurance system. The Ministry o f Health has a network o f public hospitals, and in recent years the
government created a health program to finance services to pregnant women and infants, the Free
Maternity Law, “Ley de Maternidad Gratuita” (LMG). The Free Maternity L a w finances the provision
of 33 basic services for the maternal-child population. The law was passed in 1998 and revised in 2002.
Through this mechanism, the Ministry o f Public Health pays providers’ expenses with funds from the
Solidarity Fund and a portion o f sales tax revenues. I  n theory, all women and children under 6 have
coverage, but in practice, only those that have access to services provided directly by MOH hospitals are
covered. The LMG reached by the end o f 2003 about 30 percent o f pregnant women. The LMG i s
reaching to a much reduced extent the vulnerable groups (Table A1.2), as for instance coverage for
indigenous and for rural women i s only 19 percent and for the poorest 30 percent i t i s about 20 percent.

In 2004 the LMG signed an agreement with the SSC to finance services provided by the SSC on no-SSC
affiliated, but the agreement was not yet implemented. In 2005 the LMG signed a couple o f additional
contracts with NGOs to finance services provided by them. The later i s a small expansion; but i t i s
relevant because it signifies a new stage in the strategy to expand the coverage o f the LMG.

The Universal Health Insurance Program. The Government strategy for the development o f a
Universal Health Insurance Coverage aims to expand health insurance coverage beyond current l i m i t s by
strengthening existing insurance schemes and complementing them with other options and additional
sources o f financing so that when they are brought together they would constitute an overall framework
for health insurance. The Universal Health Insurance Commission has played a leading role in
orchestrating a strategy to extend basic health services coverage, leadership, with an agenda focused on
laying the foundations for universal health insurance. The strategy has six major thrusts:

        1. Extend the benefits o f those covered by SSO to direct family members;
        2. Strengthen the SSC;
        3. Strengthen the Armed Forces and Police insurance schemes;
        4. To develop an insurance system for the families o f those that have emigrated supported b y
           transfers from the emigrated;
        5. Foster the competitiveness o f private insurance schemes b y encouraging the purchase of
           services from public and private providers; and
        6. Develop mechanisms to enable the GOE to incorporate insurance coverage for the most
           vulnerable segments of the population.

The sixth point of this strategy has led to the development o f PROAUS, which i s the focus o f this
proposed World Bank project. I t would constitute a nominal health insurance for those in the f i r s t and
second quintile, and would contribute to expand the services financed b y LMG. PROAUS would finance
a set o f Guaranteed Services defined in the National Health System Law, for the first and second quintile
o f the population, which cannot be reached by other forms o f insurance, paying providers expenses for
those services. PROAUS would be executed through SODEM that would have the role o f purchasing
services for the PROAUS beneficiaries. The PROAUS would be overseen by the Consejo Consultivo del
Sistema de Aseguramiento Universal en Salud (CCAUS), a public body established to oversee the
PROAUS and establish its operational regulations, and report to the MEF about i t s operations. The
management board o f CCAUS i s constituted by representatives o f the MOH, the National Health
Committee (CONASA), SODEM, IESS and other health-related institutions.

CCAUS would define the specific regulatory procedures for AUS. I t would also be responsible for
determining standards of internal control and for monitoring and evaluation.



The PROAUS as a key strategy for Poverty Reduction in Ecuador

A recent World Bank study: “Creating Fiscal Space for Poverty Reduction in Ecuador” shows that the
Budgets for the social sectors are low b y regional standards and declining. Following dollarization, social
sectors expenditures peaked up to 5.1 percent o f GDP in 2002, thus reversing a long term decline and
almost reaching their level o f the early 1980s. However, the level o f health expenditures remains low,
about half the combined LAC average o f 7.5 percent o f GDP, and i s declining since 2002. Public health
spending per capita remains among the lowest in Latin America (only Haiti spends less), and recent
budget increases have mainly gone into salary increases for health workers.




                                                    24
Making matters worse, these stunted resources have suffered from a persistent poor targeting o f resources
increasing the inequalities in access to service delivery. These findings point to the need to assess the pro-
poor focus and efficiency o f the social programs in general, and health program in particular.

About half o f total social spendinn i s not pro-Door. Incidence analysis allows examining to what extent
expenditure i s pro-poor (that is, a negative differential between the share o f spending received by the
richest and poorest quintiles, thus favoring the consumption levels o f the poor relatively more than those
o f the rich, and hence reducing consumption inequality), mixed or non-pro-poor. In 2003, and in absolute
terms, the poorest quintile received 12 percent of social expenditure, compared to 27 percent to the richest
quintile (Vos et al. 2003).

                  Expanding Health Coverage to the Poor: Lessons from Colombia



               Colombia expanded health coverage to the poor in much the same way as
               Ecuador plans, with an overall positive experience but some pitfalls should be
               avoided.
               Prior to 1993, the Colombian health care system was segmented according to
               social groups in three categories - Ministry o f Health, Social Security Institute,
               private sector - with much o f the population without coverage (76%) as it i s
               currently in Ecuador.
               B y 2000, following radical reforms Colombia was ranked first of 191 countries
               by WHO in terms o f fairness in financing with health insurance coverage
               expanding to 54% o f the population.
               The reforms involved the creation o f a new system characterized b y universal
               health insurance coverage with cost-sharing on the financing side and pluralistic
               publiclprivate provision.
               Quintiles 1 and 2 are covered under a subsidized scheme and receive basic
               benefits.
               Despite i t s successes, some key problems have arisen:
                   o A complicated transfer system led to payment delays from the
                        implementing agency and providers;
                   o One-third o f the eligible population was not covered because o f a lack
                        o f basic information o f the affiliation process;
                   o There has been manipulation o f the enrollment system through
                        connections. I t has been difficult to verify enrollment information. If
                        economic situation o f enrollees improves it i s unlikely they w i l l
                        acknowledge this and loose subsidy.

       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

The project, with a total cost o f US$90 million16 would include the following components and activities:

Component I : Institutional Strengthening o f Management Information                    Systems for     Monitoring,
Evaluation and Concurrent Auditing (US$13 million)

The successful implementation of PROAUS would require ensuring beneficiaries entitlements and rights
in the program are protected. Increasing the accountability o f staff and facilities providing services to
beneficiaries would require that the SODEM can effectively monitor and audit performance. SODEM
would begin by using the existing information system o f the ISSFA. As well, SODEM through its
technical assistance would learn from best international practice of similar information systems, technical
assistance and personnel training to support the processing o f contracts, provider payments and Project
transfers. Key areas to be addressed under this component include: membership management; provider
management; provider operations; support provider and membership support; contract administration
service definitions; encounter reporting under a capitated payment scheme; claims adjudication process;
incentive systems; hardware, networking and connectivity considerations; quality and fiduciary
compliance audits; operational audits utilization review process; operational and financial reporting
training; education and documentation process.

Project financing would be utilized to strengthen the IT network through upgrading o f IT design, new
software and equipment, training for staff at the SODEM to monitor health provider performance,
aggregation and reporting o f information used for gauging Project performance, as well as used t o make
transfers to providers. In addition to being a renewed basis for further phases o f PROAUS
implementation, the system i s also expected to generate tracer information that would be accounted for in
the managing o f financial flows under the project. While SODEM staff would monitor results and
enrolments on a monthly basis, an independent audit (concurrent audit) would be conducted b y an
independent firm with qualifications in health systems administration, insurance and information
technology. They would provide an independent opinion on the reliability o f the “billings” sent b y
participating providers to the SODEM justifying the basic payment o f the capitation (80 percent) and the
service production targets (up to 20 percent o f the capitation).

This component would support:

      1.  upgrade and expansion of the information systems o f the Health Management Information
          Network for both AUS and its providers for the monitoring o f the implementation o f PROAUS.
          This would include technical equipment and software
      ..
      11. technical assistance and personnel training to support the processing o f contracts, provider
          payments and Project disbursements;
     ... external finance and technical audits (Le., medical audits, household utilization audits).
     111.
     iv. the implementation o f a communications strategy to strengthen awareness, utilization and
          support for PROAUS at the grassroots level.

SODEM operative costs and Project implementation cost would be covered by the GOE and are not
included in the Project Cost Summary tables (Annex 5).

Component 2: Provision o f support for the implementation and development of the Health Insurance
Strategy for the Poor (US$77 million)

This component would support the implementation of the HISP through conditional transfers to the
GOE where the amount of disbursement would be subject to the achievement o f the performance
matrix (which i s based on defined capitation premiums and performance indicators. These transfers
would also contribute to guaranteeing human capital protection b y the GOE.

The conditional transfers would be based on the negotiated capitation premium, the achievement o f
the full implementation o f service arrangements and on PROAUS performance goals defined in the
Performance Matrix (Matriz de DesempeAo). Each quarterly disbursement w i l l be based on the
achievement o f aggregate capitation expenditures given current enrollment.

Secondly, to provide incentives for the fully implement of enrollment targets and supervision
arrangements of the HISP, the GOE can request disbursements for this component under three broad
disbursement categories where progress will depend upon achievement o f the previous category o f
the performance matrix:

The HISP and in particular the design o f the PROAUS, supported by this component, includes the
following core items:

Under this component, PROAUS would be implemented according to the following criteria:

   1. Eligible Population: The beneficiaries would include individuals, o f any age, registered and
      defined as being in the first and second quintiles according to the Sistema de Zdentificacidn y
      Seleccidn de Beneficiarios de 10s Programas Sociales (SELBEN). The targeted enrollment
      during the f i r s t year o f the Project i s 400,000 individuals; this number would be scaled up to
      1.4 million individuals (40 percent of the target population) over the next 3 years o f this
      project. The first phase of the Project would include populations in quintiles 1 and 2 from the
      municipalities o f Quito and Guayaquil and from at least the provinces of Tunguragua,
      Manabi, Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Bolivar.

                                                           Population (Ql-Q2) without
           Municipality, canton or province
                                                                health insurance

        Province Tungurahua                                          40,000
        Province Cotopaxi                                            70,000

        Province Bolivar                                             40.000


   2. Guaranteed Health Benefit Plan: The initial plan o f benefits to be covered by PROAUS
      would cover prevention at individual and community levels, and treatment o f prioritized
      health conditions as identified in the Conjunto Garantizado de Prestaciones (CGP) o f
      CONASA in 2004. The cost o f the benefits guaranteed by the government per capita was
      estimated at US$45 per annum in a consulting study b y the Consortium CARE and Johns
      Hopkins University; this per capita rate w i l l be effective for the first phase o f the project.


                                                   35
            However, the SODEM would pay only 20 percent of this cost to the M O H which i s the
            incremental cost o f additional care per patient above the financing for fixed-costs already
            received through budget transfers. As well, where another provider i s also already receiving
            funding from the government to pay for patient services (i.e., Sociedad de L u c k Contra el
            Cancer (SOLCA), Sociedud de Benefciencia, municipalities and armed forces), the SODEM
            would negotiate to pay a reduced percentage o f the per capita rate to reflect the incremental
            cost o f services delivered.

        3. Payment mechanism from SODEM to providers

              The SODEM would use a mixed approach to the payment o f providers following technical
              and financial verification:

                    i.   Community and individual level preventative and curative services at the primary
                         care level: capitation at an estimated rate o f US$35.2 per capita.
                   ..
                   11.   Lndividual level secondary and tertiary care curative services: The cost o f
                         services at the secondary level was estimated to cost the equivalent of a capitated
                         rate of $13 per capita. SODEM w i l l contract with providers to deliver these
                         services according to a defined l i s t o f services and tariffs.

              T o set correct incentives at the primary care level, the cash transfer o f the capitation
              payment would be conducted in two installments: (i)            73 percent of the capitated rate
              (US$25.60 per enrollee) would be disbursed immediately after the provider’s register has
              been certified by the auditing unit o f the SODEM; and (      ii)
                                                                              27 percent (US$9.6 per enrollee)
              o f the remaining capitated rate would be disbursed periodically (in principle quarterly) after
              verification and certification by the same unit o f the SODEM that the provider met the
              production targets according to l i s t of selected tracers with a maximum o f 10 tracers agreed
              per contract. In this way, PROAUS w i l l finance less than the full premium i f health care
              delivery performance as measured by the production tracers does not fully meet production
              tracers. The more tracers achieved the higher the percentage o f the remaining capitation
              payment received: if a provider achieves e50 percent o f tracers none o f the remaining 30
              percent would be paid; if a provider achieves 50-80 percent of tracers 50 percent o f the
              remaining 30 percent would be paid; if >80 percent i s achieved 100 percent o f the remaining
              30 percent would be paid. Hence, disbursements o f loan proceeds for the capitation
              payment expenditure category would be made against the certified “quasi-bill’’ and the
              certified tracer reports submitted by participating providers. A l i s t o f tracers would be
              included in the Operational Manual. To ensure that the required information management
              system o f providers i s operational, an implementation period o f up to 6 months w i l l be
              included in the contract during which time providers w i l l receive 100 percent o f the agreed
              capitated rate.

         4. Evaluation o f results: A monitoring, evaluation and audit system would be developed with
            the support of component 1. Ensuring beneficiaries receive entitlements and staff and
            facilities are accountable would require regular monitoring o f results b y the SODEM. I t
            would be comprised o f a register o f enrollees, including demographic data and the reference
            provider, indicators o f service production, and data on community monitoring such as
            satisfaction surveys and household utilization audits. These data would form the basis o f
            disbursements to providers subject to verification o f enrollment and service production. I n
            addition, the system would contribute to the further refinement o f the resource allocation
            formulae.

          5. Impact o f the purchasing agent on the provider side

               An essential part o f the reform i s the creation o f a new institution (SODEM) that would
               receive resources from the central government for the purchase o f essential services from
               providers for the poor. This design raises potential questions regarding: (i)      availability of
               provider capacity to meet the additional demand for services; (      ii)increased funding to the
               public sector and i t s potential fiscal implications; (iii)
                                                                          generating a competitive environment
               for private providers; and (iv) additional fragmentation in an already fragmented health
               system.

               The reform i s being designed taking into consideration supply side constraints and attempts to
               avoid potential inflation of health services generated by the purchase of essential services for
               the poor. During the f i r s t A   PL phase, services would be purchased for the targeted
               population mainly from Ministry o f Health facilities and Social Insurance institutions. Given
               that the targeted population would be largely located in marginal urban areas and rural areas,
               a large part o f the provision o f services would come from the SSC, which has an estimated
               excess capacity o f about 40 percent. Investments in additional public sector infrastructure are
               not considered in this proposed Project but the MOH included in i t s budget some resources to
               continue a basic certification process of primary health care facilities. Thus, the purchase o f
               services for the targeted population constitute an additional demand for health services from
               population groups which are currently not covered by social insurance and the additional
               demand would be met using idle health providing capacity.

               An additional concern i s that the purchase of services from public sector facilities and social
               insurance institutions would imply an increase in supply side subsidies generating unfair
               competition for the private sector providers. The purchase scheme has been designed to
               minimize this risk. The cost o f the benefits guaranteed by the government per capita was
               estimated at US$45 per annum. The SODEM would pay only 20 percent o f this cost to the



                                                              38
MOH, which i s the incremental cost of additional care per patient above the financing for
fixed-costs already received through budget transfers. Also, where other provider i s already
receiving funding from the government to pay for patient services (Le,, SSC, Sociedad de
Lucha Contra el Cdncer (SOLCA), Sociedud de Beneficiencia), the SODEM would negotiate
to pay a reduced percentage o f the per capita rate to reflect the incremental cost of services
delivered. Most o f the expenditure would go to cover services provided by MOH (80 percent
years 1 and 2, 75 percent year 3 and 60 percent year 4) with additional public and private
providers being contracted to reach population coverage levels proposed by the project.

Finally PROAUS would not constitute additional fragmentation of the health financing
systems iii Ecuador. The beneficiary population o f PROAUS i s currently not covered by
insurance and the health services would be paid out of general revenues. Thus there i s no
additional fragmentationo f risk pools.

       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

Implementing Entities

PROAUS would be executed through the Secretariat for the MDGs (SODEM) that w i l l implement and
administrate de Universal Health Insurance System and would have the role o f purchasing services for i t s
beneficiaries.

MEF would finance PROAUS and be required to transfer resources to cover the operation o f the SODEM
(financing guaranteed services, operating costs, guarantee fund, investments required for the functioning
of AUS), as well as to transfer resources to sustain a baseline o f financing to PROAUS service providers
and to strengthen the service provision network of the M O H and other public sector actors. As well,
MEF would be responsible for monitoring the achievement o f the performance matrix.

The PROAUS would be overseen by the Consejo Consultivo del Sistema de Aseguramiento Universal en
Sulud (CCAUS), a public body established to oversee the PROAUS and establish i t s operational
regulations, and report to the MEF about i t s operations. The management board o f CCAUS i s constituted
by representatives o f the MOH, the National Health Committee (CONASA), SODEM, E S S and other
health-related institutions.

CCAUS would define the specific regulatory procedures for AUS. I t would also be responsible for
determining standards o f internal control and for monitoring and evaluation.

Other regulatory responsibility would be undertaken by CONASA, the MOH and the IESS. The
responsibility for coordinating between the diverse actors across the system would be that o f CONASA,
who would provide the regulatory criteria with respect to coordination o f services. The M O H would be
responsible for establishing the policies and technical norms treatment, service provision and licensing in
accordance with the legal standards currently in force. The E S S would define the technical instrument
for the accreditation of providers.

At the provider level a number o f actors would be involved in the provision o f services: MOH, E S S ,
SSC, municipalities and other private providers. Providers would be responsible for the administration o f
the global service contract, verification and application o f the regulations for internal control and for
administering the provider information system.

In brief, the specific overall responsibilities o f each institutiodentity are as follows:

       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

As part of the identification mission (August 8-11, 2005) a preliminary Financial Management (FM)
Assessment o f SODEM was performed. During the appraisal mission conducted on site and via video
conference on October 17 to 19, November 21, 2005 and December 14, 2005 by the Financial
Management Team for Ecuador in connection with the staff o f the Implementing Entity, this assessment
was completed in accordance with OP/BP 10.02 and the Guidelines for Assessment o f Financial
Management Arrangements in World Bank Projects.

Executive Summary and Conclusions

Implementing Agency i s a new institution, and effective project execution would be dependent on strong
inter-agency coordination. The innovativeness and special implementation arrangements defined for the
project require a robust financial management system. At appraisal, inherent and control risks were both
rated high. One o f the principal risks relate to the possibility o f errors and manipulation o f the lists o f
registered beneficiaries. Several risk mitigation measures have been proposed:- 1) project design provides
for institutional strengthening and capacity for carrying out continuous financial and technical audits and
surveys, such as medical audits, household surveys and health care utilization audits, a monitoring,
evaluation and continuous auditing system would be developed to create a register o f enrollees, including
demographic data and the reference provider, indicators o f service production; 2) disbursement requests
would be accompanied by a certification from an audit and contract specialist, that transfers for Capitation
Premia to Participating Health Care Providers (under a Health Care Agreement or Health Care Contract),
have been made; 3) annual external audits should include a review o f the internal audit certification
process referred to above and; 4) conditions o f disbursement for access to funds under Component 2 (b
and c) have been established in a Performance Matrix and include some related to financial management
(at least 60 percent of the contracts executed with the service providers should have been audited and the
fraud reporting systems validated by external audit).

Implementing Entity, Organization Structure and Staffing

Currently, the GOE i s launching the Universal Health Insurance initiative - AUS, which aims to increase
coverage under the existing social health insurance schemes, as well as introducing a new nominal
publicly subsidized health insurance project (PROAUS) targeting those in the f i r s t and second income
quintiles not otherwise covered by existing programs. The Health Insurance Project would be
implemented by SODEM with participation o f CCAUS, CONASA, MSP, SWS-SELBEN, MEF and
Public and Private Providers of health service. Private and public providers would be involved in the
provision of services: MOH, IESS, SSC, municipalities and would be responsible f o r the administration
of the global service contract, verification and application o f the regulations for internal control and
administration o f the provider information system.

CCAUS would be responsible for overseeing the implementation o f PROAUS and coordinating between
the different actors across the National Health System through regulatory criteria.
SODEM would execute several Institutional Cooperation Agreements with all participating entities
including the Ministries of Public Health and Social Welfare, CCAUS, E S S , ISSFA, ISSPOL, STFS-
SELBEN and health service providers.




                                                     43
Disbursement Arrangements

Two disbursement mechanisms would be used:-for category 1 the project would have access to funds
advanced by the Bank through a Special Account for processing disbursements for eligible expenditures
under the project. The borrower should submit the first withdrawal application (Application 1903) to the
World Bank requesting the initial advance amount to the Special Account. Partial advances may be made
to the Special Account as long as the aggregate amount advanced does not exceed the authorized
allocation. T h i s amount would be determined by the World Bank. Deposits into the Special Account and
replenishments up to the authorized allocation set out in the Legal Agreement would be made on the basis
o f withdrawal applications prepared by SODEM. The withdrawal applications would be accompanied b y
the supporting documentation in accordance with Bank disbursement procedures. The Special Account i s
only to be used for eligible expenditures under the loan (under no circumstances may funds in the Special
Account be used to cover the share o f expenditures corresponding to the counterpart).

Withdrawal applications under Category 2 should be presented on a quarterly basis and the Borrower
should cause SODEM, prior to the submission o f each such Loan withdrawal application, to furnish to the
Bank a report in accordance with the provisions o f the Project Operational Manual confirming, validating
and certifying that transfers for Capitation Premia to Participating Health Care Providers under a Health
Care Agreement or Health Care Contract have been done. Disbursements should be calculated by
multiplying the Enrolled Population by the Enrolled PopulatiodProduction Tracers Formula o f the
Performance Matrix. The methodology for collecting, compiling and validation o f information necessary
for preparing the disbursement request has been documented in the Operations Manual.

External Audit

In accordance with the Memorandum of Technical Understanding, the Controller General o f the State
would be responsible for hiring independent private auditors acceptable to the Bank under a multiple year
contract. SODEM would prepare Terms o f Reference (TORs) and submits for the World Bank - No
Objection. Annual project financial statements would be audited in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (ISAs) issued by the International Federation o f Accountants (IFAC). I n addition
to the standard TORs for investment projects, the TORs would include special procedures to provide
additional fiduciary assurance on the preparation o f disbursement request. Audit cost would be covered
by loan funds. Acceptable audit reports should be submitted to the Bank within the six months o f the end
of the Borrower's fiscal year.

Financial Reporting and Monitoring

The SODEM would be responsible for preparing all the financial statements and reports required for
ensuring that all the necessary information are available for decision making, audits and supervision
missions. The borrower should prepare and furnish to the Bank not later than one month after the end of
each calendar quarter, interim un-audited financial reports for the Project covering the quarter. The
interim un-audited financial reports required by the Bank should include: a ) Statement o f Sources and
Uses of Funds; b) Statement o f Cumulative Investments; c) Statement o f Expenditures (SOE); d)
Statement o f the Special Account and e) Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The financial
statements would include all sources and uses o f funds o f the whole project and would be available by
categories and components. They should be prepared in the local               y in accordance with the
accounting principles used in Ecuador, which are compatible with the          accounting standards. The
financial statements should include notes to the financial statements and disclose any additional
information.

Financial Management Action Plan

On the basis o f proposed project design, the financial management team has identified a minimum set o f
actions needed to ensure proper financial management arrangements, oversight and accountability, and
mitigation o f the control risks. The Financial Management action plan agreed with the borrower, brings
together planning, budgeting, accounting, financial reporting, internal control, auditing, and includes the
necessary steps t o achieve adequate resources management, and monitoring o f the use o f project
resources in order to reach the project development objectives.

At negotiations, the borrower submitted the Operational Manual, outlining fiduciary risk mitigation
measures encompassing: appropriate organizational structure; inter-agency coordination mechanisms;
information systems required to generate disbursement; and continuous financial and medical auditing
arrangements.

Supervision Plan

The Financial Management team would conduct a combination o f off-site and on-site supervision. Off
site supervision would consist o f quarterly desk reviews o f the interim financial statements and financial
monitoring reports and annual reviews of the external audit reports. Given the residual risk profile, on-site
supervision would be conducted at least three (3) times per year and should include revision o f the
disbursement reports and statements of expenditure on a sample basis.

                               Annex 8: Procurement Arrangements
       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

A. General

Procurement for Component 1 o f the proposed Project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and
the provisions stipulated in the Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure
categories are described in general below. For each contract to be financed b y the Loan, the different
procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs,
prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank in the
Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan w i l l be updated twice a year or as required to reflect the actual
Project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. Component 1 o f the proposed
Project does not include any procurement activity.

Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this Project would include: supply and installation o f
computer hardware for the operation o f the information system and data transmission network, software
licenses and supply o f power generators. The procurement w i l l be done using Bank's SBD for I C B and
SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for NCB. The Project also includes the procurement of,
installation, development and maintenance o f an information system. T h i s procurement w i l l be using
Bank's SBD for the procurement o f management information systems for ICB. However, the Project w i l l
analyze the convenience of procuring an information system currently installed in one o f the country
Health Insurance Providers through direct contracting method, after receiving Bank's prior approval.

Procurement of non-consulting services: Non-consulting services would include: internet service,
maintenance of computer hardware and data transmission, preparation of users data base, and registration
process at the PROAUS. The procurement w i l l be done using Bank's SBD for ICB; and SBD agreed with
or satisfactory to the Bank for NCB and shopping, with the exception o f the preparation o f users data base
that would be procured following direct contracting procedure.

Selection of Consultants: Consultant services to be procured under this Project would include: operation
of a Help Desk, design o f strategies for increasing the coverage o f the AUS, and technical assistance to
provide training on the use of the information system, finance, planning, management, and licensing.
Short lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract may
be composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the
Consultant Guidelines. The selection of consultants w i l l be done using Bank's RFP documents, with the
exception o f the consultants for the supply, development and implementation o f software for an
information system that will be under SSS.

Operating Costs: Operating costs to be financed by the Project would include: rental o f computer and
communication equipment. They w i l l be procured using SBD agreed with or satisfactory to the Bank for
N C B and shopping.

The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as model
contracts for goods procured, are presented in the Project Operations Manual.




                                                    46
B. Assessment o f the agency’s capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities w i l l be carried out by the SODEM (Secretaria Nacional de 10s Objetivos de
Desarrollo del Milenio) created recently by Presidential Decree o f July 13,2005 as a decentralized public
entity depending from the Presidency o f the Republic.
An assessment o f the capacity o f the SODEM to implement procurement actions for the Project has been
carried out by Marcel0 Osorio, PAS on November 25,2005. The assessment reviewed the organizational
structure for implementing the Project and the interaction between the project’s staff responsible for
procurement Officer and the Ministry’s relevant central unit for administration and finance. SODEM’s
current organization does not include any unit to carry out the procurement o f the goods and consulting
services. A small unit or team o f two procurement staff reporting directly to the Technical Director would
be created to carry out the above procurement. Alternatively, SODEM would contract Individual
Procurement Consultants to implement the procurement processes under a contract to be paid by product.
The key issues and risks concerning procurement for implementation o f the Project have been identified
and include: (a) l o w implementation capacity o f the SODEM, since it i s a new entity without previous
experience in procurement; (b) possible high turnover of the key staff (c) political influence in the
procurement processes.
The corrective measures which have been agreed are: (a) the loan agreement w i l l specify that all Project
procurement should be made following Bank Guidelines and agreed procedures; (b) before negotiations,
the SODEM must propose and discuss with the Bank team on the choice between hiring a procurement
staff or an external consultant under outsourcing, as well as the completion date o f employment /
contracting. Selection and employment o f the procurement staff or external consultant, as applicable,
should be completed before loan effectiveness; (c) The Project Operation Manual w i l l include: (i)
institutional and project procurement arrangements; (  ii)responsible staff for managing the procurement
processes; (  iii)the Evaluation Committee to be comprised of: the Administrative and Technical
Coordinators, the Legal Specialist, and one or two members o f the project line unit which generated either
goods or consulting services to be procured, and (iv) Project standard procurement documents to be
agreed with the Bank, as a specific annex to the Manual; (d) Annex 4 to the Loan Agreement would
include the requirement for the use o f standard bidding documents agreed in advance with the Bank for:
(i) Procurement under NCB, (       ii)Procurement under Shopping procedure, and (         iii)Selection o f
Consultants, and the use of standard Bank formats for the preparation o f bid evaluation.
The overall Project risk for procurement i s HIGH.

C. Procurement Plan

The Borrower submitted a draft procurement plan for Project implementation which provides the basis for
the procurement methods. This plan w i l l be discussed and agreed during negotiations between the
Borrower and the Project Team and the final version w i l l be available at SODEM. I t w i l l also be available
in the Project database and in the Bank’s external website. The Procurement Plan w i l l be updated in
agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual Project implementation
needs and improvements in institutional capacity.

D. Frequency of Procurement Supervision

In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity assessment o f
the Implementing Agency has recommended yearly supervision missions to visit the field to carry out
post review o f procurement actions.

                             Annex 9: Economic and FinancialAnalysis
       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

Economic Analysis:

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening of Management Information Systems for Monitoring,
Evaluation and Continuous Auditing

Investment in a Health Management Information Network for both AUS and i t s providers, technical
assistance and personnel training to support the setting o f contracts and provider payments, external
financial and technical audits and the implementation o f a communications strategy prove essential to the
implementation of the HISP. Economic benefits o f the strategy would be ameliorated given a timely and
effective implementation o f the elements described above. The repercussions o f not implementing an
appropriate information system would include unreliable information on enrollment, payment,
performance and audit reports. In order to attain a quality health service with adequate patient treatment,
loan proceeds w i l l be allocated to the training of personnel. Financial and technical audits are necessary in
order to verify and provide accurate information on the level o f service provided by contractors. Benefit
scenarios were estimated for the implementation of the PROAUS taking into consideration the adequate
implementation o f the activities in component 1 o f the project, and a second scenario where there i s poor
implementation o f information systems, personnel training and auditing, with a with a corresponding
reduction of benefits.

An economic evaluation o f the component was undertaken following accepted international standards for
estimating the present value o f benefits due to the implementation of HISP with and without institutional
strengthening of management information systems. The evaluation has shown a net present value o f
US$146 million and a rate o f return of approximately 948 percent using a discount rate o f 12 percent.


Component 2: Provision of support for the implementation and development of the Health
Insurance Strategy for the Poor

Benefits from implementing HISP are reflected in the preservation o f human capital through specific cost-
effective health interventions during a person’s life cycle which w i l l increase their capacities,
opportunities and functional life expectancy. The HISP includes the implementation o f a benefit package
which comprises mainly cost-effective interventions, including those that target the main causes o f
neonatal and infant mortality (diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases, as well as malnutrition and
inadequate prenatal care) and maternal mortality (hemorrhage and infections linked to unsafe deliveries
and complications from unsafe abortions). The benefit package also includes cost-effective interventions
for primary health care promotion, prevention and early detection o f illness to prevent complications.

An economic evaluation o f the HISP that w i l l be supported by this component, undertaken following
accepted international standards for estimating the present value o f future costs avoided in the targeted
population, has shown a substantial net present value o f US$354 million and a rate o f return o f
approximately 109 percent using a discount rate of 12 percent. Moreover, interventions are considered to
be cost-effective considering the significant importance o f neonatal mortality as a determinant o f infant
mortality in Ecuador.

Financial Analysis and Fiscal Impact: Implementing Management Information Systems for Monitoring,
Evaluation and Continuous Auditing, with a cost of $13 million, w i l l increase the rate o f return of the
investment made by the GOE in implementing the HISP, as shown in the economic analysis under
component 1. Therefore, fiscal impact i s assumed to be minimal. Under component 2, conditional
transfers w i l l help to reduce financial stress while improving the quality o f health expenditure, which w i l l
be reflected in the achievement o f the goals established under the performance matrix.

The GOE has estimated the annual cost of the benefit package per capita would be US$45. The definition
o f the package was established after a very comprehensive study of morbidity and mortality causes, as
well as the application o f the standards defined by CONASA. Based on these assumptions, the fiscal
impact in 10 years i s estimated to represent 0.32 percent o f GDP, assuming an average real annual growth
rate of 3.5 percent. This analysis also indicates that an incremental amount of resources (US$871 million)
required for investing in the new programs needed for meeting the MDGs i s feasible. The estimated
investments in a 10-year program represent 19.8 percent o f this amount. Under these circumstances the
fiscal impact o f the program could be considered moderate under a realistic economic scenario.

       HEALTH INSURANCE STRATEGY FOR THE POOR SUPPORT PROJECT

Environmental

The overarching objective o f the Project i s to increase the health insurance coverage o f the population in
the first and second quintiles o f the economy b y the end o f 2008. The Project would not finance any
health care infrastructure or directly procure medical supplies. Consequently, the Project i s not expected
to have any significant or direct environmental safeguard impacts. I t i s recognized, however, that the
increase in coverage could potentially lead to increased generation o f healthcare wastes in health
establishments that participate in the insurance scheme that would be supported b y the proposed project.

In this respect, regulations exist for the adequate management o f wastes from health establishments,
including infectious and special wastes (Registro Ofciul No. 106, January 1997). These regulations cover
                                                                                                           n
classification, segregation, storage, collection, transport, treatment and final disposal o f such wastes. I
addition, the regulations address monitoring of the implementation o f the regulations and sanctions for
non-compliance. Furthermore, according to information received from the Ministry o f Health,
implementation o f a Program for Management o f Hospital wastes (Progrurna de Munejo de Desechos
Hospitulurios) was initiated by the Ministry of Health in 1996. The objectives o f the program were to: (i)
reduce health r i s k s to healthcare workers from infections such as HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and C; and
inadequate management o f infectious wastes in health establishments; and (         ii)reduce environmental
pollution. An interinstitutional committee comprising representatives o f the Ministry o f Health, public
and private health institutions, NGOs, among others, was established. Subsequently, interinstitutional
committees were established at the provincial level, which had the responsibility for training healthcare
workers, and monitoring and evaluation o f the Program within health establishments in the provinces.
Coverage o f the program i s equivalent to 7,669 beds in private and state facilities in the areas o f
Chimborazo, Santo Domingo, Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, Esmeraldas, Loja, Pichincha, Azuay and Manabi.
Through these programs, more than 6,000 health workers have been trained and 126 workshops have
been organized in the period 1998 to date. The evaluations conducted under the program reveal that
compliance with the program increased from an average o f 43 percent in 1998 to 83 percent in 2004.
Furthermore, quantities o f hazardous healthcare wastes generated decreased from 23,669 kilograms in
 1999 to 5,500 kilograms in 2003.

The above results indicate that there have been improvements in healthcare waste management. I   n order
to take precautions against any potential environmental impacts o f the proposed project, as part o f the
contracts between the healthcare providers and the SODEM, the healthcare providers provide evidence
that their existing or planned healthcare waste management, storage, collection and disposal systems are
adequate and can accommodate any additional waste quantities that could occur as a result o f the
expanded coverage. This requirement would also be reflected in the Loan Agreement for the project.

Social

The Health Insurance Strategy for the Poor (HISP) w i l l address what was observed in the Ecuador
Poverty Assessment (World Bank, 2004), that health spending per capita in Ecuador was similar across
provinces and did not follow a pro-poor province pattern. T o that effect, the proposed Project w i l l target
the poorest two quintiles o f the population, which include the bulk o f the indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian
peoples. The first phase o f the Project w i l l focus on the Central Highlands provinces o f Tungurahua,
Cotopaxi, Chimborazo and Bolivar where the large majority o f the Kichwa population lives. I t w i l l also
include the cities o f Quito and Guayaquil.

The social assessment was a participatory effort carried out by the AUS Team, which included the MOH,
the National Directorate o f Indigenous Peoples at the MOH, and the Council for the Development o f the
Nucionalidudes y Pueblos Zndigenas of Ecuador (CODENPE). Consultations were also carried out with
SELBEN, U   N Population Fund (UNF’PA), and the Millennium Development Goal Commission.

As part o f Project preparation, an “Assessment o f the Needs and Demands o f Health Services,
Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices o f people with regard to health insurance” was carried out by the
CARE-Bloomberg Consortium o f the School o f Public Health o f Johns Hopkins University (February
2004). Based on the population distribution o f the 2001 Census, the study included a survey o f 10,000
households in urban and rural areas o f 16 provinces (10 in the Highlands, 5 in the Coastal Region and 1 in
the Amazonian Region.) The random sample consisted o f households in urban and rural areas. I t included
all quintiles of the population, but did not disaggregate population by ethnicity. The purpose o f the
assessment was three-fold: (a) to identify the needs and demands of health care services; (b) to establish
the health insurance situation o f interviewees; and (c) to analyze the levels of satisfaction with the quality
o f existing health care services. The study examined knowledge, attitudes and health care practices during
the previous year.


Some conclusions o f the assessment were:
   (a) 56 percent o f health care users used public health care facilities (48 percent MOH; and 6.7
       percent IESS); and 34 percent went to private facilities;
   (b) Public facilities receive the majority o f patients in urban areas, with an average o f 2 or 3 visits per
       year (MOH), and the level o f satisfaction i s 70 percent; whereas private facilities (Putrunatus
       Municipules) and private practitioners (NGOs and foundations) are more commonly used in rural
       areas, with the highest number o f visits per year (5 or 6) and the level o f satisfaction i s 80
       percent;
   (c) The five most common reasons to visit a health facility are related to General Health (58 percent):
       upper respiratory infections (26 percent) particularly in lowlands, followed b y gastro-intestinal
       problems and colic (9.6 percent) particularly in highlands; fractures and osteoporosis (6.6
       percent), kidney and urinary track infections (4.6 percent); migraine headaches (4 percent);
   (d) 12 percent o f cases demanded hospitalization;
   (e) Health care coverage o f M O H facilities i s 46 percent nation-wide; 23.3 percent by private
       doctors;
   (f) The most common reason not to visit a health care facility was economic (48 percent) particularly
       in rural areas (52 percent); 33 percent did not deem it necessary to go to a health facility;
   (g) In terms of cost, 28 percent o f health care services received were free o f charge; 32 percent o f
       users in rural areas and 20 percent in urban areas paid less than US$1 per visit (mostly primary
       and preventive health care). About 20 percent o f users nationwide and 29 percent in urban areas
       paid up to $5 per visit; 10 percent o f the general population paid US$10 or more. The average
       service cost i s US$5.50 nationwide, and $4.50 for rural areas;




                                                      52
   (h) Health Insurance. 18 percent o f the total population has health insurance, 78 percent of those
       from social security institutions and only 2 percent from private insurance providers. 20 percent
       o f people in Galtipagos, 14 percent in Coastal region, and 25 percent in the Highlands have some
       form o f health insurance;
   (i) Utilization o f health insurance. 38 percent of insured did not use the insurance the previous year.
       60 percent made 1 to 3 doctor visits, 21 percent made 4 to 6 visits, and 16 percent more than 7
       visits per year. 50 percent o f insured think the quality o f service was “good or very good”;
   6) The average income o f those insured i s $324 per month. It i s lower than the ‘canasta brisicu’
       which i s $380 to $400. 50 percent o f urban households live on less than $200 per month, and 40
       percent o f rural households live on >$lo0 per month;
   (k) Only 16.4 percent o f those insured use Free Child Delivery (Ley de Mutemidud Grutuitu) at the
       national level and 18.3 percent at rural level;
   (1) Un-insured population. 82 percent of the population does not have health insurance. Their
       average income i s $223 per month in general and $193 in rural areas;
   (m) Personal health insurance. The average payment for personal health insurance i s between $4 and
       $6; 32 percent o f surveyed people are willing to pay less than $1 for personal health insurance
       (less than the cost o f cigarettes or a coca cola);
   (n) Family health insurance. The average expenditure o f family health insurance i s between $4 (rural
       areas) and $9 (urban areas).

1. Health Insurance and Utilization of Health Services bv the Poor

The 2004 Demographic and Maternal-Child Health Survey (ENDEMAIN) conducted by the Center for
Population and Social Development Studies (CEPAR) has some o f the most updated data in terms o f
health service utilization. The survey was conducted in 29,000 households in 22 provinces, and
disaggregated by ethnicity.

According to the ENDEMAIN survey, 8lpercent o f the population does not have access to health
insurance, and 19 percent does. From these, 8 percent are covered b y the insurance provided b y the
Ecuadorian Social Security System (IESS), 8 percent by the Seguro Social Cumpesino (SSC), 2 percent
by private health insurance, and 1 percent by the Armed Forces (ISSSFA) or the Police Force (ISSPOL).

    M e n are more likely to be insured (21 percent) than women (17 percent), and the highest provider
    o f insurance i s either IESS or SSC. Children and youths are more likely to be uninsured. 91
    percent o f children 5 yrs old and younger, 88 percent o f adolescents and 83 percent o f youths are
    uninsured.
    There i s a correlation between level of schooling and health insurance. The higher the level o f
    education, the more likely to be insured. 50 percent o f people with tertiary education i s insured
    (31 percent by IESS, 9 percent combined with private insurance, 6 percent b y private insurance,
    and the rest by SSC, €FAA and Police.) Only 14 percent o f illiterate people &e insured, by the
    ssc.
      There i s also a correlation o f level of education and likelihood to use a health insurance. Only 9
      percent o f patients in the Amazonia, visit private doctors, and 7 percent public facilities. 16
      percent o f patients in the Highlands went to a private doctor and 14 percent to public facilities.
      Overall, 28 percent o f patients went to a private doctor and 14 percent to a public facility.
      Average schooling i s lower in Amazonia than in the Highlands.
      The reasons cited for not having health insurance are: (a) not old enough to be affiliated (28
      percent); self-employed (23 percent); does not work (23 percent); services are not accessible, cost
      o f services i s high (2 percent).
      Women, children and the elderly have the highest number o f health issues. 52 o f women, 60
      percent o f children 5 yrs old and younger, and more than 70 percent of people 60 yrs old and
      older, had a health problem.
      Approximately 50 percent o f people with health problems self-medicate.
      Access to services. From the total number of patients at the national level, 14 percent visited a
      private doctor, 6 percent went to the pharmacy, 4 percent went to a public hospital; 3 percent
      went to a health center; 4 percent went to a public Sub-center or health post; 2 percent to an IESS
      hospital or clinic, and 3 percent to private hospitals or clinics.
      Only 6 percent of the population use preventive health care services. People in the lowlands use
      them less often than the rest: 7 percent in Amazonia, 6 percent in Highlands and 5 percent in
      Coastal Region.
      Children <5 yrs and adults >75 yrs spent the least on health services. Youths between 15 and 19
      yrs old and adults between 45 and 59 yrs old spent the most.
      The most visited health units in urban regions are the private doctors (25 percent), private hospital
      or clinic (15 percent). In rural areas, public health centers (21 percent), private doctors (19
      percent), and public Sub-center or health post (18 percent).
      In general, 70 percent o f children c 5 yrs old visit public health facilities, while >30 yrs old visit
      mainly private doctors.

(n) Prenatal health care. 60 percent o f uneducated women and 97 percent o f women with tertiary
      education had at least one prenatal care visit.
( 0 ) 61 percent of prenatal care visits are done in public health units (25 percent in hospitals), and 39

(p) Child delivery. At the national level, 40 percent o f child deliveries are carried out in public
      hospitals; 18 percent carried out at home (12 percent assisted by a relative), 6 percent assisted b y
      a midwife). In rural areas, 34 percent o f deliveries are done at home. 59 percent o f illiterate
      mothers deliver at home, 19 percent in public health facilities, 7 percent in private facilities. 3

    (r) Approximately 50 percent o f illiterate women and 35 percent o f women with primary education
        did not spend money on child delivery. 43 percent o f women with tertiary education spent <$180
        in child delivery.

2. Project targeting and the SELBEN

Although it was corroborated by SELBEN (during the social assessment) that close to 95 percent o f
people in quintiles 1 and 2 have been identified b y the Juntas Parroquiules and included in SELBEN,
inaccuracy problems have been found in the registration system, with consequences for the beneficiaries
(i.e. beneficiaries of the Bono Solidario) therefore, further registration adjustments need to be made.
Also, SELBEN I     identifies the language o f the beneficiaries, but not ethnic background. SELBEN I1w i l l
allow identification o f the Indigenous, but not o f the Afro-Ecuadorians.

3. General situation o f ctuintiles 1 and 2 with regard to health

As stated in the Ecuador Poverty Assessment (World Bank, 2004), the microeconomic crisis o f 1998-99
and the dollarization resulted in the general impoverishment o f the Ecuadorian population. The poverty
rate escalated to 45 percent in 2001. The number of people living in poverty conditions went from 3.5
(1990) to 5.2 million (excluding the Amazonian peoples for lack o f data). Poverty increased more in
urban than in rural areas. The number o f poor people in urban areas went from 1.1 to 3.5 million.

Disaggregated data by ethnicity for quintiles 1 and 2 o f the population i s found in ENDEMAIN’s
Demographic Survey for Maternal and Child Health, 2004 (29,000 households in 22 provinces).

4. Legal Framework of Intercultural Health

A long tradition o f health care and medicinal practices that have been used for centuries, are currently
being used, and w i l l continue to be used in Latin America. Efforts to recognize ancestral health practices
in the M O H are evident since the early 1990s. T o that effect, the National Directorate o f Indigenous
Health (D.N.S.P.I) was created in 1999 (Decree No. 01642) in the MOH o f Ecuador with the purpose o f
operationalizing the Constitutional mandate (Art. 44 to 84) to (i)      promote the development and set the
norms of traditional medicine and intercultural health models that respond to the particular multi-ethnic
needs in the country; (ii)  carry out evaluation and control o f intercultural plans and programs. According
to the D.N.S.P.I., the above proposals have not been realized due to budgetary limitations. Therefore,
proposals in 2005 point to the creation o f the Sub-secretariat o f Intercultural Health within the MOH.

Since the early 1990s, Ecuador joined the Indigenous Peoples o f the international community in
subscribing to treaties and agreements to seek validation o f traditional practices. In 1993, the Pan-
American Health Organization launched the “Health Initiative o f Indigenous Peoples o f the Americas” to
recognize, validate and recover the cultural wealth and ancestral wisdom o f autochthonous peoples
towards the improvement o f their health and the quality o f their life. In 1998, Ecuador ratified the ILO
Convention 169 (Registro Ofcial No. 304) on Indigenous Peoples and Tribal Groups.

Several articles of the National Constitution o f Ecuador corroborate the need to set forth alternative
approaches to health care. Art. 43 guarantees the right to use alternative medicine; Art. 44 reads, “the
State will formulate the National Health Policy; it w i l l recognize and respect the development o f
traditional and alternative medicine and norm i t s application; i t w i l l promote scientific knowledge and
technology in health under bioethical principles; and Art 84 (3.3) promotes the right to “protect the
collective intellectual property o f ancestral medicine, i t s validation, use and development”, “including the
right to protect sacred places, plants, animals, minerals and ecosystems”.



                                                       55
In 2002 the National Health Council (CONASA), in i t s General Framework o f Structural Health Sector
Reform ratified the Plurality principle (under the Organic L a w o f the National Health System, Registro
Ofcial No. 670). Art. 5 states, “Respect for the differentiated needs and aspirations of social groups, by
promoting a pluri-cultural vision o f health practices”, and Art. 7 includes “the community health services,
traditional and alternative health agents” among the Members o f the National Health System.

The Pre-commission o f Intercultural Health under CONASA was created in 2002 to strengthen the
National Political and Technical Health Commission and the coordination o f Health Services Supply and
Management o f Integrated Health Models with an Intercultural focus.

The Congress for Health and L i f e (Ecuador, 2004) proposed the “development o f a Model o f Intercultural
Health (Modem and Autochthonous)” whose application would be mandatory in all the entities that are
part o f the National Health System with the following characteristics: integrated, ecological, bio-
psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, participatory, inter-sectoral, non-discriminatory, gender-focused
and efficient. It i s suggested that i t s implementation should be carried out b y a proposed Sub-secretariat
o f Intercultural Health within the M O H to be created in 2005.

5. DemograDhic Profile of Ecuador

Ecuador i s a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic and pluri-lingual country. The total population o f Ecuador i s 12.2
million inhabitants (census 2001). I t i s intrinsically rural (82 percent) compared to 18 percent urban
population. The 2001 census used the question of ‘self-identification’. The results were: 6.8 percent
(830,418) of the population i s indigenous; 2.2 percent (27 1,372) are Afro-Ecuadorian; 2.7 percent
(332,637) are mulatto; 10.5 percent (1,271,051) are white; and 77.4 percent (9,411,890) are mestizo.
Thus, the official total o f indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian and mulatto i s 12 percent of the total population.

The Nacionalidades and Pueblos o f Ecuador and their Institutions

There are 13 autochthonous nacionalidades” and 14 pueblos”                  in Ecuador. The number o f indigenous
peoples varies according to the data source.

6. Differences in Health Conditions between non-indigenous and those o f the Nucionulidudes and
Pueblos of Ecuador (INEC 2001 Census, 2004 ENDEMAIN survey)

The direct correlation between indigeneity, rural setting, and lower health care conditions i s reflected in
the data provided by the Census and the ENDEMAIN survey below.

Illiteracv rates. A t the national level, illiteracy for indigenous women 10+ yrs old (30.7 percent) almost
doubles that of men (16.8 percent). The highest illiteracy rate for autochthonous people corresponds to the
Highland provinces o f Carchi (34. l),        Bolivar (33. l),Chimborazo (31.7), Cotopaxi (30.5), Imbabura
(29.8), Caiiar (20.5 percent). These provinces hold the bulk o f the indigenous Kichwa of Ecuador.

Schooling. The average schooling for indigenous who had access to a school i s 4.0 yrs. The lowest
schooling rates (of those who have access to a school) correspond to the Highland provinces cited above.

Economically-active population and child labor. Approximately 60 percent o f economically-active
indigenous are self-employed in agriculture, hunting and fishing, and 25 percent in trade, construction and
manufacturing. 3.1 percent (10,700) o f children working on steady jobs are 5-1 1 yrs old.

Water, sanitation. and electricity. 22.8 percent o f indigenous have water connection inside the house, 49.2
have connections outside the house, 47.2 percent have public connections, 11.8 percent draw water from

well, 34.2 percent from rivers, and 2.2 percent purchase water from tanks. 40 percent deposit trash on
contiguous lot or creek, 28.3 percent bum or bury it, and 22.1 percent have trash collection.

Electricity, telephone, and fuel for cooking. 73 percent have electricity (94 percent in urban, and 68
percent in rural areas). 95 percent of indigenous do not have a phone. 5 1.4 percent use wood for cooking,
and 45 percent use gas.

Average number of children per woman. The indigenous and non-indigenous women without education
have the highest number o f children. The national child fecundity rates are 3.9 children per woman in
rural areas and 2.9 children per woman in urban areas (difference o f 1 child per woman). The average
number o f children per indigenous woman i s 4.9. Uneducated women have an average o f 5.7 children,
whereas women with tertiary education have 2.0 children on average (a difference o f 3.7 children).
5 lpercent o f non-indigenous and 63 percent of indigenous mothers interviewed do not wish to have more
children.

Family planning. I t i s generally determined by women. 51 percent o f uneducated women and 80 percent
of women with tertiary education use family planning. Family planning methods are generally used by
non-indigenous women, and only 47 percent o f indigenous women living with a man use a FP method.
The most common method in Ecuador i s sterilization. While 25.3 percent o f non-indigenous women are
sterilized, only 9 percent o f indigenous women are. While 14.2 percent o f non-indigenous use the pill,
only 3.5 percent o f indigenous do. While 10.3 percent o f non-indigenous women use IUD, only 7.5
percent of indigenous women use it. Although modem methods are more common than traditional ones
(58. vs. 14 percent) in urban and rural areas, the most common methods used by indigenous women are
the rhythm (8.9 percent) and withdrawal (12 percent). Condoms are only used b y 1.8 percent of
indigenous and 4 percent of non-indigenous men. Private health facilities are the main providers o f
modem FP methods for both indigenous and non-indigenous women.

Pre and post-natal care and child delivery. In the past 10 years prenatal care and institutional child
delivery have increased steadily, but post-natal care only shows a slow increase. Prenatal care during the
first term i s two times more common for mestizo women (70 percent) than for indigenous (33 percent).
Institutional delivery i s 80 percent for mestizo and 30 percent for indigenous women. Cesarean sections
are 27.8 percent for mestizo and 6.4 percent for indigenous. Post-partum controls are also more common
for mestizo women (37 percent) than for indigenous (15 percent). Pap smear tests and Mammograms are
three times more common for non-indigenous than for indigenous.

Infant and child mortalitv. Infant mortality has decreased from 40 to 29/1,000 during the last decade.
Infant and child mortality are correlated with residence, level o f education and ethnic group. The rate of
infant mortality for babies 0-11 months old i s 40/1,000 live births for indigenous and 27/1,000 for non-
indigenous. Child mortality (1-4 yrs) i s 8/1,000 for indigenous and 5/1,000 for non-indigenous.

Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding i s a generalized practice, however, breastfeeding during the first hour of
baby’s life, and exclusive breastfeeding during the first three months o f life i s more common for
indigenous (3 1.3 and 79.6 percent respectively) than for non-indigenous (26.5 and 43.7 percent
respectively). In contrast, regular health check-up for newborns are more common for non-indigenous
(41.2 percent) than for indigenous (20.6 percent).

Diarrheic (22 percent) and upper respiratorv infections (46 percent) do not vary much depending on the
area of residence of the mother. However, diarrhea i s more common in rural areas and in indigenous
communities, and upper respiratory infections are more common in urban areas.




                                                   59
Immunizations. The ENDEMAIN survey found that slightly more than 50 percent o f children in general,
and 1/3 o f indigenous children had up-dated immunization records. I t alerts that provision of
immunizations i s consistently lower for indigenous (32 percent) than for non-indigenous (55 percent), for
example Polio (45.2 percent), DPT (52 percent), Chicken pox (38 percent), etc.

Malnutrition and stunted nowth. One in 4 children has chronic malnutrition. Malnutrition and stunt
growth are twice as high among indigenous (46.9 percent) than among mestizo (21.1 percent). The highest
levels of chronic malnutrition are found in children of indigenous women (47 percent), of uneducated
mothers (38 percent), and children residing in rural areas (31 percent).

Awareness o f HIV/AIDS and STDs. Approximately 63 percent o f interviewed women 15-49 years old
know how the infections are transmitted but only 8 percent o f those know the three ways to prevent it
(sexual abstinence, fidelity, use o f condoms). The lowest levels o f awareness were found in the Amazonic
Region, women between 15-19 years old, uneducated women, and indigenous women.

7. General Recommendations

            1. Incorporate the ‘ethnic variable’ to all data collection systems.
            2. Provide accreditation to health care services providers (public or private) that include in
                their supply Intercultural Health Care services. Offer training to qualified providers so
                that they can include Alternative health care. Evaluate quality o f Intercultural Health care
                for renewal o f accreditation.
            3. Conform and/or strengthen “Intercultural Health Care Service networks” (inter-
                institutional, extra-sectoral) which include ambulatory, primary, secondary and tertiary
                health services by means of integrating M O H services with Traditional Medicine
                networks in the Micro-regions as well as the local levels.
            4. Formulate a Participation and Gender Strategy or “veedurias” for the implementation o f
                PROAUS to include the MOH, CONASA, SSC, IESS, ISSFA, ISSPOL, National
                Directorate of Indigenous Health (DNSPI), CODENPE and CODAE, and their
                representatives at the provincial, municipal and local levels. “Veedurias” would both
                participate in the promotion o f AUS, and perform social auditing at the different levels.
            5. Carry out research on Intercultural Health Care to systematize existing experiences o f
                access and utilization of Intercultural Health practices characteristic to the largest ethnic
                groups. AUS should identify research areas consistent with health care services covered
                by the Health Plan.
            6. Carry out a study to systematize the existing information and elaborate an Intercultural
                Health Manual, which should be used to train policy makers (MOH, CONASA, SODEM,
                IESS, SSC, ISSFA, ISSPOL, D.N.S.P.0 and other health care providers (MDs, Yachac,
                midwives, promoters, local health agents, health brigades, NGOs, etc) including those to
                be accredited.
            7. Organize a Promotion and Communication campaign through the health and indigenous
                networks, Regional and Zonal Assemblies, radio spots and local advertising.
            8. Organize a Participatory Monitoring system o f “veedurias” where local organizations
                (i.e. Juntas Parroquiales, Health Units or Health Committees) meet monthly to discuss
                AUS, quality o f service delivery and beneficiary satisfaction. Meetings should
                infondsuggest service providers o f adjustments to be made.
            9. Evaluate the existing experience o f implementation o f the Free Maternity L a w
                particularly for quintiles 1 and 2 in order to analyze the impact on the poor and to adjust
                the supply to respond to the culture and cosmo-vision of the beneficiaries.
            10. Make more efficient use of reference and counter-reference systems, particularly for the
                attention o f reproductive health, maternal and child health care.

              11. Family planning should be more targeted to the uneducated and indigenous women, and
                  it should also include men.
              12. An awareness campaign about HIV/AIDS and STDs i s recommended for youths,
                  uneducated women and indigenous men and women.


                      Indigenous And Afro-Ecuadorian Peoples And Gender Plan

Given that the present Project w i l l benefit the bulk o f the Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples, the
O.P. 4.10 applies. With technical assistance of the Bank, the Ecuadorian Government (inc. CODENPE
and the D.N.S.P.I.) has formulated the following Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) to incorporate the
participation o f autochthonous peoples during Project design and particularly during implementation,
monitoring, social auditing, and evaluation. The P P with an earmarked budget has been approved by the
GOE. I t has been disseminated in Ecuador and through the Bank InfoShop and w i l l be incorporated in the
Project Operational Manual. The IPP includes four parts, as follows:

1. Participatory Monitoring

Objective: to create a social control network “social auditing or veedurias” within the circles which make
decisions in terms of norms and regulations of PROAUS, and have the power to demand quantity and
quality of health care services rendered (stakeholders and beneficiaries). Participatory monitoring o f
PROAUS indicators would be implemented at all levels: central, provincial and municipal, and local.

Activities:

          Incorporate the ‘ethnic’ and ‘gender’ variables to all data collection systems.

          At the central level: A representative o f the Consejo de Nacionalidades y Pueblos del Ecuador
          (CODENPE), the Afro-Ecuadorian Development Corporation (CODAE) as well as a
          representative of the Direccidn Nacional de Salud de 10s Pueblos Indigenas (D.N.S.P.I.), and
          women’s organizations should be present in the monthly meetings of the SODEM to bring up
          issues related to AUS and to provide guidance on how to improve said services.

          At the provincial and municipal levels: representatives o f the Indigenous Organizations, and
          civil society should be present at the monthly meetings camed out by AUS to discuss progress
          and issues with AUS, and to provide guidance to and participation in the solution o f problems
          encountered.

    (d) At the local level @arroquias): the Juntas Parroquiales together with public providers such as the
         MOH, SSC, IESS, ISSFA, ISSPOL), indigenous and non-indigenous organizations, private
         providers and civil society should decide how the ‘veeduria social’ should be organized to carry
         out participatory monitoring o f AUS at the local level. The veeduria would monitor health
         improvement in the population, as well as issues in the delivery o f health care services by
         providers. Monitoring at the local level would act as a thermometer o f impact o f AUS. The
         SODEM should provide guidelines on the formation o f “veedurias”, based on the work b y the
         National Council o f Women (CONAMU) and LMGYAI on this subject.

Each level should raise issues to the subsequent higher level.




                                                     61
2. Inclusion o f “Intercultural Health with a Gender Approach” in the Guaranteed Health Benefit Plan to
be contracted by SODEM

The accreditation process of PROAUS health service providers should include a provision to contract
accredited providers who include an “Intercultural Basic Health Care Package o f Services” which
includes         the modem Medicine package offered by the MOH, AND the traditional health care
package offered b y traditional caregivers (approved by the MOH). Efforts should be made to offer both
types o f health care services in the same facilities.

Objectives:
        To attract indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian families o f different cultural background who would
     otherwise not access the PROAUS health care providers (particularly M O H Centers, Sub-centers),
     in search o f free preventive or curative health care, pre- and post-natal care, and professionally
     assisted child delivery (inc. certified midwives).
        To provide the patient with a choice o f alternative methods for prevention and cure o f basic
     health care (diarrheic infections, URIs, pre- and post-natal care and delivery).
        To support the traditional network of promoters and midwives by training and accrediting them as
     providers o f specific services covered by PROAUS.
        Train MOH health care providers on “intercultural preventive and curative practices” to ensure a
     safe practice o f traditional services.
        To encourage traditional practices which are proven to be beneficial, and to discourage practices
     that may harm patients’ health.

Activities:

     PROAUS should adjust the Actual Benefit Plan to allow modem and traditional providers to
     participate. Also, PROAUS should agree on the package o f Intercultural health care services and
     practices (modem and traditional) that i t w i l l buy from providers. I t should also agree on the
     eligibility criteria o f service providers. Providers offering mobile brigades should be used for
     reaching out in rural areas. The health service provision campaign shall begin with mobile brigades.

     Conduct a study that compiles knowledge and experience on Intercultural Health Care practices in
     Ecuador to highlight best practices to be incorporated in the Manual. The study should carry out a
     desk review o f previous studies and consultations (or workshops).
     Source o f funds: Japanese Grant. US$80,000.

     Elaborate a Manual on Intercultural Health Care (Consultancy in coordination with the D.N.S.P.0
     which includes the Health Benefit Plan covered by PROAUS, which i s presently offered by the
     MOH, AND the alternative/ traditional health care practices approved b y CONASA. The idea i s to
     provide the patient with alternative preventive and curative options. The elaboration o f the Manual
     must be coordinated with the D.N.S.P.I., and in consultation with universities working on the topic
     o f intercultural health, i.e. the University o f Nucionulidudes and Pueblos Indigenas Amuwtuy Wusi.
     The Manual should include best practices with intercultural health.
     Source o f funds: SODEM US$50,000.




                                                   62
3. Promotion and Dissemination o f HISP

Objective: T o reach target beneficiaries (Quintiles 1 and 2) with enough information about the
opportunities offered by AUS, and to attract them to use the services.


Activities:
(a)      Introduction o f HISP in the community assemblies organized by the Juntas Purroquiules, Health
         Committees, public and private health care providers, D.N.S.P.I., indigenous organizations.

(b)     Radio spots at the provincial, municipal and local level.
        Source o f funds: SODEM. US$30,000.

(c)     Color laminated posters to be displayed in key places in communities (health posts, municipality,
        and schools). Posters should capture regional symbolism and languages to convey PROAUS
        messages. Source o f funds: SODEM. US$ 10,000.

4. Training on Intercultural Health

Objective: T o train eligible health care providers in “Intercultural Health Care Practices” covered by
AUS, and accredit them as ‘PROAUS providers’.

Activities:
Training and accreditation o f M O H and other public providers, private providers as well as traditional
health care providers (midwives, promoters, healers) on intercultural health practices approved in HISP.
Themes that cuts across the training should be: quality (culidud y culidez), efficacy and efficiency of
health care delivery. Source o f funds: Component I   Io f the EC-Universal Health Insurance Project.

                       Subject: Health Insurance Strategy for the Poor Support Project

This is to inform you that the Government of Ecuador has defined as Policy o f State the design
and implementation of a Universal Health Insurance Program, PROAUS, which has a mininiuin
duration o f eight years.

As a result, the government has requested the World Bank i t s support for the preparation o f a
loan that will support the implementation of such program. Therefore, the financial instrument
that has been identified as most appropriate for this program i s the Adaptable Program Loan
(APL). This A P L will be divided in two phases for a period o f four years each. The Health
Insurance Strategy for the Poor Support Project that i s under preparation constitutes the first
phase o f this operation.
