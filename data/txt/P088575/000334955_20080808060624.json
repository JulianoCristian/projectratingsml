REFORM", "versiontyp": "Final", "loan_no": "7361", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The US$90 million loan for the Health\n            Insurance Strategy for the Poor Support Project for Ecuador\n            was approved on February 16, 2006, signed on June 5, 2006\n            and declared effective on June 6, 2006. There was some delay\n            during the first weeks of project implementation, as a\n            result of the lack of operational experience of the\n            implementing agency and the imminent change of Government.\n            The Borrower requested the first loan disbursement in the\n            amount of US$1 million on December 24, 2006, just 20 days\n            before the change of Government administration. Initial\n            funds were allocated to finance some of the initial\n            operational activities, mainly hiring of personnel. However,\n            three weeks later, the new Administration decided not to\n            start implementation of projects financed by the World Bank.\n            On the sectoral side, one of the new administration's\n            first actions was to dissolve the Secretar\u00eda Nacional de los\n            Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio (National Secretariat\n            for the Milenium Development Goals) (SODEM), which\n            contributed to weakening the sectoral dialogue. A World Bank\n            mission visited Ecuador in the beginning of March, 2007 to\n            work with officials in the Ministry of Health (MOH), explore\n            alternative options to implement the Project, introducing\n            changes in its design, if necessary. The team organized a\n            visit to Argentina with the new MOH insurance team to\n            supervise the findings of a similar operation that was\n            implemented in Argentina. However, the new Administration\n            cancelled the trip and requested the cancellation of the\n            Bank's loan. Due to the political context during that\n            time, which led to the cancellation of loans for other\n            Bank-financed projects, the Bank decided strategically to\n            postpone its official response to gain time to find a\n            solution to this matter and to re-establish dialogue with\n            the new Government. The Government, however, maintained its\n            position with respect to the projects financed by the Bank.\n            A letter cancelling the US$1 million loan balance was sent\n            to the Government on August 27, 2007. The Government of\n            Ecuador (GOE) fully reimbursed the disbursed amount of\n            US$1.0 million on January 9, 2008."}, "docdt": "2008-07-14T00:00:00Z"}
