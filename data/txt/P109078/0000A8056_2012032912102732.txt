                         Overall the CF will help the Government of Mauritania to accelerate the implementation of the Government' s Education Sector Development Program (ESDP 2001-2015)
                         in its entirety. Activities financed by the CF are within the ESDP's plan of action over the period 2008-2010. CF would have the following more specific objectives: (i)
                         promote access to education, and improve equity and retention in the sector by building additional classrooms in existing incomplete schools and through the
                         acquisition of equipment, furniture and the expansion of school feeding program; (ii) improve the quality of the pedagogical content of the primary education and the
                         internal efficiency of the education system; (iii)     improve the quality of teaching and the internal efficiency of education to improve monitoring and management of the
                         education system.

                         program PDO as stated in this ISR. As such, the following objectives were met: National average of access to grade 1 stands at 105.3%, ratio girls/boy is 1.07, retention increased to
                         65.2%; quality of pedagogical content has been boosted by the acquisition of 2,776,314 textbooks to achieve 4:1 textbook:student ratio, improved internal efficiency is evidenced by
                         maintenance of the low repetition rate since 2008 at 2.7% and the 39:1 student:teacher ratio, quality of teaching has increased through the training of teachers and resulted in

                         improved completion rates at the primary level (73.1%). However, achievement of the PDO will be rated marginally unsatisfactory for the time being in the absence of further analysis
                         and data. The ICR would therefore pay particular attention to the collection of data and evidence that might warrant upgrading the PDO rating.

                         Component-specific achievements are as follows:

                         Component 1: The component of promoting access to education, and improve equity and retention in the sector has been supported by the following: (i) 592 classrooms have been
                         built and equipped as of February 2012, and it is expected that the March 2012 data will show having met or surpassed the targeted 600 classrooms (a total of 632 classrooms were
                         being constructed/rehabilitated); (ii) 30,000 student desks have been purchased and distributed (an activity not included in the project description but in the project costing tables in
                         the PAD); (iii) 747 parents’ associations were trained in canteen management; and (iv) the school feeding program has been implemented trough the assistance of the World Food
                         Program, benefiting 145,589 children in the poorest areas for 54 days, twice a day. Available data indicates that, between 2008 and 2011: (a) primary GER increased from 95% to
                         97%; (b) retention rate increased from 58.6% to 65.2%; (c) girls participation in primary education rose from 50.03% to 50.35%; and (d) the proportion of school offering complete
                         primary education increased from 43% to 80%. However, the activities related to the decentralization process could not be carried out due to lack of funding (i.e. creation and training
                         of school boards now financed by UNICEF, training of parents' associations in textbook and school management, sub-project planning and supervision etc.); and girls’ schooling
                         sensitization campaigns. In terms of sensitization campaigns, however, UNICEF undertook the study on barriers to girls’ schooling (finalized in December 2011, which will be used for
                         the new project currently under preparation) and the government continues its program to celebrate the best performing girls during a graduation ceremony which has been very
                         successful in keeping girls in secondary education.

                         Component 2: Improve quality of pedagogical content of primary education and the efficiency of the Education system has been supported through the purchase of 2,776,314
                         textbooks (and teachers' guides), which (once distributed) will raise the textbook: student ratio from 2:1 to 4.6:1. Unfortunately, the acquisition of books for reading corners and
                         libraries was not carried out due to lack of funding. On the other hand, the implementation of the textbook policy was carried out (i.e. availability of textbooks in schools at no cost)
                         with exception of the liberalization of textbook publishing.

                         Component 3: Quality of teaching and internal efficiency of education was supported through the financing of incentives to encourage teachers who are teaching effectively ("prime de
                         craie"). This incentive was supposed to ensure that teachers spend the required time in the classrooms teaching. Unfortunately, however, activities related to teacher evaluation to
                         monitor the most important aspects of classroom practice and teacher behavior (attendance, preparation of lesson plans, planning teaching for the school year, pupil evaluation) were
                         prepared by the Evaluation unit but not adequately budgeted. Furthermore, activities related to quality improvement in student examination and the student learning monitoring unit
                         (Cellule d’évaluation des acquis des élèves) were not fully carried out, although the team was trained in Dakar. These two activities are therefore included in the new project financed
                         by the Global Partnership for Education currently under preparation.

                         Disbursement: As of March 7, 2012, the Grant has been fully disbursed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project seems to have missed opportunities to address certain constraints, especially in terms of the PDO and related results framework development. This is mainly due to the
                         fact that when this project was prepared, FTI projects did not follow normal Bank procedures and so did not benefit from the same quality support as other projects did. However,
                         Bank team could have proposed a restructuring at the time of re-engagement in March 2010 after the 15 months suspension for instance, although not much progress had been
                         made, making it difficult for the team to assess the types of changes that were necessary. The objectives were very ambitious but since the project supported the government's
                         program, they both had the same objectives, which made it difficult for the project to show its contribution. However, the project did request To ensure completion of all activities
                         currently underway, a six-month extension until March 31, 2012 to ensure completion of all activities currently underway, and which was processed and approved on September 20,
                         2011. However, some activities under Component 3 such as teacher evaluation and student examination mechanisms were not budgeted adequately and could thus not be fully
                         carried out (only preparatory activities were done). Given the importance of those activities, the government decided to include their implementation in the 2012 - 2014 action plan.
