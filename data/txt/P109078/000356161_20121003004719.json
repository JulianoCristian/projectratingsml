Some lessons learned includes: special\n            agreements with United Nations agencies and other donors\n            should be cleared prior to project effectiveness. Project\n            implementation units within the ministry are more effective\n            than those outside the ministry structure. Community\n            participation for school construction is important for\n            ensuring low cost school construction and local ownership in\n            Mauritania. Joint government and donor annual sector reviews\n            are important for ensuring coordination of activities and\n            quality implementation in Mauritania. Project preparation\n            should include a quality review regardless of institutional\n            requirements. Projects must have adequate monitoring\n            arrangements in place prior to effectiveness.
