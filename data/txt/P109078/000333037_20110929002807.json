The project has\n            made significant progress and is poised to achieve a 100\n            percent disbursement of grant proceeds through the six month\n            extension. However, a few important activities have incurred\n            unforeseen delays: a) primary school construction that\n            experienced delays due to heavy rain; b) delivery of three\n            million textbooks for the three coming school years; and c)\n            30,000 student desks.
