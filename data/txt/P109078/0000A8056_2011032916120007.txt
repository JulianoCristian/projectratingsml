                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                          The first tranche of the Grant USD 5,000,000 has been used up. The transfer of the second tranche of the project amount (USD 9,000,000) has been made available to the Bank.
                         This transfer will accelerate implementation by supporting payment of contract under implementation; consequently, this will lower the disbursement lag. Currently an amount of USD
                         3,099,088.00 is under payment.
