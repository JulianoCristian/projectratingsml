                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         To ensure completion of all activities currently underway, a six-month extension until March 31, 2012 was processed and approved on September 20, 2011. However, some activities
                         under Component 3 such as teacher evaluation and student examination mechanisms were not budgeted adequately and could thus not be fully carried out (only preparatory
                         activities were done). Given the importance of those activities, the government decided to include their implementation in the 2012 - 2014 action plan.
