M4 AWOPANDU  AND RECOMMfENDTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA
FOR A SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
1. *     The following memorandum and recosmendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Bolivia for SDR 15.1 million (US$20.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and would help finance a Social
Investment Fund Project.  Cofinancing from various lenders and donors vould
complement IDA's financing.
2.       Background.  Poverty in Bolivia is deep-rooted, posing major
challenges to the country's economic and social development. With per capita
GNP of US$570 in 1987. large segments of the population of 7.1 million survive
on subsistence income. Life expectancy averages only 51 years for men and 55
for women. Infant mortality, estimated at 110 per 1,000 live births for the
years 1980-85. is twice the average for the region, and reaches 277 per 1,000
live births in some communities. The maternal mortality rate, at 48 per
10,000 b'Lrths, is the highest recorded in the region, and is associated with
high fertility, poor health conditions of mothers, and an extremely high
incidence of induced abortion. Malnutrition is widespread, with daily
nutrient intake in depressed urban and rural areas averaging only 60-65
percent of minimum requirements. Unsanitary living conditions exacerbate the
poor health status of the population; less than 60 percent of households have
access to piped (mainly unpotable) water and 42 percent have access to
hygienic excreta disposal. In spite of improvements in the last 30 years, the
coverage and quality of education remains a primary constraint to the
development of the country's human resources, and the-refore economic
devel'pment. About 37 percent of the adult population is illiterate; 70
percent of the illiterate population is rural, and 68 percent is female.
3.       rhese conditions are a consequence not only of long-standing
historical factors, but also of poor economic management during more than a
decade, which resulted in a decline in production (real GNP fell by 10 percent
from 1980 to 1985) and culminated in economic collapse in 1985. The
Government that took office in 1985 launched a comprehensive reform program,
which succeeded in stabilizing the economy. To cushion the worst effects of
poverty, the Government undertook a major initiative, creating the Emergency
Social Fund (ESF) (restructured with IDA's help in 1986), with the mandate to
provide temporary employment to those displaced by the economic crisis, and to
bolster basic social services, which had been cut sharply since 1980. IDA
supported the restructuring and operation of ESP with two credits: 1829-BO
for SDR 7.8 million, approved in June 1987, and 1882-BO for SDR 19 million,
approved in March 1988. Surpassing expectations, by October 31, 1989, over
1,990 subprojects were approved by ESP, of Wiich 1,243 had been completed,
generating over 500,000 man-months of employment. The Project Performance
Audit Report for the first ESF credit (1829-BO) (March 20, 1990) confirms the
expected benefits and considerable achievements of the ESF operations. One of
the lessons learned from the ESP experience is that, while a demand-driven
emergency program can help to lessen hardships from unemployment during
adjustment, alleviation of structural poverty requires greater direction and



-2-
care in targeting investments and services to ensure that the neediest groups
benefit and that their most urgent needs are addressed in a sustainable
manner. A second lesson concerns the value of cooperative relationships with
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other private groups working at the
local level; ESF achieved notable success in this regard, establishing an
encouraging precedent for future efforts.
4.       As employment rebounds in the more stsble economic and investment
climate, the new Government has placed poverty alleviation at the center of
its development program. Its strategy is to channel more resources to basic
health care and primary education, with particular attention to the needs of
rural areas, low-ineme urban districts, women, and other vulnerable groups.
IDA is supporting this approach with a recently approved Integrated Health
Development Project and through a primary education project, which is being
prepared. At present, the Ministries of Public Health and Education manage
high-priority programs for the delivery of basic services to a large portion
of the poor population and have allocated increased shares of their budgets
for this purpose, but they are still ill equipped for the role of targeting
multisectoral investments and services to the poorest segments of the
population.   Thus, while ESF operations will be closed by March 31, 1991, a
Social Investment Fund (SIF) has been created to channel financing to such
investments. Over the long term, as the sectoral ministries acquire the
necessary project planning, execution and evaluation capability, as well as
the ability to target benefits to the poorest segments of the population, SIP
itself would be phased out. SIF will adopt ESF's successful systems for
efficient financial management and supervision of subprojects, while improving
poverty targeting, and integrating its programming within the sector
strategies and investment plan: for health and education. SIF will also
strengthen subproject design based on impact evaluation of compl. ad ESF
subprojects. SIF has been established under the direct oversight of the
President of the Republic. To facilitate its coordination with the normative
ministries, the Under Secretary of Planning for Social Policy will sit on its
administrative council, and SIP's Executive Director will be a member of the
interministerial National Council for Social Policy (CONAPSO), which is
responsible for approving all social policies. Coordination agreements to he
signed by SIF and the Ministries of Health and Education, provide for periodic
review of SIP's program and targets, to ensure consistency with sector
strategies. Where applicable, standards established by the corresponding
ministries have been incorporated into SIF's subproject selection criteria.
As ESF is phased out, it will conduct a training program to disseminate its
system of information management for subproject appraisal and supervision to
other public agencies.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA country assistance strategy for
Bolivia is to support the Government's program in macroeconomic adjustment,
encouragement of private sector activity, and human resources development.
IDA's human resources strategy emphasizes: (a) long-term institutional
strengthening, with particular emphasis on efficiency of resource use and on
appropriate sector policies and strategies; (b) extension and strengthening
of primary health and education systems and related social services; and
(c) assistance to the Government in securing the external financing needed for
its development program. IDA's support for ESF, combined with its central
role in mobilizing more than US$100 million in cofinancing from both
multilateral lenders and bilateral donors, was critical in helping the
Government address the social costs of its stabilization and adjustment
program. The proposed project is an integral part of the package of actions



-3-
developed by the Government in coordination with donors to achieve the above
objectives and to make the transition from the emergency perspective of ESP to
a medium-term strategy. The Government's plan is consistent with IDA*s
macroeconomic and sector policy recommendations and complements a number of
ongoing. and proposed-projects, ineludings the Economic Man&gement
Strengthening Operation (EMSO), which supports improved coordination of public
irvestments; the Integrated Health Development Project (IHDP), which supports
improvement of the coverage, quality, and efficiency of basic health services
in four principal urban centers, and under which about US$5.3 mlllion would be
channeled through SIF; and a proposed primary education project, which would
support improved services in tandem with inititutional development.
6.       Proiect Obiectives.  The project would support the initial phase
(1990-93) of the SIF program to assist in alleviating the worst aspects of
poverty through improvement of the coverage and effectiveness of services in
health and education by: (a) devolving increased responsibility to the local
level and encouraging private sector participation through increased
cooperation with NGOs; (b) shifting priorities towards basic and preventive
health care and towards primary education, (c) improving the targeting of
social programs to the poor, and (d) facilitating coordination among
institutions active in the social sectors. It would also support improvement
of selected public sector institutions' project executing ipacity by training
them in the use of ESF's management information system.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed project would include:  (a) a SIF
subproiect component (US$87.3 million), consisting of financing for
subprojects to be approved by SIF during its first two years of operation;
(b) a SIP institutional development component (US$8.1 million), consisting of
support for (i) the operation of SIF during its first four years, including
salaries and training of fixed-term staff, (ii) purclase of office equipment,
and vehicles needed for SIP's operations; and (iii) technical assistance to
strengthen SIP's financial management and operational capacity; and (c) an ESF
training component (US$0.2 million), consisting of a program to familiarize
staff of other public sector institutions with ESP's information management
system used in appraisal and supervision of projects. SIP subprojects are
expected to have an average cost of about US$70,000 and would include
investment and operational support in: (a) education (reconstruction or
rehabilitation of primary schools or small libraries, provision of equipment
and supplies, training in health and hygiene, and short-term training programs
aimed at adults with less than secondary education, particularly in rural
areas); (b) health, focused on basic care (construction and equipping of
health posts, support for the initiation of their operation, nutritional
development programs, and small water and s&nitation projects in support of
ongoing or new health or health education projects); and (c) institutional
support of Requesting Agencies (RAs) (defined as public or private agencies
that propose subprojects for SIF financing), to permit expansion of these
services to underserved areas. Subproject selection would include, inter
alia, (a) consistency with sectoral strategies and standards; (b) poverty
targeting criteria; (c) assessment of community needs; and (d) presentation by
the RA of a feasible financial plan for operation of the subproject beyond the
period of SIP's financing.
8.       The project, to be carried out over four years, provides funds for
civil works; vehicles, furniture, equipment, medicines, and textbooks;
training; technical assistance; and incremental operating costs. Total
project cost is estimated at US$95.6 million, with an estimated foreign



-4-
exchange component of US$11.2 million (12 percent). The proceeds of the
credit would be lent to the Republic of Bolivia, which would pass them on in
grant form to SIF and ESP; SIU's financing for subprojects would be provided
on grant terms.  Credit proceeds would finance on a declining scale a portion
(30 percent) of incremental operating costs, mainly salaries of key fixed-term
SIF staff who are paid salaries above the civil-service scale, to permit
retention of personnel with appropriate qualifications and experience. At
present, this can be achieved only through hiring fix,4-d-term staff outside the
civil service system and financing them from non-Governmental sources. A
long-term goal is for the Government to assume full responsibility for the
cost of all public sector personnel (this issue is being addressed under the
EHSO project (Cr. 1977-B0)), but this is not expected to occur during the
lifetime of the project. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown In Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Bolivia
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 8248 dated March 26, 1990) is also attached.
9.       SIF would have overall responsibility for the project, except for the
ESF training component. Subprojects would be proposed by RAs, which may be
local Governments, NGOs, the Ministries of Health or Education themselves, or
community organizations. In order to assure effective targeting of benefits,
SIF v ilds agree periodically with the corresponding ministries on SIF's role
in carrying out sector strategies, on the funding targets and budget for SIF's
program, and on the methodologies to be applied in identifying beneficiary
communities; provide guidance to RAs in developing proposals; and appraise all
subprojects and RAs using methodologies, guidelines and standards satisfactory
to the corresponding mintstries and to IDA. Infrastructure subprojects would
be carried out by privatt contractors under agreements with RAs; assistance
projects (e.g. traininp rograms) would generally be carried out by the RIA
itself.  SIF would eel    independent supervisors for all subprojects, and
would have overall sups. sory responsibility. Both RAs and beneficiary
communities would provide a contribution to cover subproject costs
(beneficiaries' contribution would generally be made in kind).
10.      The size of SL'"s program of financing for subprojects is contingent
on final commitments by cofinanciers for the aggregate amount shown in
Schedule A. By effectiveness, commitments will have been obtained for
external financing totalling at least US$25 million (bringing total financing
to over 80 percent of total project costs and over 100 percent of SIF's
planned commitments for subprojects during its first year); commitments for
the remaining external financing (about US$18.6 million) are expected to be
obtained during the first year of project execution. To assure that the
proportions of financing participation remain as shown in Schedule A,
provision has been made for joint review by SIF and IDA, on a yearly basis, of
SIF's programming of commitments under subprojects and for adjustment of the
programming as necessary to reflect availability of financing.
11.      Agreed Actions.  Agreements were reached at negotiations that:
(a) SIF would be maintained with the mandate to provide financing to mall-
scale subprojects designed to satisfy basic needs in health and education and
with key staff whose qualifications, experience and terms of reference would
be satisfactory to IDA; (b) ESF's operations would be terminated by March 31,
1991; (c) project activities would be carried out according to an agreed
implementation program and under agreed procedures; (d) the Government would



provide counterpart funds as required in the project financing plan and, where
applicable, would budget resources as necessary to cover operating costs of
investments financed by SIF. provided its prior &pproval was duly obtained by
SIF; (a) SIF vould implement a project accounting system that would permit
separation of ESF and SIF expenditures, earmarking of funds for subprojects
once coummtteo, and clear identification of the specific source of funding for
each subproject in the SIF program; (f) SI7 would submit for prior IRA
approval full documentatton on: the first ten subprojects for health and
education, respectively, regardless of size; *11 subprojects over US$250,000;
the first two subprojecto for institutional support for Rks; &ad the first
four contracts to be let under local shopping procedures; (g) SIF would submit
to IDA, (i) monthly reports on subprojects approved for SIF financing,
regardless of source of fundss (ii) quarterly reports on the results of a
procurement review; and (iii) quarterly reports on its activities, Including
agreed monitoring indicatorst and (h) SIF would conduct, jointly with IDA,
annual reviews oft (i) SIP's performance in carrying out the project;
(ii) social sector strategy, policy, and expenditures; (iii) SI,'s role in
implementing sector strategies and consistency of its program with such
strategies; and (iv) SIY's annual budget as agreed with the Ministries of
Health and Education and incorporated into the public expenditure program.
Frior to effectiveness, SIP would submit to IDA satisfactory evidence thats
(a) the R-gulatory Decree containing SIF's by-aws, specifying its proposed
organizational structure and functions, as agreed with ID, had been issued,
and the Promotion and Evaluation Manuals, as agreed with IDA, had been
approved by SIF?' Administrative Council; (b) subsidiary agreements had been
signed by the Government and SIP; (c) agreements regarding procedures and
mechanisms for coordination had been duly signed by SIF and the respective
corresponding mLnistries; and (d) the Government and SIP had entered into
agreements for external financing for SIF's program in amounts of at least
US$10 million and had received additional commitments for at least
US$15 million. The failure of financing agreements In an aggregate amount of
not less than US$10 million to become effective by September 30, 1990 and of
financing agreements in an aggregate amount of not less than US$25 mlllion to
become effective by March 31, 1991. would constitute an event of default,
unless the Government and SIT had made alternative arrangements, satisfactory
to IDA, to secure adequate financing for SIP's programed commitments for
subprojects.
12.      Proiect Benefits.  The project's main benefit would be to assure the
establishment of an institution designed to provide health and education
infrastructure and services to underserved populations, while fully
integrating its investments Into the public expenditures program, assuring
consistency with medium-term adjustment and sector policies, and retaining the
operational efficiencies achieved by ESF. Additional benefits would include:
(a) strengthened capacity of entities providing health and education services
to target assistance to the neediest groups and to design subprojects
responsive to the groups' priority needs; (b) improved coordination among
entities working in the social sectors. including the government ministries.
SIF itself, NGOs, local governments, and community groups; (c) improved access
to urgently needed health and education facilities and services, thereby
enhancing the population's potential for improved health and productivity; and
(d) a focal point for mobilization of external rei-ources for the acial
sectors, building on the successful experience of previous Ins credits.



-6-
13.      Prolect Risks.  Tha risks affecting the project are mainly
institutional, since achievement of project objectives will require thats
(a) SIF be provided with sufficient autonomy and key staff to carry out its
mandate; and (b) close coordination among key institutions (e.g., between SIF
and the ministries) be established. There is also a risk that financial
constraints may prevent continued operation of subprojects beyond the period
of SIP financing. These risks are being managed throughs (a) the
Government's comitment to maintain SIP with the mandate to satisfy basic
needs in health and education, with key staff whos, qualifications and
experience are satisfactory to IDA; (b) coordination agreements, satisfactory
to IDA, between SIP and the corresponding ministries specifying, inter alia,
that SIP's annual program would be reviewed and incorporated into the public
expenditure program, and that, where operating costs of a subproject would be
covered by the corresponding ministry, the ministry's prior approval of the
subproject would be sought; and (c) approval of all subprojects would be
subject to presentation of a satisfactory plan for continuation of operations
beyond the investment period and, demonstration that the costs have been
included in the budget of the responsible entity. Coordination with sector
strategies would be enhanced through participation of the Under Secretary of
Planning for Social Policies in SIF's Administrative Council and participation
of SIF's Executive Director in the National Council for Social Policy.
Improved coordination would also be pursued under the IHDP and the EMSO
projects, as well as through the proposed project.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed cred't.
