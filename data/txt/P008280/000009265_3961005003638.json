residents of the earthquake\n            zone; (b) to reconstruct basic infrastructure which will\n            support employment creation; and (c) to develop a longer\n            term sustainable program for rehabilitation in the\n            earthquake zone. The Earthquake Reconstruction Project will\n            complete the reconstruction of housing, factory shells and\n            municipal infrastructure that could provide immediate\n            assistance and employment to the needy population in the\n            earthquake zone. It will also support some key reforms in\n            housing policy ( e.g., privatization, cost recovery, single\n            family self-help housing, etc.) and help develop the overall\n            housing reform agenda for Armenia. Additionally, it will\n            prepare a long-term regional development strategy to\n            rehabilitate the earthquake zone and will provide equipment\n            to the Earthquake Engineering Institute."}, "docdt": "1994-01-05T00:00:00Z"}
