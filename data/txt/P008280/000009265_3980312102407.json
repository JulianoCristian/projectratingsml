{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Earthquake\n            Reconstruction Project (EQRP) for Armenia were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, project sustainability was\n            uncertain, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: local governance, ownership, and operations\n            capacity should be carefully assessed and if found wanting,\n            mitigating design is required. Coordination of donor\n            activities can be difficult, particularly with independent\n            non governmental organization's (NGO's) with\n            strong international support, but is essential and requires\n            attention to forestall conflict during implementation.\n            Potential operational pitfalls deserve realistic attention\n            during design and appraisal. Project Implementation Unit\n            (PIU) independence is essential, as is the rigorous\n            selection of its staff, particularly in positions of\n            leadership. Close technical communications between the Bank\n            and borrower pay big dividends: both sides are able to adapt\n            comfortably and effectively to a changing project environment."}, "docdt": "1997-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
