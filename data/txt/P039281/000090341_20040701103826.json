The lessons learned indicate that funding\n            requirements of such large projects need to be more formally\n            committed than was the case for Ghazi Barotha Hydropower\n            Project (GBHP). The environmental aspects of GBHP are mainly\n            positive, in that it obviates the need for a comparable\n            sized (thermal) generation plant, and thereby reduces the\n            damaging atmospheric impacts of such plants. The key areas\n            where innovative approaches were pioneered under GBHP were:\n            (a) the involvement of affectees in the valuation of land\n            and other assets, and (b) the retrofit of past legacy issues\n            onto a new Project-by attempting to address the outstanding\n            compensation and claims of the Tarbela Dam Project as a\n            component of GBHP. In both cases, there was limited or no\n            precedent in Pakistan which could have served as a guide for\n            the Government or Water and Power Development Authority\n            (WAPDA), when issues arose. Some of these problems may have\n            been handled more expeditiously if the concerned officials\n            were exposed to similar conditions in other countries or\n            projects, and the Bank could have taken a more active role\n            in providing such exposure or first hand examples."}, "docdt": "2004-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
