1.9  INTRODUCTION
1.1    Project Description
The Ghazi-Barotha hydroelectric power project has u capacity of 1.450 Mv1W. The project is going
to utilise the ftall of the Indus tiver between the tail water of the existingw Tarbela Dam and the
confluence of the IndLs and Haro rivers. The basic elements of the project include: a barTage about
7 km downstream of Tarbela; a large power channel to convey water from the barrage to thle
generating facility: a power complex that will receive the water from the channel, pass it through
turbine-generators tco prodLice up to 1,450 MIW of power and discharge it back into the Indus river,
and a 500 KV switchyard alon- with trainsmission lines at B;llrotlha.
1.2    Transmnission Scheme
Pak-istan Hydro Consultants prepared an environmental assessment for the proposed transmissionn
scheme for the Chazi-Barotha project in 1994. The scheme included
(i)    500 KV single circuit Barotha-Peshaw.r Transmission line                                   S
(ii)   500 KV single circuit Tarbela-Gauti in-otit at Barotha
The transmission scheme was later on extended by adldin- additional circuits for full dispersal of
power and stability of the system. These are
(i)    500 KV double circuit between Baiotha-Rewat
(ii)   500 KV single circuit between Rewat-Gakk-har-Lahore
(iii)   500 KV double circuit (in - out) of Tarbela-Gatti lines
This report provides the environmental assessment of the extended transmission scheme of the
Ghazi-Barotha hydroelectric power project. The route has been provided by the EHV department
of Wapda. This report is primarily based on the field suLvey carried otit by the combined El-lV-
Environment Dir-ectorate (NPP) team.

2.0 LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRANIEWORK
The regulations, guidelines and standards governing the design, constmction, andl operation of the
.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .
transmission lines for the Project and its environmental assessmenlt are brietly disctissed below.
2.1    Role Of Wapda
T, '  -      The authority of WAPDA to coIIstruct a3d operate electrical tranismission lines was established in
1958 under the West Paklistan Water and Power Development Act, which assigns to WAPDA the
powers and obligations of a licensee uniderl the Electricity Act of 19 110. These laws establish policy
*  of land acquisition and compensation, as well as the degree of liability ot WAPDA for diLlai!es
1 M          sustained by landowners or others.
j!           2.2    World Bank Requirements
.
This Environmental Assessment (EA) report has been prepared in accordance with the World
Banks Operationad guiidelines. The gluidelines cover potential environimentall impacts. effects on
;*         - land use, health and safety issues, indtuced development. project alternatives and nIonitoiing. The
guidelines deal inconclusively with the question of electromagnetic fieldls (ENIF), noting that the
z-    0-    "Scientific community has not reached consensus on specific biological responses to ENF, but tile
evidence suggests that health hazards may exist." Thle guiidelines do not provi(le stanldarld(s for
conductor clearanices from residential, edLucationlal andl/or business strUCtuLes, or from vezetationi or
other environmental or socio-economic resouirces. As a matter of fact, the World Bank allows each
countly to establish its own standiards for the design of transmission Iines on Banlk fnlLedl projects.
provided those are consistent with intemnational engineering andl safety practices.
4     .^-    2.3    Public Health/Safety Standards
There is growing awareness that long-term  exposure to the EMF effects of hiih volta,e
transmission lines could adversely affect the health of those living oir working close to such line.
There is particular concem over children studying in schools near high voltage transmission lines.
*t      Although the EMF decreases with the square of the distance from line, neither the specific health
effects nor the distance at which sutch effects pertain over time is adeqluately understood.

2.4    Conductor to Ground Clearances
WAPDA has accepted curTent inteinational standards for conductor to gtround clearanAces for the
construction of 500 KV transmission line projects. The specific standard accepted is (h;lt of the
; *'. fNational Electrical Safety Code (ANSCI C2), cu-rently applicable in the United States.
Actual conductor clearances (at a m;aximum temperature of 65°C) are as follows:
i.;.  1.    Cultivated land traversed by vehicles              9.0( m

2.5    Corridor Clearances
WAPDA follows a policy of 50 m wide coInidors for 500 KV transmission liies (25 ni out ft-om
I~~~~~~~~
the centreline). In principle, no resideential or other buildingz structure shoukl be within the 50 rn
wide corridor, although in densily populated areas, suech as cities, the minimum distance from the
- entreline can be reduced to 21 m, which -ives a minimum horizontal clearance of 12 m froim the
..t       outer conductors.
Open wells, including Persian wells. are allowed to remain under the highi voltage conductors, as
are existing orchards. provided the fruit trees are kept unider 3 m in height. Far m buildings or single
storey factory buildings not used as residences are also allowed to remain under the high voltage
lines, provided an 8 m clearance is maintained. The height of the towers can be increased to
4



accommodate existing buildings. Tubewells are not permitted under the high voltage conductors,
* for fear that piping and cranes used to refuLrbish such wells couLld come in contact with the lines.

4.0  ENVIRONMENTAL EVALUATION
4.1    BAROTHA-REWAT LINE.
* The Barotha to Rewat 500 KV transmission line consists of 47.89 Km of double circluit oI single
towers and 114.5 Km of single circtuit. It originates from a 50)1 KV switchyard near Barotha and
reaches at 500 KV switchyard near Rewat. For conveinlenice of planning, the line haLs beenl dlivided
into ten segments.
4.1.1 Land Use
Se2ment-l
This segment is 12.53 Krn long and stretches from Barotha Switchyard to Attock-Sher Shalh
railway line. The circuit starts at Barotha switchyard, passes over the outlet of the power chlannel
anid then crosses over 4-5 houses. The line then passes between Barotha and Gariala villages
avoiding the village of Barotha by 100 meters, and 50 (meters from the villake sclhool and then
aivoiding the village of Gariala by about 200 meters. The area is qtiuite brokeen as the line comes out
* of Barotha. In this region the line remains parallel to the IndLus river. As thle line leaves the Indtus.
the land becomes more levelled. The line then crosses the Attock-Chlhoi roadl north-east of Gariala.
As the line approaclhes Haro iiver, the area around the iiver is more andn more broken and it fuLrther
deteriorates along the line. The line avoids the village of Mehdi Shah by 10X meters and villagze
Salar by 360 meters and crosses the Haro river north of village Mehdi Shah. The line then passes
over small nullah's avoiding the village of Sind Baghpur by 500 meters. The area is less broklen Ias
the line crosses the Haro iiver except near the village of Sind Baghpur. Thle line then crosses tlhe
5



major nullah of "Nandania KaLs" thlee times in a length of 2.2 Km and  reaches the Sher Shall
railway line. The area of the segmenit is bushy with scattered trees of Kikar, Beri, and Phullai. The
agriculture is barani and it is on the slopes of the hilly terrain. The rain water for agriictilttire and
drlinking is store(d in ponds by constrticting dykes. The main crops of the area are Peanult, Wheat.
Corn and Barley.
SeIment-2.
This segment is 13.69 Km long from Attock-Sher Shah railway line to the village of Humak. The
line crosses the Attock-Sher Shall railway line 350 meters south of Kan.jur railway station. Its a
broken plateau area. The line then crosses the Attock-Fateh Jang Road and slightly bending south.
enters a broken area whele it crosses two small nullalh's and two minor track roads. There the line
avoids the village of Suwalanlwal Dhok by 5(X) meters. Thie region southi of Suwalanrwal Dhok is
comparatively less brokeni. The line then crosses a katclha tr;lck1 entering ijnto a br-okeni area ol small
nullah's. The line thenl passes 315 meters north of village Dhok Mochian passing at the edge of
nullah 'Nandana Kas'. The line crossing "Nandaana Kas" reatchies a point 51(Y meters north of
1-lumnak, The whole area around this section of liie has vety little agriculture. The area is mainly
biroken andl btishy with scattered trees. There is little barani auniculture. This se-ment is located at
the southerii ed-e of Kawah Gar forest reserve.
Sevment-3
The length of this segment is 19.15  Km. It begins from a poinit 510 meters Noith ot village u-lurmak
to a point west of Sadkal oil field. The area north of H1umak is less broken witil mtcil better
agrricuitLe potential. The line moves alotni nullahi 'Nandana Kas' to a poinlt where the line takes ;i
bend towardts south at an anile of I ('-39'. The line is still parallel to the nuillalh 'Nanldana K;Ls'. It
then enters a broken land. Here the line crosses small nullah's and then cl-osses the nUllath of
'Nandana Kas' 650 meters north of Pind Niazi villaye. The line thenl pausses throu,g1 a point whicih is
500 meters Northi of Kot Salabat. The 'Nandana Kas' now moves away from the line. The line
crosses the nullah of 'Ratala Kas' north of village Kot Salabat three times in a stretch of 3 Km. The
line then enters a region which is less broken, more bushy an d with more trees. The line then
crosses the road to Langar villaoe. 250 meters soutli of Langar. The line enters a hilly area with
open scrub and scattered trees, passing through foot hills and reaches the edgre of 'Nandana Kas'
wliere it takes a tur-n of 46o-52' towards south, crossing the 'Nanidana Kas' and Gak-ar-Bahtar road.
The line then passes 400 meters east of Gakar and moves through an area of open scrrub and
scattered trees. It passes at a distance of 150 meters from Dera Wali Dhok crossing small nullah's
and enters Kala-Chitta reserve forest. The Kala-Chitta ieserve forest have bushes. Sanatee, Kao and
Phulai. The line coming Out of Kala-Chitta reseive forest crosses the nullah of 'Jabba Kas' and
reaches a point 600 meters west of Sadkal oil field. This area is relatively tlat with more agriciulture
anid less bushes. The Kala-Chitta region hats wildlife species of Deer. Rabbits. Jackal. Doves and

enters into a more broken and bushy area which is passinig 300 meters north ot Dhok Brei. Then the
line passes through a plateau area of small nullah's and enters an area of hard sand mixedl with
stones where there are very few signs of vegetation. Coming out of the hard sandy area, the line
enters into a region of mixed vegetation. The line then crosses null;ah 'G.unbir Kas' and a metalled
road, After crossing the road, it enters into a region which is veiy broken and croded. The line
moves forward, the plateau starts becoming higher and less broken. The line then passes I Knm
south of Kasala Kalan and crosses the Soan river.
Segment-7 (Rewat-l)
This segment is 20.7 Km long. It stauts from a point across Soaul iiver south of Kasala Kalan to a
giid station near Rewat. The line after crossing the Soan river, tak-es a left ttiin and passes through
a plateau with bushes and scattered trees. It then crosses a nullah and pw;ses 300 meters nor-th of
village Thatta. At this point, the line takes a riglht turn of about 6-30', crosses two katcha tracks,
two nullah's and enters a broken area with higher plateau. At this stage the line crosses several
nullah's moving on top of the hills. The line then passes 300 meters south of Dhok- Laii tvlaulalia.
The line moves over several small nulla's, dirt traiicks and passes 35() meters sotith of Sarngra
village. After a few kilometres the line reaches a comparatively plain lamnd. The line then crosses the
Dhok Talian-Sarhandi and Rewat-Java roads. The line then crosses 2 nuillah's an(d Rewat-Burhan
220 KV transmission line. This area has a moderate barani agriculture. The m;aini cr-op in lhe recion

Murit reserve forest. The line starting north of FPateh Jang, avoidis the populated arel Of Fatcll J32
by about 300 meters. It passes through a semi plateau areal crossing 2 Ilulla''s and Bidr,1ah road
south of Bidrah. The line then enters a broken area withi bushes and scattered trees. There is little
agricuiture in this broken area. The line passes 40() meters north of Thatti Gujrau andl moves over
two nullah's and Kasana road at 150 meters north of Kasauna. It then takes a riuht turn of 0"-57' andl
crosses the major nullah of 'Chabbar Kas' and few katcha tracks. The line then enters a hard saned
area where the pits are 2-10 meters deep. The line thanl crosses the Jinder road at 50)0 meters north
of Jinder and reaches the boundary of Khari Murit reseive forest. The area of the segment is malinly
broken with bushes and scattered trees except near Fatch JaUIg where there are more plains. 'Tiie
agriculture in the area is barani and is significant only near the town of Fateh JUlng. Thle major crops
in the area are Peanut. Wheat, Com and Barley. The bushes and trees in the region are mI;ainly of
Senatee, Kao, and Phullai.

Segment-9 (Rewat-ll)
This segment is 18.4 Km long, and lies between the edge of Khari Murit reser ve forest to a point
across Soan river. The line enters the Khaai Murit reseive forest and moves over the forest area.
The forest consist mainly of Kao, Phullai. and Kikar. As the line eomes out ot the Khari Mulit
reserve forest, it enters a broken plateau area crossing motor way . Uvoidang Dhok Chohun Wala by
j:           130 meters and Chohan Wula by 100 meters. The linie crosses many ntillah and k-atha track in this > -h-
region. It then enters a dry arca. After coming out of this area, it avoidis village Dhala by ab
meters and then crosses Soan river. Some of the area is under forest depautment but the vegetatjon
in the area is not vety significant.                                          --
Segment-lf) (Rewat-Il)
This segment is 21.93 km long starting trom a point across Soan river to the switchyard ne
Rewat. This section of the line begins withl a broken area passing 450) meters Iorth of village
Miamda. Then crossing two katcha tracks and many small nullah's, crosses a metalled road 150)
meters south of Taiahia. Then the line enters an area of small hills. After cominig out of this broken
high area, the agiiuClture potential in the area starts getting better. The line now crosses a small
metalled road and passes 200 meters noith of Macra Gar, 100 meters north of Muhra langar and
200 meters north of Ghall. The line then crossing a small road antd nullah's moves 550( meters irith --
of Java. It then crosses Rewat-Java road andl turnin- niorth crosses 2 nullal's and a 220) KV
-    transmission line. It then passes at a distance of 220 meters from lthe village of SuLkhl ChainpuLr,
Crosses a nullah andj reachies the Rewat switciyarwd.
4.1.2  Ecological
The barani agriculture land along the line provides habitat lor a few species of birds and sonme
small mammals, some of which are a1icIit6iCUral pests. Jackals, Foxes, Rabbits, Doves. Partridges,
Urial and Deers etc. are found in the forest areas. In the unciultivated areas tlhe pressuire of 1t-el
wood cutting, lopping of limbs for fodder, and livestock tforain-i has greatly reduiced bio-diversity.
The removal of forests through centuries of fuel wood aInld timber cutting, coupled with live stock
s         ^pressure, has left a diry scirib ecosystem of low vegetative diversity. This is well ilILIStilnftLI by the
dominance of shrub "Senatee" Dodona Burmanniana (flylrtaceae).
The process of reforestation is a govermment functionl and does not fined a public interest in this
region. The presence of Indus iiver, Haro iiver, perennial strearms anud large number of' nulIlah'l s
increases bio-diversity. This is indicated by the presence o3f white-breasted Kin, Fi.sher. cotmmon
Raven. Eagles, Buzzards, 1-lasrivers, Falcon and Sanid Martin in the area. Sutch species ae usilly
indicative of a rich population of small rodents. The main species of ti-ees in the area ;ue Kao.
Phullai and Kikar. These trees are found in Kala-Chitta. Kawah Gar aznl Khaii Murit  reseive
9



f . rests. The wood of Kao is mainly used for making handles foir axes, hanmerx andtu her tools.
Kikar etc. is used as fuel wood.
Impacts and Recomnnendations
The construction of towers and stringing of wires will cause damage to the ecosystem within tlhe
nurTow confines of the coniidor. In all the non agricultuial sections of the lines, the natural
vegetation consists of grasses and shrubs, and is already subject to considerable human pressure.
The line passes through the Kala-Chitta, Kawah Gar anid Khari Mur-it reseive forest. A part of the
Kala-Chitta reserve forest has already been acquired by the ;umy. any fuiither loss to the ftirest
should be minimised to the extent possible. The Khari MLiit reserve forest is very narrow and the
transmission line crosses it in three to four spans. Care should be taken iduring construction and
maintenance of the line to keep the impact to a minimum level.
4.1.3  Socio-Economic and Cultural Resources
This proposed new line from Barotha to Rewat, starts at a switchyard near Barotha passing souith of
Attock, tums north of H-Lumak to enite Kala-Chitta reseive forest. The Iine crosses railwuy line
north of Fateh Jang near Sadkal oil fieltd. The dLouble circtuit line here changes to single circuit.
Both the single circuits then cross the motoraway after ciossing, the Khari NMurIit reseive forest. Then
both the lines turn left after crossing Soan river to reach Rewat switchyard.
Settlement Pattern
The settlement pattern along the line is different in broken and plain plateau are:s. Generally in the
region of Haro iiver antd nullah NanL;idana Kas. the cenitr;al villages lie oni the bench between the
iiver valley and the hills (Kala-Chitta aned Kawah Gar uplalndis). where relaitively flat land is
available for the barani cuiltivation. The laid along the rivers ftr the most part is dLeeply eroded and
gullied, while towards the hills it is also gullied and stoiny. These broken aueas are usedl for
p:asturage, for fuel wood and fodder. In few places, wlere lulnd slopes evenily down to tile rivers,
fertile pockets irigated by persian wells are present. such as the Dhok Mouchian (Akori village)
and around the contluence of the Shak-ardara kas with the HIar tiver(Dhen-i Kit anid Sind Bagh).
Villages are slightly smaller than those west of the Indus, with populations of between 350 aneld 9
households. Numerous smaller settlements awid f; mily compounds are scatiteredl arouinti lhe central
villages, a substantial portion of these beine untLer the hills where permanent water is available.
After crossing Fateli Jang the area is veiy brokSen and diy. che populkltion dlensity in Ithis region is
vety low. The line then enters a less broken area where the population dlenisity keeps on increasing.
as we approach Rewat switchyard.

Ethnic Divisions
nThe first part of the region to be traversed by the proposed transmission line is a part of Attock
District and is inhiabited by Punjabi (Potoh.ui dialect) speak-ing, post-tribal lineage groups
(biradawies). The two major linage groups are those of the Awans. who dominate most of the
Potohar plateau south of Kala-Chitta range. auid the small Khattar tribe. The later is confined to the
southern belt of Attock tehsil and the northerm margins of Fateh lan3g tehsil. The secon(d pait of the
region is the area nearby/adjacent to the Rewat. Here the majoiity is of the Rajgan lineag;e along -
with Awans and Maliks. This region has contributed substantial number of their men to the anned
forces.
Economic Base
The economy south of Hlaro river is extensively rural, although the proximity of Attock city and the
extensive Sanjwal Defence Indlustries north of Halro, industrial waea of Fateh Jang and a few stone
blavsting and crushing factories provide some alternative daily work opportunities for the villages
of the area. In adklition, every village has members working outside the area in Islamabad. Karachi
or abroad.
nThe rural economy is largely barari agriculture, with Wheat, Maize, Barley andl Bajra (foddter) as
the main crops. The land holdinigs are smaller usually ranging from (1.1 ha to 3 ha. Livestock
provides an important addition to the family, incomes and diets. An average ftamily witli (.3 ha;
holding can earn somewliere between Rs. 12,(N)( - I5,()(X) fiom crops; and fiom livestock Rs.
6,l)() - 7,1)()0. This is ustually the average income for the village.
Basic education and medical care are available throughi a networ-k of village primaly and mindlell
schools and basic health units. High schools are present at the Union CountICil level, while Attock
city, Fateh Jlan  and( Rewat has at least a degree college each and several plivate professional
sIchools for commerce and computer studies. More advanced medical assistance is also available in
Attock city, Rewat and Fateh Jang.
Transportation System
Some major and secondary transportation links pass through the area including both road andl  
rawiway. The Attock-Sher Shah (via Kundian ) railway line runs ft-om Attock junction south across
the Hiaro niver and nullah Nandana Kas, before passing througil the Kala-Chitta range. The road to
Basal. Pindi Gheb, Talagang and Khushab is routed across the Hafro near Gaiala. Fateh antg-
Rawalpindi road, Jinder-Rawalpindi road, Rewat-Java road, Kasala Kalan-Rawalpidtli road and
Rawalpindi-Lahore road are also some of the main roatd linkis lying in the region traversed by the
circuit. District roads across the area fiom Attock city to Fateh lang and from Sanijwal to Fatch
-11



Jang. The roads north and east of Attock city connect the whole region to the Granid Trunk road.
Most villages are connected by metalled roads.
Archaeological and Historical Resources
The only known archaeological site near the transmission line is at Gariala, where a group of 17
Boulders is marked with petroglyphs. Gaxiala is also the site of a stone age culture from the early or
Middle Pleistocene periods. The most prominent contemporaty cultural property proximate to the
transmission line is the shrine of Saklhi Zinda Pir at Akori.
Impacts and Recomnmendations
--    The transmission lines are not expected to cause any significant changes in the land use, since
WAPDA policy is to avoid any damages by modifying the line route where necessaiy. Sucih
modifications include avoidance of villages and when possible, of single dwellins. Wlhere no
alternative to moving a dwelling exists, the site of the dwelling and the new site o-f the reseultel
family will undergo minor landuse changes(residential to agricultural, and vice versa). Sucih areas
will involve only fraction of hectare. The number of houses effected is given in Table- l. The line
tends to avoid villages, schools, wells, shrines, graveyards, mosCqies and other dwellings to keep
the impact on the area at a minimum level. Although the line passes over nimeloLIs vilklae roads
and tracks and railway line, no effect on transportation or villa2e Mai6ClUtUral mlovellment is
andicipated.
4.2   BAROTHA-TARBELA (IN CIRCUITS)
The Barotha-Tarbela (in circuit) 50() KV transmission line consist of 26.3 Km of doiuble circuit on
a single tower and 8.9 Km of single circuit and has been divided into fOlur sermenis tOl planning
purposes. It originates from  500 KV switchyard near Barotha and realclhes the existingi 500 KV
Tarbela-Gatti lines.
4.2.1 Land Use
Segment-]
This segment is 1 1.1 Km long and starts from Barotha switchyard to Attock-Sher Shah railway
line at a point 500 meters South of Kunjur. The line originates from Barotha switchyar.l. moves
al6ng the village of Barotha at a distance of 70 meters. The line curving around. leaves the village
at its southern end and moves towards east. This area is very mUch broken and bushy with very Iew
trees. The line crosses the outlet of the power channel anid then crosses over 4-5 ho1Uses. The line
then crosses a Katcha track enters a less broken area with better agriculture. At this point it crosses
'Attock-Raindher road, a small nullah  and Attock- Gleii road. The line theni iimmedliately enters a
12



f~~~~~ ,:e * 4:r3e.:* 
broken bushy area. It then takes a right turn of 6"-00'. The population is scattered and thin around
this turning. The line then passes 500 meters south of Mani Kanjuir reaching Attock-Sher Shalh
railway line.
Segment-2
This segment is 15.1 Km long. The segment starts at a poiint 500 meters south of Mari KanjLIr tV a
point west bf existing Tarbela-Gatti (1) line. The line crosses the Attock-Sher Shah railway line
and crosses two small nullah's. All this area is broken and plateau. It then cr:osses a katcha track c
moving over 2-3 houses. The line then crossint  Attock-Fateh Jang and Attock-Baiar ro ad, crosses
Haro river. After crossing Hero river, the line enters 'Kawah Gar' reserve forest. The line moves left
at an angle of 9' -25' and lfO meters north of Dhok Bariar. As the line comes out of tile forest. the
area is suitable for agriculture. Here it crosses thrlee small nullalh's and two k;atcha tiracks Ivoiciini,
Dhok Tare by 90 meters and Kahutt-a by 750 meters. Then the line crossingt a katcha tiack moves
south of pind Tarn and Bolianwal at a distance of 300 meters. There are 5-6 houses whicih are
situated close to the end of the segment.
Seement- 3 (Tarbela-fl
This segment is 3.25 Km long. The line starts at a point west of the exiting Tarbela-Gatti (I) line
and moving north-east reaches Tarbela-Gatti (1) line at I klm north of Daulatwal. There are few
houses at a distanc:e of 50 meter in the southern direction, fi-om where this seerment beLins. Thle line
moving north-east, crosses the Boliwal-Battu road and passes through a bi* len bushy area. The
agriculture decreases as the line enters the broken area. The amiiculture in the whole area is b;uaiti.   0
The major crops in the region are Peanut, Wheat, Coin anld Barley. The line tlhen Mnovill over two
nullah's and passing  00() meters west of Dhok Nadiir Ali (Dolatwall), reaches thle Tarb;la-iGatti (I)
|-  line.-E 
-     Segment-4 (Tarbela-4l)
This segment is 5.7 Km lon- and begins at a point west ot existing Tarbela-Gatti (1) line to an
existing tower of Tarbela-Gatti (11) line 1.5 Km south of 'Mlian Sultan Ki Dhok'. This segment starts
in an area which is plateau but not broken and there are two houses in the sOuthern dlirection at a
distance of 75 meters. The line then crosses Dauradad road. Bolianwatl-Batar road andl a katchaL
-   track- avoiding Dhok Akbari by about 600 meters. The line then moves over three minor InlUiaIL'S
*     and two katcha tracks just before reachinig Tarbela-Gatti (f[) line. There is moderate atoiculltue in
the area.

4.22  Ecological
The ecological value of the region falling under the route of this transmission line is similar to that
of the Barotha-Rewat line. The only difference is in the area south of Attock. where the bio-
diversity is very low. The line passes through Kawah Gar reser-ve forests along Haro river wilere
the bio-diversity is relatively significant. A considerable number of reptors are present at various
points in the area. The habitat is not very conducive to the growth of wildlife/bird species sinlce it
lacks most of its original and natural vegetation and also bacause there is an increasing humrui
activity and settlements.
4.2.3 Socio-Econiomic and Cultural Resources
This proposed new line from Barotha to Tarbela, starts at a switclhyard near Barotha. It passes south
of Attock, crosses Attock- Sher Shah railway line anad Haro river, pa;sses through Kawah Gar
reserve forest and reaches the Tarbela-Gatti lines.
Settlement Pattern
In the region of Haro river and Nandana Kas. the villages lie on the benlcih between the river valley
and the hills, where relatively tlat land is available for b;u-ani cultivation. The region is not (lensily
populated. In few places. where land slopes evenly down to the rivers. fertile pockets irrigated by
persian wells are present. The broken areas are used for pasturage. and for fuel wood and foddear.
Villages are slightly smaller than those %vest of the Induis. Numerous smaller settlements and familily
compounds are scattered around the villages. a substantial portion of these being indler the hiills
were permanenit water is available. althouh, tilere has been some tLubewvell developimlent over the
years.
Ethnic Divisions
The region to be traversed by the propose transmission line  is a part of Attock District and is
inhabited by Punjabi (Potohari dialect) speak-ing people. The two major finage "I-OLIpS ale those Of
the Awans, who dominate most of the Potohar plateau soLIth of Kala-Chitta range. and the small -l
Khattar tribe. The later is confined to the southeni belt of Attock tehsil and tthe northern maruins of
Fateh Jang tehsil.
Economic Base
The economy of the area is extensively nirrl, althou1h the proximity of Attock city andl the
extensive Sanjwal Defence Indlustries north of Haro provide some alternative dalily work:
oppontunities for the villages of the area. The ruLal economy does not cater for all the needs of the
people for family livelihood anid the area is one of the persistent oiut migration with adlult matles
14



temporarily moving out to take jobs in big cities 01 further away in abroad. Basic education and
medical care are available in villages. Electiicity is supplied through otit most of the regioln. Many
villages have govt. supplied tubewells.
Transportation System
Secondary transportation links pass throuLh the area. The Attock-Sher Shah1 (via Kundian ) railway
line runs from Attock junction and across the Haro and Nandana rivers, before passing throulh the
Kala-Chitta range. The road to Basal, Pindi Gheb, Talagang and Khushab is rouited across the l-laro
near Cariala. District roads cross the area from Attock city to Fateh Jang and from Sanjwal to Fateh
lang. The roads north and east of Attock city connect the whole re-ion to the Grwnd TruLnk road.
Most of the large villages are connected by metalled roads.
Archaeological and Hlistorical Resources
The only known archaeological site near the transmission line is at Gaiala. The most comm1ion
form of local cultural property in rural areas are "Shrines (Ziarats)" andl old villale mosLiues.
Impacts and Recommendations
This transmission line is not expected to cause any significant changes in the arl-ea. All ihe
important potential impacts from the transmission line will be noted and trleir mitigation measures,
if reqLuired, will be slugested at the design and constructioln stage. The ntimber of houses effected is
given in Table-I.
4.3    BAROTHA-CATTI (OUT CIRCUITS)
The Barotha-Gatti (out circuit) 500 KV trawsmissioin line consists ot 30.6 Km * of dotuble circuLit on
a single tower and 29.8 Km of single circuiit and comprises of five segments. It originates fi0om a
500 KV switchywad near- Barotha and extenLds to the existing Tar-bela-Gatti 500 KV lines.
4.3.1 Land Use
Seement- 1
This segment is 12.85 Km long. It starts from the Barotha switchyard to a point noith of Dheri
Langhai. The line originates at Barotlia switchyard and moves through the brokeen area at a distance
of 130 meters from the village. It makes a semi circle around the village, and passes northi of
Gariala keeping a distance of 250 meters. The line crosses over- the power chaninel outlet aund above
3-4 houses. The line then enters a less broken area where it crosses Attock-Cllhoi road. There is
more aariculture in this region. The line then crosses the Haro iiver. The area after crossing the
Haro river is comparatively more broken and the line passes 550 meters north ot Dher Kot and after
15



crossing two small nullah's it crosses Dheii-Chohar road. From this point onwards the area begins
to deteiiorates. The line'then crosses Dheri langhal road passing at a distance of 500 meters north of
Dhtui Langhal.
Sement-2        -
This segment is 17.75 Km long. This segment starLs 500 meters north of Dhari Lan,hal to a point
notth of Jabbi Kasran. The line tak-es a 30' left turn and enters a broken auea wheie it crosses
Attock-Sher Shah railway line and nullah  'Nandana Kas'. The line then passes 40(0 meters nolth
of Dhok Nawab Khan. The areal gets better near the Dhok NawaLb Khan roid. It then passes 3(9)
meters south of Jawan Dewali Dhok. The line again crosses the nullah 'Naundlana Kas'. Thie line
then passes over small nullahs and katc:ha tracks. Moving, at a distance of 280) meters northi of
village Nawa, the line passes through the Buta village. The population of Buta villayce is on both
sides of the line. The population is at a distance ot 100 meters on one sidle and 150 meters o*n the
other side of the line. The line then passes througlh the foot hills of the Kala-Chirta forest crossing
small nullahs and Attock-Fateh Jarg road, at a distance of 50() meters fromii a ri-ock blastiin and
crushing site. The line then crossing the nullah of 'Jabbi Kas' teaches a point north of Jabbi Kasrain.
There is moderate barani agricultiLre in this re pion.
Seement-3
This segment is 1.45 Km long. It starts from a point north of Jabbi Kar-an it) ai point east ol' Jabbi
Karan on the existing Tarbela Gatti (I) line. The line moves tihroul a broken area and passes ovel,
small nullahs. The ag1liiCultLIre is not si-nificant in the region. The area is bushiy with very lvew
scattered trees. The vegetation in the region is mainly Kao. Phullai and Kikar.
Seement-4
This segment is 18.6.Km long. It starts from a point north of Jabbi Kasrzua to a pOint at J;llLan-Fiteh
Jang road. The area along this segment is a less broken plateaLL. Tlle area has scattered trees aindt
bushes. The line crosses small nIllahs, katcha tracks and Langar road aned moving parallel to nUllah
'Nandana Kas' reaches the edge of an army area. The line then tUrnlS Iight alogL the ed-e ol the
army area and moves south. The line now crosses the Gak-ar road antd enters the Kala-Chitta hills
and forest The line after coming out of the Kala-Chitta forest crosses AEtock-Fitelh Jang road and
enters a brok-en area where it avoids A.uwala by about 200 meters. The line then crosses two
nullahs, two katcha tracks, a 66 KV line, a railway line and reaches the Jand-Flatellan  Road' .
There are two houses and brick kilns in the soutilheirn directioni 5;(i meters from the endl of this
segment.
16



Segment-S'
This segment is 9.75 Km long. It starts from a point at Jand- Fateh Jang road to a point at Tarbela-
Gatti (I). line south-east of Fateh-Jang. This segment begins in a semi broken plateau area which
has moderate agriculture. The' line crosses two small nullah and a katcha track to reach Fateh Jang-
Talagang road. There are few houses at l()l meters south of line between Fateh Jang-Jand road and
Fateh Jang-Talagang Road. The agriculture in the area is barani and the major crops are Peanut and
Com. The line after crossing Fateh Jang-Talagang road enters a broken ald plateau area. Then it
crosses two katcha tracks and a major nullah ndl reaches a tower on Tarbel;t Gatti (11) line. There
are 4-5 houses at 50-100 meters south at this end of line.
4.3.2 Ecological
The ecological value of this line is essentially the same as that of compar;able areas of Barotha-
Rewat line.
4.3.3 Socio-Economic Cultural Resources
This proposed new line from Barotha to Gatti, starts at a switchyardi near Barotha crossing Attock-
Sher Shah railway line. It passing south of Attock, through the foothills of the Kala-Cilitia hills and
reaches the Tarbela-Gatti (1) line north of Jabbi Kasran. From here it changes to a single CilrClit
line. The line then avoids the an-ny area of Kala-Chitta moving along its edge aund tlien avoilding the
populated ar-ea of Fateh Jang city passing south of Fateli Liang reaches the T;ubela-Gatti (11) line
south-east of Fateh Jang.
Settlement Pattern
Since this line is aligned in the same sub-regioni as that of Barotha-Rewatt and Tarbela-Barotha
lines, therefore, the settlement pattem of the area is more or less samel as of the other twxo lines.
Ethnic Divisions
The region mailnly constituted upon  Attock District, is iillnhbited by Punjabi (Potohari dialect)
speaking people with biradary system. The rest is same as the Tarbela-Barotila line.
Economic Base
The economy is again extensively rural with very few inldustries such as Kamrra/Sanjwal Derenlce
Industries in the area. The uLral economy is largely baraini. with Wheat. Maize. Barley aLndl Baijra
(fodder) the main crops. The land holdings are smaller andl livestock provides an important addition
'-   to the family incomes and diets. Basic educaton and mediical care are available thr-outglh a network

Transportation System
The transmission line coriridor passes through a countty sitle that is served by secondary and tertiaiy
road and railway systems. The Attock-Sher Shah (via Canadian ) railway line runs fromn Attock
junction south across the Haro and Banidanna rivers, before passing through the Kala-Chitta raneue.
The road to Basal, Pindi Gheb, Talagang and Khushii     uted across the Haro near Gariala.
District roads across the area from Attock city to Fateh uang anda l to Fateh Jan. Tlhe
roads north and east of Attock city connect the whole region to the Grand Trunk-road. Most of
these village-roads are metalled.
Archaeological and Historical Resources
The only known archaeological site near the transmission line is at Gariala. Any othet site will-be
noted in the final alignment. Duting the detailed desimn auld construCtion stage, tower locations will \
be adjusted to avoid any relevant sites.
Impacts and Recommendations
This transmission line is not expected to cause any significant changes in the land use. 'Ihe
changes/modifications may include avoidamce of villages and when possible. of sin-le dwellings.
The number of houses effected is -iven in Table-1. The detailed survey will note all the manjoir
impacts related to resettlemet, damage to buildings, crops, huma.n health aund water resomrces and
will recommend appropriate mitiLation measures.
4.4    REWAT-GHAKKAR-LAHORE LINE
The environment assessment for this part of the transmission lines from Rewat to Gak-khar and
Gakk-har to Lahore is based on the tentative route provided by the EH1V departmenit WAPDA, and
desk study carried out by the Environment Directorate.
(A)   Rewat - Chakkar Section
The line is about 200 Km lon; starting from the Rewat switchyard to a switchyar-d at Ghakkar. The
line after coming out of Rewat switchyard, avoides the populated aueas of Sukho auld Darwaza. It
then crosses river Jhelum near Rasul headwork's and avoides the populatedl areas of Chilianwala
and Mandi Bahauddin. The line crosses the Chenab iiver near Khaniki headlwork's. The conidor
then avoiding villages and towns reaches the switchyard near Gujianwalal/Ghakkar.
18



'4.4.1  Land use
The corridor starts at a switchyard near Rewat passing through an area with plateau topography.
The area has low to moderate agliculture. The agriculture increases as we move south. The area
south of Jhelum is fertile and has a high agriculture potential.
4.4.2 Ecological Value
The cornidor passes near two areas of wildlife and a forest reserve near Domeli. The cor-ridor also
passes close to an area of forest cover near Rassul.
4.4.3  Archaeological and Historical Resources
The archaeological value of the region is not significant. A few sites of historical siLniticance exist
in the region, the most prominent is the Rohtas Fort near Dina.
(B)   Ghakkar - Laliore Section
The conidor of this line is about 80 Km long. The conidor is to by-pass the populated areaLS ot
Ajnianwala and Sheikhupura to reach the switchyard at Lalhore (near Sheikhupura).
4.4.4 Land use
The corridor is located in the auea of prime agricultuire. The area has a high populatioll dlensity and
industly.
4.4.5 Ecological Value
The ecological value of this conirdor is not very significant, since the area is of high population
density and agrieulture.
4.4.6 Archaeological And Historical Resources
The corridor area is not of very high archaeological or histoiical significance. The only historical
site is "Hiran Minae' near Sheikhupura which will be avoided.
4.4.7  Socio-Cultural Resources
The region ranges from rural uplanld country, to the populatedL Indus plains. As we move south the
population density and agriculture increases. The chane is significant as the line crosses the river
of Jhelum into Indus plains, the land hais a high agriculture potenti al anid population denisity. The
people living in the area are Punjabi's with almost a commoni diailect of Punjabi laniguage.

=5.0  CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~.
The transmission lines of WAPDA are not going to cause any major clijille in the land use of the
-region since.the coriidors tend to uvoid areas of population. forest. aauiculture. wildlife or of any
other environmental significance. Care should be taken while crossing elln.uYlh or near-by areas lif
population, forest and  wildlife. The major damage to the environment .slecially ecosystem will be
during the construction and patrolling of the line. The routint in the cmrridor (tower location) Nvill
be important for soil crosion. The transmission and switchyard system along with the projeCEt will
bring social uplift in certain regions. The relocation / resettlement with the corridors is riot very
much (Table-I). The school near the Barotha switchyard is to be relocited, fliuther if anuy other
school or d%welling will lie within the safe distance from the line conidor during the fiinal routinig, it
will also be relocated. This cost of relocation will be inclulded in the project cost. Thus in thic ligit
of the above,mentioned the transmission line scheme, Ghazi-Barotha project will have no major
environmental impacts.
