The project\n            will consist of: 1) the construction of the Ghazi Barotha\n            Hydropower Project (GBHP) which comprises the following four\n            main components: a) a barrage and its ancillary works; b) a\n            52 km long concrete-lined power channel with a capacity of\n            1,600 cumecs and its ancillary works; c) a power complex and\n            its ancillary works; and d) the construction of power\n            transmission facilities to connect GBHP to the\n            interconnected grid; 2) the implementation of an environment\n            and resettlement management plan including: a) an\n            environment mitigation and monitoring plan; b) a\n            resettlement action plan (RAP); and c) and integrated\n            regional development plan (IRDP); 3) the power sector\n            component which involves setting up of GBHP as a separate\n            project entity and the establishment of a separate\n            transmission and despatch entity; and 4) a technical\n            assistance component consisting of consultancy services."}, "docdt": "1995-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
