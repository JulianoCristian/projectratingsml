Project for Ethiopia are as follows: outcomes of the project\n            were moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, bank performance was moderately\n            unsatisfactory, and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: to have the\n            desired impact and serve as a sustainable model, financing\n            of cultural site management plans should include priority\n            physical works identified in the plan. The approach in\n            Gondar versus Axum shows that this is essential if there is\n            to be a visible impact on improved visitor experience and if\n            the site is to serve as a space used by locals and\n            contributing to local economy. Lags between development plan\n            and financing plan result in dilution of impact, create\n            borrower fatigue, and seriously compromise the ability of\n            the investment. Venues developed for cultural commercial\n            activities should be located at key cultural sites.\n            Experience in Harar and Gondar compared to Addis Ababa shows\n            that tourists are unlikely to go to a venue just for craft\n            purchase from one outlet. Bringing together commercial\n            activities and cultural sites also increases turnover for\n            investment and the frequenting of the cultural site by local\n            residents. Exposure to international markets is necessary\n            but demanding in investment and time and currently has\n            limited potential to reach a large number of crafts people.\n            The regional bureaus of culture and tourism and city\n            administration need significant access to technical support\n            in cultural management. When national inventory and\n            information systems are developed, such as the computerized\n            inventory database, there should be a formalized commitment\n            to deliverables from the regions. Otherwise, as is the\n            current case, there is a risk that the equipment will be\n            used for other purposes and the staff deployed elsewhere,\n            thereby making the whole system dysfunctional."}, "docdt": "2009-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
