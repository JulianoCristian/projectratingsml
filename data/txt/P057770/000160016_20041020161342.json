This report presents\n            the findings and recommendations of the audit. The audit\n            confirmed that in line with World Bank Operational Policy\n            (OP 4.12), the 10 households relocated in Axum, were\n            involuntarily relocated as an adverse impact of project\n            activities. The 10 households are therefore eligible for\n            compensation in the form of: facilitation/provision of\n            equivalent or improved accommodation; full cost coverage for\n            transport of assets to the new location; a relocation\n            allowance and six months rental subsidies for increased\n            rental costs. Artisanal Crafts Development and the\n            re-establishment of ancient craft making traditions at Ras\n            Mengesha House or rather compound will not induce\n            \"land\" acquisition, per se. In Ethiopia, all land\n            belongs to the state. Private persons as well as legal\n            persons have usufruct rights, provided by the kebeles. The\n            kebele has the usufruct rights over the Ras Mengesha House.\n            The project has been granted access rights to the compound\n            and full usufruct rights to the facilities by the kebele.\n            Also confirmed was that in Axum the four components of the\n            project, will not induce land acquisition.  Ten (10)\n            households (47 persons) of which three female-headed\n            households have been relocated from the Ras Mengesha\n            compound as the facilities of the compound will be used for\n            preservation and re-establishment of ancient craft making\n            traditions. Seven (7) households were relocated by the\n            kebele (municipality) administration in September 2002. The\n            three households remain to be relocated. An abbreviated RAP\n            was prepared for these three remaining households: They have\n            been notified of their relocation and the Keble\n            administration will assist them in finding appropriate\n            rental houses within 300 meter radius of their current\n            location. Each household is to receive the equivalent of six\n            months rent and relocation allowance, and will be offered\n            job opportunities when the construction work commences and\n            be given priority when the crafts center becomes operational."}, "docdt": "2004-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
