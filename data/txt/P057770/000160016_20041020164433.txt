Preface 
A
resettlement/rehabilitation policy framework (RPF) is a document that ought to be 
established prior to project implementation. This has not been the case for the Ethiopia 
Cultural Heritage Project. The rationale is. 
 
In the project preparation document (PAD), resettlement was not considered to be an 
issue. The project was rated environmental category C, thus exempting it from an 
environmental assessment (EA). A social assessment was, however, recommended within 
the first six months of project effectiveness in the aim to assess local community 
participation and benefits from the project. Later the World Bank Quality (QEA) made a 
strong case for a social analysis and the request for a social assessment was replaced by a 
social analysis. Based on these procedures, the project was cleared by World Bank’s 
environmental division in the Africa Region. The social analysis has, however, yet to be 
executed.   
 
The World Bank supervision mission of June 18 to July 03, 2002, identified the need for 
a
resettlement action plan (RAP) to be prepared for the Ras Mengesha House in Axum. 
Also, mission findings concluded that the master plan of Axum estimated a minimum of 
200 households to be resettled from identified sites of archeological significance. But 
prior to the preparation of the RAP, 7-8 households were relocated from the Ras 
Mengesha House. Consequently, the World Bank mission recommended that: a) a 
resettlement audit be executed; b) a resettlement rehabilitation policy framework (RPF) 
be prepared to retrofit and govern potential resettlement issues that may arise during 
project implementation in Axum, in Gondar and elsewhere. In addition, the RFP also had 
to govern the mitigation of adverse social impacts generated by investments of other 
donors that may join the project as indicated in the project preparation document (PAD). 
As specified in World Bank Operational Policy OP 4.12, on Involuntary Resettlement, 
the policy applies to all components of the project that result in involuntary resettlement, 
regardless of the source of financing.   
 
This document is the result of that process and was therefore not elaborated during 
project preparation but under project implementation. This implies that this RPF is post 
project effectiveness. It follows that, it is particularly focused on, which processes and 
actions, that the project would need to execute to retrofit resettlement rehabilitation issues 
in project operations.  The preparation of the document has among others implied a 
process that has included: consultations with Federal authorities; consultations with 
regional and local authorities; consultations with project-affected persons (PAPs) that 
were already relocated from the Ras Mengesha house in Axum.  
 
In concert with World Bank policy regarding project affected persons (PAPs), the 
Ethiopian Constitution has a provision stating that people affected by development 
projects should be compensated and in the case of resettlement, their livelihoods should 
be restored. This constitutional provision is expected to facilitate the implementation of 
this resettlement/rehabilitation policy framework (RPF).

1.  
Background  
1.1 
Objectives of the Framework 
The overall purpose of the policy framework is to clarify the principles of addressing 
adverse social impacts induced by project operations. The framework is valid for project 
operations all over the Federal Republic of Ethiopia. This includes bilateral as well as 
multilateral operations financed by other donors, but emphasis will be on World Bank 
financed projects.  
 
The operational objective of the framework is to provide guidelines to stakeholders 
participating in the rehabilitation/resettlement operations in order to ensure that project 
affected persons (PAPs) will not be impoverished by the adverse social impacts of the 
projects. The basic principles imply that PAPs should be: compensated for loss of assets 
at replacement costs; given opportunities to share project benefits; and be assisted in case 
of relocation or resettlement. Focus is on restoring the income earning capacity of the 
project-affected persons. The aim is to improve or at least sustain living conditions prior 
to project operations or resettlement.  
1.2 
The Ethiopia Cultural Heritage Project 
While evidence of Ethiopia's culture and history is found in its ancient monuments, cities, 
and prehistoric sites, its living cultures are reflected in the work of architects, musicians, 
writers, artisans and crafts people. Strong traditions have long contributed to Ethiopia's 
material wealth by producing illuminated parchment manuscripts, leatherwork, 
metalwork, jewelry, basketry, woodwork, and pottery. Much of this rich heritage is being 
eroded by rapid development and growth, and ancient craft skills are being lost as 
markets and values for artisanal crafts change over time. 
 
Until recently, few of Ethiopia's historic sites had been managed with the view that they 
have much to offer to the national, regional, and local economies. Despite their 
significant influence on Ethiopian heritage, communities of poverty surround these rich 
centers of culture. These contradictions have become increasingly clear to the current 
government, which is seeking ways of strengthening the role of culture in the 
economic life of the country. At the heart of the federal state is the idea that regional 
identities are strongly rooted in cultural expression. The main sector issues with regard to 
cultural heritage conservation and management in Ethiopia relate to the need to: 
·
more fully integrate a cultural dimension into Ethiopia's economic and social 
development program and to incorporate this approach into local development 
efforts; 
Page  7
7
·
build the capacity to prevent the loss of cultural heritage assets through strategic 
conservation planning, protection and threat mitigation, and the development of 
better information about the extent and condition of these assets; and to 
·
coordinate institutional efforts for cultural heritage management amongst multiple 
stakeholders: 
between central, regional and zonal authorities; within communities; between tourism 
and cultural interests;
 
and with other institutions such as the Supreme Islamic Council 
and the Orthodox Church. 
 
The institutional mandate for management and protection of the country's cultural 
heritage assets rests in part with the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural 
Heritage (ARCCH) and in part with regional cultural bureaus. Among other things, 
ARCCH legally has oversight for management of the country's World Heritage Sites, and 
finances some site conservation activities through regional cultural bureaus. Regional 
cultural bureaus, in contrast, operate under the mandate of regional administrations but 
usually have extensive, though informal, contacts with ARCCH. They vary widely in 
their capacity and ability to deliver on the cultural heritage conservation agenda. Capacity 
is constrained, and they remain dependent on technical support from ARCCH. There is 
growing recognition that ARCCH should increasingly work toward building the capacity 
of regional cultural bureaus to take on a wider range of tasks responsive to regional and 
local development priorities. 
 
Legislation which provides for the conservation of assets with major artistic, scientific, 
cultural, or historical value, was adopted in 1989, and has recently been revised. The 
revised legislation provides for the establishment of ARCCH. The 
Proclamation to 
Provide for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage 
(Proclamation 209/2000) 
was endorsed by the Council of Ministers and has now been adopted by the National 
Assembly. Despite the strong synergies and interests between tourism and cultural 
heritage institutions, they have tended to operate in isolation from one another, the former 
focusing primarily on market and infrastructure development, and the latter focusing 
primarily on site management. 
 
In response, the project will provide resources to pilot the development of site planning 
and conservation initiatives in selected priority sites and to build national, regional, and 
local capacity for site planning and conservation in a way which integrates cultural site 
management with local development priorities. The creation of a multi-stakeholder 
steering committee to oversee project implementation, the scope for partnerships with 
national and international NGOs, and the need to collaborate closely with communities 
on site management and development initiatives will provide opportunities to test out 
alternative approaches toward institutional collaboration, and will promote innovative 
opportunities for institutional learning. 
 
The project is a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) that will provide for stronger 
capacity building elements in cultural heritage management. Test the nature of individual 
components for which viable technical, financial, and social solutions need to be 
developed, and, experiment with different partnership arrangements, involving non-
governmental organizations, government agencies, communities, and interested artisans.

Project components are three: 
Site Planning and Conservation
;
Inventory and 
Documentation Development
;
Artisanal Craft Development
.
Government's general strategy of developing mechanisms for identifying - and then 
mitigating 
–potential negative impacts of development activities on cultural sites and 
assets will be strengthened through the project, by developing core national standards for 
inventory/documentation, and guidelines for managing endangered sites.
 
1.3  
Adverse Social Impacts 
Background 
The estimations of the master plan of the city of Axum suggest that, a minimum of 200 
households in Old Town Aksum, may be resettled from identified sites of archeological 
significance, within the next 10-15 years, should the Ethiopian Government find financial 
resources to validate the findings. In the first project operations in Axum, 10 households 
were relocated, thus prompting a subsequent review of the adverse social impacts of the 
project. That experience indicated that similar issues may arise in other locations, proper 
action should therefore be taken within the context of this resettlement framework. 
 
Impacts 
The long-term objective of the Cultural Heritage Project to integrate the conservation and 
the management of its cultural heritage into local and national economic development. 
The project supports the development of approaches to the conservation of cultural 
heritage assets through site planning and conservation of archaeological and historic 
buildings and sites, and through the development of better information for conservation 
planning and threat mitigation.  
 
In the short term, these project operations may induce adverse social impacts. Those 
impacts will be mitigated during project implementation. Project components with 
operations presumed to induce adverse social impacts are related to resettlement: land 
acquisition; appropriation of archeological sites; appropriation of cultural and historical 
buildings; construction of by pass roads; establishment and protection of potential 
archeological sites and cultural and historical zones, construction of tourist 
infrastructures.  
 
Their impacts will be monitored. The designs of the operations of project components 
will be carried out taking into account ways of reducing adverse social impacts. A 
screening for adverse social impacts before commencement should precede project 
operations. The screening should focus on basic social profile of potential PAPs 
identifying issues such as: land tenure, family size, sources of income, potential houses to 
be relocated etc.

2.  
Operational Procedures
 
2.1 Institutional 
Framework 
Stakeholders of the Cultural Heritage Project include a range of actors: government 
institutions and organizations at both federal, regional and local level, multilateral and 
bilateral organizations, private enterprises (national and international), non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) and PAPs.  
 
The Ministry of Youth, Sport and Culture, the Authority for Research and Conservation 
of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH) and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and have, however, 
emerged to be the key stakeholders. These three actors will be consulted in the course of 
the project cycle in order to assure that adverse social and cultural impacts of the 
subprojects are addressed properly. Also, the three actors will be encouraged to 
participate in the identification and in the mitigation of the adverse social and cultural 
impacts that might be identified in the implementation of project operations.  
 
The Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU) is the implementing agency. The implementing 
agencies of presumed resettlement & rehabilitation operations, will, however, be the 
woreda
 (local government) in conjunction with the regional administration. The 
implementation of the mitigation of adverse social impacts, will therefore be executed by 
the 
woredas
 and be subject to the PCU operational procedures in conjunction with: the 
requirements of the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority (EEPA); the World 
Bank policy requirements and the potential requirements of other donors, multilateral as 
well as bilateral. 
2.2  
Planning Principles and Process 
The PCU site-planning officer together with the 
kebele
 
administration, are in charge of 
the identification and the mitigation of adverse social impacts. The PCU site-planning 
officer is accountable for planning and monitoring while the 
kebele
 
administration is 
accountable for the implementation of the expropriation/compensation operations. Also, 
the PCU site planning officer and the monitoring and evaluation officer will address 
analytical issues such as ToRs, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), and evaluations. The 
RAP should, after completion of preparation, be submitted to the World Bank for 
clearance. The 
kebele
 
administration is accountable for: registration of PAPs, 
establishment of compensation committees, assessment and establishment of 
compensation rates and payment of compensation.  
 
The PCU site planning officer and the monitoring and evaluation officer will provide the 
general direction for the planning of the expropriation/compensation tasks, ensure 
Page  10
10
coordination in the mitigation of social impacts of project operations, monitor and 
document the implementation.  
 
2.2.1  Design of  Operations Project Component  
Before commencement of project operations, social screening of project component will 
be conducted in the aim to determine whether or not implementation would trigger 
actions requested in World Bank Operational Policy (4.12). The principles of 
compensation/rehabilitation will be triggered wherever there will be land acquisition.  
 
The World Bank operational policies OP 4.12 as of December 2001 states on paras. 1

experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under development projects, 
if unmitigated, often gives rise to severe economic, social, and environmental risks: 
production systems are dismantled; people face impoverishment when their productive 
assets or income sources are lost; people are relocated to environments where their pro-
ductive skills may be less applicable and the competition for resources greater; commu-
nity institutions and social networks are weakened; kin groups are dispersed; and cultu-
ral identity, traditional authority, and the potential for mutual help are diminished or 
lost. This policy includes safeguards to address and mitigate these impoverishment risks.
\03
Policy Objectives
 
2. Involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term hardship, impoverishment, and 
environmental damage unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried 
out. For these reasons, the overall objectives of the Bank's policy on involuntary 
resettlement are the following: 
 
(a) Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring 
all viable alternative project designs.2 
 
(b) Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be 
conceived and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient 
investment resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project 
benefits. Displaced persons
3
should be meaningfully consulted and should have 
opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs. 
 
(c) Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and 
standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or 
to levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is 
higher.

2.2.2  
Preparation of Operations of Project Component  
After the design of a project operation, the project component may become subject to a 
social screening depending on its activities. Terms of reference (ToR) for the screening 
will be drafted by The PCU site planning officer and the monitoring and evaluation 
officer. Issues to be addressed by the screening will include social profile of potential 
PAPs: demography; land tenure; sources of livelihood, consultations with local 
government and authorities etc. Land tenure issues will be given particular attention as 
they are linked to land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. The loss of land often 
implies that those who live on the land need to be relocated or resettled. The first 
objective of the screening in regard to involuntary resettlement and rehabilitation, is to 
estimate the capacity of the receiving area(s) to sustain additional population under the 
conditions introduced by the resettlement rehabilitation operations. 
 
To reduce adverse social impacts on houses in towns and in villages, the project plans 
will take into account, the physical development plans established by the towns. Master 
plans of urban areas will be taken into account as integrated components of the project.  
 
Should the project add components that were not planed for in the PAD, for instance 
through investments from other donors, and the findings of the social screening reveal 
that more than 200 persons would be affected by project operations, a detailed 
resettlement action plan (RAP) should be prepared. The number of PAPs is a useful tool 
in the planning process.  
 
One of the key activities to be conducted, in the RAP is a household survey, describing 
the extent of the social impacts, looking at data such as:  
·
Family size, gender and age information; 
·
Education; 
·
Occupation; 
·
Land ownership, tenure arrangements, inheritance regulations; 
·
All sources of income; 
·
Inventory of wealth indicators, like building materials, house size, tools and utensils, 
furniture, crops, livestock; 
·
Means of transportation; 
·
Distance to markets, work, schools, and health facilities; 
·
Health implications; 
·
Listing of affected households. 
 
The survey would estimate the extent to which the affected families will experience loss 
of assets, including control over resources, as well as infrastructure and social services 
available and disturbed. The survey should further describe local organizations and 
institutions, traditional village councils, religious groups, etc., that could later participate 
in planning and implementing the resettlement options. Expected changes in demography 
and health impacts should also be addressed. At this stage, all PAPs will be listed in order 
to avoid an influx of people trying to take advantage of the compensation and 
rehabilitation. A cut off date will be proclaimed. That means, a date from which 
Page  12
12
eligibility for compensation will be terminated. New inhabitants coming to the project 
affected areas will not be considered for compensation. 
 
The ToR for the RAP will be drafted by the PCU site planning officer and the monitoring 
and evaluation officer and focus on the following:  
 
·
Technical design alternatives to avoid resettlement; 
·
Land tenure, household survey; socio-economic baseline study; 
·
Selection of resettlement area and provision for alternative sites; 
·
Organizational structures; 
·
Community participation of both resettles and hosts, including also community 
institutions or organizations of both groups and NGOs; 
·
Legal framework; 
·
Plan and design of development assistance to cover both project affected persons 
(PAPs) and host community;  
·
Valuation methodology, title registration, time frame in compensation procedures, 
appeal mechanisms;  
·
Impact on marginal groups, old people, women, ethnic minorities and pastoralists; 
·
Cultural identity and preservation; 
·
Access to training, employment and credit; 
·
Housing, including criteria for house plot allocation, infrastructure and social 
services; 
·
State of natural resources, land suitability and carrying capacity at resettlement site 
estimated at least two generations ahead taking into account population and livestock 
growth, as well as water availability and water quality; 
·
Immediate as well as foreseen health implications at resettlement site in relation to 
water-borne diseases, nutrition, environmental hygiene, availability of clinics or other 
health extension services, hazardous chemicals, toxic wastes, food contamination and 
the work environment; 
·
Possibilities and constraints regarding assimilation or integration of resettles into host 
communities; 
·
Staff requirements, staff training needs, necessary equipment,  
·
Cost estimation, budget, synchronized resettlement implementation action plan with 
the project implementation schedule; and 
·
Monitoring and evaluation procedures. 
 
The final output of the ToR is a RAP. After preparation, the RAP should be submitted to 
the World Bank (ASPEN) for clearance and makes it available to the general public. 
After the World Bank clearance, the project and the World Bank will again disclose the 
RAP to the general public. For detailed procedures see, Annex 4, O.P. 4.12, involuntary 
resettlement paragraph
 
22.  
 
2.2.3 
Implementation of Operations of Components Project 
At the launching of operations of project component, relevant stakeholders will be 
consulted to establish planning principles and work arrangements aimed at identifying 
and mitigating adverse social impacts induced by sub-project operations. Household 
Page  13
13
survey, valuation of properties and payment of compensation will be effected ahead of 
the commencement of civil works. Progressively, all PAPs will be consulted in the 
process, be it in the context of resettlement/compensation, in the context of mitigating 
adverse impacts on cultural heritage or in the context of mitigating other project related 
social impacts. 
 
Likewise, prior to launching of project component operations, regional, zonal and local 
governments will be consulted by the PCU, in line with established procedures. That is, 
the PCU will present the project component to the regional and the zonal administrations 
and they will present it to the local governments. In addition, the PCU will consult with 
the relevant local government officials to present the project component prior to 
implementation.  
 
Parallel with the project component work program and construction schedules, presumed 
implementation of resettlement/rehabilitation action plans will be established. 
Compensation will be paid prior to land acquisition. The project will be requested to 
prepare a social screening report prior to commencement of operations. Those reports 
should present all potential resettlement subjects identified.  
Page  14

3.  Legal Framework for Expropriation and  
Compensation 
3.1  
Expropriation Law 
Resettlement and rehabilitation are recognized civic rights in the Ethiopian legislation. 
Article 44 No.2 of the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has a 
clause stating that:
 
“All persons who have been displaced or whose livelihoods have been adversely 
affected as a result of state programs have the right to commensurate monetary or 
alternative means of compensation, including relocation with adequate state 
assistance.” 
 
In addition, the 
Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage Proclamation 209/2000
 
article 25, 
Expropriation of Cultural Heritage
 sti
pulates that “Any Cultural Heritage: 
1)  which is not properly protected, repaired and restored; or, which is exposed 
to decay, contrary to the provisions of this proclamation, regulations and 
directives to be issued for the implementation of this proclamation; or, which 
is exposed to damage or decay due to its use contrary to the manner 
prescribed in Article 22(3); or 
2)  whose custody in a museum is deemed necessary, and compensation thereof is 
decided by the council of Ministers; 
3) 
which has been detained while being taken out of the country illegally, may be 
confiscated by the Authority
.
These two texts constitute the national legal basis for the compensation rehabilitation 
procedures to be followed by the PCU. In addition, by signing the credit agreement for 
the Cultural Heritage project  (credit 3632) with IDA, the Federal Democratic Republic 
of Ethiopia committed itself to abide the Involuntary Resettlement Policy of the World 
Bank in the context of the project. Thus, the legal framework of the PCU is composed of 
the Ethiopian constitution and the World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12) on 
involuntary resettlement.  
 
In case of potential discord regarding the application of the national legal framework and 
the international one as agreed through the credit agreement with the World Bank, the 
international framework will supersede the national one. For instance, in cases such as: 
the treatment of illegal occupants and squatters. By definition illegal occupants and 
squatters have no rights to compensation in the national legal framework, World Bank 
directives, however, consider such groups to be eligible for compensation and they will 
therefore be compensated on equal terms as other groups, in line with World Bank 
operational policy OP 4.12.  
Page  15
15
3.2 World Bank Procedures for Resettlement/Rehabilitation 
(OP. 4.12)
 
The World Bank operational policies OP 4.12 as of December 2001 states on  
paragraphs 23 and 25:   
 
23. The purpose of the policy framework is to clarify resettlement principles, 
organizational arrangements, and design criteria to be applied to subprojects to be 
prepared during project implementation (see 
OP 4.12
,
paras. 26-28). Subproject 
resettlement plans consistent with the policy framework subsequently are submitted to the 
Bank for approval after specific planning information becomes available (see 
OP 4.12
,
para. 29). 
 
25. When a resettlement policy framework is the only document that needs to be 
submitted as a condition of the loan, the resettlement plan to be submitted as a condition 
of subproject financing need not include the policy principles, entitlements, and eligibility 
criteria, organizational arrangements, arrangements for monitoring and evaluation, the 
framework for participation, and mechanisms for grievance redress set forth in the 
resettlement policy framework. The subproject-specific resettlement plan needs to include 
baseline census and socioeconomic survey information; specific compensation rates and 
standards; policy entitlements related to any additional impacts identified through the 
census or survey; description of resettlement sites and programs for improvement or 
restoration of livelihoods and standards of living; implementation schedule for 
resettlement activities; and detailed cost estimate. 
 
The commitment of the Federal Government of Ethiopia to comply with the requirements 
of World Bank’s operational policy (OP) 4.12 has been demonstrated, among others in 
the ongoing implementation of the Road Sector Development Program Support Project 
RSDPSP, executed by the Ethiopian Road Authority (ERA) and 
in the implementation of 
other projects, such as the Resettlement at Gilgel Gibe Power Plant undertaken by the 
Ethiopian Electric and Power Corporation (EEPCO).  
 
3.3  
The PCU Strategy for Expropriation and Compensation  
It is the objective of the PCU to avoid or reduce to a minimum, the detrimental effects of 
project operations, on the livelihood of the people to be served by the project. However, 
if adverse social impacts induced by project operations are inevitable, then PAPs will be 
identified, be consulted and compensated for loss of their properties.  
 
To achieve the social mitigation goal, the following process will be adopted.  
i. 
The PCU project coordinator will, together with the kebele head administrator, 
prepare and request a yearly budget for expected expropriations and 
compensations costs.  
Page  16
16
ii. 
The budget will be submitted to the woreda administration for funding, depending 
on the size of the amount requested. Smaller amounts under 500 dollars, can be 
directly sponsored by the kebeles. 
 
iii. 
Expropriation and compensation committees will be established in collaboration 
between the PCU site planning officer and the with woreda deputy administrator. 
The role of the committees is to assess the economic value of the properties to be 
expropriated and establish the rate of compensation to be paid.   The committees 
will be composed of local experts/civil servants from the local government 
(Bureau or Department of Agriculture, Bureau or Department of Works and 
Urban Development, Police, etc.), a representative of PAPs and other relevant 
stakeholders. The presence of representatives of various local government sectors 
will ensure that proper economic valuation, for instance of a tree is conducted.  
 
iv. 
Upon the establishment of the compensation rates, eligible PAPs will be provided 
the result for approval. They may accept or refute the compensation proposed. In 
case of disagreement, they may first appeal to the compensation committee and if 
the parties do not find a solution, the PAP may appeal to the kebele court or later 
a
higher court.  
 
v. 
Payment of compensation will be executed by the kebele accountant in 
collaboration with the PCU accountant and in the presence of selected members 
of the compensation committee. .   
 
These are procedures to be followed in addressing expropriation and compensation issues 
in all project operations, present and future.

Socio-Economic Background of PAPs 
5.1 Socio 
–
Cultural and Economic Landscape of PAPs 
The Cultural Heritage Project will cover three regions of Ethiopia (Anhara, Oromia and 
Tigray, but with special focus on four cities, Addis Ababa, Axum, Gondar and Harar. 
Consequently, it will affect the various social and cultural landscapes of those regions 
and cities. Social screenings will be conducted in project operations that have been 
identified to potentially induce adverse social impacts in terms of compensation and 
relocation of people.  
 
The main group of PAPs is assumed to be constituted of urban dwellers, given that 
project sites are located in urban areas. The sources of livelihood of people living in the 
project areas are principally: wage labor, farming, urban animal husbandry, small trade, 
and provision of café – small shops – bar and restaurant services. Based on the above 
assumption, the major resettlement issues may include: relocation of tenants; demolition 
of resident houses and businesses; acquisition urban farmland or housing plots for 
protection and conservation of cultural assets. 
 
Despite the occurrence of detrimental social effects on PAPs, the Cultural Heritage 
project might generate more creativity and productivity from local people; improve the 
well being of the people through cultural ownership; generate new sources of incomes 
and enhance the living standard of communities in project areas. 
 
5.2  
Cultural Affiliation of Project Affected People (PAPs)  
Ethiopia is a multicultural country where the various cultures have been forged by a 
history of cohabitation. Thus there is unity in diversity among the various communities 
that may be adversely affected by project operations. In general, there are commonly 
shared urban cultural values among the presumed PAPs, yet variations may occur.  
 
Amharic, Oromiffa, Tigrigna and Guragigna are the main languages spoken in the project 
areas. Orthodox Christianity and Islam are the predominant religions in the project 
regions and cities and likewise in the country. In the case of the 10 PAPs household 
identified in Axum, all spoke Trigrigna. And all were orthodox Christians. They 
expressed pride in participating in a national cultural heritage project valorizing also their 
cultural regional assets.  
Page  19
19
5.3   Land Use 
Ethiopia is a country with several agro-ecological zones and various types of topography. 
Land forms range from lowland plains to mountain peaks. These are the result of 
geological and geo-morphological processes taking place in and on the surface of the 
earth since time immemorial.  
 
About 85% of the population of Ethiopia live in rural areas and engaged in Agricultural 
activities as their mainstay. Land use is therefore dominated by farming activities. The 
other land use patterns include: pastureland, settlement and wasteland. 
 
All land in Ethiopia belongs to the state. Citizens have, usufruct rights. In lowland areas, 
land is used for grazing, the population of those areas is often nomadic and their 
livelihood is based on cattle rearing. In urban areas, land is mainly used for housing, but 
there is a good share of both urban agriculture and animal husbandry. Yet, given that all 
land belongs to the state, urban dwellers including private and public companies, only 
have usufruct rights to the plots on which they have built their houses, real estates or 
structures.   
 
In the project site areas, Addis Ababa, Axum, Gondar, Harar, urban land use is most 
prevalent. It implies that most land use issues to be encountered by the project are 
presumed to refer to housing plots, urban agriculture and will therefore be subject to 
negotiations of right of access. Land acquisition in terms of long-term use, may there not 
be an issue. In Axum for instance, access to the Ras Mengesha House and compound, 
which will host the artisan center, will not be subject to land acquisition.  
5.4  
Economic Activities 
Farming is the major economic activity in rural areas. The central and northern parts of 
the country are well known for their cereal production and rearing of small herds of 
cattle. The lowland areas of Afar region and East Shoa zone of Oromia are areas where 
nomadic peoples are common. In the project cities, trade, industrial production, urban 
agricultural and animal husbandry. The informal sector, is the main source of livelihood.  
 
In the project site areas, which are dominated by urban economic activities, the informal 
sector is the main source of livelihood. For instance in Axum, in the case of the 10 PAP 
households identified, only two heads of households worked in the formal sector (support 
staff at the local government) the remaining heads of households had their sources of 
livelihood as employees in the informal sector, but constantly drifting in and out of the 
formal sector as a back up.   
Page  20
20
5.5.  
Housing  
Housing conditions in Ethiopia is generally of low standard, especially in the rural areas. 
Construction materials vary from area to area, depending on climatic conditions, ecology, 
transport facilities and purchasing power.   
 
In urban areas, particularly in the project cities, most people live in houses with facilities 
such as water supply, electric light, telephone, toilet and the like. The building materials 
varies from wood, brick to concrete walls and mud. Tin roofs dominate the roofing 
material. Grass roofs are found in low-income neighborhoods. In the Tigray region, 
including the city of Axum, houses are mostly made of stones and with roofs corrugated 
iron sheet or mud and sometimes even with stones.  
 
Forms of ownership of houses in project areas vary.  While houses in rural areas are 
mainly privately owned by individuals, houses in urban areas can in addition be owned 
by: individuals; by private and public real-estate companies, and Federal, Regional and 
local governments, e.g., the kebeles. The kebeles are the primary administrative entities 
of the Ethiopian administration and the primary providers of low-income houses.   
 
In the case of Axum for instance, all 10 PAP households identified were tenants living in 
kebele houses; located in Old Axum at the old city center, about 10 minutes walk from 
the two time honored all Ethiopian national monuments; the 35 m high stelae and the 
church harboring the Arch of the Covenant. The houses were made of mud and stone- 
walls, and corrugated iron sheet roofs. The floors were simply earth. Each PAP 
household was living in one room, furnished with 2-3 adult beds. The rooms had 
electricity.

6.  
Social Impacts of the Cultural Heritage Project 
6.1  
Impacts on Land Use 
Out of the three project components, Site Planning and Conservation, Inventory and 
Documentation Development, Artisanal craft Development, two of the components are 
presumed to have impacts on land use. Those two are:  Site Planning and Conservation, 
and Artisanal Craft Development.  Project sites are located in cities, the presumed project 
impacts on land use will be mainly confined to housing plots and possibly to some urban 
farms. Subsequent project supervision following project effectiveness, identified the 
Axum and the Gondar project sites as potential cases where adverse impact on land use 
might occur. Project supervision missions will monitor project operation impacts on land 
and suggest social screening whenever necessary.  
6.2  
Impacts on Economic Activities  
Impact on economic activities is presumed to be rather positive than adverse. The long-
term objective of the Culture Heritage project is to enhance the income generating 
capacity of the Ethiopian culture heritage capital. In the short term and medium term, the 
project will generate job opportunities, build social capital through training of artisan and 
foster entrepreneurship, both for individuals, for communities and for the administrations, 
local, regional as well as well as national. Project supervision missions will monitor the 
short term and the medium term impacts on the economic activities of project sites.  
6.3  
Impacts on Housing 
Impact on housing is presumed to be limited as land acquisition is presumed to be 
limited. Project components and sites, which would require land acquisition, have been 
identified. Subsequent project supervision following project effectiveness identified 
direct operational impact on housing to take place, for sure, in the city of Axum and 
potentially in Gondar project site. The social screening to be conducted will include the 
assessment of positive and adverse impacts on subjects such as: land tenure, family size, 
sources of income, social networks and so forth. Also, project supervision missions will 
closely monitor adverse impacts on housing.  
 
Page  22
22
6.4 
Impacts on Cultural Heritage 
The culture heritage of Ethiopia is rich and many-faceted. For many years, after the find 
of Lucy (Dinkenesh = The Beautiful) archeologists considered Ethiopia to be the cradle 
of mankind. Ethiopia is the world’s first reference for the archaeology of human origins 
and for human palaeontology. Lucy, one of the oldest humanoids known was found in 
Ethiopia.  
 
Archaeological sites, marketplaces, historical and religious structures are forgotten — 
imbedded in cities, hidden in villages, drowned along river basins and buried along major 
transportation axes where new roads and new cities are built. There is therefore reason to 
be cautious when building new infrastructures, even in a culture heritage project.  
 
Therefore, the presumed project wide social analysis to be conducted will include the 
assessment of potential adverse impacts on culture heritage sites. The 
Research and 
Conservation of Cultural Heritage Proclamation 209/2000
 guidelines will constitute the 
basis for the establishment of the TORs for culture heritage screening or assessments. 
The work will be executed  in consultations with various stakeholders, particularly with  
the Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH). Likewise, the execution 
of the screening or the assessments will be conducted in partnership with the ARCCH.  
6.5  
HIV/AIDS 
The problem of infectious diseases in Ethiopia is becoming critical due to the steady 
emergence of the HIV/AIDS that has been spreading fast during the last two decades 
(Health Policy, 1998). It is estimated that 9.3% of the Ethiopian population is infected 
with HIV/AIDS and 250,000 have died of the disease in 1997 alone (UNAIDS, 1998). 
Investing adequately in combating HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia is now a precondition for any 
development investments in Africa to succeed, the World Bank (2000) concludes in its 
Multi-country HIV/AIDS Program for Ethiopia.  
 
People working with the Cultural Heritage project operations in various sites will be 
transformed, to temporally migrants. As such, they may satisfy their sexual needs “on the 
road.” Their behavior could therefore contribute to the spread of the HIV/AIDS 
pandemic. The PCU site planning officer and the monitoring evaluation officer will 
prepare an HIV/AIDS prevention action plan for the Cultural Heritage project operations.

Valuation Procedures 
7.1 
Organizational Procedures for Delivery of Entitlements 
With regard to land and structures, "replacement cost" is defined as follows: For 
agricultural land, it is the pre-project or pre-displacement, whichever is higher, market 
value of land of equal productive potential or use located in the vicinity of the affected 
land, plus the cost of land preparation to levels similar to those of the affected land, plus 
the cost of any registration and transfer taxes; for land in urban areas, it is the pre 
displacement market value of land of equal size and use, with similar or improved public 
infrastructure facilities and services and located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus 
the cost of any registration and transfer taxes; for houses and other structures, it is the 
market cost of the materials to build a replacement structure with an area and quality 
similar to or better than those of the affected structure, or to repair a partially affected 
structure, plus the cost of transporting building materials to the construction site, plus the 
cost of any labor and contractors' fees, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes.  
 
In determining the replacement cost, depreciation of the asset and the value of salvage 
materials are not taken into account, nor is the value of benefits to be derived from the 
project deducted from the valuation of an affected asset. Where domestic law does not 
meet the standard of compensation at full replacement cost, compensation under domestic 
law is supplemented by additional measures so as to meet the replacement cost standard. 
7.2  
Method of Valuation  
The PCU in collaboration with the kebeles, will employ two methods, which can be used 
to conduct valuation of properties of PAPs. These are replacement cost and 
compensation. (see 
Annex 3
)
Replacement cost  
The replacement-cost approach is based on the premise that the costs of replacing 
productive assets that have been damaged because of project activities or improper on-
site management can be measured. These costs are taken as a minimum estimate of the 
value of measures that will reduce the damage or improve on-site management practices 
and thereby prevent damage. The approach involves direct replacement of expropriated 
assets and covers an amount that is sufficient for asset replacement, net depreciation, 
moving expenses and other transaction costs. This minimum value is then compared to 
the cost of the new measures.  
In line with the principles of “equivalent reinstatement” if the premises to be reinstated 
require repair, a deduction to reflect this should be made. The deduction for repairs is 
Page  24
24
made in accordance with the principle that the reinstated property should as far as 
possible be equal to the property being reinstated. 
7.3  
Basis of Valuation  
The basis of valuation is Gross Current Replacement Cost (GCRC). Gross Current 
Replacement Cost is defined a
s
‘the estimated cost of erecting a building as new having 
the same gross external area as that existing with the site works and services on a similar 
piece of land’. The valuation process will also consider the use of “compensation value” 
for affected properties. 
 
“Compensation value” is defined as ‘ the amount to be paid to the leaseholder which is 
calculated as an amount which is above the gross current replacement cost, including the 
costs for the inconvenience caused to the leaseholders by relocation, and to enable the 
same leaseholders to build slightly better houses than what they currently occupy’.  
 
Compensation Approach 
The compensation approach is based on the willingness of owners of a resource to give 
up their rights to that resource. In general, the issue of compensation will address four 
questions: what to compensate for (e.g. land, structures, business, fixed improvements or 
temporary impacts); how to compensate; when to compensate; and how much to 
compensate. 
 
Compensation for land structures, business, fixed improvements and other temporary 
impacts are based on among other things market valuation, productivity valuation, 
negotiated settlements, material and labor valuation, disposition of salvage materials and 
other fees paid. It should be noted that lack of license or permit will not be a bar to 
compensation. Because, even squatters have construction costs relative to design, 
materials employed, workmanship and final finish. 
 
If relocation of business becomes necessary, access to customers and suppliers should be 
assured. In addition, workers losing employment in the process of relocating should be 
entitled to transitional income support. 
 
Compensation for temporary impacts should include but not limited to the following: 
Compensation equivalent to lost income required for the duration of impact 
Compensation equivalent to lost income required for loss of access 
Physical restoration of assets (or access) required prior to return 
 
In addition, PAPs will be entitled to transitional assistance which include moving 
expenses, temporary residence (if necessary), employment training and income support 
while awaiting employment and should have an option for full compensation if duration 
of impact is to exceed two years. In preparing the valuation average costs will have to be 
assumed. It should be noted that costs of construction vary from one locality to the other.  
Page  25
25
7.4 Compensation Procedures and Civil Works Schedule 
Compensation will be paid by the kebele administration at replacement cost. The PCU 
together with the kebeles will establish expropriation and compensation committees for 
each affected site. The committees will be constituted of representatives of local 
governments, representatives of PAPs and the PCU. Together, they will conduct the 
registration of affected properties and the number of PAPs per households. Likewise, 
they will establish the compensation rates, taking into account, World Bank requirements. 
All compensations will be effected ahead of the civil works. 
 
Compensation procedures will include three steps: (a) Establishment of compensation 
committees, (b) Assessment of replacement values of identified assets; (c) Establishment 
of compensation rates for all assets to be expropriated. For instance, compensation for 
trees will take into account the distinction between various type of trees and their 
economic values; fruit trees versus non -fruit trees etc. Fruit trees will be compensated for 
the value of lost production until another tree comes to the same stage of productivity.  
 
Compensation Rates for Loss of Crops and Trees 
Cash compensation is paid for loss of crops and trees that are found on the land that has 
been acquired. The compensation rates, are established by the relevant agricultural office 
of the locality considered. In accordance with the PCU procedures and in consultations 
with local governments, the kebele will execute the expropriation and the compensation 
for the loss of crops and trees. The decisions taken will be documented with meeting 
protocols
 and 
receipts
 upon payment. The documents should be available at local 
government offices and at the PCU office. Compensation rates for loss of crops and trees 
will be based on market values and cover a cash value of the loss estimated until the new 
crop or tree comes to maturity. The process and the necessary actions to be taken will be 
concluded after consultations with local governments and the PCU.  
 
Compensation Rates for Loss of Houses 
Likewise, compensation procedures for loss of houses are established in consultations 
between the PCU and local governments. The 
woreda
 executes the expropriation/ 
compensation procedures in consultation with: the entitled Project Affected Person (PAP) 
and the local government. A local government committee establishes the compensation 
rates in consultations with eligible PAPs. The rates are established at market value. As in 
the case of expropriation/compensation for loss of crops and trees, the decisions taken are 
documented. Also, each individual PAP has the right to refuse the rate proposed and take 
his case to the court if he finds the compensation to be under market value. 
 
Grievance Redress 
Compensation will only be paid to a PAP after a written consent of the PAP. Should a 
PAP refuse the compensation suggested by the PCU, litigation is settled by the local 
governments courts. Each individual PAP has the right to refuse the compensation rate 
proposed and take his case to the court if he finds the compensation to be under 
replacement cost. This system has worked for the last two decades in Ethiopia and is well 
Page  26
26
known by local administrations who often act as advocates for the compensation of their 
inhabitants.  
 
However, grievances are first preferred to be settled amicably whenever possible. That is, 
positive discussions are made to convince the affected PAP in the presence of elders, 
local administration representative or any influential person in the locality. If the PAP is 
not convinced with what has been proposed, as stated above, he can take the case to the 
court.

8.  
Sources of Funding 
As stated in the Constitution of Ethiopia, people affected by development projects have 
the right to be compensated and resettled. This forms the bottom line for the commitment 
of the Government towards compensation and resettlement/rehabilitation. Whereas the 
national government is the political source of funding, the operational source of funding 
of resettlement/compensation operations is the 
woreda
 administration in agreement with 
kebele (local)  and regional governments.  
 
The scope of potential resettlement/rehabilitation operations assessed and to be induced 
by the three components of the project (Site Planning and Conservation, Inventory and 
Documentation Development and Artisanal craft Development), is within the budgetary 
framework of 
woreda
 administrations. Should the costs for resettlement/rehabilitation at 
any project site exceed the budgetary capacity of the woreda administrations, additional 
financial resources will be covered by the regional administration or by the Federal 
government.  
 
The cost will be calculated on the basis of the estimates made in presumed household 
surveys, including the quantity and types of properties of the PAPs. Upon establishing the 
cost estimates, the budget including resettlement/rehabilitation will be submitted to the 
kebele
,
PAPs and PCU compensation committee for review. Once the budget is 
approved, potential requests for additional funding will be sent by the 
woreda
 and the 
PCU, to the relevant regional governments for funding.  
Page  28
28
9.  
Consultation and Participation Processes 
Relocating or compensating people implies communication or dialogue with the 
stakeholders. Potential PAPs will be consulted individually and in groups, depending on 
the context. The consultation and participation process will include four phases: i) data 
collection; ii) preparation and planning of operations; iii) implementation of operations; 
and iv) monitoring and evaluation.  
The PCU monitoring and evaluation officer will coordinate all the four operations. 
9.1 
Data Collection Phase 
Actors
:
PCU 
Ministry, Bureau or Department of Agriculture (agriculture data) 
Ministry, Bureau or Department of Urban Affairs at the Ministry of Social 
Infrastructure (housing data) 
PAPs (provision of other relevant data) 
Municipality and local administration (household data) 
 
The above actors will constitute the main task force in the data-collection phase. This 
process will include consultations with PAPs, and other relevant stakeholders. The data 
collected will serve as an instrument for the monitoring of the social mitigation measures 
to be implemented.  
 
PAPs, including local administration (the Bureau or Department of Agriculture, the 
Bureau or Department of Works and Urban Development, the Local Police) will be 
consulted through individual and group meetings to share information about the project. 
For example, owners of affected properties, will be informed about actions to be taken 
and the rehabilitation or the resettlement measures anticipated in order to prepare them 
for the changes. At those meetings, PAPs will be invited to participate in the data-
collection phase by providing socio-economic information about their livelihoods. Their 
contributions will be integrated into the project implementation process, from planning to 
evaluation.  
 
The data-collection phase will include three major processes:  
i) Preparation of the resettlement/rehabilitation policy framework;  
ii) Execution of a project wide social analysis or a social screening of a particular project 
component and  
iii) Establishment of the presumed RAP for project operations that would require it. 
 
(to be initiated/completed before civil works).

29
9.2  
Planning Phase 
Actors
:
PCU 
 Municipality and local administration (planning) 
 PAPs (planning inputs, sounding board and advice-giving) 
 
Planning and coordination of the tasks of the various actors is the key to a successful 
implementation of the expropriation/compensation arrangements. To achieve that goal, 
workshops will be organized with the above-mentioned stakeholders and other relevant 
government agencies, at the commencement of every project operation identified to have 
adverse social impacts.  
 
The above three stakeholders will be requested to participate in the decision making 
process and provide inputs in the area of their expertise in order to establish a coherent 
work plan. Also, PAPs will be consulted in the aim to obtain their positions on issues at 
stake. The requirements of their work programs/businesses activities will be incorporated 
into the expropriation/compensation plans.  
 
The workshops will focus on: a) taking stock of the legal framework for compensation;  
b) settle institutional arrangements and mechanisms for payment of compensation;  
c) define tasks and responsibilities of each stakeholder and d) establish a work plan.  
9.3  
Implementation Phase 
Actors
:
PCU 
PAPs (endorsement of arrangements)  
 
The execution of the expropriation/compensation operations will be conducted by the 
PCU together with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and local 
government agencies. PAPs will be consulted about the compensation arrangements 
prepared. Cash compensation amount and size of land offered for compensation will be 
presented to each eligible PAP (husband and wife) for consideration and endorsement 
before cash payment or land for land compensation can be effected.  
 
Page  30
30
 9.4  
Monitoring and Evaluation Phase 
Actors
:
PCU 
Municipality and local administration (monitoring and evaluation) 
PAPs and NGO’s or private consultants wherever required (evaluation) 
 
The PCU will organize project completion workshops with government agencies, NGOs 
and representatives of PAPs after completion of the expropriation/compensation 
operations but prior to the closure of the mitigation measures. The aim of that exercise is 
to assess progress in the operations executed, suggest corrective measures where needed 
and solve pending issues.  
 
After completion of all expropriation/compensation operations, PAPs will be consulted in 
a
household survey. The aim of that survey is to assess the impacts of the social 
mitigation measures implemented. Likewise, the municipality and other local 
administration with PAPs will be consulted to provide their assessments of the impacts of 
the social mitigation measures applied.  
 
The findings of the survey and the workshops will be presented in the Project Completion 
Report, which will be established by the PCU. 
Page  31
31
10.   Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements 
Actors
:
PCU 
Municipality and local administration (monitoring and evaluation) 
PAPs and NGO’s or private consultants as required (evaluation) 
 
Since resettlements could become by-products of project operations, the principal of the 
resettlement/rehabilitation operations will be the PCU, in close co-ordination and co-
operation with local authorities. However, in the case of large scale resettlement/ 
rehabilitation  operations, the PCU may conduct the monitoring through an NGO or with 
the consultant who might have established the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The 
PCU monitoring and evaluation officer will continuously take stock of all expropriation 
compensation reports and discuss them on regular basis with various stakeholders. 
 
The frequency of monitoring may vary, depending on the magnitude and complexity of 
resettlement/rehabilitation. Field visits (supervision missions) by the PCU will be 
effected at least once a month. The 
woreda 
local administration will conduct its own 
monitoring, but when possible, this will be done in conjunction with the PCU.  
 
After completion of resettlement/rehabilitation operations, it is expected that PAPs 
should be better off than prior to resettlement/rehabilitation. Therefore, resettlement 
/rehabilitation operations will be monitored as regard to performance and compliance 
with established policies and objectives. 
 
10.1 Monitoring 
Principles 
For project operations with adverse social impacts, a monitoring and an evaluation plan 
with appropriate mitigation measures will be established. The scope of the plan will take 
into account the size of the social impacts to be mitigated. The plans will describe:  
 
·
Internal monitoring processes; 
·
Key monitoring indicators (provide a list of monitoring indicators, which would be 
used for internal monitoring); 
·
Institutional (including financial) arrangements; 
·
Frequency of reporting and content for internal monitoring, process for integrating 
feedback from internal monitoring into implementation; 
·
Financial arrangements for external monitoring and evaluation, including process for 
awarding and maintenance of contracts for the duration of resettlement; 
·
Methodology for external monitoring; 
·
Key indicators for external monitoring, focusing on outputs and impacts; 
·
Frequency of reporting and content for external monitoring and process for 
integrating feedback from external monitoring into implementation. 
·
Analysis of the environmental and social performance or record of each sub-project 
 
Page  32
32
Internal Monitoring 
will be conducted by the PCU, following the plan described and the 
Stirring Committee will make the necessary follow-up to ensure that proper monitoring is 
being undertaken. Likewise, the local administrations of project sites will conduct 
accompanying their own monitoring in conjunction with the PCU. 
 
External Monitoring
 will be conducted through World Bank supervision missions. 
Classic World Bank supervision mission (twice a year) will, however, not be sufficient to 
monitor progress in the mitigation of adverse social impacts. Given the limited social 
scientific capacity of the PCU, the World Bank supervision missions should be coupled 
with capacity building inputs from an international resettlement expert. This would 
ensure: progress on the ground; strengthen the analytical capacity and safeguard proper 
documentation of operations executed and progress made. 
 
Before closure of the mitigation of adverse social impacts, the CPU will recruit a local 
NGO to conduct an evaluation of the mitigation measures executed. The evaluation 
report will be used as a planning instrument to correct pending issues and suggest a post-
project monitoring period in the aim to ensure that PAPs have not been subject to 
impoverishment induced by project operations.

Annex 1: 
Screening Guidelines  
……… 
 
Screening 
Screening determines whether or not a project component requires detailed environmental and 
social impact analysis and, if so, at what level. Screening involves judging whether or not the 
expected impacts of a proposal on the social environment are likely to be of 
significant
.
While it 
is true that there are different approaches to screening, which could be categorized into, 
judgmental and predetermined, the approach suggested here is a sequential one involving several 
levels of consideration in determining the potential significance of impacts from a proposed 
operation.  
 
Suggested screening tools 
1. Provisions made under national policies and legislation. 
2. Use of a matrix checklist to identify impacts. 
3. Use of a questionnaire checklist to determine significance of impacts. 
 
Provisions made under national policies and legislation  
Provisions made under the Ethiopian national policies and legislation could be used to address 
specific environmental concerns that may be affected by the construction and rehabilitation of 
cultural sites as provided for under relevant policies and pieces of legislation. Notable policies 
and pieces of legislation with specific provisions on environmental and social impacts include: 
The National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), National Environmental Procedure Manual.

Methods of Valuation - World Bank Guidelines 
The text bellow is from the World Bank Resettlement & Rehabilitation Guidebook, found on the 
web at: http://essd.worldbank.org/sdv/guidebook/generic/gindex.htm 
 
Method of Valuation for structures, land, trees and other assets  
at Replacement cost. 
 
Replacement costs is the method of valuation of assets which helps determine the amount 
sufficient to replace lost assets and cover transaction costs. In applying this method of valuation, 
depreciation of structures and assets should not be taken into account. For losses that cannot 
easily be valued or compensated for in monetary terms (e.g. access to public services, customers 
and suppliers; or to fishing, grazing or forest areas), attempts are made to establish access to 
equivalent and culturally acceptable resources and earning opportunities.  
 
·
Replacement cost for houses and structures
·
Replacement cost for land
·
Replacement costs for other assets
Method of Valuation for structures, land, trees and other assets  
Replacement cost for houses and structures 
 
Replacement cost is the market cost of the materials to build a replacement structure, plus the 
cost of transporting building materials to the construction site, plus the cost of any labor and 
contractors' fees, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes. ( the cost of the land upon 
which the house or structure sits is considered in Replacement cost for land
). 
 
Method of Valuation for structures, land, trees and other assets 
Replacement cost for land 
 
For agriculture land, replacement cost is the pre-project or pre-displacement, whichever is 
higher, market value of land or equal potential or use located in the vicinity of the affected 
land, plus the cost of land preparation to levels similar to those of the affected land, plus the 
cost of any registration and transfer taxes.  
For land in urban areas, replacement cost is the pre-displacement market value of land equal 
size and use, with similar or improved public infrastructure facilities and services and located 
in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes.

·
Determining replacement cost in countries with active land markets
:
Determining 
replacement cost of affected land can be relatively easy where active land markets exist (for 
example, in most regions of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Thailand). In projects located in 
these areas, RAPs should include land market surveys. Private and independent real estate 
agencies, banks, or mortgage firms could be engaged to determine market prices for land, or 
to evaluate the adequacy of administratively set compensation. If Borrowers refuse to engage 
private professional agencies, or if legal restrictions preclude payment of fair market prices, 
solatiums, relocation or subsistence allowances, or other forms of cash assistance can be used 
to "top up" compensation to replacement cost levels. Alternatively, committees including 
PAPs or NGO representatives can be formed to participate in establishing land valuation, and 
helping PAPs to identify and purchase replacement land.  
 
Precedents in Practice
In India,
land committees have been established for several projects to identify or purchase 
replacement land from willing sellers. In the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project 
(Cr.2801) legal compensation was to be supplemented by "rehabilitation assistance grants" 
sufficient to purchase replacement land or other productive assets. The projects also promised 
reimbursement for, or exemption from, all transfer fees or taxes.  
In Bangladesh,
the Jamuna Bridge Multipurpose Project (Cr.2569) replaced provision of 
administratively set compensation and an automatic 50% solatium with land purchase 
committees guaranteeing supplemental compensation sufficient to purchase replacement lands 
from a willing seller identified by the PAP. As long as the replacement land was within 
maximum allowable cost ceilings, the PAP could choose between more land of lesser quality, or 
less land of higher quality.

·
Determining replacement cost in countries with "mixed" land markets and property 
systems
:
In some Borrower Countries (notably Indonesia and the Philippines), or in 
particular regions within Borrower Countries, formal property titling remains incomplete, 
leaving a complex melange of competing legal and customary claims upon land (see also 
Customary Claims and Common Property
). In Indonesia, for example, untitled land 
continues to exist even in downtown Jakarta, with titled land valued 10-60% higher. In areas 
lacking coherent and integrated property systems, resource valuations may differ 
substantially and some property claims are likely to go unrecognized. Hence, establishing 
replacement cost requires much greater attention to the type of title and usage rights held by 
affected persons. And projects acquiring land in such areas should encourage vigorous

information disclosure, negotiation or arbitration procedures, and independent grievance 
mechanisms.  
 
Precedents in Practice
In the Philippines,
resettlement plans for the Leyte-Luzon Geothermal Project 
(Ln.3746) called for negotiated settlements on land acquisition between PAPs and the 
National Power Corporation. In the event agreement could not be reached, 
compensation disputes would be addressed by an Independent Appraisal Committee, 
consisting of a real estate expert and representatives from the local land bank and the 
Philippines National Bank.  
Also in the Philippines,
PAPs in the Transmission Grid Reinforcement Project 
(Ln.3996) could choose between compensation as evaluated by an independent 
appraiser or replacement land provided by the project.  
In Indonesia,
resettlement plans for the pending Second Sulawesi Urban 
Development Project would give PAPs with insecure tenure (and those now in rental 
housing) tenurial rights in developed houseplots that cannot be sold for at least 10 
years.

Replacement cost for land 
·
Determining replacement cost in countries lacking land markets
:
Though both Vietnam 
and China are experimenting with mechanisms to increase individual or household tenure, 
land remains collectively or publicly owned and cannot be alienated. In China, the Bank 
accepts country practice of compensating the collectivities rather than affected households 
for expropriated land. (Affected households, in turn, receive replacement land or other forms 
of rehabilitation assistance from collectives or local authorities.) In Vietnam, by contrast, 
affected households often are directly compensated for loss of use of land. In the absence of 
land markets, replacement cost in these countries needs to be linked to the productive value 
of the affected land.  
 
Precedents in Practice
In China,
compensation for expropriated rural land is calculated as a multiplier 
(usually 3-6) of the average annual value of agricultural production over the 
preceding three years. Some project plans, gradually increase the multiplier to favor 
smaller average landholdings in affected villages. An additional resettlement 
"subsidy" (allowance) for the people who need to be economically rehabilitated is 
also paid (and also is calculated as a multiplier). Where PAPs are relocated from one 
local jurisdictional unit to another, compensation and rehabilitation packages can be 
split among both. In some projects, the original unit of residence is compensated for 
loss of land while the unit of relocation receives rehabilitation assistance for 
providing alternative lands, jobs, or commercial opportunities. In the Xiaolangdi 
Resettlement Project (Cr.2605), however, all compensation and rehabilitation 
assistance goes to the local unit in the area of relocation; if collectives lose both land

and PAPs they receive no compensation. National law limits combined compensation 
for land and economic rehabilitation to no more than 20 times the average annual 
productive value of the acquired land.  
 
In Vietnam,
an emerging market permits land use rights to be bought and sold at 
highly fluctuating prices. Compensation rates payable in cash to project affected 
households were introduced by national decree (87-CP) in 1994, which sets minimum 
and maximum prices for various categories of land. The prices established in this 
decree are set administratively and may not represent replacement cost. Bank 
experience in Vietnam so far has mainly focused on the land-for-land option for 
people losing more than 20% of their total holding, and cash compensation for people 
losing less than 20%. New laws also allow for outright ownership (and alienation) of 
houseplots up to 200 square meters in size. The Irrigation Rehabilitation Project 
(Cr.2711) provides 60% of replacement cost for non-owned homesteads (plus full 
compensation for the house or other structures) to be used for purchase of privately 
owned homesteads. In all instances, compensation is to be sufficient to purchase a 
200-square-meter parcel. The conversion from use rights to outright, alienable 
ownership is considered as contributing to replacement cost.

Schedule of rates obtained from the infrastructure department
:
The infrastructure 
construction departments in all countries have a schedule of rates for preparing estimates for 
construction projects, which Borrower agencies themselves use to assess costs for 
construction materials and labor. When applied to calculation of replacement cost, rates 
current for the period of actual replacement must be used.

programs
:
Where rate schedules do not exist or are out of date, recent quotations by 
contractors for similar types of construction in the vicinity of the project can be used for 
calculating replacement cost. In projects offering the options of cash compensation or 
alternative accommodation, the construction cost estimates for alternative accommodation 
could be used for calculating cash compensation payable.

These policies were prepared for use by World Bank staff and are not necessarily a complete treatment of the subject.  
·
For public infrastructure:
in-kind replacement under force account within an agreed time 
schedule, or full compensation to the agency replacing the service is required.  
 
·
For cultural property and community-owned facilities:
in-kind replacement or compensation 
at replacement cost for land and structures (e.g., religious churches, mosques, temples, or 
shrines; private or community-operated schools; village meeting houses; local libraries).  
 
·
For cash crops:
Arrangements should be made to allow for harvest or market value should be 
paid for lost cash crops. In some countries average annual market value of crops for the 
previous 3 years is deemed appropriate as crop compensation. Compensation for subsistence 
crops can be in-kind, or can be an amount of cash sufficient to purchase equivalent supplies.  
 
·
For trees:
Where markets do not provide sufficient information about the value of fruit or 
timber, compensation for fruit-bearing and non-fruit-bearing trees should be at net present 
value calculated for the productive life. In the case of immature trees, a less costly alternative 
may be to directly replace seedlings.  
Other assets:
Tubewells, graves, fishponds, poultry houses, fences, and other tangible assets 
should be replaced in kind (or with functional equivalents), relocated, or be compensated at 
replacement cost.

Annex 4: 
Involuntary Resettlement
 
1. Bank
1
experience indicates that involuntary resettlement under development projects, if 
unmitigated, often gives rise to severe economic, social, and environmental risks: production 
systems are dismantled; people face impoverishment when their productive assets or income 
sources are lost; people are relocated to environments where their productive skills may be less 
applicable and the competition for resources greater; community institutions and social 
networks are weakened; kin groups are dispersed; and cultural identity, traditional authority, 
and the potential for mutual help are diminished or lost.  This policy includes safeguards to 
address and mitigate these impoverishment risks. 
Policy Objectives
 
2. 
Involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term hardship, impoverishment, and 
environmental damage unless appropriate measures are carefully planned and carried out.  For these 
reasons, the overall objectives of the Bank’s policy on involuntary resettlement are the following: 
 
(a) 
Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all viable 
alternative project designs.
2
(b) 
Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be conceived and 
executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment resources to 
enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project benefits.  Displaced persons
3
should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to participate in planning and 
implementing resettlement programs. 
(c) 
Displaced persons should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and 
standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to 
levels prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.
4
1. 
“Bank” includes IDA; “loans” includes credits, guarantees, Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advances and grants; and 
“projects” includes projects under (a) adaptable program lending; (b) learning and innovation loans; (c) PPFs and 
Institutional Development Funds (IDFs), if they include investment activities; (d) grants under the Global Environment 
Facility and Montreal Protocol, for which the Bank is the implementing/executing agency; and (e) grants or loans provided 
by other donors that are administered by the Bank.  The term “project” does not include programs under adjustment 
operations. “Borrower” also includes, wherever the context requires, the guarantor or the project implementing agency. 
2. 
In devising approaches to resettlement in Bank-assisted projects, other Bank policies should be taken into account, as 
relevant. These policies include

Impacts Covered 
3. 
This  policy  covers  direct  economic  and  social  impacts
5
that  both 
result  from Bank-assisted investment projects
6
,
and
are caused by
 
(a) the involuntary
7
taking of land
8
resulting in  
(i) 
relocation or loss of shelter; 
(ii) 
lost of assets or access to assets; or  
(iii) 
loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the 
affected persons must move to another location; or 
(b) 
the involuntary restriction of access
9
to legally designated parks and protected 
areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the displaced persons. 
4. 
This policy applies to all components of the project that result in 
involuntary resettlement, regardless of the source of financing.  It also applies to 
other activities resulting in involuntary resettlement, that in the judgment of the 
Bank, are (a) directly and significantly related to the Bank-assisted project, 
(b) necessary to achieve its objectives as set forth in the project documents; and 
(c) carried out, or planned to be carried out, contemporaneously with the project. 
5. Requests 
for 
guidance
 
on the application and scope of this policy should be addressed to 
the Resettlement Committee (see 
BP 4.12
,
para. 7).
10
 
5. 
Where there are adverse indirect social or economic impacts, it is good practice for the borrower to undertake a 
social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse economic and social impacts, 
particularly upon poor and vulnerable groups.  Other environmental, social, and economic impacts that do not 
result from land taking may be identified and addressed through environmental assessments and other project 
reports and instruments. 
6. 
This policy does not apply to restrictions of access to natural resources under community-based projects, i.e. 
where the community using the resources decides to restrict access to these resources, provided that an 
assessment satisfactory to the Bank establishes that the community decision-making process is adequate, and 
that it provides for identification of appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts, if any, on the vulnerable 
members of the community. This policy also does not cover refugees from natural disasters, war, or civil strife 
(see 
OP
/
BP 8.50
,
Emergency Recovery Assistance
). 
7. 
For purposes of this policy, “involuntary” means actions that may be taken without the displaced person’s 
informed consent or power of choice. 
8.  
“Land” includes anything growing on or permanently affixed to land, such as buildings and crops.  This policy 
does not apply to regulations of natural resources on a national or regional level to promote their sustainability, 
such as watershed management, groundwater management, fisheries management, etc.  The policy also does not 
apply to disputes between private parties in land titling projects, although it is good practice for the borrower to 
undertake a social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse social impacts, 
especially those affecting poor and vulnerable groups. 
9.  
For the purposes of this policy, involuntary restriction of access covers restrictions on the use of resources 
imposed on people living outside the park or protected area, or on those who continue living inside the park or 
protected area during and after project implementation.  In cases where new parks and protected areas are 
created as part of the project, persons who lose shelter, land, or other assets are covered under para. 3(a). Persons 
who lose shelter in existing parks and protected areas are also covered under para. 3(a). 
10. The 
Resettlement Sourcebook
 (forthcoming) provides good practice guidance to staff on the policy.

Required Measures 
6. 
To address the impacts covered under para. 3 (a) of this policy, the 
borrower prepares a resettlement plan or a resettlement policy framework (see 
paras. 25-30) that covers the following: 
(a) 
The resettlement plan or resettlement policy framework includes measures to 
ensure that the displaced persons are 
(i) 
informed about their options and rights pertaining to resettlement; 
(ii)  consulted on, offered choices among, and provided with technically and 
economically feasible resettlement alternatives; and  
(iii)  provided prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost
11
 for losses 
of assets
12
 attributable directly to the project. 
(b) 
If the impacts include physical relocation, the resettlement plan or resettlement policy 
framework includes measures to ensure that the displaced persons are  
(i) 
provided assistance (such as moving allowances) during relocation; and  
(ii) 
provided with residential housing, or housing sites, or, as required, agricultural 
sites for which a combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and 
other factors is at least equivalent to the advantages of the old site.
13
 
(c) 
Where necessary to achieve the objectives of the policy, the resettlement plan or 
resettlement policy framework also include measures to ensure that displaced persons 
are 
(i) 
offered support after displacement, for a transition period, based on a reasonable 
estimate of the time likely to be needed to restore their livelihood and standards 
of living;
14
 and
 
11. 
“Replacement cost” is the method of valuation of assets that helps determine the amount sufficient to replace 
lost assets and cover transaction costs.  In applying this method of valuation, depreciation of structures and 
assets should not be taken into account (for a detailed definition of replacement cost, see Annex A, footnote 1).  
For losses that cannot easily be valued or compensated for in monetary terms (e.g., access to public services, 
customers, and suppliers; or to fishing, grazing, or forest areas), attempts are made to establish access to 
equivalent and culturally acceptable resources and earning opportunities.  Where domestic law does not meet the 
standard of compensation at full replacement cost, compensation under domestic law is supplemented by 
additional measures necessary to meet the replacement cost standard.  Such additional assistance is distinct from 
resettlement assistance to be provided under other clauses of para. 6. 
12. 
If the residual of the asset being taken is not economically viable, compensation and other resettlement 
assistance are provided as if the entire asset had been taken. 
13. 
The alternative assets are provided with adequate tenure arrangements.  The cost of alternative residential 
housing, housing sites, business premises, and agricultural sites to be provided can be set off against all or part 
of the compensation payable for the corresponding asset lost. 
14. 
Such support could take the form of short-term jobs, subsistence support, salary maintenance or similar 
arrangements

(ii) 
provided with development assistance in addition to compensation measures 
described in paragraph 6(a) (iii), such as land preparation, credit facilities, 
training, or job opportunities
.
7. 
In projects involving involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and 
protected areas (see para. 3(b)), the nature of restrictions, as well as the type of measures 
necessary to mitigate adverse impacts, is determined with the participation of the displaced 
persons during the design and implementation of the project.  In such cases, the borrower 
prepares a process framework acceptable to the Bank, describing the participatory process by 
which 
(a) 
specific components of the project will be prepared and implemented; 
(b) 
the criteria for eligibility of displaced persons will be determined; 
(c) 
measures to assist the displaced persons in their efforts to improve their livelihoods, or 
at least to restore them, in real terms, while maintaining the sustainability of the park 
or protected area, will be identified; and 
(d) 
potential conflicts involving displaced persons will be resolved. 
The process framework also includes a description of the arrangements for implementing and 
monitoring the process. 
8.
 
To achieve the objectives of this policy, particular attention is paid to the needs of 
vulnerable groups among those displaced, especially those below the poverty line, the 
landless, the elderly, women and children, indigenous peoples,
15
 ethnic minorities, or 
other displaced persons who may not be protected through national land 
compensation legislation. 
9. 
Bank experience has shown that resettlement of indigenous peoples with traditional land-
based modes of production is particularly complex and may have significant adverse impacts on 
their identity and cultural survival.  For this reason, the Bank satisfies itself that the borrower has 
explored all viable alternative project designs to avoid physical displacement of these groups.  
When it is not feasible to avoid such displacement, preference is given to land-based resettlement 
strategies for these groups (see para. 11) that are compatible with their cultural preferences and are 
prepared in consultation with them (see Annex A, para. 11). 
10. 
The implementation of resettlement activities is linked to the 
implementation of the investment component of the project to ensure that 
displacement or restriction of access does not occur before necessary measures for 
resettlement are in place.  For impacts covered in para. 3(a) of this policy, these 
measures include provision of compensation and of other assistance required for 
relocation, prior to displacement, and preparation and provision of resettlement 
sites with adequate facilities, where required.  In particular, taking of land and 
related assets may take place only after compensation has been paid and, where 
applicable, resettlement sites and moving allowances have been provided to the 
15. See

displaced persons.  For impacts covered in para. 3(b) of this policy, the measures to 
assist the displaced persons are implemented in accordance with the plan of action 
as part of the project (see para. 30). 
11. 
Preference should be given to land-based resettlement strategies for displaced persons 
whose livelihoods are land-based.  These strategies may include resettlement on public land (see 
footnote 1 above), or on private land acquired or purchased for resettlement.  Whenever 
replacement land is offered, resettlers are provided with land for which a combination of 
productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is at least equivalent to the 
advantages of the land taken.  If land is not the preferred option of the displaced persons, the 
provision of land would adversely affect the sustainability of a park or protected area,
16
 or 
sufficient land is not available at a reasonable price, non-land-based options built around 
opportunities for employment or self-employment should be provided in addition to cash 
compensation for land and other assets lost.  The lack of adequate land must be demonstrated and 
documented to the satisfaction of the Bank. 
12. 
Payment of cash compensation for lost assets may be appropriate where (a) livelihoods 
are land-based but the land taken for the project is a small fraction
17
 of the affected asset and the 
residual is economically viable; (b) active markets for land, housing, and labor
 
exist, displaced 
persons
 
use such markets, and there is sufficient supply of land and housing; or (c) livelihoods are 
not land-based.  Cash compensation levels should be sufficient to replace the lost land and other 
assets at full replacement cost in local markets. 
13.
 
For impacts covered under para. 3(a) of this policy, the Bank also requires the following: 
 
(a) 
Displaced persons and their communities, and any host communities receiving them, 
are provided timely and relevant information, consulted on resettlement options, and 
offered opportunities to participate in planning, implementing, and monitoring 
resettlement.  Appropriate and accessible grievance mechanisms are established for 
these groups. 
(b) 
In new resettlement sites or host communities, infrastructure and public services are 
provided as necessary to improve, restore, or maintain accessibility and levels of 
service for the displaced persons and host communities.  Alternative or similar 
resources are provided to compensate for the loss of access to community resources 
(such as fishing areas, grazing areas, fuel, or fodder). 
(c) 
Patterns of community organization appropriate to the new circumstances are 
based on choices made by the displaced persons.  To the extent possible, the 
existing social and cultural institutions of resettlers and any host communities 
are preserved and resettlers’ preferences with respect to relocating in 
preexisting communities and groups are honored. 
16. See 
OP 4.04
,
Natural Habitats.
 
17. 
As a general principle, this applies if the land taken constitutes less than 20% of the total productive area.

Eligibility for Benefits
18
 
14. 
Upon identification of the need for involuntary resettlement in a project, the 
borrower carries out a census to identify the persons who will be affected by the project 
(see the Annex A, para. 6(a)), to determine who will be eligible for assistance, and to 
discourage inflow of people ineligible for assistance.  The borrower also develops a 
procedure, satisfactory to the Bank, for establishing the criteria by which displaced 
persons will be deemed eligible for compensation and other resettlement assistance.  The 
procedure includes provisions for meaningful consultations with affected persons and 
communities, local authorities, and, as appropriate, nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), and it specifies grievance mechanisms. 
 
15.
 
Criteria for Eligibility
.
Displaced persons may be classified in one of the 
following three groups:  
(a) 
those who have formal legal rights to land (including customary and traditional rights 
recognized under the laws of the country); 
(b) 
those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the census begins 
but have a claim to such land or assets
—provided that such claims are 
recognized under the laws of the country or become recognized through a 
process identified in the resettlement plan (see Annex A, para. 7(f)); and
19
 
(d) those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are occupying. 
16. 
Persons covered under para. 15(a) and (b) are provided compensation for the land 
they lose, and other assistance in accordance with para. 6.  Persons covered under para. 
15(c) are provided resettlement assistance
20
 in lieu of compensation for the land they 
occupy, and other assistance, as necessary, to achieve the objectives set out in this policy, 
if they occupy the project area prior to a cut-off date established by the borrower and 
acceptable to the Bank.
21
 
Persons who encroach on the area after the cut-off date are 
not entitled to compensation or any other form of resettlement assistance. All persons 
included in para. 15(a), (b), or (c) are provided compensation for loss of assets other 
than land.  
18. 
Paras. 13-15 do not apply to impacts covered under para. 3(b) of this policy. The eligibility criteria for displaced 
persons under 3 (b) are covered under the process framework (see paras. 7 and 30). 
19. 
Such claims could be derived from adverse possession, from continued possession of public lands without 
government action for eviction (that is, with the implicit leave of the government), or from customary and 
traditional law and usage, and so on. 
20. 
Resettlement assistance may consist of land, other assets, cash, employment, and so on, as appropriate. 
21. 
Normally, this cut-off date is the date the census begins.  The cut-off date could also be the date the project area 
was delineated, prior to the census, provided that there has been an effective public dissemination of information 
on the area delineated, and systematic and continuous dissemination subsequent to the delineation to prevent 
further population influx.

17. 
To achieve the objectives of this policy, different planning instruments are 
used, depending on the type of project: 
(a) 
a
resettlement plan or abbreviated resettlement plan is required for all operations that 
entail involuntary resettlement unless otherwise specified (see para. 25 and 
Annex A
); 
(b) 
a resettlement policy framework is required for operations referred to in paras. 26-30 
that may entail involuntary resettlement, unless otherwise specified (see 
Annex A
); 
and 
(c) 
a process framework is prepared for projects involving restriction of access in 
accordance with para. 3(b) (see para. 31).
 
18. 
The borrower is responsible for preparing, implementing, and monitoring 
a
resettlement plan, a resettlement policy framework, or a process framework (the 
“resettlement instruments”), as appropriate, that conform to this policy.  The 
resettlement instrument presents a strategy for achieving the objectives of the policy 
and covers all aspects of the proposed resettlement.  Borrower commitment to, and 
capacity for, undertaking successful resettlement is a key determinant of Bank 
involvement in a project.  
19. 
Resettlement planning includes early screening, scoping of key issues, the choice of 
resettlement instrument, and the information required to prepare the resettlement component or 
subcomponent.  The scope and level of detail of the resettlement instruments vary with the 
magnitude and complexity of resettlement.  In preparing the resettlement component, the 
borrower draws on appropriate social, technical, and legal expertise and on relevant community-
based organizations and NGOs.
22
 
The borrower informs potentially displaced persons at an early 
stage about the resettlement aspects of the project and takes their views into account in project 
design. 
20. 
The full costs of resettlement activities necessary to achieve the objectives 
of the project are included in the total costs of the project.  The costs of 
resettlement, like the costs of other project activities, are treated as a charge 
against the economic benefits of the project; and any net benefits to resettlers (as 
compared to the “without-project” circumstances) are added to the benefits stream 
of the project.  Resettlement components or free-standing resettlement projects need 
not be economically viable on their own, but they should be cost-effective. 
22. 
For projects that are highly risky or contentious, or that involve significant and complex resettlement activities, 
the borrower should normally engage an advisory panel of independent, internationally recognized resettlement 
specialists to advise on all aspects of the project relevant to the resettlement activities.  The size, role, and 
frequency of meeting depend on the complexity of the resettlement.  If independent technical advisory panels are 
established under 
OP 4.01
,
Environmental Assessment
,
the resettlement panel may form part of the 
environmental panel of experts.

21. 
The borrower ensures that the Project Implementation Plan is fully consistent with the 
resettlement instrument.  
22. 
As a condition of appraisal of projects involving resettlement, the borrower provides the 
Bank with the relevant draft resettlement instrument which conforms to this policy, and makes it 
available at a place accessible to displaced persons and local NGOs, in a form, manner, and 
language that are understandable to them.  Once the Bank accepts this instrument as providing an 
adequate basis for project appraisal, the Bank makes it available to the public through its 
InfoShop.  After the Bank has approved the final resettlement instrument, the Bank and the 
borrower disclose it again in the same manner.
23
 
23. 
The borrower’s obligations to carry out the resettlement instrument and to keep the Bank 
informed of implementation progress are provided for in the legal agreements for the project. 
24. 
The borrower is responsible for adequate monitoring and evaluation of the activities set 
forth in the resettlement instrument.  The Bank regularly supervises resettlement implementation 
to determine compliance with the resettlement instrument.  Upon completion of the project, the 
borrower undertakes an assessment to determine whether the objectives of the resettlement 
instrument have been achieved.  The assessment takes into account the baseline conditions and 
the results of resettlement monitoring.  If the assessment reveals that these objectives may not be 
realized, the borrower should propose follow-up measures that may serve as the basis for 
continued Bank supervision, as the Bank deems appropriate (see also 
BP 4.12
,
para. 16). 
Resettlement Instruments 
Resettlement Plan 
25. 
A draft resettlement plan that conforms to this policy is a condition of appraisal (see 
Annex A
,
paras. 2-21) for projects referred to in para. 17(a) above.
24
 
However, where impacts on 
the entire displaced population are minor,
25
 or fewer than 200 people are displaced, an 
abbreviated resettlement plan may be agreed with the borrower (see Annex A, para. 22).  The 
information disclosure procedures set forth in para. 22 apply. 
Resettlement Policy Framework 
26. 
For sector investment operations that may involve involuntary resettlement, the Bank 
requires that the project implementing agency screen subprojects to be financed by the Bank to 
ensure their consistency with this OP.  For these operations, the borrower submits, prior to 
appraisal, a resettlement policy framework that conforms to this policy (see 
Annex A
,
paras. 23-
25).  The framework also estimates, to the extent feasible, the total population to be displaced and 
the overall resettlement costs. 
23
 
See 
BP 17.50
,
Disclosure of Operational Information 
(forthcoming) for detailed disclosure 
procedures. 
24. 
An exception to this requirement may be made in highly unusual circumstances (such as emergency recovery 
operations) with the approval of Bank Management (see BP 4.12, para. 8).  In such cases, the Management’s 
approval stipulates a timetable and budget for developing the resettlement plan. 
25. 
Impacts are considered “minor” if the affected people are not physically displaced and less than 10% of their 
productive assets are lost.

27. 
For financial intermediary operations that may involve involuntary resettlement, the Bank 
requires that the financial intermediary (FI) screen subprojects to be financed by the Bank to 
ensure their consistency with this OP.  For these operations, the Bank requires that before 
appraisal the borrower or the FI submit to the Bank a resettlement policy framework conforming 
to this policy (see 
Annex A,
paras. 23-25).  In addition, the framework includes an assessment of 
the institutional capacity and procedures of each of the FIs that will be responsible for subproject 
financing.  When, in the assessment of the Bank, no resettlement is envisaged in the subprojects 
to be financed by the FI, a resettlement policy framework is not required.  Instead, the legal 
agreements specify the obligation of the FIs to obtain from the potential subborrowers a 
resettlement plan consistent with this policy if a subproject gives rise to resettlement.  For all 
subprojects involving resettlement, the resettlement plan is provided to the Bank for approval 
before the subproject is accepted for Bank financing. 
28. 
For other Bank-assisted project with multiple subprojects
26
 that may involve involuntary 
resettlement, the Bank requires that a draft resettlement plan conforming to this policy be 
submitted to the Bank before appraisal of the project unless, because of the nature and design of 
the project or of a specific subproject or subprojects (a) the zone of impact of subprojects cannot 
be determined, or (b) the zone of impact is known but precise sitting alignments cannot be 
determined.  In such cases, the borrower submits a resettlement policy framework consistent with 
this policy prior to appraisal (see 
Annex A,
paras. 23-25).  For other subprojects that do not fall 
within the above criteria, a resettlement plan conforming to this policy is required prior to 
appraisal. 
29. 
 For each subproject included in a project described in para. 26, 27, or 28 that may 
involve resettlement, the Bank requires that a satisfactory resettlement plan or an abbreviated 
resettlement plan that is consistent with the provisions of the policy framework be submitted to 
the Bank for approval before the subproject is accepted for Bank financing. 
30. 
For projects described in paras. 26-28 above, the Bank may agree, in writing, that 
subproject resettlement plans may be approved by the project implementing agency or a 
responsible government agency or financial intermediary without prior Bank review, if that 
agency has demonstrated adequate institutional capacity to review resettlement plans and ensure 
their consistency with this policy
.
Any such delegation, and appropriate remedies for the entity’s 
approval of resettlement plans found not to be in compliance with Bank policy, are provided for 
in the legal agreements for the project.  In all such cases, implementation of the resettlement plans 
is subject to ex post review by the Bank. 
Process Framework
 
31. 
For projects involving restriction of access in accordance with para. 3(b) 
above, the borrower provides the Bank with a draft process framework that 
conforms to the relevant provisions of this policy as a condition of appraisal.  In 
addition, during project implementation and before to enforcing of the restriction, 
the borrower prepares a plan of action, acceptable to the Bank, describing the 
specific measures to be undertaken to assist the displaced persons and the 
arrangements for their implementation.  The plan of action could take the form of a 
natural resources management plan prepared for the project. 
26. 
For purpose of this paragraph, the term 
“subprojects” includes components and subcomponents.

Assistance to the Borrower 
32.
 
In furtherance of the objectives of this policy, t
he Bank may at a borrower’s request 
support the borrower and other concerned entities by providing 
(a) 
assistance to assess and strengthen resettlement policies, strategies, legal 
frameworks, and specific plans at a country, regional, or sectoral level; 
(b) 
financing of technical assistance to strengthen the capacities of agencies 
responsible for resettlement, or of affected people to participate more 
effectively in resettlement operations;
 
(c) 
financing of technical assistance for developing resettlement policies, 
strategies, and specific plans, and for implementation, monitoring, and 
evaluation of resettlement activities; and 
(d) 
financing of the investment costs of resettlement. 
33. 
The Bank may finance either a component of the main investment causing displacement 
and requiring resettlement, or a free-standing resettlement project with appropriate cross-
conditionalities, processed and implemented in parallel with the investment that causes the 
displacement.  The Bank may finance resettlement even though it is not financing the main 
investment that makes resettlement necessary. 
34. 
The Bank does not disburse against cash compensation and other resettlement assistance 
paid in cash, or against the cost of land (including compensation for land acquisition).  However, 
it may finance the cost of land improvement associated with resettlement activities.

description of the boundaries of the 
relocation area; and an assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed resettlement
29
 
1.  
With regard to land and structures, “replacement cost” is defined as follows: For agricultural land, it is the pre-
project or pre-displacement, whichever is higher, market value of land of equal productive potential or use 
located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of preparing the land to levels similar to those of the 
affected land, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes.  For land in urban areas, it is the pre-
displacement market value of land of equal size and use, with similar or improved public infrastructure facilities 
and services and located in the vicinity of the affected land, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes.  
For houses and other structures, it is the market cost of the materials to build a replacement structure with an 
area and quality similar to or better than those of the affected structure, or to repair a partially affected structure, 
plus the cost of transporting building materials to the construction site, plus the cost of any labor and 
contractors’ fees, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes.  In determining the replacement cost, 
depreciation of the asset and the value of salvage materials are not taken into account, nor is the value of benefits 
to be derived from the project deducted from the valuation of an affected asset.  Where domestic law does not 
meet the standard of compensation at full replacement cost, compensation under domestic law is supplemented 
by additional measures so as to meet the replacement cost standard.  Such additional assistance is distinct from 
resettlement measures to be provided under other clauses in 
OP 4.12
,
para. 6.
 
2. 
Provision of health care services, particularly for pregnant women, infants, and the elderly, may be important 
during and after relocation to prevent increases in morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition, the psychological 
stress of being uprooted, and the increased risk of disease. 
3. 
Negative impacts that should be anticipated and mitigated include, for rural resettlement, deforestation, 
overgrazing, soil erosion, sanitation, and pollution; for urban resettlement, projects should address such density-
related issues as transportation capacity and access to potable water, sanitation systems, and health facilities.

and measures to mitigate and manage these impacts (coordinated as appropriate with the 
environmental assessment of the main investment requiring the resettlement). 
15. 
Community participation
.
Involvement of resettlers and host communities,
30
 including 
(a) 
a description of the strategy for consultation with and participation of 
resettlers and hosts in the design and implementation of the resettlement 
activities; 
(b) 
a summary of the views expressed and how these views were taken into account 
in preparing the resettlement plan; 
(c) 
a review of the resettlement alternatives presented and the choices made by 
displaced persons regarding options available to them, including choices 
related to forms of compensation and resettlement assistance, to relocating as 
individuals families or as parts of preexisting communities or kinship groups, 
to sustaining existing patterns of group organization, and to retaining access to 
cultural property (e.g. places of worship, pilgrimage centers, cemeteries);
31
 
and 
(d) 
institutionalized arrangements by which displaced people can communicate 
their concerns to project authorities throughout planning and implementation, 
and measures to ensure that such vulnerable groups as indigenous people, 
ethnic minorities, the landless, and women are adequately represented. 
16. 
Integration with host populations
.
Measures to mitigate the impact of resettlement on any 
host communities, including 
(a) 
consultations with host communities and local governments; 
(b) 
arrangements for prompt tendering of any payment due the hosts for land or 
other assets provided to resettlers; 
(c) 
arrangements for addressing any conflict that may arise between resettlers and 
host communities; and 
(d) 
any measures necessary to augment services (e.g., education, water, health, and 
production services) in host communities to make them at least comparable to 
services available to resettlers. 
17. 
Grievance procedures.
 
Affordable and accessible procedures for third-party settlement of 
disputes arising from resettlement; such grievance mechanisms should take into account the 
availability of judicial recourse and community and traditional dispute settlement mechanisms. 
4. 
Experience has shown that local NGOs often provide valuable assistance and ensure viable community 
participation.

Resettlement Policy Framework 
23. 
The purpose of the policy framework is to clarify resettlement principles, organizational 
arrangements, and design criteria to be applied to subprojects to be prepared during project 
implementation (see 
OP 4.12
,
paras. 26-28).  Subproject resettlement plans consistent with the 
policy framework subsequently are submitted to the Bank for approval after specific planning 
information becomes available (see 
OP 4.12
,
para. 29). 
24. 
The resettlement policy framework covers the following elements, consistent with the 
provisions described in 
OP 4.12
,
paras. 2 and 4: 
(a) 
a brief description of the project and components for which land acquisition and 
resettlement are required, and an explanation of why a resettlement plan as described 
in paras. 2-21 or an abbreviated plan as described in para. 22 cannot be prepared by 
project appraisal; 
(b) 
principles and objectives governing resettlement preparation and implementation; 
(c) 
a description of the process for preparing and approving resettlement plans; 
(d) 
estimated population displacement and likely categories of displaced persons, to the 
extent feasible; 
(e) 
eligibility criteria for defining various categories of displaced persons; 
(f) 
a legal framework reviewing the fit between borrower laws and regulations and Bank 
policy requirements and measures proposed to bridge any gaps between them; 
(g) 
methods of valuing affected assets; 
(h)  organizational procedures for delivery of entitlements, including, for projects 
involving private sector intermediaries, the responsibilities of the financial 
intermediary, the government, and the private developer; 
(i) 
a description of the implementation process, linking resettlement implementation to 
civil works; 
(j) 
a description of grievance redress mechanisms; 
(k) 
a description of the arrangements for funding resettlement, including the preparation 
and review of cost estimates, the flow of funds, and contingency arrangements; 
(l) 
a description of mechanisms for consultations with, and participation of, displaced 
persons in planning, implementation, and monitoring; and 
(m) arrangements for monitoring by the implementing agency and, if required, by 
independent monitors. 
25. 
When a resettlement policy framework is the only document that needs to be submitted as a 
condition of the loan, the resettlement plan to be submitted as a condition of subproject financing

Operational Policies
 
61
need not include the policy principles, entitlements, and eligibility criteria, organizational 
arrangements, arrangements for monitoring and evaluation, the framework for participation, and 
mechanisms for grievance redress set forth in the resettlement policy framework.  The subproject-
specific resettlement plan needs to include baseline census and socioeconomic survey 
information; specific compensation rates and standards; policy entitlements related to any 
additional impacts identified through the census or survey; description of resettlement sites and 
programs for improvement or restoration of livelihoods and standards of living; implementation 
schedule for resettlement activities; and detailed cost estimate. 
Process Framework
 
26. 
A process framework is prepared when Bank-supported projects may cause restrictions in 
access to natural resources in legally designated parks and protected areas.  The purpose of the 
process framework is to establish a process by which members of potentially affected 
communities participate in design of project components, determination of measures necessary to 
achieve resettlement policy objectives, and implementation and monitoring of relevant project 
activities (see 
OP 4.12
,
paras. 7 and 31).  
27.  Specifically, the process framework describes participatory processes by which the 
following activities will be accomplished 
 
(a) 
Project components will be prepared and implemented.  
The document should briefly 
describe the project and components or activities that may involve new or more 
stringent restrictions on natural resource use.  It should also describe the process by 
which potentially displaced persons participate in project design. 
(b) 
Criteria for eligibility of affected persons will be determined.  
The document should 
establish that potentially affected communities will be involved in identifying any 
adverse impacts, assessing of the significance of impacts, and establishing of the 
criteria for eligibility for any mitigating or compensating measures necessary. 
(c) 
Measures to assist affected persons in their efforts to improve their livelihoods or 
restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels, while maintaining the 
sustainability of the park or protected area will be identified.
 
The document should 
describe methods and procedures by which communities will identify and choose 
potential mitigating or compensating measures to be provided to those adversely 
affected, and procedures by which adversely affected community members will decide 
among the options available to them. 
(d) 
Potential conflicts or grievances within or between affected communities will be 
resolved.  
The document should describe the process for resolving disputes relating to 
resource use restrictions that may arise between or among affected communities, and 
grievances that may arise from members of communities who are dissatisfied with the 
eligibility criteria, community planning measures, or actual implementation.  
Additionally, the process framework should describe arrangements relating to the 
following 
(e) 
Administrative and legal procedures.  
The document should review agreements 
reached regarding the process approach with relevant administrative jurisdictions and

line ministries (including clear delineation for administrative and financial 
responsibilities under the project). 
 
(f)
 
Monitoring arrangements.  
The document should review arrangements for 
participatory monitoring of project activities as they relate to (beneficial and adverse) 
impacts on persons within the project impact area, and for monitoring the 
effectiveness of measures taken to improve (or at minimum restore) incomes and 
living standards.
