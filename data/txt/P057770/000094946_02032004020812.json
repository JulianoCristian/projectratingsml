cultural heritage concerns, into\n            multiple development sectors, at the national, regional, and\n            local levels, and, its Learning and Innovation Loan\n            instrument, will provide for stronger capacity building\n            elements, test the nature of individual components for which\n            viable technical, financial, and social solutions need to be\n            developed, and, experiment with different partnership\n            arrangements, involving nongovernmental organizations,\n            government agencies, communities, and interested artisans.\n            The components will: 1) provide resources for site planning,\n            and analysis to formulate a conservation master plan at the\n            Axum, and Gondar world heritage sites, and, finance the\n            development of a series of pilot activities in architectural\n            conservation, and archaeological consolidation; 2) develop\n            the capacity of regional governments to effectively manage\n            cultural resource assets, by establishing an information\n            base aimed at planning, conservation, and threat mitigation.\n            Workshops, and training initiatives will develop skills to\n            implement inventory work, build professional capacity, and\n            involve local organizations; 3) implement the preservation\n            of ancient craft traditions, and re-establish craft making,\n            as a vital part of community, and national economic life.\n            Design guidance, technical skills, business understanding,\n            and direct market links will be provided to generate local,\n            and export products; and, 4) fund project management, i.e.,\n            the Project Coordination Unit - Expert staff, Accountant,\n            Procurement, and monitoring and evaluation specialists,\n            among others."}, "docdt": "2002-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
