Executive Summary 
 
A
resettlement/rehabilitation audit was requested by the first Bank supervision mission of the 
project, amid the subsequent finding about the relocation of 7-8 households at the Ras 
Mengesha House in Axum, due to project operations related to the third project component. 
That is, Artisanal Crafts Development. This report presents the findings and 
recommendations of the audit.  
 
Audit Findings and Recommendations 
 
1
The audit confirmed that in line with World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12), the 
10 households relocated in Axum, were involuntarily relocated as an adverse impact 
of project activities. The 10 households are therefore eligible for compensation in the 
form of: facilitation/provision of equivalent or improved accommodation; full cost 
coverage for transport of assets to the new location; a relocation allowance and six 
months rental subsidies for increased rental costs.  
 
2
The review of project work plan and consultations with Project Coordinating Unit 
(PCU) and kebele (local government) officials confirmed that, Artisanal Crafts 
Development and the re-establishment of ancient craft making traditions at Ras 
Mengesha House or rather compound will not induce “land” acquisition, per se. In 
Ethiopia, all land belongs to the state. Private persons as well as legal persons have 
usufruct rights, provided by the kebeles. The kebele has the usufruct rights over the 
Ras Mengesha House. The project has been granted access rights to the compound 
and full usufruct rights to the facilities by the kebele. 
 
3
The review of project documents and consultations with the above mentioned project 
stakeholders confirmed that in Axum the four components of the project, will not 
induce land acquisition.
 
4
Ten (10) households (47 persons) of which three female-headed households have 
been relocated from the Ras Mengesha compound as the facilities of the compound 
will be used for preservation and re-establishment of ancient craft making traditions. 
Seven (7) households were relocated by the kebele (municipality) administration in 
September 2002. The three households remain to be relocated. An abbreviated RAP 
should, however, be prepared; submitted to the World Bank (ASPEN) for clearance, 
and disclosed prior to the relocation of the three households. The Resettlement/ 
Rehabilitation Framework of the project provides guidance on how the work should 
be carried out. 
 
5
None of the 10 heads of households or their members lost their sources of livelihood. 
Seven of the families relocated moved less than 200 meters from their old location, 
the Ras Mengesha compound. One moved about two kilometers away in order to 
open a local bar, because the Ras Mengesha compound is in old Axum and such 
commercial activities are not accepted in that part of the town.

All project affected persons (PAPs) were tenants living in single rooms. None of them 
received any compensation, neither in cash nor, in kind. However, the kebele/ 
municipality actively assisted all 7 households to find new houses. All PAPs got 
increased rents, but also better rooms and for most of them (5 out of seven), larger 
rooms. In the interviews, PAPs expressed satisfaction with their new housing and the 
quality their provided.
 
7
All PAPs were informed about the project before relocation. In the audit 
consultations, all PAPs expressed their appreciations of projects activities, seen as 
subjects of regional and national pride. Also, all PAPs expressed their preparedness to 
work for the project in Axum once operations started. 
 
8
Audit conclusion recommends that six months rent (120 birr) and a relocation 
allowance (20 birr) be paid to each household.
i
The relocation allowance includes 5 
birr to cover transport costs.  Also, the audit recommends that PAPs households, 
should be given job priorities during project implementation, should they manifest 
interest. Both project management and the local government officials endorsed the 
recommendations. The local government officials committed themselves to pay the 
compensation no later than September 30, 2003. Finally, the audit recommends that 
the project conduct a field verification mission to confirm compliance with the 
recommendations made and agreement reached.  The project TTL confirmed in 
January 2004, that the compensation was executed.

I.  Introduction 
 
The Ethiopia Cultural Heritage Project aims at testing an operational, and implementation 
mechanism for a fuller integration of cultural heritage assets, into multiple development sectors, at 
the local, regional and national levels.  
 
The project is a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) that will provide for stronger capacity building 
elements in cultural heritage management. Test the nature of individual components for which viable 
technical, financial, and social solutions need to be developed, and, experiment with different 
partnership arrangements, involving non-governmental organizations, government agencies, 
communities, and interested artisans.  
 
Project components are three.  
1) 
Site Planning and Conservation
 
provide resources for site planning, and analysis to 
formulate a conservation master plan at the Axum, and Gondar world heritage sites, and, 
finance the development of a series of pilot activities in architectural conservation, and 
archaeological consolidation;  
 
2) 
Inventory and Documentation Development
 
develop the capacity of regional governments 
to effectively manage cultural resource assets, by establishing an information base aimed at 
planning, conservation, and threat mitigation. Workshops, and training initiatives will 
develop skills to implement inventory work, build professional capacity, and involve local 
organizations;  
 
3) 
Artisanal Craft Development
 
implem
ent the preservation of ancient craft traditions, and 
re-establish craft making, as a vital part of community, and national economic life. Design 
guidance, technical skills, business understanding, and direct market links will be provided to 
generate local, and export products.

II. Rationale and Audit Methodology 
 
Bank’s Board approved the project by April 17, 2002. Project effectiveness was March 2002. 
The environmental category of the project is B. No EIA or social assessments were 
conducted in the project preparation phase. In the first supervision mission of the project, 
June 18 to July 3, 2002, the mission subsequently found that Involuntary Resettlement 
Safeguard would be triggered, as 7-8 households in Axum were to be relocated due to project 
operations. To address the issue, mission recommendations suggested the preparation of a 
resettlement/rehabilitation framework and the execution of a resettlement audit in Axum.  
 
As a sequel of the June –July mission mentioned above, this audit rests on the World Bank 
Operational Policy OP. 4.12, regarding involuntary resettlement. Paragraph three of the 
policy states: 
 
This policy covers  direct  economic  and  social  impacts
iiiii
 
that  both result  from 
Bank-assisted investment projects
iv
,
and are caused by
 
(a) the involuntary
v
taking of land
vi
 resulting in  
(i)  relocation or loss of shelter; 
(ii) lost of assets or access to assets; or  
(iii) loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected 
persons must move to another location; or 
(b)  the involuntary restriction of access
vii
 to legally designated parks and protected 
areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the displaced persons. 
Methodologically, the audit rests on: a) consultations with the TTL; b) consultations with the 
Project Coordination Unit (PCU); c) consultation with the local government officials and d) 
collective consultations and individual conversations with PAPs in their new homes. Each 
PAP “house” was visited and documented with photography.

III.  
Review of Relocation/Rehabilitation Arrangements
 
The Ras Mengesha House
 
The kebele (municipality) has the title of both the Ras Mengesha House and the land on 
which the house is built. The Ras Mengesha House is, however, not a single house, but a 
compound with 15 houses of various qualities and functions. Nine of the houses hosted the 
kebele administration including the kebele court, which, was located in one room with three 
chairs and two benches.  The 10 PAP households inhabited five “houses “or rather” shacks. 
The last house which, was the main building and still not in use for years, was the former Ras 
Seyum resident or the Ras Mengesha House proper. The kebele administration relocated 
itself to another location.  
 
Kebele Housing 
The kebeles are the primary administrative entities in the Ethiopian administration. They own 
houses in most urban centers, be they large or small. The quality of the houses varies, from 
mud walls, earth floors and corrugated iron sheet roofs, to patrician villas, like in Addis 
Ababa. The later were requisitioned by the Dergue regime and have since been government 
property. Kebele houses are low cost, they don’t follow market values, but they are not low-
income houses. In cities like Addis Ababa, a kebele house with a rent of 400 birr/month (1 
$= 8.6 birr) is worth 2000 birr/month rent on the ordinary market. Yet, it is the kebele policy 
to rent houses under market value, which often leads to poor maintenance and the 
depreciation of the value of the house. Lottery is the method of preference for the allocation 
of kebele houses.  
 
“Houses” and Households of the PAPs 
Mud walls, natural stone walls, earth floors and corrugated iron sheet roofs was the housing 
standard of all PAP households. Each PAP household was living in one room, furnished with 
2-3 adult beds. The rooms had electricity. The rent was 20 birr/month. While nine of the 
households lived inside the compound, one was at the gate. The houses were located in Old 
Axum at the old city center, about 10 minutes walk from the two time honored all Ethiopian 
national monuments; the 35 m high stelae and the church harboring the Arch of the 
Covenant.  
 
The 10 PAP households came from one community, about 15 km from Axum. Three of the 
households were female headed. Seven out of 10 came to Axum 21 years ago and lived in the 
same rooms ever since, although the size of their households grew. Two came 11 years after, 
they were soldiers who participated in the civil war and were provided shelter in kebele 
houses as reward. The last one came a year ago. There seemed to be a strong sense of 
community and solidarity among the10 households. The household outside the gate of the 
compound was poor, the PAPs said. To help that family, the 9 other households collected 
money to buy iron sheets for the roof of the poor household. It is one of the three households 
that is still to move.  
 
Page  9

The Relocation of PAPs 
PAPs were given two months notice before relocation. Kebele and the 
Woreda
/district 
administration, together with the ministry of culture provided the information about the 
project and why the PAPs had to move. Thereafter, kebele administrators convened a 
meeting between private homeowners and the PAPs. The administrators informed the private 
landlords that 10 households had to move from the kebele houses and they needed new 
rooms in the neighborhood. The seven households which, were ready to move, found new 
accommodations within two months. Seven of the families relocated moved less than 200 
meters from their old location, the Ras Mengesha compound. Two are about 20-30 meters 
from the Mengesha compound; one of those two is a female-headed household. A second 
female headed household moved about two kilometers away in order to open a bar serving 
traditional beer, as the Ras Mengesha compound is in old Axum and such commercial 
activities are not tolerated in that part of the town. 
 
The assets of the PAPs were moved on horse carts to the cost of about five birr per 
household. Horse cart is the most common form of transport in Axum. The cost for moving 
assets from a fully furnished house with tables, couches and TV etc., in Axum, is about 15 
birr, according to transport providers and kebele officials. The kebele administrators assisted 
the PAPs practically, in helping them to pack and watching after their exposed properties in 
the compound. No compensation was paid to them, neither in cash nor in kind. Five out of 
the seven households relocated have got larger and qualitatively better rooms. Two have got 
about the same size of rooms but with better quality. For all PAPs, the rent has at least been 
doubled, except the woman who has started the bar; her rent has been tripled. But the 
revenues from her business exceed the rental costs. She is better of then before relocation. 
For the female-headed household without the bar, the rent is 50 % higher. All have 
electricity, none has any intention to move to other rooms. The sense of community remains. 
The 10 PAP households still pay visits to each other to drink coffee and tea, share gossips 
and life experience.

IV. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Information about the World Bank compensation/rehabilitation policy and principles was 
conspicuous by its absence, both within the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and within the 
Woreda
 (district) and the kebele (municipality) administrations. The preparation of a 
resettlement/rehabilitation policy framework would help to correct that shortcoming. The 
execution of the resettlement/rehabilitation audit has made the various stakeholders 
mentioned above, aware of World Bank policy. Also, the establishment of the 
resettlement/rehabilitation audit in Axum, will contribute to harmonize compensation/ 
rehabilitation practice with other Bank projects, e.g. the Road Sector Development Program 
(RSDP), already operating in the region.   
 
In line with World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12), the 10 households relocated in Axum, 
were involuntarily relocated as an adverse impact of project activities. The 10 households are 
therefore eligible for compensation the form of: facilitation/provision of equivalent or 
improved accommodation; full cost coverage for transport of assets to the new location; a 
relocation allowance and six months rental subsidies for increased rental costs.  
 
Three PAPs households are still to be relocated. An abbreviated Resettlement Plan should be 
prepared for the three households. The RAP should be submitted to the World Bank 
(ASPEN) for clearance, and disclosed prior to the relocation of the three households. The 
Resettlement/ Rehabilitation Framework of the project provides guidance on how the work 
should be carried out.  
 
In line with World Bank (OP 4.12) the plan cover the following minimum elements: 
 
(a) 
a census survey of displaced persons and valuation of assets; 
(b) 
description of compensation and other resettlement assistance to be provided; 
(c) 
consultations with displaced people about acceptable alternatives; 
(d) 
institutional responsibility for implementation and procedures for grievance redress; 
(e) 
arrangements for monitoring and implementation; and 
(f) 
a timetable and budget. 
 
What follows bellow, are main audit findings and recommendations.

The review of project work plan and consultations with Project Coordinating Unit 
(PCU) and kebele (local government) officials confirmed that, Artisanal Crafts 
Development and the re-establishment of ancient craft making traditions at Ras 
Mengesha House or rather compound will not induce land acquisition. In Ethiopia, all

land belongs to the state. Private persons as well as legal persons have usufruct rights, 
provided by the kebeles. The kebele has the usufruct rights over the Ras Mengesha 
House. The project has been granted access rights to the compound and full usufruct 
rights to the facilities by the kebele.

2.   
According to OP 4.12, Under Impact Covered, paragraph three, footnote 8, “Land” includes anything growing on 
or permanently affixed to land, such as buildings and crops. In the case of Axum, it is neither requisition of land or 
building, but a sort of lease/grant access to the facilities. 
 
3.  
Where there are adverse indirect social or economic impacts, it is good practice for the borrower to undertake a 
social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse economic and social impacts, 
Page  13
12
particularly upon poor and vulnerable groups.  Other environmental, social, and economic impacts that do not 
result from land taking may be identified and addressed through environmental assessments and other project 
reports and instruments. 
 
4. 
This policy does not apply to restrictions of access to natural resources under community-based projects, i.e. 
where the community using the resources decides to restrict access to these resources, provided that an 
assessment satisfactory to the Bank establishes that the community decision-making process is adequate, and 
that it provides for identification of appropriate measures to mitigate adverse impacts, if any, on the vulnerable 
members of the community. This policy also does not cover refugees from natural disasters, war, or civil strife 
(see 
OP
/
BP 8.50
,
Emergency Recovery Assistance
). 
 
5. 
For purposes of this policy, “involuntary” means actions that may be taken without the displaced person’s 
informed consent or power of choice. 
 
6.   
“Land” includes anything growing on or permanently affixed to land, such as buildings and crops.  This policy 
does not apply to regulations of natural resources on a national or regional level to promote their sustainability, 
such as watershed management, groundwater management, fisheries management, etc.  The policy also does not 
apply to disputes between private parties in land titling projects, although it is good practice for the borrower to 
undertake a social assessment and implement measures to minimize and mitigate adverse social impacts, 
especially those affecting poor and vulnerable groups. 
 
6.  
For the purposes of this policy, involuntary restriction of access covers restrictions on the use of resources 
imposed on people living outside the park or protected area, or on those who continue living inside the park or 
protected area during and after project implementation.  In cases where new parks and protected areas are 
created as part of the project, persons who lose shelter, land, or other assets are covered under para. 3(a). Persons 
who lose shelter in existing parks and protected areas are also covered under para. 3(a).
