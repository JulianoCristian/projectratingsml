       were as follows: outcomes were moderately unsatisfactory,\n            the risk to development outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was also moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: in a context of fragile institutions,\n            special attention should be paid to the political economy\n            and 'second best' solutions should be explored.\n            One of the key elements of reform that was emphasized\n            throughout the project was the development of a\n            multi-sectoral regulatory agency. Such an agency never\n            became operational and was possibly rarely considered\n            seriously by the changing Governments. As discussed above,\n            the political instability and the complexity of unbundling\n            the existing vested interests at the level of individual\n            ministries (which were sensitive to the resources generated\n            through the sectoral regulatory agencies) are the key\n            reasons behind this outcome. Early recognition of the\n            strength of these vested interests could potentially have\n            allowed for the exploration of alternative, more politically\n            feasible, routes of reform. The monitoring and evaluation\n            (M&E) framework should receive greater priority even in\n            a weak institutional setting in order to support both a\n            quantitatively sound evaluation and project implementation.\n            The lack of a satisfactory M&E framework makes it\n            difficult to adequately assess the impact of the project,\n            and therefore limits the ability to make corrections or draw\n            lessons for future projects. The lack of adequate M&E\n            doubtless limited the ability to measure the degree to which\n            specific components achieved the desired goals or should\n            have been modified in order to accomplish those goals."}, "docdt": "2010-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
