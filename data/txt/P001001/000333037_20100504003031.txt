F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project#s development objective is to support increased investment, competitiveness
and participation of the private sector in economic activity. This objective will be
achieved by implementing the Government's divestiture program, reforming the
infrastructure and commercial banking sectors, outsourcing certain Government services,
stimulating private investment, undertaking legal reform, improving the fiscal and
regulatory aspects of the business environment and strengthening supply chains. The
project would thus contribute to Government#s poverty alleviation strategy and
sustained, high GDP growth.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1    Context at Appraisal

Country context. Guinea-Bissau was of the poorest countries in the world coming out of
an extremely destructive conflict. Guinea-Bissau is and has been one of the poorest countries
in the world, with inadequate infrastructure and low social indicators, the result of state-
controlled development strategies pursued until the mid-1980s, endemic institutional fragility,
and political instability. The authorities embarked on a reform program from 1987 . In 1997,
the country joined the West African Economic and Monetary Union (Union Economique et
Monetaire Ouest Africaine, UEMOA). Progress was interrupted by an armed conflict that broke
out in June 1998 and lasted 11 months. War-related losses were estimated at approximately 50
percent of 1997 GDP. Following a transitional government in 2000, a democratically-elected
government took office in 2001, although continuing insecurity and political challenges
generated persistent risks to government efforts to resume the reform agenda.

Rationale for Bank assistance. The project was in line with the Bank's strategy for
Guinea-Bissau: to support the Government's reform program which centered around
three pillars, one of them being to promote rapid broad-based growth led by the private
sector. In the pre-conflict context, the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Guinea-Bissau,
approved by the Board in June 1997, sought to support the Government's reform program and
focused on sustainable economic and social development. Consistent with this rationale, the
project initially focused on three components: (a) privatization, (b) agribusiness development,
and (c) improving the regulatory environment. Following the armed conflict, cognizant of the
magnitude of the developmental challenges, the Government's Interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) targeted rapid broad-based private sector-led GDP growth of at least 5
percent with widely distributed benefits to reduce poverty. Consistently with the Government
priorities, a transitional strategy was prepared and is summarized in the President's Report of
the Economic Rehabilitation and Recovery Credit (ERRC, Cr. 3349-GUB), approved by the
Board on May 16, 2000. It addressed the country's post-conflict needs by financing urgent
social sector and infrastructure needs. This entailed (i) redirecting IDA-financed credits to
support education and health programs; (ii) providing quick-disbursing assistance through the
ERRC to contribute to macroeconomic stability, reducing domestic debt and promoting
inclusive policies; and (iii) improving the business environment and expanding private sector
participation in service delivery. In the aftermath of the conflict, the country was starved for
resources and in dire need of reigniting growth, which explains the strategic rationale for why
typical alternatives adopted in other post-conflict contexts, such as community development
driven projects, were not pursued. To respond to the challenges of the post-conflict scenario,
the project evolved from the original design prepared during 1997-1998 into a more ambitious
structure as discussed in Section 2.1.

1.2    Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The project's development objective is to support increased investment, competitiveness, and
private sector participation in economic activity. This objective will be achieved by
implementing the Government's divestiture program, reforming the infrastructure and
commercial banking sectors, outsourcing certain Government services, stimulating private
                                             1
investment, undertaking legal reform, improving the fiscal and regulatory aspects of the
business environment, and strengthening supply chains. The project would thus contribute to
the Government's poverty alleviation strategy and sustained, high GDP growth.

PDO (Project Development Objectives) indicators in the PAD (Project Appraisal Document)
differ from the PDO indicators in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). Instead, the
DCA indicators fundamentally coincide with the PAD output indicators. The PAD PDO
indicators were high objectives that were hard to measure, for this reason we focus on the
indicators as in the Schedule 6 of the DCA. 1

 There are discrepancies between the PDO KPI in the DCA and the ones used in the ISRs. This ICR will focus on
the PDO KPI as listed in the DCA. The following KPI present in the PAD and DCA were not included in the ISR:
     i. In the civil aviation component: Number of passengers doubled
    ii. In the divestiture sub-component: Environmental audits carried out for all identified PEs before
       completion of each transaction
   iii. In the legal reform sub-component: At least 70 percent of judges, lawyers and other legal staff have been
       trained.
   iv. In the business environment sub-component (present in the PAD but not the DCA): Tax, customs and
       other inter-regulatory agencies interface with the private sector more effectively. Four private associations
       established.

laws and regulations.
b. Legal institutional capacity strengthened. At least 70 percent of judges, lawyers and other legal
staff have been trained. Improvements in the performance of the tribunal in Bissau (50 percent
reduction in time for issuing judgment)
Investment Climate

(increase in domestic value-added of 50 percent) by 2007.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

The project development objective was not changed but the project was amended3 twice.
The first modification, in August 2003, was part of a country-wide portfolio restructuring and
did not imply any change in the PDO nor in the indicators.4 At the time of the second
amendment, in August 2006, the electricity component was expanded and modified to cover
additional activities in the energy sector.5 Accordingly, the PDO indicator for this component
("Bidding documents for the water and energy sectors prepared by 2003") was replaced with
"Increase the collection of electricity bills from 40 percent to 80 percent". Additionally, this
second amendment led to dropping the port component and, with it, its PDO indicator "Port
master plan for the port prepared and adopted by 2005". (For details, see Section 1.7)

1.4     Main Beneficiaries,

The project beneficiaries included a large set of stakeholders. The PAD noted that the
project was designed to benefit the population at large through better services from more
efficient public utilities, including telecommunications and transport services. An effective

  In the PDO KPI of the DCA there is no reference to jobs creation while in the Output KPI of the PAD the target
includes 400 jobs created.

  Only the first amendment is considered a formal restructuring because, following the ICR Guidelines (Appendix
B), the project is not considered formally revised unless the amendments are submitted to the Board for approval
("through approval of the Bank authority that approved the original loan").

  Refer to Section 1.6 for more details on the content of the change.

  Originally, it was envisaged that the PIU would have provided limited technical advisory services and goods
while a proposed Energy and Water Project was prepared. However, as the preparation of the new Energy and
Water Project took longer than expected, and this was approved only in 2006, the Borrower requested the addition
of more activities to this component. This consequently led to a change of the relevant KPI.
                                                       3
judiciary would contribute to social welfare by guaranteeing the basic property rights of
citizens and businesses. The project would have also benefited entrepreneurs, most of whom
are small, by reducing uncertainties and transaction costs of doing business by, among others:
(a) providing transparent commercial legislation and effective property rights, and improving
the functioning of the judiciary; and (b) reducing production costs through improved efficiency
and availability of utility and infrastructure services. The project's emphasis on rural
entrepreneurship and agribusiness would benefit rural communities. Lastly, the project aimed
to help Government by enhancing public revenue collection.

1.5    Original Components (as approved)

The original project components as described in the PAD (Part C1)

Project Component 1: Building Partnerships and Private Participation (US$16.3 million).
This component aimed to help the Government address a key bottleneck to private sector
participation in economic activity, namely poor utility and infrastructure services. The project
was to support and/or prepare the reform of the telecommunications, air transport, port, water,
and energy sectors, by attracting private investments, implementing necessary legal and
regulatory reforms, and funding related capacity building, especially in a multi-sector
regulatory agency. In addition, the project aimed to support the withdrawal of the overextended
public sector from areas best handled by the private sector, via support for divestiture from
public enterprises, liquidation of a bankrupt commercial bank and outsourcing of custodial
public services. In this context, the project would finance the costs of retrenching redundant
workers. This project component also aimed to kick-start private sector activities by providing
an EFF (Equity Financing Facility) that matched resources mobilized by private entrepreneurs
for viable productive investments. Access to the EFF would be limited to existing private firms
whose assets were damaged during the conflict and to divested private enterprises.

Project Component 2: Improving the Investment Climate (US$5.6 million). The first aim of
this component was to support legal reforms by modernizing business laws and improving
access to justice for individuals and private enterprises. Activities included improving
institutional capacity in the main tribunal of Bissau, which handles most of the business cases;
harmonization of national laws with OHADA; and training and technical assistance to
strengthen the judicial system and the legal profession. The other thrust of this component was
to improve the business environment, first by supporting the progressive alleviation of
administrative barriers and the rationalization of tax-induced investment incentives, as well as
the elimination of associated distortions. These initiatives were also to be supported by FIAS.
Second, the component aimed to support the assessment of policy and institutional constraints
to develop six key subsectors regarded as promising entry points for private investment.
Institutional support to four emerging private organizations (e.g. Chamber of commerce,
association of small entrepreneurs, etc.), as well as public agencies, would have also been
provided through this component.

Project Component 3: Supporting Implementation and Capacity Building (US$3.7
million). In view of the country's weak institutional capacity, project implementation capacity
was deemed crucial. Stakeholders recognized this problem early on and assembled a strong
team even before effectiveness with funding from a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). This
component also supported monitoring and evaluation.

1.6    Revised Components

In 2003, the Credit documents were amended to allow for financing of the management of
a trust-funded program for reintegration of demobilized combatants, and also changed
the financing percentage under the Credit. The amendment to the PSRDP was part of an
overall portfolio restructuring for Guinea-Bissau approved by the Board in August 2003
(IDA/R2003-172) which aimed to respond to a Government request addressing urgent needs.
In order to free resources for the demobilization and reintegration program, then left with only
US$2.9 million available from the multi-donor trust fund, the new activity absorbed the cost of
the contract with the International Organization for Migration managing the program for
approximately US$1.8 million. As a result, the outsourcing sub-component was dropped from
the PSRDP. In addition, the 2003 amendment changed the financing percentage under the
Credit from 85 to 100 percent of expenditures to alleviate counterpart funding problems

1.7    Other significant changes

Following the Mid-Term Review, a second amendment approved by the Country Director
(letter of June 22, 2006 to the Minister of Finance) expanded support for the electricity
authority under the infrastructure reform sub-component of the project. The Mid-Term
Review, in April 2005, led to various revisions. First, due to a lack of IDA resources and delay
in the preparation of a new energy project, various activities and investments were included in
the energy sub-component. Paragraph A1 (c) of Schedule 2 of the agreement dealing with the
Water and Electricity Sectors was replaced in its entirety. The activities included in the revised
sub-component were: (i) technical assistance to the Electricity Authority to design an efficient
tariff structure; (ii) engineering studies and preparation of bidding documents for the
contracting of a power generation system, the rehabilitation of the distribution network, and the
establishment of a pre-payment metering and billing system; (iii) acquisition of goods to
address urgent generation needs; (vi) rehabilitation and improvement of the commercial
management of the Electricity Authority through the establishment of an independent private
sector commercial management operation for a period of three to five years. Second, the
paragraph dealing with the port was not changed in the DCA, but the cover memorandum for
the amendment noted that additional activities for the port would not be financed because of
difficulties arising from the dispute between the Government and the former concessionaire
(Tertir). This is discussed in greater detail in Section 3.2 and Annex 2. Third, the rules of the
EFF were amended in response to the situation on the ground (see Section 1.7 for details).

The cost-sharing arrangement under the equity finance facility was amended to allow half
of the 50 percent contribution by beneficiaries to be in assets (with cash was still required
for the other half). During the Mid-Term Review the supervision team noted that despite a large
interest in the equity finance facility, indicated by 49 projects applying for funds-- 8 of which
were considered eligible-- in only 11 months, no funds could be disbursed because of the
restrictive rules governing the counterpart funds. The cost-sharing arrangement under the
equity finance facility was amended to allow half of the 50 percent contribution from by the
beneficiaries to be in assets.

The closing date was extended twice. First, from March 31, 2008 to March 31, 2009 and then
to September 30, 2009.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project preparation and implementation must be seen through the lens of a fragile and
highly volatile political context. The fragility of the post-conflict situation influenced the
design of the project and later amendments and modifications. The following table sets the
project timeline in the context of the highly volatile environment.

Project design evolved through a long preparation period that was interrupted by the
armed conflict. Project preparation started in 1997 but was interrupted by the conflict in 1998-
1999. When preparations were resumed,6 the design was reviewed in the post-conflict context
and while the overall thrust remained unchanged, i.e. introducing essential reforms to boost
private investment in Guinea-Bissau, the project became more ambitious and multi-sectoral to
address new needs. In particular, much stronger emphasis was put on infrastructure and the
regulatory environment, together with an innovative matching grant scheme.

The project was technically well prepared and appraised by a team with the required
technical skills. The project benefitted from extensive analytical work carried out before the
conflict, and built upon the groundwork of a previous USAID project (TIPS ­ Trade and
Investment Promotion Support) that had prepared a large set of studies. In addition, preparatory
work included studies on legal reform, the telecommunications sector, and the establishment of
a project implementation unit. When preparation resumed after the conflict, additional studies
were carried out and missions undertaken with a strong team that included specialists in
privatization, infrastructure, telecommunications, resettlement issues, and supply chain
analysis.

The implementation arrangements were appropriate and instrumental in achieving the
successes the project was able to attain. The project implementation arrangements, which
relied on a capable project implementation unit, were appropriate7 given the shortage of skilled
staff in the implementing agencies and the need to coordinate among agencies.8

In hindsight, the project's scope could have been less ambitious, but there are various
reasons that justify the approach that was adopted. The project included infrastructure
reform, divestiture, and support for the private sector through an equity fund, legal reform, and
business environment reform. The breadth of the project was justified directly in the PAD,
which noted the need to ensure a critical mass of reforms, and the absence of alternative
sources of financing. In addition, this design was a proactive response in a post-conflict
context where the project was the first, and largest, Bank intervention. 9 During project design it

6
  The decision not to do a new concept note review when the preparation was resumed was made by the team and
supported by the Country Director on the basis of the careful preparation documented by extensive aide memoire
and additional studies (i.e. two FIAS studies, on the regulatory environment and the simplification of the tax
regime, and one study of the financial sector).
7
  In addition to the purposeful effort of the team designing the project, two contextual factors helped in setting up
such high level PIU: (a) a transparent and effective recruitment process, (b) the reduced pool of attractive
alternative jobs for high-level technical staff.
8
  More details on the importance of the PIU are given in Sections 2.2 and 5.2(b).
9
  This was explicitly discussed in Section D.1. of the PAD.
                                                         7
was moreover assumed that in a fragile context it a multi-pronged approach was preferable,
with an evaluation of progress at the Mid-Term Review, where sub-components that were not
working could be dropped and more successful ones expanded.10 Moreover, projects in small
countries tend to include a range of components as there are few operations for the country. As
will be discussed in Section 2.2, the restructuring at the Mid-Term review in the end did not
reduce the complexity of the project. In retrospect, while the importance of a pragmatic
approach in the context of a fragile state is important, as discussed in Section 6, this ICR
believes that a slightly less ambitious approach could still have helped to bring in desperately
needed private investment while allowing the Government to concentrate its political capital in
the highest priority activities. .

The indicators were incomplete and not always appropriate. Indicators, some of them
inputs and outputs, were not always appropriate for measuring progress in the implementation
of various sub-components. In addition, the baseline data were not collected for various sub-
components (i.e. retrenched workers, companies financed by EFF). The PDO indicators listed
in the Financing Agreement were listed as output indicators in the PAD, while the PAD's
outcome indicators were generally unwieldy.

The Government and a key set of stakeholders who supported the project preparation
were committed to the reform agenda promoted by the project, but the volatility of the
political environment reduced buy-in with respect to expectations at appraisal. These
parties were actively involved in defining the project content during both preparation and
implementation, which helps to explain why some important objectives were met despite the
political instability during the implementation period. However, the political instability,
combined with high turnover of senior policy makers, eroded this commitment and slowed
progress. In retrospect, some of the reforms envisaged, particularly the multi-sectoral
regulatory authority, had less buy-in in the end than assumed at appraisal.

The PAD spelled out most of the risks, including the high risk of political instability and
governance issues. The appraisal document correctly noted that political and security issues
were beyond the scope of the project, and the appraisal team did not attempt to provide
mitigation measures. The risk of weak implementation capacity in the country was addressed
in the project design by establishing a strong project implementation unit, which proved
effective throughout the political changes of the implementation period. Technically competent
staff helped to ensure government engagement and maintain a fair degree of commitment to
reforms despite the numerous changes. The appraisal document also notes that the team sought
to mitigate the risk of complexity by involving stakeholders during preparation and by
outsourcing technical work to professionals.

One key risk was left out, which affected the achievement of the PDO. It was assumed that
the domestic debt problem would have been solved and the private sector repaid, but this did
not happen and the private sector remained seriously under-capitalized. This reduced private
sector support for regulatory and doing business reforms and affected the adoption of the equity

     This evaluation largely coincides with the two Quality of Supervision Assessments detailed in Section 2.2.
                                                           8
financing facility as entrepreneurs were unable to raise their fifty percent "matching"
contribution. 11

Lessons were drawn from other projects and incorporated into project design. The project
took into account lessons on the importance of strong implementation capacity in a post-
conflict context, financing the social costs of reforms, and making investment capital available
for reconstruction in post-conflict countries. The lesson that the regulatory agency should be
independent from political influence and financially sustainable was built into the project
design, and emerged from similar experience in other countries in the region (e.g. Cape-Verde),
although the potential for economies of scale and optimizing limited capacities via a multi-
sectoral regulatory agency was not realized (see section on implementation).

A Quality at Entry assessment was not prepared by the Quality Assurance Group, but
two Quality of Supervision assessments were carried out, both of which assessed as
satisfactory the quality at entry. These were carried out in FY06 and FY07 (see Section 5.1).

2.2     Implementation

 The overriding factor affecting project implementation was the political instability that
prevailed in Guinea Bissau during that entire period. As shown in Table 1 above, political
instability was the single most important factor affecting the project. After the project became
effective in the second half of 2002, a coup in 2003 and the legislative elections in 2004 were
followed by widespread unrest until a new president was elected in 2005 and progress was
resumed in the reform agenda. In 2008, there was an armed attack on the presidency, which led
to another period of unrest which culminated in the assassination of the President and the Army
Chief of Staff in 2009, and to new Presidential elections. On average, there was one
Government per year during seven years of the implementation period.

The political instability and governance issues were not unexpected but are not subject to
easy mitigation. The project put emphasis on building a strong and high level PIU to try to
minimize the risks posed by the project's technical complexity and the need to maintain a high
level policy dialogue with the Government. However, the political nature of some of the
obstacles went beyond the competencies of a very capable PIU, and progress could be achieved
only during those windows of opportunity when the Government was more open to dialogue
and reforms.

The staff continuity on the Bank side and in the PIU explain a large part of the project's
achievements, facilitating the dialogue with successive Governments. On the Bank side, one
TTL prepared the project and brought it to the board. Shortly after approval, one of the team
members, who had been involved since appraisal, became the task manager and remained in
charge for the entire implementation period excluding the last nine months. Similarly, once the
project became effective the PIU coordinator remained in charge for the entire period excluding
the last few months (January 2009-September 2009). This stability helped to maintain some
continuity in the policy dialogue despite the frequent changes in the Government.


11
  A fundamentally cash-strapped private sector was unable to provide strong support or to voice the need to
improve the regulatory environment.
                                                    9
The high quality of the PIU was also critical. In order to mitigate the risks posed by the
complexity of this project, the task team purposefully set up a competitively selected, high
quality PIU. In the context of endemic instability, the project implementation unit remained an
apolitical technical body upon which the Government could rely (e.g. the PIU became the unit
in charge of the privatization process which was successfully accomplished ahead of schedule).

The Bank team proactively engaged with successive Governments to address technical
problems as they arose. The Bank team adopted a proactive and pragmatic approach by
responding to needs as they arose. The project was restructured in 2003 and revised in 2006.
The first restructuring freed resources to finance the management of the reintegration program
for demobilized soldiers, a key priority to reduce instability in a post-conflict context.
Similarly, following the mid-term review in 2006, further adjustments were made to the credit,
including expansion of the support for electricity reform and increased allocations for
severance payments to facilitate divestiture. Reforms in electricity are still ongoing, although
the timely intervention of the project probably averted greater problems. Timely financing of
severance payments facilitated divestiture and contributed to meeting the basic needs of former
workers of state enterprises, who had not been paid for several months. The amendments also
facilitated project implementation by eliminating counterpart funding requirements, which
could not be met given the fiscal crisis, resulting in problems with suppliers. Similarly, reduced
matching funds requirements for the private sector facilitated the use of the equity fund at a
time when the private sector was deeply undercapitalized.12 These responses highlight a
pragmatic approach by the Bank in a fragile context where this project was often "the only
game in town" and had to deal with unforeseen, urgent needs for Bank support.

During implementation, the absence of other projects and the limited involvement of
other donors led this project to shoulder even more responsibility and therefore
complexity. Because of the political instability during this period, Guinea-Bissau received
limited support from other donors. The performance-based IDA allocation system and the fact
that, because of the nature of its conflict, Guinea-Bissau did not fall into IDA's formal
definition of a post-conflict state made this project the main vehicle to address a large set of
problems that were not foreseen at appraisal. Being the "only game in town" also made it
harder for the PRDSP to exploit complementarities with other donors' support.

At the same time, during implementation some opportunities to narrow the complexity of
the project were missed. The weak institutional context and the overall political fragility
should have inspired more pressure to attempt to simplify the project. In particular, the mid-
term review was a missed opportunity to substantially restructure project activities and
indicators, e.g. in relation to the port..

Structural factors outside the reach of the project adversely affected the achievements of
the project objectives. The conflict of 1998/1999 left the economy starved of capital. Private
companies lost a large part of their assets and were unable to undertake the required investment
given the extremely weak financial system. This was compounded by the fact that the

12
  In the post-conflict context where companies had experienced deep capital losses, the pending debts owed by the
Government to the companies were largely unpaid, and the underdeveloped system unable to provide the required
financial support to private companies, so entrepreneurs were unable to match the EFF contribution with 50
percent in cash. Addressing this constraint unlocked access to the EFF for eligible companies
                                                       10
Government's payment of its domestic debt to the private sector was not solved during this
period. Additionally, rates of return on private investments were affected by the poor state of
infrastructure and the high operating costs due to structural constraints. The principal
constraints were the high cost and scarcity of electricity, as a result of the power company's
problems, and the high cost and inefficiency of the port, where reforms and investments were
delayed because of protracted discussions about the concession contract.

The Quality of Supervision was rated in two occasions, and in both cases it was rated
satisfactory; however both QAG reports emphasized the need to improve the KPIs. The
first Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA6), done in 2004, rated the quality of supervision
overall satisfactory. The review also "found the supervision of Fiduciary/Safeguards Aspects
and the Adequacy of Supervision Inputs and processes to be Satisfactory, but gave Moderately
Satisfactory rating to the Focus on Development Effectiveness and to the Realism of
Performance Ratings". The review noted that "to further enhance the effectiveness of the
supervision effort, the review recommends to pay more attention to the monitoring of project
outputs and outcomes". A second Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7), done in 2006,
rated the quality of supervision overall satisfactory; however, the review noted that "The
supervision missions have had opportunities, for example at MTR, to convert from input/output
to impact/outcome indicators, but mainly because of data constraints in the country, have
retained the indicators". As a consequence, the review recommended that the team "attempt to
convert some of the KPI to impact/outcome measures, if possible, in preparation for the ICR".

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The complexity of the project is reflected in the large number of indicators. The PAD and
DCA, with some minor formal differences, contain 24 indicators clearly linked to each one of
the sub-components.

Many KPIs are input and output type indicators. As raised by the FY06 and FY07 QAG
reports, the results framework of the PAD and the corresponding Schedule IV of the DCA are
mostly input and output-based. Most KPIs were not revised during the mid-term review, apart
from two indicators associated with the restructuring.13

The PIU reports were detailed but focus mostly on inputs. The limited attention given to
collecting data is reflected in the PIU reports which are very extensive and detailed but mostly
narratives of actions and inputs with very limited information on outcomes and impacts.

The limitations of the KPI coupled with the lack of a baseline data weaken the possibility
of rigorous evaluation during the ICR. Baseline data (e.g. data on judges, length of
commercial disputes, value added in key sectors, etc.) were not collected during the first phase
of the implementation.. Additionally, during the implementation, data and monitoring were not
emphasized and only in 2006 did some gathering of monitoring information begin.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



13
  The supervision team decided not to revise most of the KPIs because it considered it unrealistic to expect
"outcome/impact". The best case scenario would have been impact during second generation reforms.
                                                    11
Safeguard policies were related to the environmental assessment of the EFF beneficiary
companies and retrenchment of workers: both were successfully tackled during the
project implementation. All of the required environmental audits were carried out for the
companies benefiting from the EFF. The workers' retrenchment was carried out in a transparent
manner, and no complaints were recorded among workers regarding retrenchment payments.

Financial management is rated satisfactory. Project accounts were kept in line with Bank
requirements and audits were conducted on time. Problems encountered during the January
2006 supervisory mission related to the format of the financial reports, the accuracy of budgets
and the accounting system were addressed quickly, and the reporting budgeting and accounting
systems have been rated acceptable since that time. The project accounts were audited annually
and audits were received on time. Audits were unqualified except for the first one.
Supervision reports record that the recommendations of auditors were taken into account by the
PIU. Financial management was always rated satisfactory.

Procurement is rated satisfactory. Supervision reports noted that the procurement process
tended to be slow and the mid-term review recommended that the PIU be more proactive in
accelerating the procurement process. At the same time, the reports noted that procurement
documents were well organized. Since the mid-term review, supervisory reports have not
reported on procurement (the January 2006 supervision records again the findings of the mid-
term review). Procurement was rated satisfactory throughout the life of the project, except for
the ISR of December 2006 (#10). The procurement rating was raised back to satisfactory in the
following ISR.

Disbursements lagged with respect to estimates, which is not surprising given country
conditions. Disbursement delays were in part due to the slow procurement process. There was
only one procurement specialist in spite of the complexity of the project. Supervision reports do
not note any particular issue with respect to disbursements.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Support to private sector development is presently being continued via budget support
rather than investment lending. Given the limited resources in the current IDA allocation
and interim nature of its strategy for Guinea-Bissau, no decision has been made yet on a
follow-up investment operation in support of the private sector. At the same time, a series of
two DPOs, the first approved in June 2009 and the second currently under preparation,
prioritizes private sector development as one of its two pillars. In particular, the DPOs aim to
continue improving the investment climate (i.e. simplification of business registration
regulations) and support enactment of various legal packages designed under this project (e.g.
investment code, telecoms law). The Government is committed to approving various items of
legislation over the next few months, taking advantage of the relative political stability
following last year's Presidential elections.14 With respect to investment climate reforms,
following a recent request, the Bank is providing support to the Ministry of Economy to make
the "one stop shop" operational and to simplify the requirements to register new companies.


14
  Shortly after the ICR mission, in December 2009, the President enacted a new investment code developed under
the PSRDP, while the telecoms law was approved in March 2010.

A new study financed under the PPIAF has recently been launched to evaluate options to
revitalize the Port of Bissau to support the Government's efforts. The study assumes that there
will not be further constraints to the recruitment of an operator and the dispute with Tertir is
solved. Additionally, a multi-sectoral infrastructure rehabilitation project (a follow-up of the
"water and energy component") was approved in June 2006 with the objective of increasing the
availability of urban power, water and roads infrastructure services, and additional financing is
currently being prepared for this project.


3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The overall relevance of objectives, design and implementation is high.

The relevance of the objectives is high. Project objectives at appraisal were aligned with
Bank strategy and highly relevant, in that they sought to lay essential foundations to be able to
attract desperately needed private investment to Guinea-Bissau. The objectives remain relevant
to Bank strategy as spelled out in the recent ISN (Interim Strategy Note, May 12 2009), which
prioritizes promoting private investment, strengthening the business climate, reducing red tape
and strengthening contract enforcement. Similarly, objectives related to addressing key
infrastructure needs such as telecommunications, port, aviation, energy, and water are well
aligned with current priorities and Bank strategy. Finally, the project objectives are clearly
consistent with two of the four pillars of the Guinea-Bissau PRSP of September 2006: (a)
fostering growth and job creation, (b) increasing access to social services and basic
infrastructure.

The relevance of design is rated satisfactory. The project design reflects a substantial amount
of preparatory work. The design incorporates some innovative components such as the EFF,
which aimed to provide solutions to the private sector tailored to the country's context.
Nevertheless, it is important to flag a design shortcoming with respect to the M&E framework.
The reason why the project design is rated satisfactory, even though the KPIs needed
improvement, is because it is understood that the emphasis was on getting the components right
and articulating the appropriate implementation system, while the possible revision of the KPIs
was left for the implementation phase when the project would hit the ground.

The relevance of implementation is rated satisfactory. The Bank's implementation
assistance was flexible, adaptive and responsive to the needs of the country, as shown by the
many revisions made to the project content and modalities.

For several years this project represented the main channel of policy dialogue to promote
reforms in Guinea-Bissau. The assessment of the relevance of this project should also
consider that, given the limited IDA resources and the absence of a DPO, this project served as
the main channel of policy dialogue with the Government of Guinea-Bissau and set the basis
for future operations of the Bank in Bissau.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

                                               13
Given the breadth and complexity of the project, this section will describe the achievements in
the various sub-components in some detail, and provide provide additional background
analysis and information in the appendix.

Given the significant shortcomings in the achievement of objectives, the overall outcome
is rated moderately unsatisfactory.15 Despite a number of valuable outcomes arising from the
project, including some major accomplishments, the majority of the intended objectives, as
measured by the KPI, were not accomplished. The major accomplishments of the project lay in
telecom liberalization and the privatization process. Additionally, the project generated a
number of valuable outcomes in terms of legal reforms and institutional strengthening.
However, largely because of political instability and institutional fragility, most of the legal and
regulatory reforms could not be finalized and are still pending approval by the Parliament and
the President. Progress is clearly under way on this, but too late to be factored into this review.

Component 1: Building Partnerships and Private Participation

This component was the largest one, as it absorbed approximately 60 percent of the
overall resources. Despite some remarkable achievements, particularly in telecom and
privatization, overall this component was hampered by significant shortcomings. These
shortcomings particularly affected the civil aviation, port, water and energy, regulatory
institution, and EFF sub-components. For this reason the component is rated moderately
unsatisfactory.

This component was expected to support the achievement of the project's objective by
implementing the Government's divestiture program, reforming the infrastructure and
commercial banking sectors, outsourcing certain Government services, and stimulating private
investment. However, the outsourcing sub-component was dropped a few months after the
project became effective, in response to changing needs and the Government's request (see
Section 1.6).

A. Infrastructure

A1. Telecommunications: The results of telecommunications reform are satisfactory.
Starting from an extremely low base, with only one telecom company (landline) and 3,000
fixed line users in 2002, the goal was to have two additional concessions, 16,000 fixed line
users, and 20,000 cellular phone users. The liberalization of the sector led to the entry of three
new mobile phone companies, two of them international investors (Orange, MTN) and one a
15
  Based on the ICR Guidelines for formally revised projects, the evaluation of the PDO should be broken down
into phases distinguishing between pre- and post- revision. For the purpose of the ICR, as discussed in section 1.6,
only the 2003 amendment is considered a formal revision because only this amendment was approved by the
Board. This revision occurred just a few months after the project was declared effective, and for this reason no
concrete objective was achieved during such a short period (the project was declared effective in October 2002,
formally launched in Bissau in February 2003, and formally restructured in August 2003). For this reason we do
not discuss the achievement of the objectives by splitting the time period into pre- and post-restructuring.
Additionally, this restructuring did not change the PDO or any of the KPI. The 2006 amendment, approved not by
the Board but by the Africa Region Vice-President, only affected the two KPIs, not the PDO. All of the remaining
KPIs and the overall project evaluation remained unchanged. Only the two sub-components affected (i.e. energy
and water, port) are evaluated with respect to both the new and the old KPIs, as KPIs were unchanged for the other
sub-components (see Appendix 2 for further details).
                                                        14
consortium of Guinea Bissau SOE (Guiné Telecom) and its Portuguese ally (PT). The revenues
from the initial licensing fees amount to 9 million euros16, and estimates of the three
companies' revenues during 2005-2009 are approximately US$122 million. The liberalization
ended Guiné Telecom's exclusive control over the international gateway, with a substantial
price reduction for international calls. At the time of the ICR, the number of cellular phone
users is estimated at close to 400,000, and land-line users at 4,000, for an overall total that
vastly exceeded appraisal expectations of the number of beneficiaries. Although the
"explosion" in the number of the users is a worldwide phenomenon helped along by exogenous
technological changes, the liberalization and the entry of the three new companies in the sector
are direct results of the project engagement. Moreover, a comparison of the growth rate of the
number of users and the prices charged for cellular phone calls shows that Guinea-Bissau
started from a low base in 2002 and improved much faster than the average in SSA and, based
on available data, is now in line with SSA average.17 In the context of a fragile state such as
Guinea-Bissau, the telecom sector provides an example of a successful liberalization that has
attracted investments,18 with enormous benefits in terms of expanded access and reduced costs
for consumers.19 At the same time, it should be noted that the regulatory framework is not fully
in place. While a robust legal package was prepared by the project, approved by the Council of
Ministers in April 2008, they have only been approved by Parliament very recently and now
need to be implemented.. Additionally, the regulatory authority remains weak and highly
politicized with its President changing, on average, once per year. This situation creates some
risks for the sector, and the lack of an adequate regulatory framework adversely affects
consumers. Despite these problems with the regulatory framework, improvements in access and
reductions in prices have been so large as to justify the satisfactory rating.

A2. Civil aviation: Substantial progress has been achieved with the improvement of
airports and the establishment and strengthening of the civil aviation authority, although
shortcomings remain; the outcome of this sub-component is moderately satisfactory. The
project had four targets in this area: (i) With regard to revision of the civil aviation code, the
very weak regulatory situation Was addressed by creating the civil aviation authority in
January 2007 and furnishing it with adequate infrastructure, office equipment and capacity
building. (ii) With regard to the creation of a fully operational civil aviation authority able to
fulfill adequate safety standards, the airport began the project with extremely poor safety
conditions, dilapidated infrastructure and did not meet minimal standards such as fencing and
runway lighting. Airport safety improved with the construction of the perimeter wall and the
repair of fire trucks and related equipment, however, a recent ICAO report (April 2009) still
highlighted safety issues that led the European Commission to request the Civil Aviation
Authority to provide an action plan to improve safety regulations and standards in order to
avoid being blacklisted. The Civil Aviation Authority responded proactively by developing a
plan and is awaiting financing to implement it. (iii) With regard to improving the Bissau airport

16
   MTN and Guinetel each paid 2.2 million euros in 2004, Sonatel paid 4.6 million euros in 2007.
17
   In the appendix, see the comparison of prices and users in Guinea-Bissau with the rest of SSA.
18
   Complete data on investments were not available. However, data obtained from interviews give an idea of the
importance of the investments in the sector. MTN, the market leader, estimates its investment in 2009 at US$20
million and anticipates investing an additional US$10 million in 2010. Similarly, in order to recover lost ground
after four years of no investments, Guinetel (the cellular company jointly owned by Portuguese PT and the
Government of Guinea-Bissau) is expecting to invest approximately 3.3 million euros in 2010.
19
   Prices for international calls have decreased by more than 85 percent in nominal terms, from around CFAF 1200
per minute in 2004 to around CFAF 150 per minute in 2009, which implies an even larger decrease in real terms.
                                                       15
facilities, project investments clearly improved the infrastructure and conditions of the
airport--for example, with investments in lighting and generators, night landings became
possible. (iv) With regard to increasing the number of flights and doubling number of
passengers, this target is arguably a highly imperfect measures of the project outcome. The
number of flights decreased from 462 in 2002 to 36420 in 2009 and the number of passengers
fell accordingly, for reasons that cannot be attributed to the project. In particular, Air Senegal's
financial problems led it to suspend its flights, while political instability reduced the demand
for flights and influenced TAP's decision to reduce the number and capacity of flights to
Bissau. ,

A3. Port: This sub-component was dropped, together with its KPI, after the Mid-Term
Review. When the sub-component was dropped, it was affected by major shortcomings
and is rated unsatisfactory.21 The support to the port authority consisted of technical
assistance through various studies which would have set the basis for a badly needed re-
launching of the port. However, since the Government could not reach an agreement with the
former concessionaire, Tertir, developing a master plan, as foreseen in the KPI, would not have
supported a rehabilitation of the port. The port is still in a dire situation: its infrastructure is
dilapidated, management is turned over annually, it is overstaffed with more than 800 workers,
and the regulatory authority overlaps with the management authority (both of which are
extremely weak). Nevertheless, a hard-to-quantify contribution of this sub-component is that it
served as a channel of policy dialogue and helped to avoid decisions such as sole-sourcing the
management of the port.

A4. Water and energy: Although resources for this sub-component increased after the
second restructuring, outcomes were modest and the sub-component is rated
unsatisfactory. This sub-component was introduced as a "bridge" to finance urgently needed
works and goods while a larger infrastructure project was being designed and appraised. The
original KPI, namely Bidding documents prepared by mid-2003", which was consistent with
the objective of privatizing the water and energy companies, was changed to "Increase the
collection of electricity bills from 40% to 80%", which was consistent with expanded support
and investment in additional production capacity. At the time that the sub-component was
amended it was unsatisfactory, because the original KPI related to preparing the bidding
documents for the privatization had not been achieved. With respect to the amended KPI there
is limited reliable data on collections, but interviews with stakeholders suggest that electricity
bills collections remain at around 40 percent or less, so that amended KPI is also rated
unsatisfactory. Moreover, the energy company is still publicly owned and in serious financial
distress, overburdened by an excessive number of workers and able to operate less than one-
third of its installed capacity of 5.5 MW. Based on the recent Investment Climate Policy Note
(2009), 80 percent of companies in Bissau own a private generator (the highest in SSA), and
face on average between 8 and 22 power outages per year, even with private generation
capacity. However, even if the outcome was unsatisfactory, at critical moments the project
intervention prevented a total collapse and allowed a limited delivery of electricity for basic
services such as the hospital.

20
   Seven weekly flights, two of them with TAP carrying a maximum of 120 passengers and 5 with TACV carrying
an average of 70 passengers.
21
   The original KPI - Port master plan for the Port prepared and adopted by 2005 ­ had not been achieved by the
time when the component was dropped.
                                                      16
A5. Regulatory institution: The Multi-Sector Regulatory Agency was not created and this
sub-component is rated unsatisfactory. At the outset of the project, the situation in Guinea-
Bissau was characterized by multiple sectoral regulatory agencies with weak capacity and high
exposure to political influences and capture. In this context, with a small economy and limited
resources, following the example of Cape-Verde the project took a gradual, pragmatic approach
toward building a multi-sector regulatory agency. During the first phase, the development of
the agency would primarily consist of strengthening the existing (but very weak) telecom
regulator, addressing pressing issues faced by a sector undergoing very rapid transformation.
Only gradually, once sufficient capacity had been built and other sectors had implemented
reforms, would the functional purview of the agency be expanded to other sectors. The project
strengthened the capacities of the various regulatory authorities, notably telecommunications
and aviation, but did not achieve the objective of creating a single multi-sectoral regulatory
agency. The strengthening of the Aviation Authority was relatively successful, but the
telecommunications authority22 (ICGB) was less so, and the port authority was not improved.
Two key factors underlie these unsatisfactory outcomes. First, political instability permeated
the regulatory authorities, with frequent turnover in senior management. Second, the weakness
of the central government and its budget constraints created incentives at the sectoral level to
hold onto existing resources and the unbundling of existing vested interests proved too
complex in the country's fragile political context. Resistance to the proposed reform appears to
have been largely driven by resistance to adopting a transparent regulatory framework in a
sector such as telecom that is a key source of revenue generation, rather than by a rejection of
the multi-sector concept.

B. Divestiture and outsourcing

B1. The objectives of the divestiture sub-component were achieved satisfactorily with only
minor shortcomings.             The initial target for this sub-component was the
privatization/liquidation of 33 public enterprises. As of October 2009, 32 companies had been
divested or were at an advanced state of privatization/liquidation, including the International
Bank of Guinea-Bissau (BIGB). Payments to retrenched workers were processed in a
transparent manner and without complaints. However, due to adverse economic conditions in
Guinea-Bissau and earlier over-staffing, most of these workers were not hired by the new
owners as the workforce was substantially reduced. No data were collected about the labor
outcomes of retrenched workers, but during interviews it was suggested that most of them did
not find other formal employment. On the other hand, these workers were already not being
paid because they were working for companies that were in deep financial distress. Two other
shortcomings could be identified in this process, even if they are unintended consequences of
the Government's instability and lack of resources. First, the Government, in certain cases, did
not comply with the payment of salary arrears. Second, the new owners of the privatized
companies were often denied promised tax exemptions (e.g. import duties on materials for
physical rehabilitation of the privatized establishments), which has slowed the rehabilitation of
some of these companies. These problems, coupled with the high cost of doing business and
22
   The amount of preparatory work though should be emphasized because this formed the basis for the future
progress of the sector. In fact, various important pieces of legislation have been prepared, some of which went
through the Council of Ministers such as the "Telecom Law" which would grant independence to the telecom
authority and introduce a more transparent system for recruitment of senior management. This law was approved
by the Assembly on March 15, 2010 and is now awaiting the promulgation by the President.
                                                      17
adverse economic environment in Guinea-Bissau, explain why most privatized companies are
still operating far below capacity, and why no buyers could be found for nine additional
companies for which the privatization process was launched and will need to be re-launched.
Even so, the objectives of this sub-component were satisfactorily achieved, since the
Government benefitted from the trimming of its bloated payroll, it earned revenues of US$6
million dollars from the sales of these companies, and privatization stimulated both domestic
and foreign private investments. One example is the "Hotel 24 de Setembro", previously the
main hotel in Bissau, which was acquired by a regional consortium and is currently under
rehabilitation with an investment of approximately US$4 million--and a similar story applies
to the Hotel Bissau. Another successful case is Afripeche, a fisheries company acquired by a
consortium of local and international investors, which is now rehabilitated and employs
approximately 200 workers. These achievements are particularly remarkable in the context of
high political instability, where changing Governments sometimes questioned their
predecessors' decisions regarding politically sensitive issues. The pressure from the project and
the continuous engagement of the PIU must be credited for the resolution of these political
obstacles, which is a remarkable achievement in a fragile state.

Banking sector. The liquidation of BIGB, whose CFAF 21 billion in assets represented 51
percent of banking sector assets, was completed with financing under the credit. Depositors
were repaid and workers were paid their severance. This restored financial credibility and
stability to the sector, enabling the second bank in Guinea-Bissau to expand operations and
three new banks to enter the country. The economy is now receiving basic banking services
even if the financial system is still largely underdeveloped.

B2. Outsourcing: As discussed in Section 1.6, the outsourcing sub-component was eliminated
at an early stage with the first restructuring before any activities had begun. Additionally, no
KPIs were associated with this sub-component, so it cannot be rated for the purpose of the ICR.

C. Equity Financing Facility

This sub-component is rated moderately unsatisfactory, despite important achievements
and the learning associated with this pilot fund, because there were significant
shortcomings in the achievement of the original objectives. The initial target of financing 15
projects and creating 400 jobs was not achieved, and only 11 projects were financed. Of those,
three are not operational and two are considered high risk. Nevertheless, there were some very
successful investments such as the ones in Agripeche, Ascon and Guerauto.23 Based on
interviews with entrepreneurs and other stakeholders, the EFF was considered a positive
experience in post-conflict Guinea-Bissau, where companies had been badly damaged by the
conflict and lost a large part of their assets, so that potential entrepreneurial capacities were
idle. The lack of assets for use as collateral and an underdeveloped financial system also
reduced the chances of recovery for existing entrepreneurs, leaving the private sector in a low
equilibrium trap. Four elements undermined the success of the EFF. First, the instability and
high costs of doing business in Bissau reduced returns on private investments and shrunk the
pool of potentially viable investments. Second, the initial requirement that entrepreneurs' 50
percent contributions be in cash proved unduly restrictive given difficulties in accessing
external finance. This requirement was duly relaxed in the second restructuring of the project,

23
     For more details see Annex 1.
                                               18
but time was lost at the beginning. Third, the long-standing issue of government arrears to the
private sector was not solved, limiting companies' capacity to invest. Fourth, certain eligibility
criteria sought to reduce the scope of the fund by targeting firms affected by the war and
excluding new companies, but this proved to be too restrictive in Guinea-Bissau's post-conflict
context, where the difference between start-ups and existing firms badly affected by the conflict
was much less clear than in a normal situation.24

D. Reintegration of Demobilized Ex-combatants

As discussed in Section 1.6, the project financed part of the costs of the reintegration program.
However, a KPI was not added to measure the impact of this activity, nor was the impact of this
activity tracked, so it is not possible to formally evaluate it for the purpose of this ICR.

Component 2: Improving the Investment Climate

Despite some achievements, especially in the legal sub-component, major shortcomings
hampered the achievement of the expected objectives. Therefore, this component is rated
unsatisfactory. This component was expected to support the undertaking of legal reform, as
well as improving the fiscal and regulatory aspects of the business environment and creating
value chains.

A. Legal reform

Despite important achievements, this sub-component is rated moderately unsatisfactory
because of significant shortcomings in achieving the objective of implementing legal
reforms to modernize national laws consistent with OHADA legislation. There were three
KPIs for this sub-component, none of which was fully met:

(i) National laws modernized and revised to be compatible with OHADA: The project ensured
that Portuguese translations were available for the first time for all eight OHADA Uniform
Acts in force in Guinea-Bissau, although these Acts have not been widely disseminated.25 As a
result of the translations, legal experts financed by the project drafted legislation to amend or
repeal GB legislation that contradicted the OHADA legislation. The revisions were approved
by the Council of Ministers in February 2008 and are pending approval by the Parliament.
Drafts were also prepared of laws such as the Civil Code, Code of Civil Process, Commercial
Code, Law of Arbitration, Reform of the Judicial System to Simplify Process of Collection and
Execution, Law for the Notary, Law to Approve Code of Commercial Companies, and Reform
of the Judicial System relative to Guarantees. This work was completed in May 2007. These
drafts are pending approval by the Council of Ministers and the Parliament.



24
  This issue had been discussed during preparation, but the possibility of including greenfield investment was
dropped at the request of the IFC on the basis that this would have distorted the capital markets.

25
  The Portuguese translations of all OHADA Uniform Laws were published in the Official Gazette (Boletim
Oficial) from 21 to 23 September 2005, but with a restricted print-run, only 100 copies were printed separately.

                                                        19
(ii) 70 percent of judges, lawyers and other legal staff trained: There was no baseline survey to
identify the total numbers of judges, lawyers, and other legal staff and therefore this indicator
cannot be fully evaluated. However, Four judges also received training on the OHADA
legislation in a year-long program in Dakar before returning to Bissau to take up positions as
commercial law judges in the new Commercial Court, and they are well placed to properly
apply the OHADA law to commercial disputes. Other short term courses were attended by
some 100 judges and lawyers at the beginning of the project. Also, at the Government's
request, an assessment was made of GB's judicial system which could be used as a basis for
future reforms.

(iii) Improvements in the performance of the tribunal in Bissau, specifically a 50 percent
reduction in the time to issue judgments in commercial cases: The country's first commercial
tribunal in Bissau was opened in a refurbished government building in April 2009, much later
than expected in part because the Ministry of Justice wanted to ensure it would be able to retain
a revenue collecting function. However, the infrastructure and office equipment had been ready
for several months.26 The commercial tribunal is still not fully operational because it lacks
administrative services, but the judges have started to review existing pending cases even if
none have been closed yet. Because the commercial tribunal is not yet fully operational, and
based on interviews with judges and other stakeholders, this target is considered not to have
been achieved. There is no baseline information against which to assess whether or not there
was a decline in the time elapsed for issuing judgments.

B. Improving the business environment and creating value chains

Despite substantial work, the achievements of this sub-component were limited by major
shortcomings and therefore the outcome is rated unsatisfactory. There were two main KPI
for this sub-component: (i) Action plans resulting from administrative barrier and tax studies
implemented. (ii) Supply response and competitiveness stimulated in six key sub-sectors or
entry points (increase in domestic value-added of 50 percent). With respect to the first KPI, the
investment code was drafted but has not yet been approved. Some recommendations from the
FIAS studies that were implemented include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate (from
39 to 25 percent), the personal income tax rate (from 20 to 12 percent), and the tax on property
transfers (from 10 to 2 percent). However, regulations for ongoing businesses remain
burdensome, as shown by the ranking in the 2010 Doing Business indicators. The process of
opening and running a business takes 213 days27, and the country is ranked 114th and 175th,
respectively, for the ease of dealing with construction permits and employing workers. The
ranking for the ease of registering property indicator deteriorated further, from 170th in 2008 to
177th in 2010. The trading across borders ranking deteriorated from 111th to 116th. It is
estimated that it takes six different documents and 23 days to export a 20 ft container. With
respect to the second KPI, despite substantial preparatory work and studies to promote different
value chains, the supply response and competitiveness of the four sub-sectors that were
26
  Initial steps were also taken by the county's two Chambers of Commerce to establish a Centre of Alternative
Dispute Resolution focused on the arbitration of commercial disputes, and some potential arbitrators received
initial training. The offices of the official notary and the commercial registry were to have been transferred from
the Ministry of Justice to the new courthouse, but this has not happened due to the disagreement between the
Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court.

eventually prioritized28 has been very weak in a context of endemic instability, poor
infrastructure and high transaction costs.

3.3        Efficiency

The original economic analysis could not be replicated because some of the assumptions
made during the preparation could not be tracked clearly, such as the "assumed" productivity
gains from investment climate and legal reforms. Similarly, the assumptions made with respect
to the retrenched workers could not be verified because data were not collected and could not
be collected during the ICR.

For this reason, the efficiency analysis focuses on the sub-components for which it was
possible to obtain detailed data: (a) privatization, (b) telecom, and (c) EFF. All these sub-
components are part of Component 1, "Building Partnerships and Private Participation," which
accounts for almost 60 percent of total resources allocation.

In terms of economic efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the telecom sub-component was an
enormous success. The rate of return is over 1000 percent and drives the overall rate of return
of the project. The benefits of the telecom sub-component included welfare gains for the
consumers due to the substantial reduction in prices, revenues for the Government, new
investments attracted, and the very high revenues of the new telecom companies.

Privatization also has a positive rate of return on the order of 60 percent. In contrast, the
EFF rate of return is negative, driven by high administrative costs and the fact that many of the
companies benefitting from the grants have not yet started their operations (for details refer to
Annex 3).

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)

The overall project outcome is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The project addressed
urgent needs and remains relevant today. Project outcomes were less successful than expected,
although some very important outcomes with high returns were attained, and this justifies the
overall moderately unsatisfactory rating. Telecommunications services were improved and the
divestiture of state enterprises was accomplished. The liquidation of unprofitable state-owned
enterprises not only eliminates future liabilities but provides a clean slate for investment in new
enterprises once the political situation is clarified. The banking sector is providing basic
banking services, which it was not able to do before the project because the larger of the two
banks in the country was bankrupt, discouraging investment in the sector. Three new banks
were established and one expanded operations following the liquidation of the bankrupt bank,
with the result that the economy has limited but improved access to basic financial services.
Although legal reform was not achieved, considerable progress was made in preparing
legislation which will be the basis for the needed legislative reform expected to be started this
year--e.g. the telecom law was approved by Parliament on March 15, 2010. Economic
efficiency is difficult to measure. The positive returns resulting from the telecom and, to a
lesser extent, the privatization sub-component, which together account for approximately one

third of project costs, indicate important economic gains resulting from the project, especially
in relation to the IDA financing of SDR 21 million.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty, gender and social impacts are not easily attributable. The absence of baseline data
and the indirect nature of much of the project's impact makes it particularly difficult to identify
the impact on poverty, gender, and social issues.

Based on qualitative evidence and interviews, it is possible to identify some positive, direct
impacts on poverty through employment generation. The employment generating effects of
the EFF and of some privatizations, such as those of the Hotel 24 de Setembro and Afripeche,
had some positive effect on poverty. More indirectly, it could be argued that the telecom
liberalization positively affected the welfare of the population at large, and potentially helped
the poor through expanded access to information and communication services at substantially
cheaper prices. However, these effects are rather indirect and hard to quantify. Additionally, it
is possible to argue that the retrenched workers were positively affected in the short-run by the
retrenchments payments. The fact that most of these workers could not be hired by the new
owners and that most of them remained unemployed could be considered an adverse result.
However, these workers were duly compensated and, prior to being released they were not
being paid and, given the status of the companies, were unlikely to be paid.

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional development and long-term capacity building was a key goal of the project
and there were some important achievements, even if limited due to general instability
and institutional fragility. The reform and strengthening of the civil aviation authority and
telecom regulatory agency left these institutions much more developed that when the project
began. However, the process is far from complete. Despite Parliament's approval of the
telecom law, the regulatory agency in still in a weak position with high turnover rates among
its senior management, who are often appointed based on political criteria. Similarly, the civil
aviation authority became operational, its infrastructure was rehabilitated and its offices
equipped, and its capacity was strengthened thanks to the project, but the recent ICAO report
highlighted serious weaknesses in the aviation authority that need to be addressed in order to
meet internationally acceptable safety standards.

The use of an external PIU did not hamper the strengthening of domestic institutions. On
the contrary, a strong and well equipped PIU served as a training ground for staff who
later became like-minded, reform-oriented policymakers. The core activities carried out by
the project aimed at improving these capacities, as discussed in the paragraph above and, in
greater detail, in Section 3.2. The creation of the high quality and well equipped PIU
transformed this into a de facto laboratory for capacity building. The first coordinator of the
project went on to become Minister of Finance and then a lawmaker. The second coordinator
became, during the last few months before the project's closure, Secretary of State for the
Budget. Other technical advisors went on to important roles as policymakers (e.g. customs).
Whereas the standard argument against PIUs is that they are transitory relative to public
                                                22
institutions, in the turbulent post-conflict setting of Guinea-Bissau, the high quality PIU
provided an oasis of continuity and institutional memory in a context of continuous turnover of
senior officials in the Ministries and public agencies.

The legal sub-component achieved important results in the modernization and
development of the existing judicial system, although the process is not yet complete. The
translation of the OHADA code, drafting of new and compatible regulations, and reinforcement
of the capacities of four judges are important outcomes for modernizing the judicial system,
even though the system is still fragile and not yet fully operational. For example, the lack of
administrative services does not allow the commercial tribunal to be fully operational and the
newly drafted laws have not yet been approved or enacted.

The institutional development of the banking sector was crucially enhanced by the
liquidation of BIGB. The liquidation of BIGB, which was the largest bank in the country and
dominated the banking sector, and the payment of depositors permitted the second bank in the
country to expand operations. It also encouraged three other banks to enter Guinea-Bissau. As
a result, the economy has access to banking services, which was not the case prior to the BIGB
liquidation.

(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3. The project yielded a range of unintended outcomes. On the negative side, workers
retrenched from the privatized companies were not able to find employment because of the
weak economy, and project financing of severance payments for retrenched workers became
more important than it would have been in a normal environment. On the positive side, the PIU
became a center for learning and of knowledge about the implementation of reforms and of
investment programs, which was not necessarily planned. Moreover, it became a springboard
for various "like-minded" policy reformers who went on to assume important political positions
within Government. Additionally, the capacity of the PIU Unit was drawn on by four other
projects at various stages of preparation or implementation, which was not planned at the outset
of the project. Finally, the telecom liberalization both dramatically increased the number of
users (as measured by the relevant KPI) and lowered prices substantially, with the prices of
international call falling by almost 90 percent. While this cannot be called unintentional, it
certainly is an important outcome with a tremendous impact that is not measured by the KPI.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The project's accomplishments in areas such as divestiture, telecom, OHADA, and banking are
considered largely irreversible and are stepping stones for future reforms. However, the risks
are high for other components such as civil aviation, energy, regulatory institution, ports, and
investment climate. Overall, given the political situation, the risks are moderate that the
outcomes which have been achieved will not be maintained.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance
(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.
The project's objectives addressed high-priority issues after the conflict, and the operation was
prepared to quickly address the Government's urgent needs. The technical underpinning of the
project was very solid, and the appraisal team included staff with the appropriate skills. The
project incorporated innovative components such as the EFF which, despite limited results, was
considered by most stakeholders to be particularly relevant as it sought to provide emergency
funding for the private sector, which had lost much of its capital. Additionally, the project
design is such that most of the agenda is still relevant today. As discussed in Section 2.1, there
were two Quality of Supervision Assessments carried out in 2004 and 2006. Both evaluated the
design at entry as generally sound and satisfactory, except for the weakness of the results
framework, which needed to be revised.

The appraisal team appropriately identified the key risks, the most important of which was
the Government's weakness, and established an institutional structure which ensured the
implementation of many components of the project in spite of the extremely adverse political
environment. This structure, with its continuity of skilled staff, also helped to mitigate down-
side risks in terms of shifts in ownership of an essential reform agenda, which is a risk that is
particularly acute and intractable in a turbulent post-conflict political environment with high
turnover among key policy makers. With hindsight, the project should have been narrower in
scope, considering the political risks of an operation in Guinea-Bissau, but the team's decision
to include many components is understandable given the need to address a range of constraints
in order to successfully stimulate private investment, and the perspective at appraisal that the
project was to be considered an evolving mechanism to address the key constraints of the
private sector, and the MTR was expected to thoroughly review and restructure each
component as needed. Two further assumptions made at appraisal that would have helped the
project did not materialize. First, it was assumed that the long-standing issue of public arrears
to the private sector would have been solved, alleviating the private sector's financial
constraints and encouraging new investments. Second, it was assumed that the project would be
closely followed by a budget support operation that would strengthen political support for
reforms financed by the project, but this did not materialize until much later.

Finally, the project indicators were detailed but focused mostly on outputs rather than
outcomes, the PAD and Financing Agreement were inconsistent on this, and key baseline data
was not collected. During interviews for the preparation of this ICR, it emerged that during
preparation and appraisal the team focused on defining the components and the outputs in the
expectation that the indicators would have been reviewed along the way, and substantially
revised by the MTR.

(b)    Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory


                                               24
 Supervision was generally continuous and proactive. During the first five years of
implementation, there were semi-annual field supervisions and, in one case when it was not
possible to visit the country, the PIU team visited Washington for discussions. However,
supervision was less intense than would have been desirable during the final year of the project
due to changes of TTLs. The team was proactive and pragmatic in responding to the country's
needs as they emerged. This was exemplified by two revisions to the project's scope, one to
include financing for demobilization and the second to include support for urgently needed
reforms.

The two Quality of Supervision Assessments rated supervision satisfactory, but
opportunities were probably missed to narrow the scope of this project and instead
expand the envelope of support for Guinea-Bissau. In particular, in hindsight and based on
this ICR's findings, it is fair to say that the restructuring at the MTR was not as deep as needed
(e.g. in relation to the ports or the multi-sector regulatory agency). It can be argued that this
was potentially a missed opportunity, because a deeper restructuring could have had an impact
on the project's achievements. Bearing in mind that supervision involves not only the
immediate project or country team but also more senior management decisions, a critical
strategic decision was that of expanding the range of activities supported by this project, rather
than financing other operations in Guinea-Bissau and narrowing the scope of this particular
project to heighten chances of success. Because of the IDA performance-based allocation
system and the fact that Guinea-Bissau was not formally defined as a post-conflict state due to
the nature of its conflict, the IDA envelope fell far short of what is required in a post-conflict
setting. Thus the project was not accompanied by the foreseen parallel DPO and was for a long
period, "the only game in town", which undermined the "corrections at mid-term review"
strategy envisaged at appraisal and complicated the achievement of the project development
outcomes. A further shortcoming more closely related to the project level was the lack of data
collection in areas such as legal reforms, privatization, workers retrenchment, and the fact that
indicators were not improved as had been suggested by the two Quality of Supervision
Assessments. These factors made the project evaluation particularly difficult and contribute to
the overall Moderately Unsatisfactory rating for supervision.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Overall, the Bank's performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory. The project addressed
strategic needs of the country at a difficult time, was technically well prepared, and acted
quickly and flexibly during implementation to respond to urgent needs. The scope of the
project could have been narrower and the indicators better developed, but these flaws are
explained by the urgency of the operation and the (growing) extent of the needs, and the project
assumed that these elements would be adjusted during implementation when the project would
have been streamlined by dropping less feasible elements. More importantly, some key
assumptions made during the preparation and appraisal did not materialize and this crucially
affected the project. Supervision was adequate in intensity but did not take advantage of the
MTR to more substantially restructure and to reduce the complexity of the project. Finally,
appropriate indicators were not developed or quantified and detailed baseline data for various
sub-components was not collected, which made it difficult to assess the project's impact.

5.2    Borrower Performance
                                               25
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Government performance is rated unsatisfactory. The political instability that prevailed
during implementation resulted in frequent turnover of government officials, changes in
policies relevant to key project issues, and changes in the levels of commitment to specific
issues. Governments often questioned the decisions made by their predecessors. Throughout
implementation, the Government did not emphasize monitoring of the project. Government
officials often did not participate in the steering committee because they wanted to receive a
special stipend which the government was not able to pay.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The implementing agency's performance is rated satisfactory. As noted elsewhere in the
report, the PIU's staff was competent, characterized by limited turnover, well paid, and
committed to the reform agenda supported by the project. Given the shortcomings at the
Government level, the PIU was able to advance reforms in spite of the lack of durable
champions in the Government. The Unit was well managed and had strong administrative
procedures, which made it possible for it to assume responsibility for the implementation of
four other Bank projects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

In this rating. greater weight is given to the Government's performance than to the
implementing agency because of the former's importance in implementing the required
reforms to achieve the PDO. In spite of the vast amount of work done by the PIU and
advances in reforms in some important areas (i.e. telecom and privatizations), the political
instability critically undermined the achievement of the PDO. In sum, the PIU is considered a
necessary but not sufficient condition for the successful achievement of the PDO, as
exemplified by various legislative packages completed but not yet approved (see Annex 2,
Component 2.A, for details).

6.     Lessons Learned

In a context of fragile institutions, special attention should be paid to the political
economy and "second best" solutions should be explored. One of the key elements of reform
that was emphasized throughout the project was the development of a multi-sectoral regulatory
agency. Such an agency never became operational and was possibly rarely considered seriously
by the changing Governments. As discussed above, the political instability and the complexity
of unbundling the existing vested interests at the level of individual Ministries (which were
sensitive to the resources generated through the sectoral regulatory agencies) are the key
reasons behind this outcome. Early recognition of the strength of these vested interests could
potentially have allowed for the exploration of alternative, more politically feasible, routes of
reform.


                                               26
In a fragile state, understanding the political economy and institutional operations may
lead to solutions that would not be optimal in a normal context. For the implementation of
this project a steering committee was set up, including all of the relevant Ministries and
stakeholders. This would certainly be a good idea in a normal context, however in this specific
case it slowed down the project implementation because the size of the committee was such
that reaching a quorum for making decisions was often problematic. The principal difficulty of
getting the steering committee to meet was the result of continuous changes due to political
instability. Additionally, consistent with World Bank rules, members of this Committee could
not be paid for their work because they were already paid for their jobs as civil servants. This
greatly affected their incentives to meet and take decisions. In such a context, it may have been
more effective to have a smaller committee and draw in specific sectoral representatives and
stakeholders only as needed depending on the topic being discussed, even if this is sub-optimal
in its level of representation.

Another lesson for projects where the existing institutions are fragile and unstable is the
importance of building a strong PIU. A key reason for the achievements of this project was
the capacity and quality of the PIU.

Implementation in a context of weak capacity needs to account for details that may be
second order in a normal context. The legal reform sub-component aimed to modernize the
legal system by making commercial regulations compatible with the OHADA laws and
building capacity to apply these revised laws. For this reason, the project involved "soft
activities" such as the translation of OHADA laws, the revision of the commercial code,
intensive training for the relevant judges, and "hard investment" such as the renovation of
buildings to accommodate the new commercial tribunal. All of these activities were carried out
as planned, but the commercial tribunal is still not fully operative because of a lack of
administrative services. For instance, annual discussions between the project unit and the
supervision mission about necessary changes could have perhaps revealed the training
requirements of the administration staff.

There are strong complementarities between investment operations and Development
Policy Operations that should be exploited in order to move the reform agenda forward.
Investment operations and technical assistance are instrumental in setting the stage and doing
the preparatory work to support the reforms, however the DPO becomes crucial when the time
comes to accelerate and enact the reforms. In the case of Guinea-Bissau, these
complementarities could not be exploited as there was no DPO to accompany the investment
operation. A related consideration is that legislative reforms take considerable time to
implement, and this should be accounted for in project design.

Designing ambitious and multi-pronged projects can be appropriate in a fragile
institutional context, especially in the case of small countries, however in these situations
an aggressive restructuring should be proactively pursued during implementation. The
evaluation of this project should not lead to the conclusion that ambitious and multi-pronged
projects should not be designed in the context of fragile institutional environments. In fact, in
such contexts the needs are often numerous and the project design has to be responsive to client
needs. This may lead to the design of ambitious and multi-sectoral projects, especially in the
case of small countries where the limited number of projects creates strong pressure to define
multi-sectoral interventions ("the only game in town" situation). In these situations, where
                                               27
political volatility is an issue, a pragmatic approach that focuses on multiple goals can have a
high payoff. However, when such a strategy is adopted the implementation should be especially
aggressive in exploiting every available opportunity to revise, restructure and retain only the
sub-components with the highest potential.

The case of this project in Guinea-Bissau, a small country with a limited IDA allocation
and a fragile institutional context, raises some questions about the limits of the current
IDA engagement model with a performance-based allocation system. When the IDA
allocation is limited by country size and reduced even further by weak institutional
performance, especially after an adverse shock, this may generate a vicious cycle. Because
needs are many, the few projects in the portfolio become especially ambitious to be able to
attain minimum conditions for achieving investment, growth, institutional development or
access to services, which increases the probability of unsatisfactory results, thereby feeding
back into lower performance-based allocations of IDA.

The M&E framework should receive greater priority even in a weak institutional setting
in order to support both a quantitatively sound evaluation and project implementation.
The lack of a satisfactory M&E framework makes it difficult to adequately assess the impact of
the project, and therefore limits the ability to make corrections or draw lessons for future
projects. The lack of adequate M&E doubtless limited the ability to measure the degree to
which specific components achieved the desired goals or should have been modified in order to
accomplish those goals.

Component 1 Building Partnerships and Private Participation

A1. Telecom Sector

History and evolution

During the last two decades the Telecom sector in Guinea-Bissau has been going through some
important changes. The most relevant, before the PRDSP was declared operative, was the
partnership in 1989 between Guinetelecom and Portugal Telecom with the objective to promote
private investments and improvements in the quality, and access, to telecom services.

In the light of the radical changes influencing the telecom sector, during the late 90s, the
Government started negotiating with Guinetelcom, and its partner PT, possibility to restrict the
exclusivity condition consistently with a world-wide process of liberalization in the telecom
sector.

In 1999 a new regulatory framework was approved that amended the basic telecom law, the
regime of access to the gateway, revised the status of the ICGB, and defined the sectoral
objectives for the telecom sector. This process of reforms was interrupted by the conflict and,
in 2001-2002 a new round of negotiations restarted with the objective of modifying the
conditions of the concession contract of Guinetelecom. During this period the World Bank,
through the PPF started providing technical assistance in this process of negotiations with the
objectives of guaranteeing the respect of private investors' right, on one side, and supporting
the process of liberalization of the sector at the moment far behind the Sub-Saharan average in
terms of quality and access to telecom services.

In 2003 the Government decided to unilaterally rescind the concession contract and a new
contract was signed in 2004. The latter limited the monopoly of Guinetelecom, granted two
new licenses to Guinetel (owned by Guinetelecom and PT), Spacetel (company owned by the
MTN group). A third license contract would be granted in 2007 to Sonatel (Societé Nationale
des Telecommunications du Sénégal ­ which is 43% owned by France Telecom).

In 2005 the process of liberalization of the telecom sector was reinforced by the declaration of
the Government will to liberalize the telecom sector by promoting competition and investment
within a transparent and fair legal framework. The 2005 also signed the termination of the
exclusivity over the international gateway of Guinetelecom.

Since 2007 the PRDSP has been supporting the reinforcement of the technical and regulatory
capacity of the telecom authority (ICGB), and at the same time the process to improve the legal
and regulatory framework in line with CEDEAO and UEMOA directives. As a result a set of
legal documents including laws, decrees and regulations has been prepared (see list below)

Achievements

The results of this liberalization have been remarkable with the number of cel-phone users
exploding from zero in 2002 to about 350,000-400,00030 with Guinea-Bissau getting at the
same level of other Sub-Saharan countries in terms of cell phone subscriptions.

Similarly remarkable are the results in terms of costs reduction and consequent welfare gains
for consumers, particularly marked has been the reduction of prices of international call after
the elimination of the international gateway, the prices of international calls felt from 1200
CFAF per minute in 2004 to about 150 CFAF per minute in 2009 . (See table below for
information on the evolution of price basket for mobile calls in Guinea-Bissau).

One adverse outcome of the explosion of the cell subscriptions is the reduction in the number
of subscribers of landline which, coupled with mismanagement and lack of investments, has

  There are some difficulties with exactly quantifying the number of users because the available number of
contracts (SIM cards) is an upper bound of the number of user in a context where users often tend to carry multiple
SIM cards and use one or the other depending on the time of the day/tariffs.

generated a very difficult situation for Guinetelecom that is today unable to pay the wages of its
workforce nor able to find resources for the required for its revitalization, as a matter of fact the
company is in financial distress with its revenues unable to cover its operative costs and
provide a service of adequate quality.

Present weaknesses and future agenda

Despite the remarkable improvements (especially when compared with the extremely poor
initial situation) it is important to underline that the reform agenda and the evolution of the
telecom sector is still an unfinished agenda.

First, it is crucial that the legal package prepared during the last 3 years is approved in order to
provide the required regulatory framework for a sector that has evolved substantially during the
last years.

Second, related to the previous point, it is crucial to transform the ICGB into a truly
independent body and provide it with the adequate human, technical and financial resources.
Often, in the past the ICGB has been influenced by political changes as proved by the fact that
its president has been changed on average once per year. The new telecom law, pending its
approval in the Parliament over the next Assembly session (February-March 2010) grants
ICGB the needed independence and a system where its president and high-level technicians are
recruited based on their competencies through a public process.

The situation of Guinetelecom is very difficult and negatively affects the whole sector, starting
from the diffusion of internet services. It is crucial to review the options available weighting the
interests of all stakeholders, in particular the consumers in Guinea-Bissau.

Finally, a special review of the elements affecting the expansion of ICT services in general, and
internet in particular, should be done with the objective of identifying the policies needed to
promote a sector that is crucial for the overall competitiveness of Guinea-Bissau.

A.3 Port of Bissau

Background.

Since 1999, the port of Bissau has been managed by the public-sector Port Authority of GB
(APGB). For the last 11 years, APGB's results have been disappointing since it has been unable
to deal with the most urgent issues that have continuously impacted the port's operations.
These include:

           1. the removal of ship wrecks along the port access channel;
           2. the removal of a sunken ship at an important berth;
           3. the regular dredging of the port and access channels to allow large vessels to
              service the port;
           4. the significant reduction in the number port employees of 2006, APGB had
               accrued unfunded pension liabilities of some CFAF 700 million and was adding
              another US$35,000 or so monthly to that liability.
           5. the repair or replacement of most hauling, loading and related equipment; and

APGB's inability to deal with these important problems is partially attributable to financial
problems as it does not control the use of port revenues. The Project was unable to support
needed reforms in part because there was a disagreement with a concessionaire which has not
been resolved as expected.

Following the signing of the Portugal-Guinea Bissau investment treaty in 1991, TERTIR, a
Portuguese company, and Guinea-Bissau (GB) signed a 15-year concession contract for the
management and operation of the port of Bissau. By the terms of this contract, the concession
was then assigned to GUIPORT, a joint venture between TERTIR and GB, with TERTIR the
major shareholder. Following allegations by GB of breaches of the concession contract on the
part of GUIPORT, GB rescinded the contract in 1999. Following a long procedure involving
both the GB courts and an International Arbitration panel, the dispute remains unresolved.

The Project. Under the project it was envisaged that the Bank would support the reform of the
port, assist in attracting private investment and help fund technical assistance for the
formulation and implementation of appropriate legal and regulatory reforms. An assessment of
the port's competitiveness was to have been undertaken, with the identification of priority
investment needs, as part of a port sector master plan study financed under Part A: 1. (d) of the
Project. In addition, under the same sub-component, a monitoring system was to have been
created to improve the performance of customs and port operations through the provision of
technical assistance, training and equipment for the customs office. None of these goals, was
achieved under the Project.

From the outset, the working assumption was that the private sector should be involved in port
operations, whether as the manager, lessee or owner of all port assets. Project teams note that
the Bank gave at least verbal encouragement to the stated GB desire to resolve the dispute
quickly on an amicable basis since it was generally accepted that eventual expressions of
interest from competent private operators would inevitably prove few unless a settlement with
TERTIR could be arrived at first. However, by mid-term review in 2005, no serious settlement


                                               33
effort had been initiated to settle the TERTIR dispute, and the component was dropped from
the project.

Following the mid-term review, the Bank made several informal proposals to government to
help find solutions to the concession issue but these did not result in a solution to the
outstanding problems. In 2007, with support from a World Bank-managed PPIAF financing, a
highly-qualified Portuguese law firm was retained to work with the GB Government
counterparts in preparing a proposed PPP law covering such matters as (a) how to select a
private contractor; (b) what to do with unsolicited bids, (c) the respective obligations of the
private contractor and of the State; and (d) what must be included in any PPP contract. Under
the World Bank Legal Vice-Presidency supervision, draft legislation was ready for review by
the Government early in 2008 and, following workshops in Guinea-Bissau attended by senior
government officials including relevant Ministers, the draft Law on Public-Private Partnerships
was finalized in October 2008. This law is based on best international practice, as well as the
recommendations of the United Nations on Public Procurement and Public-Private
Partnerships, while taking into consideration the special circumstances of Guinea-Bissau.
On 3 April 2009, the Guinea-Bissau government announced the approval of this Law by the
Council of Ministers. To allow for the implementation of PPP projects in Guinea-Bissau, the
government has announced its commitment to overhaul it administrative legislation dealing
with domestic public tenders. In the meantime, the PPP law awaits promulgation by the
President.

C. Equity Financing Facility

Summary: Main issues and lessons learned

This note summarizes the findings of the ICR team during a field visit where it met with the local
staff charged with the component as well as with beneficiary institutions. This was a very
innovative sub-component and it has been reviewed with particular attention because it was a
pilot initiative potentially replicable in the future.

Eleven projects were financed and a total of CFAF 750,482,892 disbursed from the project under
the EFF component. These funds mobilized investments, financed by either by the firms' own
resources or by bank credits, amounting to 397,229,936 CFAF (for a detailed breakdown of
investments see Table 3 below).31

The results of the EFF are summarized below the original target of 15 projects financed and 400
jobs created were not met. Furthermore, among the 11 financed projects:

            Three projects (Mabi, Dias y Dias, Suinave) are not operational yet and two of them
           (Mabi and Dias y Dias) are considered high risk in terms of their implementation32

            One project (Chez Ami) is a micro investment and a small restaurant with less than 7
           employees

            One (SGD Lenox) is a gas station with only 12 employees

Nevertheless it is important to underscore some very successful investments such as the one in
Agripeche, a privatized fisheries company today completely renovated and with the potential of
becoming a successful exporter, the investment in Ascon, a large construction company well
structured and active in Guinea Bissau and in the region. Guerauto proved a successful
investment and helped to transform a small mechanic workshop into a well-respected mechanic
company able to supply larger organizations (i.e. embassies, UN) and NGOs.

Lessons learned
Interviews with most of the companies financed through the EFF and the two managers of the
fund point to the following lessons.

EFF was a good idea in a post-conflict context. There is little doubt that in a post-conflict
context, such as that of Guinea-Bissau, where companies have been badly affected by the
conflict and lost a large part of their assets an equity fund is a very promising idea and can make
an important difference. The principal reasons why such an intervention can be appropriate in
this context are two. First, because of the war, potential entrepreneurial capacities are idle.
Second, the firms' lack of assets usable as collateral, coupled with an underdeveloped financial
system, reduces the chances of existing entrepreneurs to recover leaving the private sector in a
low equilibrium.
31
     For a list of the companies visited see annex 1
32
     See "Relatorio Final de Execucao do Fundo Compatricipacao Pos Conflito"

                                                        38
The instability and cost of doing business hampered the success of the fund. When
evaluating the results of the EFF it is important to bear in mind two key variables that negatively
affected any investment returns: first the extremely high instability and consequent high risk,
second the high cost of doing business and scarcity of complementary inputs (i.e. electricity).
These two factors contributed to drastically reduce any private investment returns and therefore
raised the bar for the EFF to be absorbed by the private sector and complement private
investments.

The initial condition of 50 percent cash as counterpart funds was problematic. When
initially launched the fund had as condition for disbursement that the entrepreneur had to make
available counterpart (50 percent) in cash. This was contentious point because entrepreneurs did
not have the required liquidity and were not able to raise the funds from local banks. Eventually
this requirement was relaxed and the beneficiaries were able to put upfront 25 percent cash and
the remaining 25 percent in assets. This change increased the flexibility of the EFF and allowed
more companies to become eligible.

Need for creating partnerships with banks. One clear lesson learned is that in a post-conflict
context it is unlikely that entrepreneurs have cash in hand out of existing profits because of the
capital losses undergone during the conflict. Furthermore, it may be difficult for entrepreneurs to
deal one by one with commercial banks. In this context a partnership of the EFF with local (or
international) banks may prove successful as it would help to generate businesses for the banks
as well as help unlock access to EFF funds. Complementing equity with debt is a usual strategy
in venture capital type interventions

Procurement rules could be streamlined. One of the important lessons for operations of the
project refers to the procurement rules. In the case of the EFF it was agreed that the beneficiary
companies would have followed the same procurement rules of the WB which imply that for any
acquisition three pro forma invoices are presented and no payment can be done before the good
is delivered. This proved complex and costly in a context where local market is very thin (and in
certain cases is hard to find three potential suppliers) and for the acquisition of machineries
when often an account is required by the suppliers.

The criteria of focusing only on existing firms proved too restrictive. For being eligible a
company had to be either already existing or damaged during the conflict or be a privatized
company.33 For instance, if an entrepreneur had a company that was destroyed during the conflict
but wanted to start a new business this would not be eligible. Similarly, start-ups were not
eligible under the EFF. Such criteria reduced the pool of potential investments and proved, with
hindsight, too restrictive. It is possible that investing in start-ups may require a different
screening but it is also important to note that in a post-conflict context even existing firms are
akin to a start-up in a normal context.

Evaluation of impact

33
   The possibility of making startups as eligible was discussed during preparation but was excluded especially
because of the opinion of IFC that this would have crowded out other type of financial instruments to support
startups.

                                                     39
Based on the field visits and the discussions with various stakeholders (in particular the
companies that benefited under the EFF) we can highlight the impact of the fund investments.
However, it is important to note the problems with this evaluation. First, there are no baseline
data that we can use to track improvements over the period. Second, we have no information on
counterfactual or firms similar to the ones financed that did not receive any support. Third,
several of the companies that benefited from the EFF did not start their operations. Fourth, this is
an extremely small sample so our conclusions are much more alike to a case study than to a
rigorous impact evaluation. Nevertheless we can highlight four main results.

1.      Positive impact on investment: this is a clear impact as the EFF support not only
generated direct investments but allowed various companies to access external financial
resources such as Banks. In particular, overall for each dollar of the EFF the entrepreneurs were
able to access and invest $0.5 dollars from financial institutions (this varies from company to
company). It is hard to assess the question of additionality or "would have the companies
invested anyway if the EFF was not there? "Based on the interviews this is unlikely for most
companies given their poor capitalization. Overall we can conclude that the EFF stimulated
directly investments of an amount equivalent to CFAF 397,229,936 CFAF (close to
US$800,000)


2.     Positive impact on production capacities and scale of production. We found that
some of the companies were completely non operative and others were operating at a much
lower scale before the support of the EFF. Examples of this situation are LENOX, GUERAUTO,
GUIMETAL and SOAPEC. Therefore it is evident that the EFF had a positive impact on
production capacities and scale of production.


3.      Unclear impact on employment. For those companies that were non operative before
the support of the EFF and became operational after, it is clear the funds had a positive impact on
job creation. However this was not necessarily the case for existing companies and the impact on
employment was certainly below the target objective of 400 new jobs created.
4.     Very high administrative costs. Having discussed the benefits of the fund it is also
important to outline the costs of this intervention, in particular the administration costs. These
costs proved to be very high in particular as a percentage of the total investments done. If we
sum up operating costs, consultants services and audits, training and workshops and purchased
goods this is equal to about 327 millions CFAF, which reaches about 43% of the total
investments done (CFAF 752 million).

Component 2: Improving the Investment Climate


A. Legal Reforms

Outcomes
The project's legal reform component aimed to make GB's legal and judicial system
more secure, predictable and responsive, especially in respect of the creation of
businesses, private sector investments and business contracts. components were loosely
defined at appraisal and the specific activities to be carried out were spelled out in the
DCA. These activities are summarized in the paragraphs that follow.

Harmonizing GB's business laws with its OHADA Uniform Acts, as well as drafting
additional laws to support private sector investment

By March 2007, an omnibus law was prepared with Project-funded TA amending and
repealing, as appropriate, existing legislation to bring it in line with the eight OHADA
Uniform Laws. In addition, recommendations were made for the up-dating of colonial
laws which were still in force. The same legal consultants led two, three-day workshops
in Bissau for lawyers, judges, law professors and students to explain their work. The task
of reviewing and analyzing the experts' recommendations fell to GB's OHADA National
Commission which met infrequently. It took eleven months before the various relevant
statutes were reviewed and approved by the Council of Ministers in February 2008.
These have not been enacted yet (see list of laws and regulations drafted with the support
of the project and not yet enacted).

In addition the Government employed with Project financing, legal experts to assist in the
drafting of a Land Law, an Investment Code, amendments to the Privatization Law and
laws and decrees regarding the Telecommunications Laws and decrees were available for
approval by the Council of Ministers in May 2007 for approval by the council of
Ministers and subsequent approval of the Parliament. To the date only the Invesmtent
code has been approved by the Assebly and enacted by the President (on December
2009).

Developing a legal information system, including the translation of OHADA laws,
creating a computerized database, posting laws and regulations on GB web sites, and
strengthening GB's Official Gazette

The translation of OHADA laws: The eight OHADA Uniform Laws in force in Guinea-
Bissau were translated and some 100 copies of the relevant Official Gazettes with these
translations were printed and made available. The initial publication and dissemination of
the eight OHADA Uniform Laws in Portuguese was necessary for the harmonization
work referred to above, as well as for any general understanding in Government and
GB's private sector of the various provisions of these laws

Creation of a computerized legal database. Efforts to establish a legal information
system faltered within the Ministry of Justice. The need for such a system remains acute,


                                           44
as the cost of obtaining hard-copies and copying all the laws in force in Guinea-Bissau is
high. In 2007, without Project support, the Faculty of Law of Bissau published an index
of the titles of all laws enacted in Guinea-Bissau between 1975 and 2005 which lay the
ground-work for a subsequent computerized database to be housed at the Faculty. In
March 2008, the Faculty put forth proposals to the PIU for databases on colonial and
modern legislation to be carried out mostly by local consultants however at this stage the
resources allocated to the legal component had been virtually exhausted and this project
could not be financed.

Posting of all laws and regulations on one or more GB web sites and strengthening of the
Official Gazette. The Ministry of Justice successfully initiated its website which can be
viewed at www.mj-gb.org. Not all legislation is included in the website at this time..
Project assistance consisted of the purchase of computer equipment for the office of the
Official Gazette which was helpful in its production, among other things, of copies, in
Portuguese, of all OHADA Uniform Laws.

Strengthening enterprise registration, including the official commercial notary and the
commercial registrar

The PAD specifically spells out the computerization of the commercial registries. By
Mid-term Review in 2005, Project-funded computerization was well underway in the
commercial registry housed in the Ministry of Justice building in Bissau. The Project also
funded the purchase of computers for the office of the commercial notary in the Ministry
of Justice, which is the sole notary in the country and has acted as a monopoly, as well as
computer-training for officials in both the commercial registry and the notary's offices.
There were physical problems in building legal capacity due to the lack of reliable
electric power, as the Ministry of Justice had no back-up generator, with the result that
the officials were only able to operate computers and air conditioners on a sporadic basis.
In 2006, the Project financed the purchase and installation of a back-up generator at the
Ministry.

With a view to the eventual harmonization of the commercial registry and the notary
services with OHADA requirements, a Project-financed study was completed in
December 2005 by a competitively selected firm in Dakar which was eventually
disseminated in Portuguese. Also, with encouragement from World Bank missions, a
series of Ministers of Justice considered privatizing the notary service maintained as a
public service. A Ministerial decree to privatize the only notary service in the country
was prepared for the Justice Minister's signature in 2006, although it has not been
promulgated. Despite the intentions expressed, all recent Ministers of Justice have, in the
end, been persuaded that preventing the loss of income generated for the Ministry by the
existing notary service is a priority.

Developing modern code of conduct for judges; court case management, and judicial
performance standards and evaluation systems; developing an alternative dispute
resolution system for commercial cases




                                            45
Code of conduct, case management and evaluation system. No progress was achieved in
these areas.

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) for commercial cases. The component was not
clearly defined at appraisal and there were no interlocutors which could have facilitated
the discussion during supervision. GB's two Chambers of Commerce appeared interested
in promoting a jointly owned Commercial Arbitration Centre in Bissau but disagreements
between these Chambers delayed making a Center operational. In l March 2007 a joint
commission established by the two Chambers (CCIA and CACI) put in place the
beginnings of an organizational structure for a "Commercial Arbitration, Mediation and
Conciliation Center". For some time thereafter, controversy surrounded the contract of
appointment of the Center's Permanent Secretary who was to be in charge of the Center's
day-to-day operations. The initial Permanent Secretary's contract expired in May 2008
when it became necessary to find a replacement. These disputes have not been solved yet
and the Centre lays non operative.

In the latter half of 2007, a Brazilian legal consultant funded under the project carried out
initial training of fifteen potential arbitrators from the ranks of volunteer lawyers, law
faculty teachers and judges in Bissau. The consultant also provided a useful 77-page
Report assessing ADR possibilities in Guinea-Bissau, as well as helpful power point
slides on Arbitration in Guinea-Bissau. By Project completion, however, there had been
no effective follow-up in terms of further training. A preliminary public awareness
campaign was prepared in 2007 to inform the public of the existence of the Center and
how its services were going to be offered, the Centre had undertaken only 1 of these
successfully concluded by October 2010 and 2 have been reviewed but still pending
resolution.

 Diagnostic Analysis of the Judicial System. At the suggestion of the Government, IDA
agreed to the use of Project funds to carry out a thorough diagnostic analysis of the
judicial system. Completed in a preliminary version in December 2007 by a team led by a
respected Bissau lawyer, this analysis has highlighted a wide range of issues that Guinea-
Bissau must address in the short-, medium- and long-term in order to establish a legal and
judicial system which is well understood, applied and enforced objectively, predictably
and transparently. Also with Project funding, a two-day workshop was organized in mid-
March 2008 for representatives of the Supreme Court, appellate court, trial courts, and
the legal profession, as well as the Ministry of Justice to discuss the study.


Refurbishment of the Commercial Court of Bissau. At the request of the Government,
IDA funded under the Credit the refurbishing of existing government premises for
Bissau's first Commercial Court Although the 2002 Law on the Courts( Law No. 3/2002
of 20 November 2002) established a Commercial Court, no such court was then
operational. Also, by the latter half of the Project period, the Government had made clear
its intention to transfer and consolidate all commercial registry functions to this new
Court, as well to transfer the office of the notary to this same Court. The initial stages of
the civil works were completed in December 2007. Secondly, the Project-funded training



                                             46
of four GB judges in Dakar in the substantive texts of the OHADA Uniform Laws and in
commercial matters more generally was completed in August 2007. Required equipment
was provided although training of court administrative personnel has not been completed.

 Training of Judges. The Project funded a Government organized three-day program of
judicial ethics and good governance attended by judges and legal professionals in Bissau
in 2005. In addition, the Project sponsored a course in Bissau on the Rule of Law and
legal and judicial ethics in October 2006. This latter program was led by four Portuguese
judges and attracted over 100 judges and lawyers each day for 11 days of seminars and
training. Other courses which would have been helpful, such as general administration,
substantive business and procedural law, and case management, the writing of judgments
were not carried out.

Training under the subcomponent was focused on the training of four judges to become
the initial judges of GB's new Commercial Court. In August 2006, these four judges
began four months of intensive legal French language immersion in Dakar, Senegal
immediately prior to receiving general judicial, as well as commercial law, training,
including in respect of the OHADA Uniform Laws and matters of commercial procedure.

Training of Court Personnel. It was agreed in early 2008 that urgent short-term legal and
administrative training be undertaken as soon as possible in Dakar on a staggered basis
for all court clerks (greffiers) employed in the new Commercial Court. This was an
important step to make the commercial tribunal operative, unfortunately at this late stage
the resources allocated under this sub-component were exhausted and this activity could
not be completed.

Education and training programs for legal professionals, law teachers an students on
business laws and regulations

 Project-funded books were received in mid-2007. In addition, the Project funded the
preparation of two booklets; on OHADA simplified recovery procedures and execution
measures, and on OHADA secured interests.

The Project funded the cost of classes in basic French in the latter half of 2006 (21
individuals from the Bissau Law School, 13 from the GB Bar Association, 13 from GB's
Supreme Court, 10 from GB's Ministry of Justice and 3 from GB's OHADA National
Commission). Attendance was less than anticipated and the course was cut short; the
same was true of locally-based French language training at the French Cultural Center
with sessions in September and December 2007 for some 15 judges, lawyers and law
students each.

The Project financed a television program devoted to OHADA in September 2006.
Although was not possible to ascertain the extent of the viewing public nor was a survey
undertaken. Although the project unit proposed other public information campaigns,
these were never approved by the successive ministers of justice.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The original economic analysis could not be replicated because some of the assumptions
done during the preparation could not be tracked clearly, for example the "assumed"
productivity gains deriving from the reforms of the investment climate and legal reforms.
Similarly, the assumptions done with respect to the retrenched workers could not be
verified because data were not collected and could not be collected during the ICR.

For this reason the efficiency analysis focuses on those components for which it was
possible to obtain detailed data: (a) privatization, (b) EFF, (c) telecom.

(a) Privatization: The final cost of the privatization component was 6.838 million US
dollars. For this component we can clearly identified three types of benefits. First, the
fiscal revenues for the Government which, based on data available for some of the
privatized/liquidated, companies amount to close to 6 million US dollars. Second, the
privatization of these companies attracted some fresh investments and, even if data could
only be obtained for the two hotels privatized and the fishery company Afripeche, these
investments alone are in the order of 5 million US dollars. Third, before the privatization
most of these companies were fundamentally paralyzed and the revenues extremely low
if not zero. After the privatization, and the new investments, the companies restarted their
operations; unfortunately data on their revenues could not be collected.
Concluding, for the privatization component, a very conservative estimate of its benefits
can be put at around 11 million US dollars.

(b) The total cost of the EFF, both the administration costs and the value of the grants, is
equal to 2.342 million US dollars. In order to calculate the benefits of this sub-component
during the ICR mission data on sales were collected for some of the companies (data
were obtained only from 3 companies, namely Guerauto, Afripeche and Guimetal ­ with
the respect to other operating companies data could not be obtained from Ascon, SGD

Lenox and Stenaks34). Comparing pre-grant sales and post-grant sales, if we make the
assumption that the entire35 increase in sales is due to the EFF grant (which obviously
over-estimates the impact of the grant), we obtain that the net benefits of the EFF are
equal to 731 thousands US dollar. Two key reasons are behind this result. First, only few
of the companies benefiting from the EFF are currently operative. Second, the
administration costs of the EFF have been particularly high.

(c) Telecom: Overall the total cost for the component "infrastructure reform", which included
telecom sub-components among others, is 4.566 million US dollars. With respect to the
benefits we can identify four set of benefits. First, government revenues from the license
fees equal to 9 million US dollars. Second, investments done by the companies that had
obtained the licenses in the order of 30 million US dollars36. Third, the company revenues
during the entire period are equivalent to 111 million US dollars37. Fourth, consumers
benefits due to the price reduction. The latter are quantified in the following manner.
Based on the data available from WDI the price basket for mobile service in Guinea-
Bissau dropped by 50% between 2005 and 200738. Additionally based on studies for
other developing countries we assume that the share of household expenditures for
communication costs is around 3 percent (around 10 dollars per year for individuals with
34
   The lack of information on sales from these companies is negatively biasing the calculation of the
benefits from the EFF.
35
   It is impossible to correctly estimate what would have been the value of sales without the EFF, not
surprisingly the companies were unable to provide this information, nor baseline data on similar
companies, not benefiting from the EFF, were collected.
36
   These are not official figures but could be obtained during interviews with the CEOs respectively of
MTN and Guinetel. Unfortunately the CEO of Sonatel could not be interviewed which leaves some
uncertainty on the exact figures.
37
   Just in 2009 the total revenues for the three companies were equivalent to 39 million US dollars. This
implies, assuming a number of users equal to 350,000, expenditures in the order of 112 dollars per
user/year.
38
   This is certainly a lower bound in terms of phone call costs as the costs of international calls dropped by
90 percent.

average income per capita) this is equivalent, in a static model, to about 1.5 percent the
income per capita (about 5 dollars), which, for an estimated number of 300,000
consumers, is equivalent to 1.5 million US dollars per year. Only focusing on 3 years,
2007-2009, this would be equivalent to 4.5 million US dollars (nominal current values) in
terms consumer benefits.
Summing up, a rather conservative back on the envelop estimate suggest that the overall
benefits of the telecom liberalization are in the order of about 154 million US dollars.

Overall the rate of return of the project is extremely high as it is fundamentally driven by
the returns to the telecom sub-component. The EFF has a negative rate of returns, and the
privatization dose have a positive and high rate of return (see table below)

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

An audio-conference was organized on March 17, 2010 with Bissau in order to obtain
comments of the Borrower on the Draft ICR.

The participants in Bissau included: Carmen Pereira (World Bank), Filomena Miranda
(former PIU), Ema Dias (former PIU), Gilmar Danif (former PIU), Amarildo Correia
(former PIU), Fortes Injai (Ministry of Economy), Cherno Jalo (Ministry of Justice)
In Washington D.C: Leonardo Iacovone (World Bank).

The meeting generated a very rich discussion and the comments of the Borrower can be
summarized as follows.

   1. It was recognized that the ICR is well developed and clearly described the
      achievements and shortcomings of the project

   2. The project was indeed considered very ambitious but it was emphasized that it is
      important to contextualize it. In 2002, the country was in a situation where needs
      were many and the project addressed key complementary areas to support the
      development of private sector.

   3. It was recognized that the project did not satisfactorily achieve the objective of
      uplifting the private sector in Guinea-Bissau as hoped at the outset of this project.

   4. It was underscored that in a context where resources are limited it is very
      important to be strategic and proactive in terms of concentrating the limited
      resources on those sub-components that work better. This is especially important
      in ambitious projects that span across multiple sectors and components such as the
      PSRDP
