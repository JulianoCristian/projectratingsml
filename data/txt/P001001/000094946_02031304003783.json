Guinea-Bissau is to support increased investment,\n            competitiveness, and participation of the private sector in\n            economic activity. There are three project components. The\n            first component supports and/or prepares the reform of\n            telecommunications, air transport, port, water, and energy\n            sectors. The project assists in attracting private\n            investments in these sectors and in the implementation of\n            the necessary legal and regulatory reforms, and funds\n            related capacity building, especially in a multi-sector\n            regulatory agency. In addition, this component supports\n            divestiture from public enterprises, including the\n            liquidation of a bankrupt commercial bank and the\n            outsourcing of custodial public services. The project\n            finances the retrenchment cost of redundant workers. The\n            second component helps implement legal reform by modernizing\n            business laws and making fair and equitable justice more\n            readily available to individuals and private enterprises.\n            Activities include improving institutional capacity in the\n            main tribunal of Bissau, which handles most of the business\n            cases; harmonization of national laws with the Organization\n            for the Harmonization of Business Laws in Africa (OHADA);\n            and providing complementary training and technical\n            assistance to strenghten the judicial system and the legal\n            profession. The third component supports implementation, and\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2002-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
