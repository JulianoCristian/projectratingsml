assessment of seventeen public enterprises in the Republic\n            of Guinea-Bissau that are being privatized under the Private\n            Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project. It aims to\n            provide the necessary information for internal planning\n            before divestiture and for external reporting as well as\n            indicating the \"road map\" for determining the\n            environmental liabilities and audit studies for future\n            privatization candidates. The major environmental issues of\n            concern in Guinea-Bissau include deforestation, soil\n            degradation, overgrazing, and over-fishing. The\n            industrialization could become accelerated through the\n            privatization of public enterprises. This could give rise to\n            critical and most immediate problems: a) health impacts of\n            pollution derived from inadequate water supply and shortage\n            of electricity; b) poor sanitation, drainage, and solid\n            waste services; c) Poor urban and industrial waste\n            management; d) air pollution; and e) noise pollution. In\n            general, there is relatively low coverage and access to\n            basic services. Controlled landfills, incineration, and\n            resource recovery facilities are few. Hence, health and\n            safety issues, including medical monitoring and providing\n            appropriate industrial hygiene for workers, will be\n            necessary to minimize the negative impacts."}, "docdt": "2001-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
