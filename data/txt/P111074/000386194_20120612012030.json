{"cdata!": "The development objective of the\n            Integrated National Energy Strategy Technical Assistance\n            Project for Iraq is to improve the ability of the Government\n            to develop an energy strategy that is designed to increase\n            the contribution of the sector to sustainable development.\n            In response to a letter dated April 10, 2012, from the Prime\n            Minister's Advisory Commission (PMAC), this\n            restructuring aims to extend the project closing date for\n            the project from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. PMAC has\n            also requested a re-allocation of funds between project\n            categories. The Government has requested an extension of the\n            project closing date in order to a) complete the Final\n            Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES) report to the\n            highest possible standard by July 2012, b) and to allow time\n            for comprehensive consultation on the INES, and early\n            implementation of the INES. The Government has also\n            requested reallocation of remaining uncommitted funds to\n            consulting services to support dissemination of the INES\n            report and early implementation of its recommendations. The\n            project is rated satisfactory against financial management\n            and procurement management. There are no overdue audits\n            reports, safeguards problems, or other pending issues\n            related to this project. The changes do not result in a\n            change of the project activities nor require a modification\n            to the project description in the loan agreement. As of\n            today, US$ 4.93 million (71 percent of the US$ 6.9million\n            approved financing) has been disbursed and a total of US$\n            6.4 million has already been committed. The team intends to\n            formally revise the disbursement schedule at the time the\n            project closing date is extended. The PDOs remain unchanged\n            as do the results framework, and PDO and intermediate\n            results indicators. No changes to components, safeguards,\n            institutional arrangements, financing structure and\n            financial management are envisaged or requested."}, "docdt": "2012-06-06T00:00:00Z"}
