                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is now close to completion: The Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES) was approved by the Iraqi Cabinet on April 16, 2013, and will be disseminated in a
                         stakeholder event on June 12, 2013. These represent key achievements for the Project.

                         Importantly, Iraq has already taken steps to implement a number of key recommendations contained within the INES, particularly with respect to determination of oil production
                         profiles, working towards capture and processing of flared gas, overall improvement of its gas sector operations, and infrastructure development in the power sector. The Prime

                         Minister's Advisory Commission (PMAC) and the INES Steering Committee have therefore worked effectively within Government to ensure that the INES is more than a study, but will
                         represent the first step in an ongoing strategic process that seeks to maximize the energy sector’s contribution to Iraq’s socio-economic development.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government of Iraq will need to continue analysis of strategic decisions and investments over time, with appropriate adjustment of these as conditions change. This will require
                         that Iraqi staff are trained in the Integrated Economic Model (IEM) which was developed for the study, and through which most of the INES analysis was undertaken. PMAC will
                         complete training of key Ministry of Electricity and Ministry of Oil staff in the IEM prior to the project close of June 30, 2013.
