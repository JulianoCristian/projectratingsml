                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the INESTA Project is now well underway. The Consultant (Booz and Co.), that is supporting the Government in its development of Iraq's Integrated National
                         Energy Strategy (INES), submitted its First Interim Report on May 5th, 2011. The submission of this report marks the on-schedule completion of the base-lining phase of the Project.
                         The purpose of this First Interim Report is to describe the current challenges of the energy sector in Iraq and articulate the strategic options which will be analyzed during the
                         Formulation phase.

                         The Iraq Project Steering Committee (PSC), supported by the Bank team, met with the Consultant on April 7 - 8 to review a draft of the First Interim Report. The First Interim Report
                         was also distributed to all stakeholder Ministries, and presented to the Deputy Prime Minister for Energy. The comments of the PSC, Ministries and the Bank have now been

                         addressed by the Consultant in the First Interim Report.

                         The PSC continued its strong management of the Project during the period since the last ISR. The PSC continues to build ownership in the INES within stakeholder Ministries, and
                         supported by the Bank team has closely monitored the performance of the Contractor. The Contractor's performance has also improved - comments provided by both the
                         Government and the WB during the review of the Inception Report, and other interim meetings, have been addressed, and the quality of the First Interim Report is good.

                         The Consultant is now commencing work on the Formulation Stage of the Project, and will maintain close coordination with the PSC in order to ensure that acceptable strategies are
                         developed. The Bank team will continue to support the PSC through this next critical stage of the Project.
