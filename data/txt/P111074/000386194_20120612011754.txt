                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      In response to a letter dated April 10, 2012, from the Prime Minister’s Advisory
Commission (PMAC), this restructuring aims to extend the Project Closing Date for Iraq
Integrated National Energy Strategy Technical Assistance (TF095802, P111074,
P121980AF) from June 30, 2012 until June 30, 2013. PMAC has also requested a re-
allocation of funds between project categories.

2.      The objective of the Project is to improve the ability of the Government to
develop an energy strategy that is designed to increase the contribution of the sector to
sustainable development. Total funding for the Project is $8.5M. The Bank has
contributed $6.9M in funding from the Iraq Trust Fund, and the Government has
contributed $1.6M in co-financing.

3.      The Government has requested an extension of the Project Closing Date in order
to a) complete the Final Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES) Report to the highest
possible standard by July 2012, b) and to allow time for comprehensive consultation on
the INES, and early implementation of the INES. The Government has also requested
reallocation of remaining uncommitted funds to consulting services to support
dissemination of the INES report and early implementation of its recommendations.


B. PROJECT STATUS

4.      The INESTA Project has made significant progress, and a Final INES Report
containing critical strategic recommendations for the development of Iraq’s energy sector
is now in the final stages of completion. The Iraq Project Steering Committee (PSC)
supported by the Bank team met with the Consultant (Booz and Co.) in March 2012 and
reviewed the Final Report. The Final Report had already been distributed to all
stakeholder Ministries and independent comments received from each of these Ministries.
The Final Report is now of a high quality, and the only significant comment made by the
March review meeting was that the report required an extended Executive Summary in
order to be complete. The Consultant is now finalizing the Executive Summary for Final
INES Report, and it is expected that the full report will be available for consultation in
early July 2012. The PMAC will then undertake internal consultation with Government
stakeholders, including Cabinet and the Prime Minister’s Office (for endorsement of the
INES), and with relevant Ministries and Parliament. It is envisaged that this consultation
will require 3-4 months. Endorsement of the INES by Cabinet will be followed by
further dissemination of the report to Ministerial stakeholders and other stakeholders
including Parliament; CSOs; academia; the international community; and the media, over
a period of several months.

6.     The project became effective on January 11, 2010, and the original Closing Date
was June 30, 2012. This is the first request for extension of the project by 12 months.

                                            4
7.      The Project is rated Satisfactory against financial management and procurement
management. There are no overdue audits reports, safeguards problems, or other pending
issues related to this project. The proposed changes do not result in a change of the
Project activities nor require a modification to the Project description in the Loan
Agreement. As of today, US$ 4.93 million (71% of the US$ 6.9million approved
financing) has been disbursed and a total of US$ 6.4 million has already been committed.
The team intends to formally revise the disbursement schedule at the time the Project
Closing Date is extended.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

8.     Project Closing Date: The Project Closing Date will be extended from June 30,
2012 until June 30, 2013 to allow the Government sufficient time to complete the Final
INES Report and undertake comprehensive internal consultation and then wider
dissemination of the Report

9.      Re-allocation of remaining uncommitted funds: Almost $500k of funding
remains available to the Project (for Operating and Miscellaneous Expenses). During the
last supervision mission, in March 2012, the PMAC requested that this funding be
utilized for additional consulting services to support the dissemination of the final report,
and to support early implementation of its recommendations. The proposed reallocation
of this funding (to Consulting Services) will allow the Government of Iraq to use the
funding for these purposes. Proceeds for Iraq, P111074 will therefore be reallocated as
follow:

                                Original
                                Amount of the
                                Financing
                                Allocated
                                (Expressed in     Proposed Revised       Disbursed as of
Category of Expediture          USD)              Reallocations (USD)    May 2012 (USD)

1 – Consultants’ Services
including audit and Training          6,400,000              6,830,000           4,930,000
2- Operating Costs                      250,000                 70,000                   0
3- Unallocated                          250,000                      0                   0
Total                                 6,900,000              6,900,000

10.   Project Development Objectives: The PDOs remain unchanged as do the results
framework, and PDO and intermediate results indicators.

11.    Disbursement arrangements and Procurement: the Borrower has prepared new
disbursement and procurement plans acceptable to the Bank, which will allow it to
complete the project by June 30, 2013, the proposed new Project Closing Date.

12.    Implementation schedule: The implementation schedule will be delayed to allow
a) completion of the Final INES Report to the highest possible standard by July 2012, and

                                             5
b) rigorous consultation and dissemination of the Final INES Report over a period of up
to 6 months from July 2012. Full implementation will be completed within the proposed
new Project Closing Date

13.    No changes to Components, Safeguards, Institutional Arrangements, Financing
Structure and Financial Management are envisaged or requested.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

14.     The above changes do not result in a change of impact (from the original
Appraisal Summary of the Project Paper) in any of the Economic and Financial analyses,
Technical, Social, Environment, Exceptions to Bank policy and Risks components of the
Project.

15.     Given that the project is highly likely to meet its development objectives if the
Project Closing Date is extended, the team recommends approval of this request for the
extension of the Project Closing Date, to June 30, 2013, and reallocation of funds as
requested by the Government of Iraq.
