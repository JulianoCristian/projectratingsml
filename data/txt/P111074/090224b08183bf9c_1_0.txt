                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The significant work in support of Iraq’s Integrated National Energy Strategy (INES) is almost complete. The Consultant that is supporting the development of the INES, Booz & Co.,
                         has now provided the Prime Minister's Advisory Commission (PMAC) with a Final INES Report with Appendices. PMAC has distributed this report through the Project Steering
                         Committee (PSC) to the various stakeholder ministries.

                         The INES is being translated into Arabic, and PMAC will now focus on a rigorous process of internal consultation around the INES prior to disseminating the Final Report more widely.
