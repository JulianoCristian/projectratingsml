development\n            outcome was substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory\n            and borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned includes: the Bank's experience of\n            implementing projects in post-conflict countries has\n            highlighted the importance of simple and flexible project\n            design. The project was designed around a single contract,\n            with utilization of local consultants where possible and\n            reliance on remote communications and coordination as far as\n            is practical. The project was carefully designed so that\n            policy issues being discussed with the Government at the\n            commencement of engagement will be explored fully. As a\n            result of the project's design, which called for a\n            strategy that not only maximized energy sector revenues, but\n            that was also assessed according to the levels of economic\n            diversification, jobs growth, energy security, and\n            environmental sustainability that it brought, Iraq\n            government policy now considers all of these elements in\n            addressing energy sector development. As a criterion for\n            Bank support, strong interest and political commitment\n            increase client's ownership and quality of delivery.\n            Pursue a strategic process rather than a strategic document\n            to establish the basis for strong implementation. The\n            project consultant was based in Beirut and Dubai/U.A.E, and\n            had strong Arabic speaking expertise. The consultant's\n            geographical vicinity to Iraq is an advantage for a better\n            understanding of local context and domestic issues in order\n            to provide realistic solutions. Design, implementation and\n            supervision in a conflict environment are costly. The\n            importance of strong coordination across multiple ministries\n            and subsectors is critical to achieve targets and ensure\n            sustainability of implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-12-26T00:00:00Z"}
