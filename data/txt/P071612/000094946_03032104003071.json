infected, or affected by the epidemic. Through a\n            multi-sectoral approach, the project objectives will support\n            the implementation of Niger's Strategic Framework for\n            the Fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS for the period 2002-2007.\n            The development objective of both the National Program, and\n            this operation are to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS, mitigate\n            the adverse impacts of the disease, and, strengthen capacity\n            to formulate, manage, implement, monitor and evaluate a\n            cost-effective HIV/AIDS program, attained through a\n            multi-sectoral approach, drawing on comparative advantages,\n            and partnerships among both public, and private entities.\n            Within its components, the project will support strategic\n            orientations to scale up, expand, and improve prevention\n            activities, through the treatment, and care of local\n            populations, and activities to mitigate the impoverishment\n            effects of the epidemic, as well as strengthen the national\n            capacity to implement the multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS program.\n            To this end, prevention, care, and mitigation activities\n            will be financed through line Ministries, to attain a strong\n            health system (that includes tuberculosis prevention, and\n            care), through the provision of education, training, and\n            improved access to treatment, intensified by the civil\n            society response, and community-based initiatives. Capacity\n            building and further training activities for the public\n            sector, and civil society agencies should foster effective\n            management of preventive, and treatment activities. Project\n            management activities will support technical assistance,\n            program coordination, and administration, and, facilitate\n            the multi-country AIDS program's strategic management."}, "docdt": "2003-03-18T00:00:00Z"}
