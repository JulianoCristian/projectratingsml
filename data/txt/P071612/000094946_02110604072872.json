The two types of waste health care facilities\n            would produce are solid waste such as that produced by\n            health care providers diagnosing and treating patients as\n            well as ordinary garbage, and liquid waste derived from\n            blood and toxic/hazardous chemicals, along with laboratory\n            research and pharmaceutical waste products, and waste\n            products resulting from surgery, for example, anatomical\n            waste, disinfectants, mercury compounds, x-ray films,\n            syringes, tubes, other instruments, and used bandages. Solid\n            waste comprises the main category of wastes that poses the\n            risk of transmission of Hepatitis B or C and/or HIV/AIDS,\n            especially through sharps, syringes, and other cutting\n            instruments, and is the main focus of this assessment. The\n            report also identifies the risk of air pollution due to the\n            release of hydrochloric acid, and silver and sulfuric oxides\n            as well as carcinogenic particle emissions. Incinerating\n            plastic also raises the risk of toxic gas release. Surface\n            and underground water could be polluted by runoff from these\n            biomedical wastes. Measures to mitigate the risk of\n            contamination include: Building the institutional capacity\n            of hospitals, health centers, and health agencies; equipping\n            health facilities and personnel involved in waste disposal\n            with protective gear (masks and gowns) and equipment;\n            providing health facilities with suitable collection bins\n            for storing biomedical waste; providing disinfectant\n            (bleach) to sterilize needles and \"sharps\"\n            (instruments); and providing health facilities with mobile\n            equipment (carts and wheelbarrows) to aid in removing waste;\n            and building incinerators. Waste management activities will\n            involve the private sector and members of civil society.\n            Efforts will be made to disseminate information through the\n            media, and to train personnel and others exposed to\n            infectious diseases."}, "docdt": "2001-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
