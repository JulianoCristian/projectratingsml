Some lessons learned included: fighting and\n            preventing HIV/AIDS is fundamental to the economic and\n            social development of a country. Therefore, regardless of\n            income level, governments should not rely only on donor\n            resources which are characterized by unpredictability and\n            uncertainty. It is necessary to clarify the institutional\n            setting at the design stage to avoid dual oversight and to\n            make sure that only one structure is accountable for project\n            execution. Technical assistance for project execution and\n            monitoring and evaluation (M&E) should be embedded in\n            this type of project, especially when national capacities\n            are known to be weak. The technical assistance package\n            should be flexible enough so that it can be redeployed to\n            help address emerging challenges, as the implementation\n            unfolds. For instance, technical assistance for M&E is\n            essential to fine tune results framework, collect data,\n            compare them and use them to better inform policies and\n            strategies. The success of complex, multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS\n            projects in very low capacity environments is likely to be\n            due to the commitment and competence of one or a few\n            exceptional individuals. Since such individuals are\n            typically few and far between, it makes such projects very\n            risky. Furthermore, since the Bank has no mechanism to\n            ensure that such individuals are found and hired, it is\n            difficult to see how appropriate mitigation measures can be developed."}, "docdt": "2009-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
