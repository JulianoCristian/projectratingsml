I.A.2. Project Objectives:
This project is being prepared in the context of the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program
(MAP II) for Africa, approved by the Board of Executive Directors on February 7, 2002 in the
amount of US$500 million equivalent, whose overall development objective is to increase
dramatically access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support programs, with
emphasis on vulnerable groups (such as youth, women of childbearing age and other groups at
high risk). The overarching objective of this country operation is to support the Government of
Niger in the implementation of its Strategic Framework for the Fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS
for the period 2002-2006, adopted in May 7, 2002. The specific objectives of this operation are
thus those articulated in Government's Strategic Framework: (a) to scale up, expand and
improve prevention activities in an effort to lower the risks of transmission; (b) to mitigate the
negative impact of the disease through improvements to the availability and quality of services
for people living with HIV/AIDS and affected family members and communities,
encompassing care, treatment, counseling, and social protection; and (c) to strengthen capacity
in Niger to formulate, manage, implement, monitor and evaluate a viable, cost-effective
HIV/AIDS program that would be multisectoral in its approach and that would draw on the
comparative advantages and partnerships of a multiplicity of actors.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Strategic Orientations. The project will support Niger in its efforts to operationalize and

ISDS
implement the four strategic orientations of its recently adopted Strategic Framework for the
fight against HIV/AIDS: (a) the scaling up, expansion and improvement of prevention activities
in an effort to lower the risks of transmission; (b) the scaling up of the treatment and care of
PLWHA; (c) the scaling up of activities to mitigate the impoverishing effects of HIV/AIDS on
households and communities; and (d) the strengthening of national capacity to formulate,
manage, implement, monitor and evaluate a viable, cost-effective, multisectoral HIV/AIDS
program. The main elements of each of these strategic orientations are described immediately
below, followed immediately by a presentation of the project components and how they would
support the articulation and implementation of multiple action plans conceived along the lines of
these orientations.
* Prevention. Highest priority is accorded to prevention activities as these are recognized as
being the most urgent as well as the most cost-effective interventions for Niger, given the
epidemiology of the pandemic (relatively low levels of prevalence, and concentration of
prevalence in particular populations), as well as Niger's financial constraints. Under the
prevention rubrique, the critical interventions envisaged by Niger include efforts to create and
intensify understanding and commitment on the part of high-level government officials, opinion
leaders and decision-makers, and to create an overall enabling environment, including an
improved legal framework, for arresting the spread of HIV/AIDS. Targetted interventions in
favor of enhanced prevention include: communications for behavior change, with messages
especially tailored to reach effectively the various at-risk groups; the expansion and promotion of
voluntary counseling and testing services; the regular supply and promotion of condoms;
improved safety in the work place/protective material/protocols and training for health workers;
reduction of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT); intensification/improvement of screening
and early treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
* Treatment and Care. The National Strategy recognizes that an effective treatment and care
program can contribute to intensified and more effective prevention. Under this strategic
orientation, efforts are envisaged to improve and fully integrate into all levels of the existing
health service delivery system viable, quality care and counseling for STIs, HIV/AIDS. Palliative
care of victims of HIV/AIDS (eg. treatment of opportunistic infections) is also envisaged to be
extended through ambulatory care. A strategy for voluntary and confidential testing and
counseling and for improving access to antiretroviral drug therapy would also be developed.
Care and counseling would be integrated into all programs and services through the
adoption/promotion of the syndromic approach in the care and counseling of people living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and the provision of services to prevent and treat opportunistic infections
would also be developed and expanded. Revision of the basic training curricula in schools of
public health and in the faculty of medicine would underpin and sustain such improvements in
treatment and care. In recognition of the important role of traditional practitioners, this strategy
also envisages their full implication in the fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS.
* Mitigation. In an effort to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS on PLWHA and their affected
families and communities, this strategic orientation envisages efforts to offer personalized,
community-based counseling services to those afflicted and affected. Outreach is envisaged to
extend right into the household, encompassing both care and treatment, as well as
material/monetary support and spiritual support. Promotion of the fuller implication of the



3
ISDS
non-governmental sector in the provision of socio-economic support will be another important
element of this strategic orientation. Government also intends to build the capacity of civil
society to take on a lead role in the care of PLWHA, and of orphans, widows and other family
members affected by HIV/AIDS. Efforts will also be undertaken to reduce the vulnerability of
individuals, families and communities affected by the disease, including: the protection of
workers' rights and the protection from discrimination of those afflicted or affected; and the
integration of HIV/AIDS issues and measures into all sector development programs.
* Capacity Building for Program Management and Implementation. Under this strategic
orientation, national capacity will be built for effective program management, monitoring and
evaluation and implementation. This would include the finetuning and strengthening of
institutions and organizations of multiple actors contributing to program management and
implementation, as well as the mobilization of new national partners to expand and deepen
Niger's overall capacity to respond to the challenge. An emphasis is placed on the importance of
understanding and monitoring the dynamics of the disease and its spread, as well as the
underlying determinants of the spread of the disease and the effectiveness/impact of program
interventions in this light. Strengthening of the surveillance of STIs/HIV/AIDS and of
underlying behaviors (second generation surveillance) and the monitoring of innovative activities
are thus given great importance.
Project components. Support to the implementation of these strategic orientations will be
delivered through the following three project components: (a) Public Sector Responses for
Prevention, Care and Mitigation; (b) Civil Society Response and Community-Based Initiatives
for Prevention, Care and Mitigation; and (c) Capacity Building. A fourth component, Project
Coordination and Management, will support the costs of efficient management and utilization of
IDA grant resources.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Project will be nationwide in its coverage. Pilot activities will focus on Niamey (urban) and Say
(peri-urban)
B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The Project has been classified as "B" due to the need for addressing the potential impacts of
medical waste on the population and the environment.
