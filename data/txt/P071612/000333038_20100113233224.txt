1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      Niger--one of the poorest countries in the world--saw its first human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) victim in early 1987. By 2000, the World Health
Organization (WHO) estimated that 165,000 adults and children out of a population of
about 10 million were infected with the HIV virus, with an estimated cumulative number
of 5600 reported cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The lack of a
reliable surveillance data, however, would suggest that the actual number was higher.
The first national prevalence survey, carried out in 2002 and financed by an ongoing
International Development Association (IDA) health operation, put the HIV prevalence at
0.87 percent, with large variation by occupation groups, urban/rural residence,
geographic region, gender (with women having 1.85 times higher prevalence than men),
and age-group. High-risk groups included commercial sex workers who, with a
prevalence rate of 25.4%, were the most infected, followed by military personnel, miners,
prisoners, drivers, and teachers with prevalence rates ranging from 3.8% to 1.4%. Put
differently, Niger had a so-called concentrated HIV/AIDS epidemic.

2.      Despite the relatively low overall prevalence, a number of risk factors put the
country at high risk for a rapid spread of the disease: high rates of poverty and migration,
high-risk jobs (e.g., sex work, mining, and trucking); high rates of malnutrition and poor
health (and education) indicators, high rates of sexually transmitted diseases (STIs);
"risky" cultural and religious norms (e.g., widespread scarring, early marriage, and
fundamental religious belief opposing the use of condoms); and an ineffective
government response to the epidemic.

3.      HIV/AIDS control activities were severely constrained by: a lack of national
policy and guidelines on the management of HIV/AIDS patients and on organization of
AIDS-related laboratory services; difficulties on the part of health staff in informing
patients about their HIV positive status; unreliable supply of drugs needed to treat
opportunistic infections; limited financial and geographic accessibility of antiretroviral
(ARV) drugs; minimal capacity to provide ARV therapy services; and absence of
collaboration between modern and traditional practitioners.

4.       In response to the past poor performance in preventing the spread of the HIV
virus, the Government of Niger (GoN), with support from the World Bank, United
Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and other partners, developed a
National Strategic Framework for the Fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS (hereinafter referred
to as the National Strategic Framework) covering the period 2002-2006. This framework,
developed through a participatory and analytical process, was articulated around the
themes recommended by the second Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (MAP
II): a) Scaling up of prevention services; b) scaling up of treatment and care activities; c)
scaling up mitigation of the impact of HIV/AIDS on households and communities; and d)
building national capacity for strategic management and implementation of a



                                             1
multisectoral program. The Niger Multisectoral STI/HIV/AIDS Support Project
(hereinafter the Project) was designed to support the implementation of this framework.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
5.      The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) lists the development objectives of both
the National Program and this operation as: (a) to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in the
general population; (b) to mitigate the negative impact of HIV/AIDS on individuals and
communities; and (c) to strengthen the country's capacity to formulate, manage,
implement, monitor, and evaluate a viable cost-effective HIV/AIDS Program. However,
Schedule 2 of the Legal Grant Agreement (Grant No. H031 NIR) states that "the
objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient to implement its STI/HIV/AIDS
Strategic National Framework, in order to slow the spread, and mitigate the impact, of the
STI/HIV/AIDS epidemic, through a multisectoral approach by: (i) the extension to youth,
women of childbearing age and other vulnerable groups nationwide of access to
STI/HIV/AIDS prevention, care, mitigation services and treatment; and (ii) strengthening
of the capacity of public, private and community institutions to design, carry out and
monitor Work Programs and Subprojects." Since the Bank relied on the wording in the
PAD in its supervision efforts, the ICR does the same.

6.      During negotiations the GoN and the Bank agreed that, while the ultimate
indicator of the fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS was HIV and STI prevalence, the progress
toward this goal would be monitored using set of indicators that included process/input,
output, and impact indicators. The key outcome and impact indicators included:

1. By project closing date (June 30, 2008), increase the % of men aged 15-49 who have
   utilized a condom during their most recent sexual encounter outside of marriage from
   14% to 30%
2. By project closing date, increase the % of women aged 15-24 years who have utilized
   a condom during their most recent sexual encounter outside marriage from <2% to
   20%.
3. By project closing date, HIV prevalence rates among aged 15-49 years would remain
   stable at 0.87%.
4. By project closing date, HIV prevalence rates among high-risk groups would remain
   stable for young girls (15-19 years) in rural areas at 0.2%; for young boys (15-19
   years) in urban areas at 0.4%; for military/uniformed personnel at 3.8%; for teachers
   at 1.4%; for drivers at 1.7%; for prisoners at 2.8%; for sex workers 25.4%; for
   migrant workers at 4.4%; and for miners (no data).
5. By project closing date, syphilis prevalence rates among high risk groups would be
   reduced by 30% for young girls and boys (15-19 years) and migrant workers,
   respectively; by 50% for military/other uniformed personnel and drivers/prisoners/sex
   workers, respectively; and by 20% for teachers and miners, respectively.

7.      While there were differences between the wording of the PDOs in the PAD and
the Legal Grant Agreement (LGA), the key M&E indicators were identical in both
documents. Annex 1 of the PAD also included a number of additional outcome and
output indicators that were not included in the LGA.
                                            2
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
8.      The project was restructured on June 29, 2007, as part of the umbrella
restructuring of eight MAP projects. The revised development objectives listed in
Umbrella Restructuring and Amendment of the Financing Agreement for the Projects
under the Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program for Africa (Report No. 39906-AFR, May
2007) for Niger were actually the original PDOs listed in the LGA, which is obviously a
mistake. The text referring to revised PDOs in the Amended LGA, dated July 31, 2007,
will therefore be taken as the correct one. According to this text "The [revised] objective
of the Project is to contribute to the improvement of a) coverage and utilization of HIV
prevention, care, treatment and mitigation services; and b) knowledge of the general
population in the area of STI/HIV/AIDS."

9.     Similarly, because the umbrella restructuring document contained only a general
"Africa Region Scorecard" without project/country-specific indicators, the "Performance
Monitoring Indicators" contained in Schedule 5 of Annex 3 to the Amended LGA are
presented in Table 1 below. Baseline information has been added for those indicators for
which it was missing in the Amended LGA.

10.     Among the major reasons for the restructuring listed in the umbrella restructuring
document, the following applied to the Niger project: i) Using HIV prevalence as the
PDO and a performance indicator was unrealistic, and ii) slow implementation of MAP
projects had been principally due to weak or inefficient institutional arrangements and
project design. In addition, many of the lessons from IEG and QAG reviews of MAP
projects also pertained to the Niger project including: The need for a) stronger and
functional M&E systems; b) improved coordination for a more prioritized, multisectoral,
and mainstreamed response to HIV/AIDS; c) involvement of health ministries for a
successful response to the epidemic; d) clearer roles and responsibilities of the various
coordinating and implementing agencies.

11.     In addition, along with project restructuring of the PDOs and indicators as part of
the umbrella restructuring, the LGA was amended to a) incorporate necessary changes in
the implementation arrangement for implementation efficiency; ii) review and adjust
financing parameters of the project (to 100% financing of all project activities); iii)
reallocate project funds across components; iv) adopt simplified disbursement rules; v)

                                                       4
adopt revised procurement rules; and vi) extend the project closing date by one year (to
June 30, 2009).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries, original and revised
12.      The proposed operation was expected to benefit numerous groups. Public sector
employees and their families as well as the population at large would benefit directly
from avoidance of HIV infection and AIDS, and from better access to care, support, and
mitigation activities supported by the program. Lower-income groups would benefit from
community-based assistance to households taking care of AIDS patients and orphans.
Communities would be better able to plan and manage their own response to the
epidemic. Persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) would benefit from reduced stigma
and improvements in their human rights, from improved care at home, in their
communities and in health centers and hospitals, and, as a consequence, from prolonged
and healthier lives. Women and youth would benefit disproportionately from targeted
interventions to improve their awareness of the disease and empower them to protect
themselves. Commercial sex workers, intravenous drug users, and people in correctional
institutions would similarly be able to better protect themselves, and benefit from reduced
stigma and improved human rights. The public sector and NGOs would benefit from the
Project's capacity building efforts and increase their ability to develop and implement
HIV/AIDS control policies, plans, and programs.

13.     The Project would reduce new infections, especially among young people, and
therefore have an impact on future suffering and premature deaths. And, in the long run,
the containment of HIV/AIDS incidence would reduce the future cost of care, treatment,
mitigation and orphan care, thereby allowing governments to allocate the resulting
budgetary savings to other priorities. Both the liberated funds and larger labor force made
possible by the fall in AIDS-related deaths would increase total output. Because of these
economic benefits, the prevention, treatment, and care of HIV/AIDS in African countries
constitute a highly productive investment.

14.     In the restructured project, the targeted beneficiaries were only implicitly defined,
but, to a large extent, they remained the same (i.e., the general population, including
high-risk groups, HIV positive persons and AIDS victims, AIDS orphans, and
unborn/newborn children), as did the benefit(s) they were expected to receive. With the
deletion in the Amendment of the LGA of the PDO related to capacity building, the
public sector and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were no longer considered
primary target beneficiaries, although the project continued to support capacity building
activities for these sectors, and the revised performance indicators included some related
to these groups, suggesting that they remained among the project's target groups and
were expected to receive the same types of benefits as originally envisioned.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)
15.     Component 1 - Public Sector Responses for Prevention, Care, and
Mitigation: This component financed work plans of line ministries and other public
sector agencies in line with their roles and comparative advantages. Several ministries
had prepared work plans and budgets prior to the effectiveness of the project and received
                                               5
support under the project in its first year. Work plans aimed at the
strengthening/development of a more proactive engagement among civil servants to fight
against HIV/AIDS; changing risky behavior; improving the environment for
collaboration and a multisectoral approach; the development and delivery of essential
HIV/AIDS information and services. The component was divided into two
subcomponents, distinguishing the health sector from the rest of the public sector.

16.     (a) Health Sector Response: This subcomponent recognized the importance of
the Ministry of Health in the care for, and treatment of, HIV/AIDS and opportunistic
infections as well as in its pivotal role in many preventive activities, supporting the
implementation of the MOH's work plan related to its contribution to the fight against
HIV/AIDS, including activities intended to scale up the national sentinel surveillance
system, to establish standards of care, voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) protocols,
to implement VCT and follow-up activities, and syndromic treatment (care based on
group of symptoms as opposed to specific, identified pathologies) of STIs.

17.     This subcomponent would also support the tuberculosis (TB) program, scale up
the national blood screening and supply program; as well as strengthen the basic
reproductive health and referral services for dealing with HIV/AIDS, STIs, and other
opportunistic infections. Moreover, it would scale up activities for HIV vulnerable groups
in collaboration with partners; technical support and supervision of community-based
care; services to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), including counseling on
breastfeeding, family planning and care for HIV positive pregnant women and children.
Finally, it would finance health-related research and surveys to enhance the health sector
response to the HIV epidemic and provide support to the implementation of a medical
waste plan.

18.     (b) Non-Health Public Sector Response. Public service agencies other than
Ministry of Health are important instruments for carrying out a wide range of preventive
and mitigation activities, aimed both at the staff of these entities, as well as their clients.
The Project would support three principal activities: (i) provision to public sector staff
and their families of HIV/AIDS and STI education, training, condoms, improved access
to treatment and other support; (ii) enhancement of the agencies' capacity to provide
clients and audiences with the means to provide effective prevention and ways to access
health care; and (iii) sector planning to prepare for and mitigate, the impact of AIDS on
the sector. These agencies would also have access to supplemental support through the
capacity building component.

19.     Component 2 - Civil Society Response and Community-Based Initiatives for
Prevention, Care, and Mitigation: Under this component, the project would support the
intensification of prevention, care and social support to meet the needs expressed by local
level communities and groups. It would ensure the continuity and expansion of successful
HIV/AIDS mitigation activities adapted to local conditions and managed by grassroots
organizations and communities. This component would also promote and encourage
HIV/AIDS initiatives of private sector enterprises aimed at developing and implementing
prevention, care and support strategies designed for their employees and their families.

                                               6
20.     The management of the component (both technical coordination and financial
management) would be contracted out to one or a few well established implementation
agencies, already located and working in all of Niger's regions. Funds would be
channeled directly through grants to associations, religious organizations, and private
enterprises, NGOs, and community-based organizations to cover a wide range of
activities, including: (i) prevention and sensitization activities targeted at communities, as
well as specific groups at high risk and aimed at building awareness, reducing the stigma
associated with HIV/AIDS, and the adoption of safer behavior (community-based IEC,
promotion of the use of condoms at the community level); (ii) provision of home and
community-based care for AIDS patients; and (iii) social support to PLWHA, orphaned
children, and households affected by HIV/AIDS, through income generation activities
and support to local caregivers.

21.      Component 3 - Capacity Building: This component would support HIV/AIDS-
related capacity building for the various implementers of the project. It would support
training and other capacity-building activities necessary for the public sector and civil
society agencies to effectively and efficiently implement HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
support activities. This component would provide support to strengthen administrative,
financial management, and technical capacities of civil society organizations.
Decentralized levels of government and line ministries and other public sector agencies
would also be able to obtain support under this component to specifically address their
capacity building needs. Similarly, the support for the newly established coordination and
facilitation institutional framework--the CISLS and associated regional and local
coordination committees as well as the sectoral focal points--would also receive capacity
building support under this component. The needed technical assistance (TA) to
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) progress on project implementation and achievement
of the PDOs would also be provided under this component, as would TA to refine and
implement the national communications strategy.

22.     Component 4 - Project Coordination and Facilitation: The Inter-Sectoral
Program Coordination Unit (CISLS) was set up to facilitate and coordinate project
execution, while the actual implementation of project activities would be the
responsibility of line ministries, of the public sector agencies, civil society organizations,
and decentralized levels of Government and communities. The CISLS would therefore be
responsible for overall Program administration, coordination and facilitation, and
strategic management, and for the project meeting all of the Bank's exigencies. To
address capacity weaknesses identified during appraisal, this component would provide
support for the recruitment of additional staff with particular skills not adequately
available in the public sector, including an internal controller, a procurement specialist,
and a chief accountant. The project would also finance eight accountant administrators
for the eight regional coordination offices as well as technical assistance to advise and
support the CISLS on the launch of the program and in its implementation during the first
year of operation. Finally, the outsourcing of the management of the Civil Society
component would be funded under this component.



                                              7
1.6 Revised Components
None of the components were revised in the restructuring of the project.

1.7 Other significant changes
23.    Although the original project design was clearly intended to target high-risk
groups and high-risk geographic areas, implementation problems and capacity
weaknesses prevented this from actually taking place. Instead project activities focused
more on IEC, sensitization, and VCT in the general population, and ARV therapy for
PLWHAs. This shortcoming, identified during the mid-term review (MTR), was rectified
once the new project Coordinator came on board in October 2007.

24.    The restructuring made a number of important changes that facilitated subsequent
implementation processes (see Section 1.3), including a (second) reallocation of funds in
recognition of lower than anticipated absorptive capacity among NGOs, a change in
financing parameters, and application of new and simplified procurement rules.

25.     In addition, a Joint UNAIDS/World Bank Technical Support Team (TST),
organized by ACT Africa and fielded in August 2007 shortly after the restructuring
resulted in a number of extremely important changes related to the management and
coordination of the project. In particular, the CISLS Coordinator was replaced with
someone whose management style was more cooperative and less autocratic, and the
CISLS was moved from the Office of the Primary Minister to the Cabinet of the
President to improve government ownership. Furthermore, the roles and responsibilities
of the [HIV/AIDS] Advisor to the President were clarified to avoid any competition with
the new Project Coordinator. Collectively, these changes addressed the main bottlenecks
that had kept the project from progressing at a satisfactory rate up to that point. The
restructuring also included a (second) reallocation of funds in recognition of lower than
anticipated absorptive capacity among NGOs.

26.     Separate from these project-related events, a significant event took place in
September 2004, when the Global Fund to Fight Tuberculosis, AIDS, and Malaria
(GFTAM) as part of its Round 3 activities to fight HIV/AIDS donated a US$10.5 million
grant to Niger. The project, also managed and coordinated by the CISLS, provided
additional support to implement the National Framework and therefore complemented the
activities financed under the Project. The GFTAM support continued with an US$14.5
million grant through Round 7, which began on July 1, 2008, and which has disbursed
approximately US$ 9 million as of December, 2009. While originally there was a
separate structure within the CISLS, management as well as M&E of the GFTAM funds
and those of the Project were completely integrated at the close of the Project. The
GFTAM funds is currently the main donor in the fight against HIV/AIDS in Niger, but
the remaining funds from Round 7 are clearly insufficient to meet Niger's needs.

27.     The presence of the GFTAM whose activities to some extent overlap with those
of this Project complicates the ability of this ICR to attribute the observed outcomes to
the Project. However, since the overlap is only partial and the Bank's annual
contributions have on average been twice the size of the GFTAM's (US$5 vs. US$2.5), it
would seem safe to attribute most of the observed results to the Project.
                                            8
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
28.     Unlike many Bank teams preparing MAP projects at that time, this team took its
time (two years) to ensure thorough preparation process. A (US$0.63 million) Japanese
PHRD grant and a project preparation facility of (US$0.57 million), and the then on-
going health operation financed the completion of a number of important studies and
assessments, including a baseline prevalence survey, a technical assessment of the Niger
National Framework for Fighting HIV/AIDS, an institutional capacity assessment, a
comprehensive beneficiary assessment, and a detailed evaluation of the financial
management and control capacity of both the public and non-public sectors, which were
to be executing agencies under the project. The preparation team also travelled
extensively throughout Niger to meet with stakeholders and better understand capacity
weaknesses outside Niamey. Collectively, these efforts provided information that was
used to inform the project design, resulting in better targeting of the planned beneficiaries,
project activities, as well as plans for how to address fiduciary shortcomings through
project effectiveness conditions, covenants, and capacity building plans incorporated into
the project's implementation plans.

29.     The preparatory funds also allowed a number of ministries, including the Ministry
of Education, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Social Development, and Ministry of
Defense, to advance the preparation of their HIV/AIDS Action Plans, thereby increasing
their readiness to implement the project. The project's extensive consultative and
participatory process ensured wide ownership of the National Framework and the MAP
during preparation. A strong request from community organizations for the inclusion of
ARV therapy for PLWHA resulted in its inclusion under Component 1(a).

30.     Lessons learned from earlier MAP project experiences (e.g., focus on outcomes,
involve stakeholders) were considered and incorporated in project design, as relevant.
Much emphasis was also place on past and on-going operational experiences in Niger, in
particular those related to previous HNP operations, rural development, as well as
social/community-driven development (see Annex 13 of the PAD). Great care was taken
to ensure synergies between the MAP and other on-going and future Bank operations,
including the Community Assistance Program. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER)
informed the entire process and complemented the Bank team for the thoroughness with
which the project was being prepared.

31.     In short, the Bank team did everything it could to ensure that the project was well
prepared. In retrospect, however, this turned out not to be sufficient to ensure a successful
project for the simple reason that the project was a MAP (II) project and followed the
design that characterized all such projects. In other words, the PDOs focused on reducing
prevalence of HIV in the population using a multi-sectoral approach; they also included
capacity building in all sectors public as well as private/NGO sectors. Furthermore,
overall responsibility for the fight against HIV/AIDS would rest with a national, multi-
sectoral HIV/AIDS council (rather than the MOH), the secretariat for which would
coordinate all the sectoral HIV/AIDS and therefore the MAP project's activities. While

                                              9
this design was considered the state of the art at the time, subsequent experiences made it
clear that the MAP approach was serious flawed. As documented by the 200? IEG
Evaluation of the MAP projects, all the MAP projects evaluated suffered from a number
of shortcomings, which not surprisingly also turned out to afflict the Niger MAP Project.
In retrospect the Niger Project was, despite its thorough preparation process, to a large
extent like a child born with a birth defect that turned out to be exceedingly difficult to
overcome.

32.     In Niger's very low-capacity environment, these shortcomings were particularly
challenging and combined to undermine the project's ability to achieve its PDOs at least
during the first several years of project implementation. The most important weaknesses
of the Niger Project design concern the formulation of the PDOs, the project's multi-
sectoral approach and implementation arrangements, and the resulting need for a complex
coordination structure. The creation of a national, multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS Council with
overall responsibility for the fight against HIV/AIDS also created a number of problems,
as did the Coordination unit that served as its secretariat and its location in the Office of
the Prime Minister. Since the impact of most of these shortcomings is discussed in the
next section, this section describes only those not included below.

33.     As indicated above, the first PDO was to "slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in the
general population" and the key outcome indicators included overall HIV/AIDS
prevalence and specific prevalence rates in key target groups. As subsequently shown
(Wilson, 2006) and reflected in the umbrella restructuring of 2007, prevalence suffers
from a number of shortcomings that make it unsuitable both as a PDO and an M&E
indicator, particularly in a country with a concentrated epidemic and low prevalence rates
in the general population (see Annex 10 which describes the short-comings of prevalence
and incidence rates as PDOs/indicators).

34.     Despite the extensive analysis in the PAD of the type of epidemic facing Niger
and the need to prioritize project interventions to high-risk groups and in high-risk areas,
the project's multisectoral design, focusing on involving and reaching everyone, diluted
the focus on the most important activities (reaching high-risk and vulnerable groups).
Indeed, according to the project Task Team Leader (TTL), the project to a large extent
lost sight of this priority until the project was restructured, resulting in the loss of
valuable time in which to achieve the project objectives.

35.     Project Design Was Excessively Complex and Placed an Undue Burden on the
Recipient and the Implementing Agencies. Like other MAP II projects, the design for this
project involved a multisectoral implementation framework. Four components (and two
sub-components), spanning all sectors of the economy and all levels of government, were
to implement a variety of prevention, care and mitigation activities to different target
groups, while being coordinated by the secretariat, the CISLS, of a newly created
National AIDS Council residing in the Office of the Prime Minister. Given Niger's level
of development, its embryonic NGO sector, and its general weak capacity, it is hard to
see how such a complex design would not impose a major burden on the Recipient and
the myriad implementing agencies, even with the extensive (and equally complex)

                                             10
coordination mechanisms that were to facilitate project implementation. Indeed, despite
the extensive capacity development efforts, project implementation was much delayed.

36.     The Institutional Framework for Facilitating and Coordinating Resulted in a
Number of Unforeseen Challenges and Bottlenecks. This institutional framework
included a large number of coordination entities and sectoral focal points at the central,
regional, and local levels, which in practice turned out to be very difficult to implement.
The local coordination committees, for example, never became functional throughout the
project, and most of the system only began to function as originally planned after the
restructuring. In addition, the framework created a number of difficulties that had very
negative implications for project implementation. Among the most important of these
was the establishment of a National AIDS Council (NAC) whose secretariat, the Inter-
Sectoral Program Coordination Unit (CISLS), was established in the Office of the Prime
Minister. With all procurement functions located in the CISLS, implementation progress
essentially became a function of the competence of its staff and the relationship between
them and the implementing partners. Thus, weaknesses in either led to project
implementation delays. These problems were only resolved after the restructuring with
the arrival of the new Project Coordinator.

37.      Moving responsibility for the fight against STIs/HIV/AIDS from the Ministry of
Health (MOH), where it had previously resided, to the Prime Minister's office had a very
negative impact on the MOH's ownership of the project and the fight against HIV/AIDS.
It also sowed considerable confusion among MOH staff about their roles and
responsibilities. Collectively, these forces resulted in serious implementation delays of
Component 1(a) activities and, ultimately, prevented the Ministry from taking full
advantage of all the project funds allocated for much needed capacity building in that
sector. Finally, the position of "Advisor to the President" also created unforeseen
problems, because of overlapping and competing roles and responsibilities between this
position and that of the Project Coordinator. These challenges were resolved after the
restructuring of the project and a TST mission in August 2007 (see Section 1.7).

38.     Capacity Weaknesses Needs Were Underestimated. The extensive assessment of
both the technical and financial management and control capacity of both the public and
NGO sectors during the preparatory phase had made it abundantly clear that
implementing agencies had very weak capacity in these important areas. While the
project design and activities were intended to compensate for, and address, these
weaknesses, in practice it took much longer time and greater effort to build the needed
capacity than had originally been anticipated, indicating how difficult it is to accurately
assess how difficult it is to build institutional capacity in a low capacity country.
Furthermore, the overly centralized and autocratic management style of the CISLS
leadership also contributed significantly to delayed implementation and periods with
unsatisfactory ratings of Financial Management.

39.    Some Risk Mitigation Measures Were Inadequate and Important Project Risks
Were Overlooked. The PAD identified eight critical risks (four from outputs to objectives
and four from components to outputs) as well as a series of risk mitigating measures.

                                             11
Despite the thorough preparation process and the numerous assessments, the identified
risks did not include risks that subsequently proved important (see para. 37 and Annex
11). Furthermore, the proposed mitigation measures in several cases failed to fully
mitigate those risks, resulting in implementation delays until project restructuring
resolved the challenges and bottlenecks, and ultimately influenced the project's ability to
achieve its PDOs.

40.     Interestingly, several of the unidentified risks relate to aspects of the MAP project
design (e.g., the establishment of the National AIDS Council and the inter-sectoral
program coordination Unit, the establishment of the post of the Advisor to the President),
which ultimately affected project implementation negatively. Another overlooked risk
was the possibility that the GoN would renege on the agreed counterpart funding, which
was apparently a frequent occurrence in other IDA operations. This issue was addressed
in one of the covenants, but tardy deposits of counterpart funds nonetheless frequently
delayed procurement of local goods and services, and hence implementation. (See Annex
11 for an assessment of the risk mitigation measures included in the PAD as well as the
other overlooked risks.)

41.     Government Ownership of the Project during Implementation Somewhat
Overestimated. The PAD (p. 28) cites government ownership of the project as
"reasonably strong" and argues further that the extensive participatory processes used
both to develop the national framework for fighting HIV/AIDS and to prepare the project
have created strong buy-in on part of all the stakeholders, public as well as private/NGOs
and international development partners. However, the strong government ownership
during preparation did not translate into an equally strong or widespread ownership
during implementation, as evidenced by the lack of interest on the part of certain public
sector agencies in implementing the project after effectiveness (Annex 2 describes the
varying involvement of the different non-health public entities both at the central and
regional levels). This is actually quite understandable given the limited relevance of a low
prevalence HIV/AIDS epidemic to the focus and responsibilities of these ministries,
reflecting one of the shortcomings of a multi-sectoral approach in a country with a
concentrated epidemic.

42.      The President of Niger clearly remained personally committed both to the fight
against HIV/AIDS and the Project, meeting on a monthly basis with the Project
Coordinator after the restructuring moved the NAC and the CISLS to the Cabinet of the
President. Certain ministries also remained strongly committed, particularly those that
were committed to the fight against HIV/AIDS prior to the Project (e.g., education,
defense, transport), and for whom it was highly relevant. As discussed above, after the
initial deposit of counterpart funding, a project effectiveness condition, the Ministry of
Finance quickly fell behind on its contributions to the project, which apparently also
happens frequently in other IDA operations. This problem was only finally resolved
when the project was restructured and this obligation disappeared, thereby reducing the
overall GoN financing from the planned US$2.5 million to US$1.6 million.




                                             12
2.2 Implementation
43.     Despite the Bank team's extensive efforts to ensure that the government was
ready to implement the project, the design and preparation issues discussed above
combined to create implementation delays right from the start. Establishment of a
functional coordination unit took longer than anticipated, critical staff was not hired in a
timely manner, equipment was not procured, and the contract for the management of the
Civil Society Component was delayed. The confusion about the Ministry of Health's new
role and responsibilities impaired its ability to implement its activities, delaying drug
procurement, equipment acquisition, and capacity building efforts. A strained relationship
between the CISLS and the implementing partners exacerbated these problems.

44.     Early supervision documents are frank about Project implementation delays, but
make for dire reading: "CISLS has difficulties handling procurement; absence of guide
concerning financial and accounting management for the internal controller at CISLS;
M&E strategy not properly defined; low morale of staff appointed to Ministries Focal
points as well as the national and regional antennas of the CISLS." Among the actions to
be taken to address the "serious tensions both within the CISLS and between the CISLS
and its partners" is the recruitment of a consulting firm to be charged with "suggesting
ways on how to effectively lesson these tensions."

45.     The situation only began to change two years after project effectiveness (when the
project suffered an 18 month disbursement delay) when TTL-ship was transferred to the
Bank Health Specialist in the Country Office. Furthermore, the outcome of a joint
assessment of the project carried out by the Bank, GFTAM, UNAIDS, and the Joint
Problem Solving and Implementation Support Team led to an agreement about concerted
actions needed to address project implementation and management issues, including a
decision to hold monthly meetings under the leadership of the Prime Minister with all
stakeholders to more closely monitor implementation progress. A Quality Enhancement
Review (QER) held in November 2005, provided useful advice about the resolution of
implementation problems and a possible restructuring of the project. The QER, was
followed by an MTR in June 2006, during which it was agreed that the GoN would
request a restructuring of the project to address the many challenges facing the project
(see Section 1.3).

46.      After a one-year delay, the Government's request for restructuring was completed
as part of the umbrella restructuring of eight MAP projects on June 29, 2007. As noted in
Section 1.3, the restructuring made a number of changes that facilitated subsequent
project implementation, but more importantly, the TST mission in August 2007 resolved
the critical problems related to project management and coordination (see Section 1.7).
Of greatest importance was probably the change in the leadership of the CISLS.

47.     The impact of the new Coordinator, whose management style and dedication, as
well as the new location of the CISLS in the President's Cabinet cannot be overestimated.
The previous tensions among CISLS staff and between the CISLS and its partners
disappeared. Problems with the MOH were addressed and additional capacity building
was provided to those agencies in need of it. Regular supervision of Project activities

                                            13
started to take place and werekly meetings between the CISLS and the regional antennas
of the CISLS (the CRLSes) were instigated. By the time the project closed, the ICR
mission received only positive comments from the implementing agencies (in both the
public and NGO sectors) with which it met. These were clearly all people who were
committed to, and understood, their mission, and they were eagerly continuing the work
begun under the Project to the extent that funding permitted. It was truly inspiring.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
48.     Since the project was restructured with a change in both PDOs and related
indicators, M&E design, implementation, and utilization will be described both prior to,
and after, the restructuring. For space considerations, the following sections highlight
only key shortcomings, as there were no outstanding positive findings. For further
information, please see Annex 12 which contains a table with ratings of a number of
detailed aspects of M&E Design, Implementation, Utilization, and Capacity, which were
developed based on OPCS and IEG M&E guidelines and criteria. Using the detailed
ratings this annex provides aggregated ratings as well as an overall rating for M&E,
however, these ratings are not included in this section, because the methodology has yet
to validated and the results are heavily dependent on the relative weights assigned to the
various components/dimension (equal weighting of all components/dimensions are used
in the calculation in Annex 12).

49.     M&E Design at Approval. The project was prepared at a time (2002-2003) when
there was less emphasis on monitoring and evaluation and therefore less information in
the PAD. Indeed, the body of the project PAD (p.2) refers only to "key performance
indicators" and includes a table of 18 "outcome and impact indicators." In Annex 1 of the
PAD, the Project Design Summary contains the logical framework used at the time,
which included output indicators as opposed to intermediate outcome indicators. Since
this was the prevailing framework at the time, it forms the basis for the assessment of the
M&E design at approval.

50.     The M&E Design Included only Outcome Indicators for One of Three PDOs. All
of the above-mentioned 18 outcome indicators concern the first objective (slowing the
spread of HIV/AIDS in the general population) and none refer to the other two PDOs
(mitigating the impact of, and strengthening the country's capacity to fight HIV/AIDS).
This may indicate that the main objective of the Project was to slow the spread of
HIV/AIDS, but it may also be a reflection of the other two PDOs, which are rather vague
and difficult to operationalize and measure. Among, the output indicators included in
Annex 1 of the PAD, several refer to activities or outputs clearly intended to achieve the
other two PDOs, but none of them would be appropriate as outcome indicators.

51.     Many of the Outcome Indicators Were of Limited Usefulness for Project
Monitoring and Evaluation. As noted above, prevalence suffers from a number of
limitations that makes it inappropriate both as a PDO and an outcome indicator. Not only
is HIV/AIDS slow to respond to changes in risk-seeking behavior, in concentrated
epidemics like the one in Niger, HIV prevalence in the general population reflects the
tail-end of a long infection chain. Furthermore, given the time and expense needed to
collect prevalence data, it is not a useful indicator for project monitoring (for further
                                            14
details see Annex 10). Its use in this project is likely the result of it being a MAP (II)
project, as all the MAPs used prevalence as part of their PDOs and outcome indicators.

52.     Many Output Indicators of Limited Utility. Annex 1 of the PAD lists 24 output
indicators, which is a very large number (as is the number of outcome indicators!)
Furthermore, many of the output indicators are actual numbers as opposed to percentages,
which makes them much less useful for M&E purposes (e.g., the number of persons
tested HIV positive in the VCT Centers receiving preventive treatment against
opportunistic infections). Other indicators, while useful for monitoring project activities,
provide no information about progress towards intermediate outcomes. Simply counting
the number of training workshops does not really yield much information about whether
the participants learned anything useful and were subsequently able to use the knowledge
gained. To a large extent, however, these shortcomings are likely to be a function of the
framework used at the time, which did not specify the need for intermediate result
outcomes and indicators.

53.     No Discussion of Data Quality Issues or M&E Capacity. While the PAD includes
the source of each indicator (outcome or output), there is no discussion of potential data
collection issues, data quality concerns, and the general weak M&E capacity of all the
implementing agencies. Nor is there among the indicators, any mention of the need to
establish a national M&E system, which would be important to institutionalize capacity
improvements made under the project (an issue later addressed during supervision).. It
should be noted, however, that the surveys of prevalence and risky behaviors were of
high quality, as they were obtained either from DHS surveys or were collected by
reputable firms with extensive survey experience. Furthermore, most of the output
indicators were obtained from project monitoring reports, which were also of good
quality. The only source of potentially poor data quality is the sentinel survey sites that
provide data for prevalence rates among pregnant women.

54.     M&E Design after Restructuring. With one of the objectives of the restructuring
to change the PDO and the indicators, it is not surprising that M&E design improved. The
new indicators--12 in all--were not only much more manageable in number, but
corresponded directly to the revised PDOs, with appropriate indicators for both of them.
All, but one, of the indicators had baseline data (from 2006), end-of-project targets, and
sources of data. Data collection, data quality, capacity building and institutionalization of
an HIV/AIDS M&E system were to be addressed through the preparation of a new
National HIV/AIDS M&E System, which was mandated as part of the 2007-2011
National Strategic Framework for Fighting STIs/HIV/AIDS, a draft of which had already
been prepared.

55.    M&E Implementation Prior to Restructuring. Implementation of the project M&E
system remained a challenge from effectiveness to restructuring, in part as a result of the
above-mentioned M&E design weaknesses, in part because of project design and
implementation shortcomings (see Section 2). Of the original 18 outcome indicators
contained in the PAD, the project was only able to obtain data for four of them, and only
after more than two years into project implementation (towards the end of 2006).

                                             15
Supervision reports indicate that implementation of the project M&E plan posed
continuing problems and that the plan, prepared by the CISLS, had to be revised. In
addition, project implementation delays in establishment of regional maternity reference
centers to serve as sentinel surveillance of pregnant women resulted in a lack of
prevalence data for pregnant women. In contrast, the situation was completely different
for the output indicators, where the data collected was project monitoring reports and thus
presented no problems.

56.     M&E Implementation after Restructuring. With the restructuring came both a
reduction in the number of indicators as well as revisions that made data collection easier.
As a result, data were collected on all 12 (outcome and intermediate outcome) indicators.
In addition, for the outcome indicators, the data were reported by sex (as opposed to in an
aggregated manner), making it easier to track progress as it related to one of the target
groups (women). In addition, the approval of the 2006-2011 National Framework
established the basis for the creation of a national HIV/AIDS M&E system to serve every
stakeholder's needs. Changes in the CISLS included replacing the Director of M&E,
which resolved some of the problems that had undermined data collection efforts prior to
restructuring. Capacity building efforts at the regional level, including the hiring of
regional M&E staff, improved the collection and quality of the data. Despite intensive
support from the Bank supervisory team, implementation of the National M&E System
remained slower than anticipated, requiring more time and resources than estimated. In
addition, with 76 indicators (the entire collection of all donor-required indicators) of
which 60 requires review/abstraction of information from patient records and/or
documents, the system is likely to need some fine tuning to become operationally
sustainable in the long run.

57.     M&E Utilization Prior to Restructuring. In light of the problems with the M&E
design and implementation, particularly related to the outcome indicators, it should come
as no surprise that M&E utilization was very limited. With no data available on outcome
indicators, they obviously could not be used to for project monitoring purposes, nor could
reports be prepared and distributed. Even as Project implementation speed picked up,
there was a relatively limited use of the output data for a number of reasons. First, the
M&E unit in the CISLS did not produce timely reports; second, information flow
between the CISLS and the regional coordination committees was limited; and third, the
tense relationship between the CISLS and the implementing agencies, including CSOs,
precluded much effective use of M&E data.

58.     M&E Utilization after Restructuring. With a revised, more manageable set of
indicators, the change in the coordination framework, a new M&E Director in the CISLS,
and a new Coordinator, the situation changed dramatically. Not only were data collected
on all the planned indicators, including those requiring national or sentinel surveillance
surveys, but they were now used as the basis for regular discussion with the regional
coordinators, implementing agencies, and development partners. Project funds were
allocated to activities whose priority was determined as a result of the M&E system.




                                            16
59.     Needless to say, these things did not happen overnight, so only one full M&E
report was ultimately prepared and distributed to stakeholders prior to Project closure.
With the analysis and validation of the survey data for end-of-project indicators not yet
completed, it was not possible to prepare and distribute a second report; however, the
CISLS is planning to publish the results as soon as they are available. One of the
remarkable things that the Coordinator achieved using the M&E system was to get all
CSOs as well as the regional coordinators to completely focus on outcomes and to speak
with one voice about it, which the ICR author observed during a series of meeting with
these organizations at both the central and regional levels.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
60.     Environment: In light of the proposed project activities, the Project was assigned
a "B" category, and a Medical Waste Management Plan was prepared prior to Project
approval to ensure that health care facilities would dispose of their waste in an
environmentally sound manner. A pilot plan was tested during preparation to determine
which waste disposal techniques would be most suitable for Niger. The outcome of this
pilot determined that incinerators were selected (over burial) as the preferred waste
disposal method. After that decision progress on implementation of the plan slowed to a
craw for several years. Procurement and installation of the incinerators presented a
number of challenges for the MoH which were exacerbated by the problems in the CISLS
discussed above. Like the other problems these were not resolved until after the
restructuring.

61.     Once implementation started and the incinerators procured, the MoH encountered
a number of unanticipated problems that delayed their installation in a number of sites.
One of the most challenging aspects turned out to be finding appropriate spaces in which
to locate them, which in some cases required construction of a new room or rehabilitation
of existing space to house them. Ultimately, these problems were all resolved so that by
the ICR mission, all staff had been trained in the new waste disposal procedures,
incinerators had been delivered, and all but a few were operating. The remaining were
expected to become operational in the near future.

62.     Financial Management: Financial management for the most part presented
minimal problems, probably reflecting the comprehensive evaluation of the public sector
and NGO capacity in financial management (FM) control during project preparation and
the application of lessons learned from another IDA financed operation. The Legal
Agreement contained a number of effectiveness conditions pertaining to the
establishment of an acceptable financial management system (FMS) as well as eight
financial covenants. These were met within approximately six months from project
signing. FM operated in a satisfactory manner until May 2005, probably because of the
limited implementation progress until that point. Once line ministries began
implementing project activities, there were occasional delays in submission of the
quarterly Statements of Expenditure and hence in meeting the financial covenants.

63.     During the period between the midterm review (June 2006) and project
structuring (July 2007) when project implementation deteriorated significantly, the
Director of Administration and Financial Management left the CISLS, resulting in a
                                           17
period of turmoil due to an inadequate filing system, which was only discovered after his
departure. Until a new Director could be found and a better filing system put in place, FM
(like all other aspects of project management) was downgraded to MU. With the CISLS
restructuring and the hiring of the new Coordinator, the FM issues were quickly resolved,
leaving only one other supervision period (second half of CY2008) with partial
completion of the financial covenants.

64.     Disbursement: The estimated Project cost at appraisal was US$27.5 million of
which US$25.0 would come from IDA. At project closure, the total Project cost was
US$26.14 million, the reduction in part due to the Project restructuring which eliminated
the contribution from the borrower. As result, total financing by the GoN amounted to
US$1.6 million or 64% of the original amount. By the end of the disbursement grace
period, the IDA Grant had disbursed a total of US$24.56 million, leaving US$0.46
million to be cancelled.

65.     Procurement: With a contractual procurement specialist in the CISLS,
procurement to a large extent posed few problems throughout the project except during
two supervision periods where other problems also occurred. Early delays with
completing the contracts for the management of the Civil Service Component 2 resulted
in a one-time unsatisfactory rating in the (then) Project Status Reports, which was
subsequently resolved with pressure from the Bank team. In addition, as already noted all
aspects of project management, including procurement, deteriorated significantly during
the period between the MTR and the restructuring, but the procurement problems, like
the other project management problems were resolved with the revised CISLS
organization and the improved leadership style of the new Coordinator. The restructuring
also resulted in the adoption of revised procurement rules (October 2006) to abolish
thresholds for all procurement methods and the mandatory use of an annual procurement
plan, which simplified the planning and coordination across implementing agencies.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
66.     While the project may not have achieved everything that it was supposed to, it has
succeeded in establishing a permanent institutional framework for the fight against
STIs/HIV/AIDS, which exists independently of the project and will continue to do so as
long as there are any resources available to spend on the prevention, treatment, and
mitigation of HIV/AIDS. Most of the key staff in the CISLS and in the line ministries are
civil service employees, who continue their work as before. Furthermore, it has
succeeded in vastly improving the MoH's capacity to deliver prevention, treatment, and
mitigation services. Indeed, many of the ARV treatment centers are already bursting at
the seams because they have experienced greater demand for their services than
originally anticipated due to the high quality of the services provided.

67.     The MoH at the central level also seems to have greater ownership of their
responsibilities in the fight against HIV/AIDS, however, the health system is in need of
both strengthening and reform to improve the motivation of its staff, who are poorly paid.
Similarly, there is now much larger number of more vibrant and highly committed civil
society organizations, who will continue to deliver services as long as resources are
available. Moreover, these organizations are now in a much better position to manage
                                           18
projects as well as to apply for funding whether from governmental sources or
development partners.

68.      Policies and programs that continue to guide the fight against HIV/AIDS have
also been put in place. Several focus ministries (in the non-health sector) have
institutionalized their HIV/AIDS prevention activities. Schools have incorporated into
their curricula HIV/AIDS IEC activities; the Ministry of National Defense provides
information to its recruits and requires anyone who is to marry to be tested prior to the
wedding. In addition, the police track all sex workers and require them to check in on a
regular basis. There is no indication that these activities will cease operation as long as
HIV/AIDS poses a threat to the country.

69.     While there is still much to be done, the country is in an excellent position to
continue the fight against HIV/AIDS; but there is no doubt that funding is the critical
issue. There is simply only so much that can be done with the current very limited public
allocations. While the GFTAM still finances a variety of HIV/AIDS prevention and
treatment activities, the amount is far from sufficient. Furthermore, it is unclear for how
long it will continue. Support from WHO and UNAIDS is more reliable and likely to
continue, but the scope is limited, consisting mostly of technical assistance and capacity
building provided directly to the MOH and its staff.

70.    In light of the importance of continuing the battle of HIV/AIDS, the GoN has
requested funding for a second IDA operation, but the latest political developments in
Niger have caused the Bank to halt the preparation of all new projects while it considers
how to proceed. Hopefully, this situation will be resolved soon.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
71.     Because the Project was restructured, the Assessment of Outcomes requires a
separate assessment of the outcomes prior to and after the restructuring. Each of the
following subsections therefore makes separate assessments for each project period
unless there was no difference between the two.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
72.     Relevance Prior to and After Restructuring. Relevance is rated Substantial both
prior to and after restructuring for the following reasons: First and most importantly, the
Project's PDOs both before and after restructuring remained highly relevant to the
country context. Indeed they remain so to this day. HIV/AIDS was and still is a high
priority for the GoN because of its immense potential economic and social impact.
Furthermore, the PDOs before restructuring supported Niger's CAS at the time as well as
two of the four pillars of Niger's first PRSP: a) Improvement in the access of the poor to
quality social services, including... primary health care, reproductive health services,
[and] HIV/AIDS prevention..." and b) Strengthening of institutional and individual
capacity within and outside the Government at the central and local level.

73.   After project restructuring the (restructured) PDOs supported three of the current
PRSP's seven pillars: a) Creating access to "equitable access to quality social services,"

                                             19
b) Gender empowerment and social protection (including ensuring "protection of
PLWHA"), and c) promoting good governance and capacity building. The PDOs also
support the second Pillar--Equitable Access to Quality Social Services--of the FY2008-
FY2011 Niger CAS, which was designed to support Niger's second PRSP.

74.     While the project suffered from certain design shortcomings (Section 2.1) and
implementation delays during the initial three years, the restructuring and the subsequent
TST mission to a large extent resolved these problems. Furthermore, the pre-restructuring
design weaknesses and implementation delays were not significant enough to reduce the
overall relevance rating to Modest.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
75.     Because the overall achievement of PDOs needs to be based on a combined rating
of the pre- and post-restructuring achievement of the PDO, these are assessed separately
below.

76.     Achievement of PDOs Prior to Restructuring. In assessing the PDOs prior to
restructuring it is necessary to first rate each of the three PDOs individually and then
collectively. The first PDO was to "slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in the general
population. This PDO was to be assessed according to the outcome indicators listed in
Section 1.3. These all concern either prevalence rates of different population groups or
condom utilization during the "last risky sex act." Achievement of this PDO is rated
modest for a number of reasons. First, several of the targets for outcome indicators have
not been achieved (prevalence rates for youth, pregnant women, truck drivers and
prisoners; and condom use among adult women). Second, even though the targets for a
number of outcome indicators were reached, the indicators based on prevalence rates
shed little light about the extent to which HIV/AIDS has actually slowed in the general
population. As noted in Annex 10, prevalence rates could have declined because
PLWHAs died in greater numbers than the number of newly infected persons.
Furthermore, the two indicators that are considered reasonable proxies for incidence rates
(the rate of new infections)--prevalence among youth and pregnant women--both
increased, although the prevalence in both groups is still very low.

77.      On the targets related to behavioral change (increased use of condoms), the
evidence is mixed. Among adults (15-49), men reported an increase in the use of
condoms from 14% (in 1998) to 38.4% in 2006. For women, however, there was no
change, with only 0.9% using a condom at the last risky sex act. Among the younger age-
group (15-24), there was a significant increase in the use of condoms in both sexes.
Almost 50% of men and 20.4% of women aged 15-24 reported using a condom during
the last risky sex act, thereby meeting (and for men exceeding) the outcome indicators
targets for this PDO. Since the younger age-group is likely to be both more sexually
active and more risk-taken, this finding is important. It should be noted that even if the
targets were achieved or exceeded (for young men), the overall utilization of condoms is
still inadequate.




                                           20
78.    Annex 13 contains a full list of the outcome indicators as well as an assessment of
whether they achieved their target. On the basis of this assessment and the explanations
above, the achievement of this PDO is rated modest.

79.     The second PDO--to mitigate the negative impact of HIV/AIDS on individuals
and communities--had no outcome indicators assigned; however, several output
indicators clearly shed some light on the achievement of this PDO. These indicators
concern the number of persons receiving treatment for opportunistic infections (and
ARV), the number of PLWHA benefiting from sub-projects undertaken by CBOs and
CSOs as well as the number of orphans benefiting from support. As reported in Annex 13,
the project managed to deliver mitigating services to only a very small number of people
affected by HIV/AIDS. Similarly, the number of persons (1745) persons who received
mitigating HIV/AIDS services under Component 3 is also very low (see Annex 2). There
may even be some overlap between the numbers in the two Annexes, so collectively the
achievement of this PDO can only be rated as negligible.

80.     The third and final PDO--to strengthen the country's capacity to formulate,
manage, implement, monitor, and evaluate a viable cost-effective HIV/AIDS Program--
is more difficult to assess. While there are a large number of output indicators (see Annex
13) that collectively show capacity development related to the formulation, management,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the existing HIV/AIDS program, there is
limited evidence regarding "a viable, cost-effective HIV/AIDS Program." Only the
closure of two VCT sites after the MTR provide evidence that such capacity has indeed
been created, since the closures resulted from an assessment of utilization rates which
showed some of them to have very low utilization rates. They were therefore considered
cost-inefficient and closed down. In the absence of outcome indicators, the assessment of
the capacity development achieved is therefore somewhat arbitrary; however, as
indicated in Annex 13, institutional capacity did increase to a modest extent.

81.     For the health sector, a large amount of equipment had been acquired for the
testing and treatment centers, maternity referral centers, and the national referral
laboratory to be established by the project. Furthermore, large amounts of ARV and STI
medications had been procured, as had medicines to treat opportunistic infections.
Similarly, reagents and supplies to operate the new equipment and provide the new
services had been procured, and medical staff had been trained. In addition to the eight
workshops for medical staff, 42 workshops were held to train traditional healers, lay
midwives, and others on STI/HIV/AIDS information, IEC techniques, and prevention of
mother-to-child transmission. Furthermore, almost 2000 IEC activities had been
completed according to the strategic communication plan for the public sector, and
almost 40,000 such IEC activities were undertaken by civil society. Moreover, eight new
regional VCT centers were established, as were eight regional Maternity Reference
Centers for testing and treating pregnant women. Moreover, safe blood transfusion
services were established in all 42 health districts, as opposed to in only half of them, as
originally planned. More than 250 sub-projects were undertaken by CBOs and CSOs
targeting specific risk groups and several new NGO associations had been established.



                                             21
The main reason this PDO is rated modest is the absence of outcome indicators, as the
above listed achievements are all output measures.

82.     As mentioned above, the three individual achievement ratings need to be
combined into one overall score. This is done by allocating numeric values to the
qualitative ratings and then calculating the average rating. As shown in Table 2, with two
modest and one negligible ratings, the overall PDO achievement prior to restructuring is
modest.

83.      Achievement of PDOs after Restructuring. As described elsewhere, the
restructuring resulted in the elimination of one of the original three PDOs and significant
revisions to the remaining two. In addition, the outcome and intermediate outcome
indicators were greatly reduced and simplified. These changes not only improved the
relevance of the project and its design, but also strengthened its results framework. As a
result, the linkages between the objectives, activities/outputs and intermediate and final
outcomes became much more direct.

84.      The four outcome indicators that were established to assess the achievement of
the first, revised PDO--to improve the coverage and utilization of HIV/Prevention, care,
treatment, and mitigation services--captures the key dimensions of the PDO. Three of
the four indicators focus on prevention (percentage of sex workers using a condom with
the most recent client; percentage of women and men aged 15-49 who received an HIV
test in the previous year and know their results; and the percentage of women receiving
treatment for the prevention of MTCT) The End-of-Project (EoP) target related to
condom use was 80%. The Project achieved an 87% utilization rate. The percentage who
know the results of a recent HIV test also exceeded its target, although the data are not
reported in a disaggregate form. For that indicator, the EoP target had a baseline of 7%
and 9% respectively (from a baseline close to zero) and the achieved results were 69% in
the aggregate. Clearly, the sensitization campaigns had a major impact. The final
indicator (the percentage of HIV positive women receiving ARV to reduce MTC
transmission), which captures both prevention and mitigation dimensions, also showed
significant improvement from 40% to 61% (a more than 50% increase).; but with an EoP
target of 50%, the target was not reached.

1
  The three PDOs are weighted equally in Table 2, because even a very high weighting of PDO (i), which is arguably
the most important of the three PDOs has no impact on the overall PDO rating.


                                                                   22
85.     The care and treatment dimensions of the PDO are captured by an indicator
measuring the percentage of adults and children living with advanced HIV infection
receiving ARV therapy. The 2006 baseline for this indicator was 39% and the actual
achievement at the end of project was 52.5% (a 35% increase); however, with an EoP
target of 80%, the target was not achieved. Since only two of the four targets for the
outcome indicators were met, the achievement of this PDO is rated modest. Furthermore
it should be noted that the quality of EoP targets seems questionable; some are
exceedingly, high while others appear too low.

86.      It should be noted that several of the pre-restructuring output indicators also
provide evidence concerning the achievement of this PDO. Although not required to
monitor the original output indicators after restructuring, the Project continued to do so
because they were useful in monitoring implementation progress on the components,
which remained unchanged. Annex 13 contains a list of these output indicators marked
by a `*'. These indicators provide evidence of improvement in the coverage and
utilization of HIV/prevention, care, treatment, and mitigation services, as does Annex 2.
For example, almost 100,000 IEC activities were carried (by the public and NGO sectors)
by the end of the project. In addition, 8 radio transmissions served to sensitize the
population and de-stigmatize PLWHAs.
          
87.     More than 60,000 pregnant mothers were tested for HIV (of which 1.02% were
HIV positive)2 and 324,800 condoms were distributed free of charge, consistent with the
improvements in the condom use indicator. Six VCT campaigns resulted in 29,000
persons being tested and the routine VCT site attracted another 11,000 persons.
Furthermore, almost 190,000 tests of blood were performed at the 42 blood transfusion
centers nationwide. Diagnostic clinics for HIV carried out 7700 diagnostic tests. While
mitigation services were more limited they also improved although to a much smaller
extent. By the end of the project, 900 persons affected by the impact of HIV/AIDS
epidemic were receiving benefits every year from CBOs and CSOs while the number of
PLWHAs receiving such benefits had increased to more than 300.
          
88.     The second revised PDO--to improve the STI/HIV/AIDS prevention knowledge
in the general population--had only one outcome indicator associated with it: the
percentage of young women and men aged 15-24 who both correctly identify ways of
preventing the sexual transmission of HIV and who reject major misconceptions of HIV
transmission. The baseline for this was 13.4% for women and 15.9% for men, with
targets of 19% and 20% for women and men respectively. By the end of the project, the
actual achievement was much greater. Thirty-nine percent of women and 51% of men
aged 15-24 correctly identified HIV transmission mechanisms while rejecting

 In Niger, the identification of one HIV positive pregnant women typically implies the identification of another 35
people who may also be HIV positive, because most married women live in polygamous marriage with three other
wives, each of whom typically have 7-8 children. This situation makes testing of pregnant women much more cost-
effective than in other low-prevalence countries.


                                                          23
 misconceptions. While the EoP targets for this indicator were exceeded, the targets
 themselves were very conservative, especially in light of the large number of IEC
 activities. Furthermore, the achievements clearly indicate that there is still a long way to
 go before there is universal understanding of the correct transmission mechanisms. For
 this reason, the achievement of this PDO is rated modest.

 89.    Since achievement of both revised PDOs was assessed as modest, the combined
 achievement rating for the revised PDOs is also modest.

 3.3 Efficiency
 90.     Efficiency Prior to Restructuring is rated modest for several reasons. First, even
 though the PAD (Annex 4) states that the proposed project interventions were carefully
 reviewed in light of their cost-effectiveness and the need for a strong emphasis on
 "prevention and targeting of high-risk groups," in fact the project activities prior to

                                                             24
restructuring did not focus on high-risk groups, and prevention activities were
predominantly focused on the prevention of MTC transmission, while the IEC
"prevention" campaigns mainly focused on information and sensitization. Furthermore, it
is by no means clear that the project/implementation design with its reliance on myriad
actors at levels is particularly efficient in a concentrated epidemic like Niger's. In fact,
relying on so many different implementing agencies not only required a complicated (and
expensive) coordination mechanism, it also resulted in a diffusion of overall
responsibility for project outcomes, which reduced the project's effectiveness and hence,
its efficiency. Another reason for the modest efficiency rating is the inefficiency that
characterized project management and implementation prior to the restructuring.

91.      Efficiency after Restructuring is rated substantial for the following reasons. First,
the revised PDOs corresponded much more closely to the outcomes that most efficiently
would prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Niger (e.g., improving coverage and utilization
of HIV prevention services; and improving HIV prevention knowledge). Second, project
coordination became much more efficient once the organizational structure was changed
and the Coordinator replaced. Third, project activities were to a much larger extent
targeted to high-risk and targeted groups. Fourth, with more experience and better
understanding of the procedures involved in obtaining and spending project funds,
efficiency of implementation improved significantly among all implementing agencies.
Fifth, evaluation of project interventions resulted in the closure of four VCT centers due
to inadequate utilization (see Annex 2). Sixth, the establishment of a National Reference
Laboratory saved significant amounts of money by eliminating the need to send a variety
of tests to Paris at a cost of $5000/trip. And finally, the complete integration of the
management and monitoring of the GTFAM and IDA-financed activities into a single
CISLS structure significantly improved the coordination and implementation of both sets
of activities.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

92.     Because the Project was restructured, the overall outcome rating is a combination
of the pre- and post-restructuring outcome ratings. The pre-restructuring outcome rating
is weighted 52%, corresponding to the percentage of project funds that had been
disbursed at the time of the restructuring (cf. Annex B of the ICR Guidelines).
Consequently, the post-restructuring rating is weighted 48%. Table 3 below summarizes
the pre- and post-restructuring outcome ratings, which combine the Relevance,
Achievement of PDOs, and Efficiency ratings. In absence of any guidance on the rating
of each of these dimensions, they have been weighted equally.

93.   With a Moderately Unsatisfactory outcome prior to the restructuring, weigthed at
52% and a Moderately Satisfactory rating afterward, weighted at 48%, the overall project
outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
94.     The overall poverty impact of the Project is negligible, but a limited number of
project beneficiaries (1745 person) did receive support to mitigate the economic impact
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (see Annex 2). Furthermore, a small number of CSOs/CBOs
serving PLWHA provided nutritional supplements and income-generating activities for
242 beneficiaries which clearly had a poverty reducing impact. Since the project was not
intended to have a substantial poverty impact in the short run, this was to be expected.

95.     While a gender assessment has not been undertaken, some information is
available to help make a limited analysis of the Project's impact on this dimension. First,
women were one of the primary target groups, in part because of their higher prevalence
rates and in part because of the low social status, which makes them fairly powerless in
decisions related to the use of condoms, for example. Second, the project specifically
targeted identification and treatment of STIs as well as prevention of mother to child
transmission of the virus, because they are both of high importance to women's health
and quality of life. Third, the project also established reasonably accessible VCT centers
where women would have a safe place to seek assistance, if they were worried about
having STIs, HIV, or AIDS.

96.    Furthermore, although the original outcome indicators find little impact (between
2002 and 2006) on the utilization of condoms among adult women as a group--less 1%
of women aged 15-49 years reported using a condom during the last risky sex act in
2006--among younger women (15-24) the utilization increased from 0% to 20% in 2006
and remained at that level until the end of the project, suggesting that the Project may
have contributed to the empowerment of younger women.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
97.      As described in Section 2.5, the Project succeeded in achieving substantial
institutional development particularly at the central and regional levels of both the public
and NGO sectors. The institutional impact was necessarily larger in the health sector than
in the non-health public sector due to its central role in fighting the disease. While
institutional capacity development clearly varied considerably (see Annex 2), numerous
important ministries (e.g., education, transport, and defense) have institutionalized the
activities initiated during the Project. The CISLS and its regional units, the CRLSes, have
also seen substantial and sustainable institutional capacity development, whereas the
local coordination units never became functional.
                                               26
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
98.    No unintended outcomes or impacts were measured or identified during the ICR
mission.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
99.      The Risk to Development Outcome is rated substantial for the following reasons.
First, there are likely to be three key risks, all of substantial impact if they occur. The
three risks are: i) a change in government that lowers its commitment to fighting
HIV/AIDS, which experiences in other countries suggest would have a substantial,
detrimental impact on the HIV/AIDS program in Niger; ii) a change in the leadership of
the CISLS occurring before a replacement could be properly identified and trained would
have a substantial negative impact on the functioning of the CISLS and its partners; and
iii) a significant reduction on funding for the fight against HIV/AIDS would clearly have
a substantial, negative impact.

100. While it is tempting to think that the third risk is much more likely to occur than
the other two, this is not necessarily so given the importance of HIV/AIDS to most
African leaders given the commitment and importance attached to it by the international
development community, including the Bank and the GFTAM. Indeed, there is likely
only to be a modest risk of a significant reduction in total funding in the short to medium
terms, especially if the Bank, as expected, has a follow-on cooperation in its pipeline. The
other two risks are also estimated to have only modest chances of occurring for the
following reasons. With the devastating social and economic impact of high rates of HIV
prevalence, and surrounded by countries with higher prevalence rates, it is not very likely
that future governments will downgrade the importance of the fight against HIV/AIDS,
especially not given its importance to the donor community. As for the CISLS
Coordinator leaving before a replacement could be found and trained, this is judged fairly
unlikely, or of modest probability, on basis of his strong, stated commitment to his job
and his country. Using a methodology explained in detail in Annex 14, these three risks,
each rated of substantial impact, but of modest probability, combine to yield an overall
substantial Risk to Development Outcome. It should be noted, however, that in the
absence of any external funding, the achievements of this Project will be unsustainable in
the long run. The country is simply too poor to be able to sustain the current activities
indefinitely. Furthermore, it is also unwilling to fund NGO activities out of its own very
limited resources.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
101. To obtain an overall rating for the Bank's performance in ensuring Quality at
Entry (Q@E), the preparation process was assessed according to the 10 dimensions listed
in Annex A of the ICR Guidelines. A weighted average3 of these 10 scores, described in
detail in Annex 15 of this report, formed the basis for assessing Q@E as Moderately
Satisfactory. The project was highly relevant and very important at the time of its
preparation. It was consistent with both the Bank's country assistance strategy (FY2003-
FY2005), the borrower's (first) PRSP, and its national priorities and policy to fight the
spread of HIV/AIDS. Unlike many Bank teams preparing MAP projects at that time, this
team withstood the then-existing pressure within the Bank to prepare the Niger
STI/HIV/AIDS project in an excessively short period of time, thereby allowing the
completion of a number of important studies and assessments, including a baseline
prevalence survey, a technical assessment of the Niger National Strategic Framework for
Fighting HIV/AIDS, an institutional capacity assessment, a comprehensive beneficiary
assessment, a detailed evaluation of the financial management and control capacity of
both the public and non-public sectors, which were to be executing agencies under the
project. The Team also made a large number of field visits to remote areas to obtain
inputs from potential project beneficiaries.

102. Collectively, these assessments provided information that informed the project
design, resulting in better targeting of the planned project beneficiaries, project activities,
as well as plans for how to address fiduciary shortcomings through project effectiveness
conditions, detailed covenants, and capacity building plans incorporated into the project's
implementation plans. A participatory approach regarding the project benefits resulted in
the inclusion of ARV therapy for PLWHA in response to a strong request from
community representatives.

103. As result of these positive aspects of preparation, the six dimensions were rated in
the satisfactory range: i) technical, financial, and economic aspects; ii) poverty, gender,
and social development aspects; iii) environmental aspects; iv) policy and institutional
aspects; v) fiduciary aspects; and vi) Bank inputs and processes. These positive aspects
were, however, balanced by four dimensions that were rated in the unsatisfactory range:
i) strategic relevance and approach; ii) implementation arrangements; iii) M&E
arrangement; iv) risk assessment. (See Annex 15 for the detailed ratings and
justifications.)

104. Strategic relevance and approach was rated marginally unsatisfactory, despite the
high strategic relevance of the project, because the multi-sectoral approach was not the
most appropriate approach to a concentrated epidemic, especially not in a low-capacity


3
    The overall Q@E rating would not differ if all dimensions were rated equally.


                                                            28
country like Niger. Furthermore, despite a detailed institutional assessment,
implementation arrangements and coordination mechanisms were overly ambitious in the
Niger context. This resulted in a diffusion of responsibility for project activities (and
results) that delayed project implementation. The project's M&E plan lacked outcome
indicators for two of the three PDOs and did not include an implementation plan. Finally,
the assessment of risks and the mitigation measures designed were flawed in two ways:
they missed important risk factors, and some of the mitigating measures were ineffective.

105. Combining the six satisfactory dimensions with the four unsatisfactory ones,
yields an overall rating for Q@E of Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
106. From the outset it was clear that this project would require intensive supervision
because of the complex project design, complicated coordination mechanisms, and the
weak capacity of the implementing agencies. The Bank team responsible for project
supervision for at least the first half of the project period does not appear to have lived up
to that expectation. The reason may have been that the TTL who responsible for the
thorough preparation process was replaced shortly after Board approval. During the
second half of the project, starting with the MTR, quality of supervision have improved
significantly.

107. When considering the available information regarding the quality of supervision,
several conclusions emerge. First, the project benefitted from having a country office in
Niamey with a health, procurement, and fiduciary expertise, which allowed more
frequent, informal contact with the CISLS and implementing partners. It also allowed
greater supervision outside Niamey, as travel in Niger is very time-consuming and
therefore difficult to undertake for non-resident supervision staff. The presence of a
safeguard specialist in the Country Office did not, however, have the same effect, as
compliance with fiduciary safeguards was moderately unsatisfactory or unsatisfactory
during much of the project. Indeed, at the time of the ICR mission, several of the
incinerators procured by the project had not yet been installed, because they were still
awaiting the completion of work needed to create appropriate space for them.

108. Second, the project was either an at-risk or a problem project for than half the
time between effectiveness and closure. Furthermore, comments provided in the
supervision documents by both the sector and country management teams indicate that
many of the supervision ratings may have been overly positive, suggesting that the
project may in fact have performed inadequately for longer than officially indicated.

109. Third, during the first two years after effectiveness, when the project was rated in
the unsatisfactory range, the Bank fielded only one supervision mission per year. Since
the early phases of a project are always critical to the success of a project, the limited
supervision is likely to have had an even greater impact.

110. Fourth, the vast majority of all supervision missions had very limited participation
of high-level technical staff/consultants with relevant, international HIV/AIDS expertise.
                                             29
For the most part, the technical staff consisted of the local World Bank health specialist,
who took over as the (third) TTL on July 1, 2005, a pharmaceutical expert, and/or an
M&E specialist (in addition to financial management, procurement, and safeguard
specialists). While technical staff from the local UNAIDS office participated in these
missions, the difficulties facing the project suggest that their participation was
insufficient.

111. Fifth, quality of supervision appears to have improved after the TTL-ship was
transferred to the health staff located in the Country Office. The 2005 QER also provided
useful insights about how best to restructure the project and improve implementation.
The MTR, which was well staffed­identified many of the key bottlenecks and
recommending solutions (see discussion above). And as noted above, the TST mission,
fielded shortly after the restructuring, was crucial in resolving the project management
problems that had undermined project implementation during the first part of the project.
Finally the missions undertaken during the second part of the project included high-level
technical HNP staff from Headquarters.
        
112. Sixth, perhaps reflecting the high number of local supervisory staff and the
infrequent missions during the early years, supervision costs were much lower than
expected. In fact, they exceeded US$100,000 only in FY2006 when the MTR took place
(and only by US$5800). The TTL of the project reported that obtaining supervision funds
from the Country Management Unit (CMU) was not a problem, so the light supervision
during certain periods of time cannot be attributed to a lack of support from the CMU. In
fact, according to the PAD (Annex 14), supervision costs of US$ 140,000 were
incorporated into the CD's budget for FY2004, but only US$98,850 was spent on the one
mission that did take place.

113. Seventh, according to the TTL, the project received excellent support by both the
Sector Manager and the Country Manager and Director. The latter contributed
significantly to communicating the seriousness of the problems identified during the TST
mission. However, the Bank's ACT Africa team decided to include the restructuring
request in the above-mentioned umbrella restructuring of the MAP projects, which was
not finalized until a year after the MTR. This delay resulted in the loss of valuable time
and yet another period of poor project performance on virtually all fronts as the original
CISLS project staff left (and were not replaced until after the restructuring and the TST
mission had taken place).

114. Eighth, the transfer of TTL-ship to the same person who was responsible for the
on-going health operation improved the coordination between the two projects, as the
TTL was able to ensure that the annual work programs and procurement plans for the two
projects were complementary and synergistic.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU)
115. Following ICR Guidelines (Annex A) regarding a situation in which the rating for
one dimension of Bank performance is rated in the satisfactory range, while the other is


                                             30
not, the overall rating depends on the Outcome rating. Since the overall outcome rating is
MU, the overall Bank performance rating is also MU.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
116. Government Performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory on the bases that,
overall, there were moderate shortcomings in government performance according to
criteria relevant for this operation, which are listed in Table 4 below along with
individual ratings and reasons for the ratings. With two exceptions, the GoN performed
with moderate shortcomings on all criteria. As discussed extensively above, the
Government's performance on M&E was unsatisfactory, suffering from major
shortcomings. Similarly, early in the project period, implementation issues were not
solved in a timely and satisfactory manner, however, this was rectified after restructuring
when there were only minor shortcomings in the GoN's performance on this dimension

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
117. As discussed above, the Project was implemented by a large number of agencies,
both public and private/NGO, at the central, regional, and local levels, making it
impossible to assess each one individually. Instead, they will be grouped into four groups
of implementing agencies, closely mirroring the project's components (and
subcomponent). Table 5 below contains a list of the four groups--coordination units
(central, regional and local levels), the Ministry of Health (central, regional and local
levels), other Ministries, and civil society, including community-based organizations--as

                                                                31
well as each group's individual performance rating, which was developed according to
the criteria in the ICR Guidelines (Appendix A). The basis for these ratings may be found
in Annex 16.

118. Since each group of implementation agencies played quite different roles, their
contribution has been rated on a 3-point scale: High=3, Medium=2, and Low=1. Because
of their central role (financially and otherwise) to the success of the project, both the
Coordination Units and the Ministry of Health are rated as having a "high" importance.
Civil society is rated as mediumly important because they played a much more limited
role in terms of implementation activities (and financing). Finally, the remaining group--
other Ministries--is allocated low importance because of the peripheral role that they
played in comparison to the other groups.

119. It light of the various implementation delays, especially prior to the restructuring,
it is not surprising that the ratings for all four implementation groups are moderately
unsatisfactory. It should be noted that while the early problems with the coordination
units to a large extent were resolved with the restructuring and the hiring of a new Project
Coordinator, the Ministry of Health's performance had significant shortcomings
throughout the project, indicating a need to address these issues in a larger context and a
in more systemic manner; e.g., through health system reforms that would institute
performance-based remuneration for the MOH employees, who appeared among the least
motivated of all the implementation groups encountered during the ICR mission.With the
performance of all implementing agencies rated moderately unsatisfactory, so is the
overall performance of the implementing agencies .

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
120. Since both the GoN and the implementing agencies performance are rated

6. Lessons Learned

     Fighting and preventing HIV/AIDS is fundamental to the economic and social
     development of a country. Therefore, regardless of income level, governments should
     not rely only on donor resources which are characterized by unpredictability and
     uncertainty.

                                                             32
   The umbrella design/approach like that used in MAP projects does not allow the
   local context of each country environment and its epidemic(s) to be adequately
   reflected and sufficiently addressed. In the case of the Niger STI/HIV/AIDS Support
   Project, the MAP approach dictated a focus on slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS in
   the general population, which was inappropriate, given the concentrated nature of the
   epidemic. Furthermore, the utilization of adult prevalence rates as outcome indicators
   was also unsuitable, given the impossibility of determining the reasons for possible
   declines in such rates. Even though the PAD clearly indicates that the project was
   intended to focus on high-risk groups and areas, the PDOs did not do so, nor did
   implementation during the first part of the project.

   A multi-sectoral approach with responsibility for the fight against HIV/AIDS is
   inappropriate for a country with a concentrated epidemic, poor health indicators,
   and weak institutional capacity in all sectors. In a country like Niger, the major
   burden of disease is caused by maternal and child-related illnesses and a poorly
   functioning health system. As a result, it would be much more efficient to incorporate
   the fight against HIV/AIDS into a health operation that would focus on improving the
   health of women/mothers and children. Important multi-sectoral aspects could be
   incorporated into relevant sectoral projects (e.g., education, community-driven
   development, and infrastructure/transportation). The need for inter-sectoral
   coordination could still be achieved by establishing an inter-sectoral ministerial
   committee, which would not necessarily have overall responsibility for the fight
   against HIV/AIDS. Such an approach would be much more likely to succeed, because
   it would be simpler to implement and would require a much less complicated
   coordination structure.

   Locating the overall responsibility for the fight against HIV/AIDS outside the MOH is
   likely to undermine the ownership and, thus, the willingness of the MOH to implement
   its HIV/AIDS activities, which is crucial for the success of a national effort to slow
   the spread of the epidemic. Low pay and limited career prospects for most MOH staff
   frequently combine to create a cadre of civil servants with low morale and limited
   motivation. Taking away the prestige associated with being responsible for a nation's
   fight against a highly visible disease like HIV is likely to further undermine staff
   morale and motivation. Moreover, a more limited scope of the MOH's role in fighting
   the disease is likely to also reduce the amount of HIV/AIDS funds it controls, thus
   reducing any opportunities for patronage and corruption, which may also have a
   negative impact on staff morale and motivation. Since health ministries are not
   typically the most appropriate agency to implement all activities needed for an
   effective response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, other mechanisms have to be found to
   compensate for these shortcomings.

   It is necessary to clarify the institutional setting at the design stage to avoid dual
   oversight and to make sure that only one structure is accountable for project
   execution.

   Selection of a small number of appropriate outcome indicators with realistic and
   feasible targets would greatly improve both the monitoring and evaluation of the
   project's progress toward and achievement of its PDOs. The current Project provides
   an excellent example of how the poor quality or absence of outcome indicators
   renders project useless for monitoring purposes, thus undermining the validity of any
   PDO assessment that relies on them. Furthermore, the greater the number of
   indicators, the more difficult it is to derive overall outcome ratings and the less likely
   it is also that the project will actually be able to collect the necessary data for all
   indicators.

   Technical assistance for project execution and M&E should be embedded in this type
   of project, especially when national capacities are known to be weak. The technical
   assistance package should be flexible enough so that it can be redeployed to help
   address emerging challenges, as the implementation unfolds. For instance, technical
   assistance for M&E is essential to fine tune results framework, collect data, compare
   them and use them to better inform policies and strategies.

   It is inherently difficult to accurately assess how long it would take and how many
   resources would be required to build the necessary institutional capacity needed to
   implement complex projects in very low capacity environments, thus increasing the
   riskiness of any multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS project significantly. As discussed above,
   the preparation of this Project is noteworthy for the extensive and comprehensive
   institutional capacity assessments carried out. Yet, despite these assessments, the
   length of time and resources required to improve identified weaknesses were
   considerably underestimated, leading to delays in project implementation. In
   countries with as limited a capacity as Niger, it seems unlikely that capacity building
   needs could be assessed with a reasonable degree of accuracy/certainty.

   Demand-driven reliance on NGOs and CBOs to design and implement HIV/AIDS
   prevention activities targeted at sex workers is unlikely to succeed in countries
   characterized by (very) low literacy among women and high total fertility, because
   these women cannot read or write and hence establish NGOs/CBOs and apply for
   funding; nor are they likely to have any time or interest in doing so, due to their
   childbearing and child rearing duties. Thus, in this context, it may be necessary to
   ensure that certain organizations are tasked to provide these services and that they are
   provided with the necessary technical assistance from other countries to ensure that
   they are successful in their endeavor. Alternatively, international NGOs with a proven
   track record may be contracted to serve sex workers until local capacity has been
   created.

   Although umbrella NGO organizations serve a useful role in simplifying
   implementation of an NGO component, they may not be able to build the necessary
   institutional capacity among NGOs and CBOs, if they themselves lack knowledge of
   international best practices and/or have limited regional/local representation. This
   was clearly the case for some umbrella organizations contracted to implement the
   civil society component of this Project. The ICR mission heard numerous complaints

                                             34
   by individual NGOs/CBOs that several umbrella organizations contracted to
   implement Component 3 were lacking regional or local experience. Furthermore,
   none of the contracted umbrella organizations seemed to possess knowledge of
   successful experiences of NGOs working with, for example, sex workers, which
   contributed to the absence of NGOs dedicated to working with this important risk
   group.

   With a myriad of implementation agencies, it may be difficult to ensure project
   success, especially in low capacity environments (and possibly anywhere else). When
   many agencies are responsible for the implementation of different project activities,
   responsibility for project success gets diffused to such an extent as to make it
   extremely difficult to ensure the achievement of PDOs. No private sector company
   would ever employ a strategy that relies on "coordinators" as opposed to managers
   who can be held accountable for particular outcomes. This is a particular challenge
   for projects with a large NGO/CSO component.

   The success of complex, multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS projects in very low capacity
   environments is likely to be due to the commitment and competence of one or a few
   exceptional individuals. Since such individuals are typically few and far between, it
   makes such projects very risky. Furthermore, since the Bank has no mechanism to
   ensure that such individuals are found and hired, it is difficult to see how appropriate
   mitigation measures can be developed.

   Providing ARV therapy, whenever relevant, for PLWHAs may be necessary in low
   capacity countries to gain the trust of the population. While traditional economic
   analyses would suggest that it is not cost-effective to provide ARV therapy for
   PLWHAs and unaffordable for low-income countries to do so. However, the
   experience in Niger indicates that because of the (very) poor performance of the
   public health sector, the population has little trust in their government. As a result, if
   public IEC campaigns are to persuade people of the importance of HIV/AIDS and of
   the need to change ingrained, risky behaviors/traditions, it will be necessary to
   convince the public of the government's credibility. Providing ARV therapy for
   PLWHA would be one way to do so. Moreover, it may be necessary to convince
   people to get tested. It is certainly easy to understand that people would resist getting
   tested in case no treatment was available. Finally, in a very low prevalence
   environment, the cost of ARV therapy is unlikely to be prohibitively expensive as the
   number of people in need of such a therapy is limited and will remain so, if
   preventive efforts are successful.

   To the extent possible, M&E indicators for a Bank-financed project should rely on
   indicators collected as part of a routine, national M&E system to monitor progress
   on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which was designed to be an integral and appropriate
   part of a national health information system. In the case of Niger, the project-related
   M&E system did not become operational until several years in the Project, thereby
   limiting its utility. Furthermore, when a national M&E system was designed, it
   included 76 indicators to satisfy the different donors' requirement. Such a high

                                             35
   number is clearly both unnecessary and exceedingly costly to collect. As a result, the
   indicators are unlikely to ever be reliably collected and of good quality. Furthermore,
   in light of the very low prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, such a large number of
   indicators is unwarranted in comparison to the very limited number of indicators
   reliably collected as part of the routine health information system. The international
   donors urgently need to agree on a much smaller number of indicators that can be
   collected in a timely and cost-effective manner.

   Future operations by either the Bank or the GFTAM would do well to better
   coordinate so that the contributions of each agency may be more clearly attributable
   to one or the other institution. Closer collaboration during design would also help
   ensure optimal complementarity and efficiency of project management and
   implementation.

   Multisectoral HIV/AIDS projects, headed by non-HIV/AIDS specialists with multi-
   country experience, need to have extensive inputs from such specialists. The
   supervision of a multisectoral HIV/AIDS project is particularly challenging because
   of the needs for technical knowledge from many sectors. The current Project suggests
   that it is crucial, particularly in low capacity countries, to be able to rely on
   experiences from other countries which require extensive HIV/AIDS expertise as well
   as widespread knowledge of what has worked in other countries.'

   Indeed, three aspects appear to be critical, in terms of lessons learned, as we are
   prepare a follow up operation:

       Necessity to clarify the institutional setting, at the design stage (avoid dual
       oversight/ make sure that only one structure is accountable for the project
       execution);
       Fighting and preventing HIV AIDS is fundamentally a development cause, hence
       a Government should not rely only on donors resources; and
       Technical assistance for the project execution and M&E should be embedded in
       this type of project, especially when national capacities are known to be weak.
       The TA package should be also flexible enough so that it can be redeployed to
       help address emerging challenges as the implementation unfolds. TA in M& E,
       for instance is key, in terms of fine tuning results framework, collecting date,
       comparing them and using them to better inform policies and strategies.

                                Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.     The activities to be carried out under each of the projects components and
subcomponents are intended to address one or more of the following dimensions:
prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS-related diseases, and mitigation of the
impact of the epidemic.

Component 1 ­ Public Sector Responses for Prevention, Care, and Mitigation
2.      This component was divided into two Subcomponents--a) Health Sector
Response and b) Non-Health Sector Response--in order to recognize the important role
played by the Health Sector in the prevention, treatment, and, to a lesser extent,
mitigation of the impact of HIV/AIDS.

Subcomponent 1(a): Health Sector Activities
3.      The (public) health sector plays a pivotal role in the fight against HIV/AIDS
because of its responsibility for so many aspects of prevention, care, treatment, and to a
lesser extent mitigation of the epidemic. Because of the need for myriad health systems
strengthening activities, 85% of the costs for this subcomponent were devoted to
procurement of needed equipment, medications, reagents, supplies, furniture, and
rehabilitation of buildings and treatment centers. Table A2.1 below shows the break-
down of costs by purchase "category." As can be seen the two largest categories of
expenditures are medications, reagents, consumables; and equipment and medical
materials/supplies, which collectively account for about 92% of expenditures under this
subcomponent.

Component 2: Civil Society Response and Community-based Initiatives for
Prevention, Care, and Mitigation

7.     This component supported the intensification of prevention, care, and social
support to meet the needs of specific target groups, PLWHAs and their families. Three
types of activities were supported under this component:
   i.    Prevention and sensitization activities targeted at communities and specific groups at
         high-risk and aimed at building awareness, reducing stigma associated with HIV/AIDS,
         and the adoption of safer behavior (community-based IEC, promotion of the use of
         condoms at the community level, etc.)
  ii.    Provision of home and community-based care for AIDS patients
 iii.    Social support to PLWHA, orphaned children, and households affected by HIV/AIDS

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
11.     In the absence of data for economic and financial analysis, this section adopts the IEG
methodology for evaluation of the first generation of MAP projects, which bases the project's
economic and financial results on the counterfactual of no assistance and particularly on its
contribution to (i) deepen political commitment to contain the epidemic; (ii) expand and
strengthen national and sub-national AIDS institutions for long-run response; (iii) mobilize
NGOs to participate and reinforce their capacity to provide prevention and care among high-risk
groups most likely to contract and spread the infection; and (iv) enhance the efficiency of the
national AIDS programs.

12.      Political Commitment. As noted above, political commitment is strong at the highest
level of Government. The Project contributed to deepening this commitment in part by the
establishment of the NAC and in part by having the CISLS reside in the Cabinet of the President
(after restructuring). While political commitment, as evidenced by the number of action plans
and the number of activities carried out during the project, varies across the non-health ministries,
the most important from the perspective of fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic (e.g., education,
defense, transport) clearly have deepened their commitment to contain the epidemic through the
institutionalization of the Project's activities, work plans, etc. Even in public health sector
commitment has substantially increased (after restructuring).

13.     Expanded and Strengthened National AIDS Institutions. As described above, there is
clear evidence that capacity has substantially improved at the central level of the coordination
structure (the CISLS) and at the regional level. Capacity has also substantially improved at all
levels in the health sector as well as within the key non-health ministries, as discussed above.

14.     Mobilization and Strengthening of NGO Capacity to Provide Priority Services. As
discussed above, there is considerable evidence that the capacity of the NGO and CSO sector has
increased significantly. However, capacity at the local level and in the private sector still remains
to be strengthened. Furthermore, funding limitations constrain many of NGOs/CSOs from
scaling up their provision of services. Furthermore, it is doubtful that the GoN would continue to
support this sector, if funding was not available from external donors.

15.     Enhanced Efficiency. One of the results of the improved capacity built both in the
public and the NGO sector as well as the central and regional coordination units is that these
actors are now much more efficient in their jobs. Having the tools, understanding the procedures,
and having experience with the required procedures and tasks collectively result in significant
efficiency gains. However, in light of the limited utilization of certain types of equipment, e.g.,
CT4 counters, which in some places are only used twice per week to do 15 tests, it is clear that
there are still many efficiency gains to be achieved.

(AIDS). It decided to deal with the pandemic by establishing an institutional framework
and structures for developing and applying a policy to combat STIs and HIV/AIDS.
Various plans were prepared and implemented to cover the following periods: 1987-1989
(short-term plan); 1990-1992 (first medium-term plan); 1994-1998 (second medium-term
plan).

2.      The annual plans (1999-2001) laid the groundwork for the preparation of the
third-generation medium-term plan. This led, in May 2002, to the adoption, through a
participatory and multisectoral process, of an STI/HIV/AIDS National Strategic
Framework for 2002-2006.

3.     This framework defined the policy as well as the coordinating and implementing
bodies at the national and regional levels. It encouraged political commitment at the
highest level and sustained commitment from technical and financial partners, notably the
World Bank. This was reflected in the financing of the Multi-Sectoral STI/HIV/AIDS
Support Project 2003-2008.

1.1.2 Economic and social situation

4.      At the start of the project, Niger was facing an economic and financial crisis
linked to a difficult geoeconomic environment. The persistence of the economic crisis
and the impoverishment of the population were major obstacles to the fight against the
HIV/AIDS epidemic. Poverty, most pronounced in rural areas, affects women and rural
communities in particular, resulting in a structural food shortage, ongoing degradation of
the ecosystem, a massive rural exodus, strong demographic growth and a fragile health
system.

1.1.3 Status of the epidemic and major problems

5.      Since the first [AIDS] cases were announced, the epidemic has steadily grown,
but at varying rates in different population groups. In 2002, the HIV prevalence rate was
0.87 percent, with rates ranging from 1.4 percent among teachers to a peak of 25.4
percent among sex workers.



                                            52
6.      Niger faces a rapid expansion of the HIV epidemic due to risky behavior and to
the high vulnerability of young people, women, children, and mobile population groups.
Most of the early interventions had mixed results owing to the following factors:
        
   Geographical and environmental factors: extreme poverty among the population,
   internal and external migration, geographical location, etc.
   Socio-cultural factors: prostitution, low levels of schooling, social image of STI;
   Institutional factors: weak institutional capacity, low utilization of health services;
   and
   Limited resources with insufficient AIDS control activities.

1.1.4 Institutional framework

7.     The institutional framework in which the project was implemented was defined
by the STI/HIV/AIDS National Strategic Framework for 2002-2006. During this period,
AIDS efforts were organized and coordinated by policy and coordinating bodies, namely:
        The National AIDS Council [Conseil national de lutte contre le SIDA CNLS]
           chaired by the president of the Republic;
        The Intersectoral AIDS Coordinating Committee [Coordination
           intersectorielle de lutte contre le SIDA CISLS], which was initially attached to
           the Prime Minister's office and, from 2007 onward, to the President's
           Cabinet;
        The Joint Monitoring Committee [Comité mixte de suivi CMS], which became
           the Steering Committee [Comité de pilotage], with the adoption of the
           strategic framework for 2008-2012.

8.     These bodies have regional and departmental divisions. The implementing bodies
round out the institutional framework, with sectoral AIDS committees, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and associations, and community-based organizations (CBOs)
operating through the supervising agencies.

1.2 Project objectives

9.      The Multi-Sectoriel AIDS Support Project was designed to support Niger in the
implementation of the STI/HIV/AIDS National Strategic Framework for 2002-2006. The
project's development objectives were (a) to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in the general
population; (b) to reduce the adverse impact of HIV/AIDS on individuals and
communities; (c) to strengthen Niger's capacity to formulate, manage, establish, monitor
and evaluate a viable HIV/AIDS program with acceptable cost-effectiveness. These
objectives were to be achieved through a multisectoral approach based on comparative
advantages and multiple partnerships with the public and private sectors and with civil
society.

10.     Following the mid-term review of the project in 2006, the development objective
was geared to performance evaluation rather than to measurement of the prevalence of
the epidemic. Thus, a new objective was formulated and approved in 2007, i.e., to help

                                            53
improve: (a) the coverage and utilization of HIV prevention, care, mitigation and
treatment services; and (b) the provision of information to the population on preventing
STI/HIV/AIDS. In order to monitor performance, indicators were defined at the outset and
revised after the mid-term evaluation in order to assess the progress made in the second
phase.

1.3 Project components

11.    The Project, which went into effect on October 10, 2003, had four components: (i)
programs of activities of public-sector implementing agencies; (ii) civil society activities
and community initiatives; (iii) capacity-building; (iv) coordination, monitoring and
evaluation.

12.     The coverage that these components were able to achieve depended on the
implementation of interventions encompassing the various facets of the campaign:
- Prevention, through activities to encourage commitment on the part of authorities and
    leaders, knowledge of HIV, and behavior change within the population and especially
    among groups at risk;
- Treatment, by improving and fully integrating high-quality STI/HIV/AIDS care and
    counseling into all levels of the health system;
- Mitigation, to reduce the effects of HIV/AIDS on people living with HIV/AIDS
    (PLWHA), their families and their communities;
- Capacity-building for program facilitation and implementation, through interventions
    aimed at improving national capacity for effective management, monitoring,
    evaluation, implementation and leadership.

1.4 Organization and fulfillment of the project in the supervising ministry and the
    other ministries and agencies involved in project execution

13.     The organization and fulfillment of the project were defined in such a way that
each stakeholder had roles and responsibilities. Thus, the CISLS was responsible for
project management, coordination, and monitoring. The sectoral committees in the
ministries drew up action plans which they executed for their target population. Civil
society organizations prepared subprojects with the assistance of the four supervising
agencies recruited for that purpose. The components implemented were organization of
[information] campaigns, prevention activities, care and counseling, as well as
socioeconomic support.



II. PROJECT DESIGN, EXECUTION, FULFILLMENT AND IMPACT

2.1 Evaluation of the project design

14.    The project aimed to support the multisectoral plan, which was designed on a
multisectoral and decentralized basis, bringing together various actors (all ministries,

                                             54
civil society, regions and departments) for a period of five years. Implementation of the
public sector plans: public entities at the national and decentralized levels proposed work
programs and submitted them to the CISLS for approval and funding. A formal
contractual agreement concerning the budgeted work program was signed by the CISLS
and the public entities (sectoral committees).

15.    This agreement also included indicators for monitoring the utilization of resources,
execution of activities and results obtained, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the
contract signers. It governed the relations between the various actors and the CISLS.

16.    Implementation of the civil society component: the CISLS subcontracted the
responsibility for implementing the interventions contained in the civil society
component to several experienced executing agencies known as supervising agencies.
The role of these agencies was to supervise the execution of field activities by NGOs,
associations and CBOs. In this capacity, they provided training to members of the NGOs,
associations and CBOs in preparing and managing the subprojects. They also locally
supervised the execution of activities by civil society organizations.

17.       Three supervising agencies took part in the project:
      -   CARE International;
      -   Center for International Cooperation in Health and Development (CCISD);
      -   French Association of Volunteers of Progress and Lafia Matassa.

18.     The NGOs and CBOs, which were supervised by the four agencies, prepared
subprojects that were centralized, reviewed, and submitted to the Regional Approval
Committee [Comité régional d'approbation CRA] for financing. Once approved, the
subprojects were transmitted by the CRA to the CISLS, which allocated the funds to the
supervising agencies; they in turn financed the civil society stakeholders directly. The
supervised stakeholders supplied quarterly activity reports to the agencies, which
centralized them at the agency level. They also supplied reports to the CISLS and the
regional coordinating committees.

19.     As regards the financing of the subprojects, of 1,282 applications submitted to the
approval committees for review, 1,062 (or 82.84 %) were approved and 900 projects (or
84.74 percent of the approved applications) were financed in an amount of 2,324,932,514
CFA francs. Upon completion of the project, with the help of these agencies, Niger had
several community organizations whose capacity to fight AIDS had been strengthened.
This is a gain that has encouraged ownership by civil society of certain components of
the campaign, such as prevention, support and psychological care.

III. RESULTS OBTAINED BY COMPONENT

3.1. Organization

3.1.1 Coordination, monitoring and evaluation



                                             55
20.      Project financing allowed policy, coordinating, and implementing bodies to be set
up at the national and regional levels. In the course of implementation, however, these
bodies were unable to play their roles fully for reasons related to leadership and
misunderstanding of one another's roles. As a result, this component was greatly
weakened during the first two years of the project. Meetings of the various bodies were
rarely held, although they had been planned at all levels. This was particularly true of the
policy meetings (CMS and CNLS) and coordination meetings at the various levels of
project implementation. This situation hindered effective communication between
stakeholders and prevented interventions from having acceptable visibility. The same
assessment can be made concerning supervision. Apart from the supervising agencies,
few AIDS organizations regularly carried out supervision activities, even though funds
were available for such activities. It must be noted, however, that the lack of an effective
monitoring and evaluation system during almost the entire project execution period
fostered this situation. Notable progress was seen toward the end of the project with the
preparation and approval of a single, joint National Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, with
all the tools needed for its implementation, the strengthening of the regional coordinating
committees with the addition of persons in charge of monitoring and evaluation, and the
setting up of a Country Response Information System (CRIS) (database) on a pilot basis
at the central level and in three regions. Supervision is now carried out regularly and is
integrated with other programs, such as the Malaria and Tuberculosis Program. Since
data-gathering technology has been made available to actors at all levels, information can
be transmitted more easily. Several surveys that were conducted helped to remedy the
lack of information on a number of project indicators.

3.1.2. Studies, surveys and other inquiries

21.     These outputs made it possible to have the technical support needed to obtain
strategic information useful in program monitoring and decision-making, and to
strengthen the capacities of the actors as regards project management and implementation.

22.     During the implementation of the project, several consultancies were carried out,
accounting for 12 percent of the project's total budget. In particular, the preparation of
the strategic documents with the help of international or national consultants put a strain
on the budget in the "Consultant services" category.

23.      The preparation of strategic documents, such as the monitoring and evaluation
plan and manual, the national multisectoral plans and the strategic communication
framework, cost the project large sums. Nevertheless, it must be noted that this support
provided the program with several strategic documents that are likely to promote AIDS
efforts in a multisectoral context.

24.   However, strengthening local expertise to promote better ownership of the
documents with a view to their implementation remains a major challenge in this area.




                                             56
3.1.3. Strengthening the capacities of the members of the sectoral and regional
committees

25.     During the implementation of the project, 5,505 actors received capacity-building
in different areas. The actors concerned include members of community organizations,
NGOs and associations. On the other hand, it was noted that there was insufficient
capacity-building as regards the coordinating body and its regional divisions. Despite the
strengthened capacities of some staff in specific areas such as coordination and
implementation of activities, the project could have done better by targeting its
strengthening programs to areas related to the characteristics of the epidemic in Niger.
However, the activities that were carried out helped to increase the ownership of project
interventions by technical staff at the national and regional levels. In fact, strengthening
the capacities of the staff of the intersectoral coordinating committees and the sectoral
planning, monitoring, evaluation, program management and training supervision
committees to enable them to capitalize on their experiences and fulfill their task of
coordinating the fight against AIDS remains a major challenge.

3.2.   Training and awareness-raising in the area of prevention

26.    Several areas were covered in this regard, namely, training actors in behavior
change, communication and disseminating messages concerning STI/HIV/AIDS. During
the implementation of the project, particular emphasis was put on community-driven
communication strategies based on peer education.

27.     Accordingly, several peer educators from the Project's priority groups (young
people, commercial sex workers, the mobile population, the defense and security forces,
opinion leaders, workers in various sectors) received training in behavior change
communication in order to carry out community-based awareness-raising activities. Thus,
360,757 peer educators were trained in all categories. In addition, other training was
carried out on several themes, such as monitoring/mentoring, preventing mother-to-child
transmission, and care of STIs.

28.      The training provided to these various stakeholders significantly improved their
skill in conducting activities consistent with the project's vision. In the last two years in
particular, these activities were carried out in an intensive manner. As a consequence,
several community-based awareness-raising sessions were held through peer education
among the priority target groups, and information messages on AIDS were broadcast by
national, private, and community radio and television stations. As a result of these
interventions, the project contributed to reaching 489,010 persons, including young
people, members of the defense and security forces, sex workers, and members of the
clergy.

29.     Mention should also be made of the training provided to several operational
health workers in various areas, such as care of STIs, MTCT, counseling and voluntary
testing. The Project did not in fact finance the purchase of condoms, since there was a
social marketing project financed by the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (a German

                                              57
cooperation agency), but supervising agencies bought condoms and made them available
to civil society organizations as part of the implementation of the subprojects. This
experiment was quickly abandoned, because the condoms had to be managed under cost
recovery, but the civil society organizations were unable to recoup the funds invested in
order to renew the initial stocks.

30.     Another deficiency of this component that must also be noted was the failure to
implement the Strategic Communication Framework [Cadre stratégique de
communication]. This national document, which should have been the tool of reference
with regard to strategic policy, was never operationalized. This greatly hampered the
efforts to step up communication activities in time and space.

3.3.   Confidential voluntary counseling and testing

31.     Under the auspices of the community voluntary counseling and testing centers
[Centres de conseils et dépistage volontaire communautaire CDVC], nine mass testing
campaigns were conducted in which 37,216 persons were tested, 1,800 of whom were
HIV-positive. Through a contribution from the Project, which made reagents available,
13,871 persons were voluntarily tested at independent, permanent [testing] centers, with
1,244 of them HIV-positive. In addition, support from the project made it possible to
reach out to 60,177 pregnant women in the context of preventing MTCT. Lastly, with
regard to blood transfusion safety, 188,574 blood pouches were tested, 4,239 of which
were positive. During the project, voluntary counseling and testing were financed by the
Project in the form of a mass testing campaign. Generally speaking, however, the testing
campaigns did not prove to be as successful as had been hoped, as shown by the results
mentioned above.

32.    Since this dimension is critically important in terms of preventing the risk of HIV
transmission and early care of PLWHA, improving the performance of the testing centers
remains a major challenge in spite of the progress achieved.

33.     With an eye to the future, therefore, it is essential to invest in a process of
integrating the VCT centers into the health centers up to the periphery, following the
example set by the MTCT activities. These activities are now yielding conclusive results,
as attested by the 60,177 pregnant women who were reached with the contribution from
the project. If carried out well, this process can promote the ownership and sustainability
of the gains.

3.4. Care and counseling

34.     This component includes comprehensive HIV care, i.e., treatment with
antiretroviral drugs, prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections, psychosocial
monitoring, and therapeutic monitoring and mentoring.




                                            58
3.4.1. Care and counseling activities

35.      In the area of care and counseling, 2,560 health workers received training in
treatment with ARV drugs, testing and treatment of opportunistic infections, as well as
psychological monitoring and mentoring of PLWHA. The same period saw the creation
and scaling up of the treatment centers and VCT centers. Niger now has 13 treatment
centers throughout the country. This has improved access to ARV drugs in all regions. A
total of 6,982 patients were monitored in the treatment centers; by June 30, 2009, 4,822
had received ARV drugs. It must be pointed out, however, that at the start of the patient
care program, there were disruptions in the supply of reagents and medicines owing to
weaknesses in the supply chain. These disruptions were overcome with the help of
neighboring countries (Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, etc.). Overcoming this supply
management problem was at the heart of all the International Development Association
(IDA) support missions and those of other STI/HIV/AIDS technical partners. In its later
years, the project helped to strengthen the CISLS, the Sectoral AIDS Unit [Unité de lutte
sectorielle du SIDA ULSS] and the Specific Management Unit [Unité de gestion
specifique UGS] in the Ministry of Public Health in this area. This allowed Niger to take
the first steps toward controlling the quantification of reagents and medicines on the basis
of sound knowledge of the number of patients registered at the care and treatment centers.

36.     Despite significant advances, however, several challenges remain to be met,
including the involvement of private networks and the extension of treatment and
monitoring centers. The latter can be networked with the former, thereby increasing
access to care for PLWHA. Other challenges include expanding the testing of HIV-
positive individuals so that they can receive early care and treatment and improving the
distribution of factors of production through total control of needs in accordance with the
flow of existing cases, expected cases, and the therapeutic scheme.

3.5. Socioeconomic support

37.    The activities under this component deal with the precarious living conditions of
people vulnerable to HIV (PLWHA, vulnerable orphans and children, commercial sex
workers, vulnerable girls). They generally involve income-generating activities (trade,
sewing, stock-fattening, etc.).

3.5.1. Socioeconomic support activities

38.     The activities under this heading were very inadequately financed in view of the
extent of poverty in the country. In fact, only 100 PLWHA, 40 vulnerable girls and 189
commercial sex workers benefited from income-generating activities to deal with
precarious living conditions and vulnerability throughout the country during the five
years of the project. Since STI/HIV/AIDS are events that foster precarious living
conditions and poverty and are at the same time aggravated by vulnerability, providing
socioeconomic support to certain target groups remains a challenge to be met. The mixed
results of the activities under this heading, as revealed by the internal evaluation, were
due in large part to the invisibility of PLWHA and, as a consequence, the small number

                                            59
of associations focusing on them. Added to this was the weak technical expertise of the
organizations that received financing. Normally, the subprojects' start-up funds should
generate profits with which to finance new subprojects.

39.    Nevertheless, during the later years of the project, organizations dedicated to
PLWHA, particularly the regional networks, received training in financial management
and preparation of subprojects, and this led to an improvement in the indicators for this
component.

III. ANALYSIS OF INDICATORS

40.     In order to monitor the progress achieved in project implementation, several
indicators were defined. The mid-term analysis of the results obtained shows that several
indicators have no data for 2006, and this reflects the weakness of the monitoring and
evaluation system at the time. The data available show a decline in the HIV prevalence
rate midway through the period, from 0.87 percent in 2002 to 0.7 percent in 2006
(according to the Demographic and Health Survey [Enquête démographique et de santé
et à indicateurs multiples EDSN] 2006). This indicates a stabilization of the HIV
prevalence rate in the general population, in line with initial projections.

41.   Knowledge about HIV improved. Services were also strengthened, and this
improved access to voluntary testing, treatment, MTCT prevention and peer education.

42.     Toward the end of the project in 2008, the reporting system was greatly improved,
and this helped to fill in the data for nearly all the indicators that were defined for
monitoring the second phase.

43.      In analyzing the trend of the indicators, we note significant progress in all areas of
project intervention. In fact, the project helped to facilitate access to ARV drugs,
representing 52.5 percent of patients needing treatment with ARV drugs who received it
in 13 treatment centers around the country. In addition, 61 percent of HIV-positive
women received treatment with ARV drugs to prevent transmission of HIV to their
infants.

39.      As an example of the progress achieved, it can be noted that:

      87.3 percent of commercial sex workers said that they had used a condom with their
      last client, compared with 79 percent in 2006;
      108,140 women and men aged 15­49 (15 percent) underwent voluntary testing and
      knew the results in 2008;
      39 percent of women and 51 percent of men aged 15­24 were perfectly aware of the
      modes of HIV transmission and the means of HIV prevention in 2008, compared with
      13.4 percent of women and 20 percent of men aged 15­24 year-olds;
      The monitoring and evaluation system was expanded to the regions in accordance
      with the recommendations of the IDA technical support missions.



                                              60
44.    Lastly, the outcome of the activities described by component in the preceding
sections, particularly those relating to prevention (information, education and
communication/behavior change communication), greatly contributed to influencing the
HIV prevalence rate in several high-risk groups. Thus, from 2002 to 2008, it went from
(source: Second Generation Survey [Enquête de seconde génération] 2008):

   25.4 percent to 20.89 percent among commercial sex workers;
   1.4 percent to 0.25 percent among teachers;
   2.8 percent to 2.69 percent in the prison population;
   4.4 percent to 1.03 percent among migrant workers;
   2.17 percent to 1.31 percent among miners;
   3.8 percent to 1.56 percent among members of the defense and security forces.

45.     However, the rate increased in certain target groups, such as youths aged 15­24
(from 0.2 percent to 0.32 percent), pregnant women (0.96 percent to 2.02 percent) and
truck drivers (from 1.7 percent to 1.83 percent). This situation could be due to the manner
in which beneficiaries of the interventions were targeted. Some groups were
insufficiently addressed, namely, prisoners, young people, and pregnant women.

IV. STRONG POINTS

   An organizational and institutional system was put in place (CNLS, CMS, CISLS,
   sectoral, regional and subregional committees);
   There was a strong political commitment on the part of authorities at all levels;
   Strategic documents were prepared (PNM, strategic framework, strategic
   communication framework, monitoring and evaluation plan);
   The structural capacities of different organizations were strengthened (rolling stock,
   computer stock, sanitation equipment, medicines, reagents and consumables);
   The capacities of the CISLS were strengthened in terms of staff and equipment;
   Greater enthusiasm was seen on the part of the actors involved, particularly those in
   civil society and the public sector;
   A plan was implemented to heighten the visibility of the campaign (signs, posters);
   Training modules on STI/HIV/AIDS were developed;
   HIV prevalence was reduced in several high-risk groups.

V. WEAK POINTS

   The functioning of various committees was weak (irregular consultation meetings,
   committee meetings, coordination meetings and supervision and advocacy missions);
   The resources provided were insufficient to enable the committees to function;
   The annual action plans were insufficiently implemented;
   The capacities of the actors involved, in particular of the coordinating and sectoral
   committees, were insufficiently strengthened;
   Insufficient data were produced and collected;
   Socioeconomic support activities for vulnerable persons and infected persons were
   inadequately financed;

                                            61
   There was no clear strategy for condom distribution by the project;
   The private sector was not involved in AIDS activities during the project;
   The supervising agencies' field activities were insufficiently monitored by the
   regional coordinating committees;
   There was no recourse to local expertise for surveys, the preparation of strategic
   documents and technical support, resulting in exorbitant costs for the outputs;
   The communication framework was not operationalized;
   Communication activities were insufficiently financed.

VI. LESSONS LEARNED

   Owing to the use of supervising agencies, Niger now has local organizations with
   proven capacities to implement STI/HIV/AIDS subprojects;
   The low level of autonomy granted to the decentralized coordinating bodies (regional
   and sectoral) in signing and executing contracts with NGOs did not encourage rapid
   implementation and monitoring of the activities;
   The weak financing of certain activities, such as the training of coordination staff,
   field supervision activities and interpersonal communication, dealt a harsh blow to
   cooperation between the actors involved and to flows of strategic information on the
   project, resulting in insufficient data, particularly for the indicators covering the
   project's early years;
   The weak involvement of public and private health providers in the VCT centers
   hindered the achievement of conclusive results in that area;
   The failure to strengthen the expertise and motivation of project staff posed a major
   obstacle to better program management and coordination of interventions in real time;
   The low visibility of leadership on the part of political authorities in general posed an
   obstacle to accelerated achievement of the performance indicators;
   The failure to integrate HIV issues into community development plans hindered the
   provision of a more appropriate local response.

VII. RECOMMENDATIONS

   Accelerate the production of regulatory instruments creating committees in
   accordance with the new National Strategic Framework, and give them the support
   they need to function properly;
   Support the CISLS regions and management in the production of annual action plans
   and ensure that they are financed;

VIII. CHALLENGES

1. Strong HIV prevalence in certain population groups;
2. Access by the population to high-quality prevention, treatment, and socioeconomic
   support services.

IX. PROSPECTS

1. Ensure access by the general population, and high-risk groups in particular, to high-
   quality prevention and treatment services;
2. Provide economic and social support to PLWHA and other persons affected by
   HIV/AIDS;
3. Continue to strengthen the capacities of the relevant actors in order to attain the
   objectives set.

X. CONCLUSION

46.      The project established an adequate institutional and organizational system, even
if its performance was mixed. It also provided the various implementing bodies of the
Project with important assets in terms of materials and equipment and expertise regarding
HIV/AIDS issues. In addition, several strategic documents were drawn up with a view to
strengthening and providing better policy guidance to the campaign. Although capacity-
building was insufficient, several actors received training in various areas which enabled
them to improve their service delivery. All these gains are likely to promote the
sustainability of the activities.

Comments on Draft ICR

The report reflects the overall reality of the implementation of the project. However, we
would like to make the following comments:

   In its present form, certain paragraphs require reformulation to increase the
   comprehension of the document (for example pages 33 to 36). The document also
   includes some typos to be corrected.
   As for the contents:
        The document emphasized the positive changes in the implementation of
            project after the reorganization. As a result of the noted improvements, we
            would expect a rating of at least "moderately satisfactory."
        Civil society in Niger, which was inexperienced and of low capacity at the
            beginning of the project, was reinforced thanks to the activities of
            implementation agencies, which were very costly to the project. This
            significant achievement is not developed enough in the report and should be
            elaborated further.



                                            63
   In our opinion, the evaluation of sub-projects under the component civil
   company deserves to be re-examined. Indeed, as the report emphasizes, the
   target (number of sub-projects) was exceeded at no additional cost (900 sub-
   projects were financed by the end of the project in comparison to the 600
   planned).
   The report emphasizes the problem of motivation among the employees of the
   Ministry of Public Health; however, this aspect concerns all the actors.
   It is important to emphasize that the new National Strategic Framework for
   the Fight against STI/HIV/AIDS for 2008-2012, which is in the process of
   being implementation, emphasized targeted interventions directed at high-risk
   population groups in order to reduce the incidence of the disease.
   The report notes that the M&E system functions well. According to the
   [project M&E] consultant, certain aspects of the system deserve to be
   improved, which has not yet been done.

Annex 10: Limitation of Prevalence and Incidence as a Measure*

Limitations of prevalence
HIV prevalence represents the total number of HIV infections, new and old. In contrast,
HIV incidence reflects recent infections, usually expressed as the number of new HIV
infections acquired in the last year. HIV prevalence is easier to measure and is thus far
more commonly measured than HIV incidence.

The following major limitations of HIV are identified:
    HIV prevalence is slow to respond to changes in HIV risk behavior and HIV
       incidence
    In concentrated epidemics, HIV prevalence in the general population reflects the
       tail-end of a long infection chain
    HIV prevalence provides no timely information as to whether a project is on or
       off track and does not enable management by results
    HIV prevalence depends on the balance between incidence and mortality, which
       may be changed by increasing access to treatment
    HIV prevalence changes cannot be attributed to a single development partner's
       efforts--they reflect the totality of national and international HIV responses
    HIV prevalence measures may not be consistent or stable over time

Limitations of incidence
    In concentrated epidemics, HIV incidence in the general population also reflects
       the tail end of an infection chain
    HIV incidence changes also cannot be attributed to a single development partner's
       efforts--they reflect the totality of combined responses
    HIV incidence measures may also not be consistent or stable or time
    HIV incidence is expensive and difficult to measure, so it is not a practical part of
       a routine monitoring and evaluation system
    Using HIV data among young people, such as antenatal clients aged 15-19
       provides a reasonable proxy for HIV incidence, but still has limitations and
       should be analyzed alongside other incidence data.

Annex 14: Risk to Development Outcome Assessment Methodology

1.      The ICR Guidelines (Appendix A) indicate that the Risk to Development Outcome is the
product of the likelihood of one or more detrimental changes happens times the impact of these
changes if they occur. Thus, assessing this risk requires identifying the most likely detrimental
changes and estimating the probability that they will occur. Since this cannot be done in a
mathematically precise way, the following method has been used. First, the potential risks are
identified (column 1 in the table below). Second, the probability of each risk is estimated (column
2). Third numeric values are assigned to both the impacts and the probabilities. Somewhat
arbitrarily, but consistent with ICR ratings, four-point scales have been used for both.

2.      For the impacts, 4=High Impact, 3=Substantial Impact, 2=Modest Impact, and 1=Negligible.
For the probabilities High probability=75%-100%, Substantial probably=50%-75%, Modest
probability=25%-50%, and Negligible probably=0-25%. To obtain point estimates for the
probabilities the intervals are replaced by their midpoints. The estimated "risk to development
outcomes" is determined by calculating the "expected risk outcome," which is the sum of the
impacts multiplied by their respective probability point estimates. The expected risk to development
outcome in the current case is calculated to 3.39, corresponding to an overall substantial risk to
development outcome.

                                                                                                                   Individual

3.     While this approach admittedly is somewhat arbitrary, it has the advantage of explicitly and
consistently taking into account all different risks, their potential impact, and the probability with
which they occur. This approach makes clear the importance not only of the impacts and
probabilities of the risks but also the number of risks. In case of Niger, just one more risk of modest
probability but substantial impact would raise the overall risk to development outcome from
substantial to high, which might not have been intuitively obvious.
