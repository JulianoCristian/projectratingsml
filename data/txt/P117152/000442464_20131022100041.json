"versiontyp": "Revised", "loan_no": "7802", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The objective of the Kakheti Regional\n            Roads Improvement Project for Georgia is to: (i) reduce\n            transport costs and improve access between Vaziani, Gombori\n            and Telavi; and (ii) improve traffic safety along the\n            Vaziani-Gombori-Telavi (VGT) road and along the\n            Vaziani-Sagarejo-Bakhurtsikhe-Bakhurtsikhe-Gurjaani-Telavi\n            road. Some of the negative impacts include: noise pollution,\n            soil pollution, water pollution, spoil and inert\n            construction wastes, hazardous construction wastes, topsoil\n            losses due to topsoil stripping, impact on archaeological\n            sites, and transport related impacts. Mitigation measures\n            include: 1) prevent operation of vehicles in the river and\n            if there is no alternative, inspection of vehicles will be\n            required to ensure that there is no leakage of fuel and\n            lubricating materials; 2) contractors will ensure the proper\n            handling of lubricants, fuel and solvents. Fuel and\n            lubricant storage tanks will not be located within 50m of\n            any watercourse, well or dry gorges; 3) allow local\n            communities to utilize any excess rock, which may be left\n            following reuse. Suitable access to the materials will be\n            agreed with the local authorities in consultation with the\n            community; 4) topsoil removed from the highway itinerary\n            will be used for reinstatement of the topsoil in the\n            adjacent construction corridor affected by the project\n            activities. Topsoil from the sites, which will not be\n            reinstated to the initial conditions will be distributed\n            carefully on the surrounding area; and 5) road department\n            should ensure permanent erosion and land stability control\n            and monitoring of landscape restoration after completion of\n            construction works, as well as timely implementation of\n            corrective actions."}, "docdt": "2013-08-01T00:00:00Z"}
