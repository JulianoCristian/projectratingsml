                         Implementation Status Overview
                         On November 20, 2013, Level-II Restructuring of the Project was approved in response to the Government of Georgia's requests dated of February 26, 2013 and December 5, 2012.
                         The project closing date is extended from November 30, 2013 to August 30, 2015 and the rehabilitation of another road - Sasadilo-Sioni (17 km), which feeds the Vaziani-Gombori-
                         Telavi circuit road has been added under this project.

                         Project implementation is progressing well and on track towards the achievement of the PDO. As a result of the completed first two civil works contracts by 2011 and 2012
                         (rehabilitating total 65 km of roads), transport costs have reduced significantly: (i) travel time between Vaziani and Telavi via Gombori has been reduced from 120 min to 55 min

                         (against the target of 55 min); (ii) vehicle operating costs have been reduced for cars from US$0.36 per veh per km to US$0.17 (against the target of US$0.25) and for trucks from US
                         $1.05 to US$0.65 (against the target of US$ of 0.72). Similar travel time savings and reduction in vehicle operation costs are expected on Sasadilo-Sioni road after its rehabilitation.
                         The implementation of Phase 1 of priority small-scale road safety improvement works has contributed to reduction in road crashes, which is recorded at 51.7% decrease (against
                         target of 30%). Phase 2 road safety works, which is under implementation, and Phase 3 road safety works and awareness and education campaigns to be carried out in Kakheti

                         region before the end of the project are expected to help maintain a declining trend in road crashes on Kakheti regional roads.

                         The first two civil works contracts under the first component of improvement of the Vaziani Gombori Telavi road were completed in 2011 and 2012. The Roads Department (RD)
                         continues monitoring a landslide prone area on the Gombori-Telavi section. The design-build contract for the rehabilitation of the Sasadilo-Sioni road (with 5 bridges) which was
                         added under this component during restructuring of this project in November 2013 was awarded in December 2013. The design for the first 5 km has been prepared and is under
                         review by the RD; the contractor continues the preparation of the design for the remainder of the road.

                         The second component (road safety component and institutional strengthening) is progressing well. Phase 1 of priority road safety measures identified in the Road Safety
                         Management Plan for the Vaziani-Telavi-Bakhurstikhe Sagarejo-Vaziani ring road was completed on November 30, 2013. Phase 2 of priority road safety measures on Bakurtsikhe-
                         Gurjaani section has been tendered out. To make more positive road safety impact on this section in the longer term, the project extends support to the preparation of the feasibility
                         study and bidding documents for the construction of Bakurtsikhe-Gurjaani bypass to divert heavy transit traffic.
