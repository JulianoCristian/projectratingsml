 The Project will close on August 30, 2015. The achievement of the project Development Objectives is rated satisfactory. The Project has supported the
 rehabilitation of 82 km of roads in Kakheti region which contributed to the reduction of travel time on Vaziani-Gombori-Telavi road from 120 min to 55
 min and reduction of vehicle operation costs from US$0.36 per vehicle per km to US$0.25 for cars and from US$1.05 to US$0.72. The implementation
 of two phases of small-scale road safety works contributed to 51.7 percent reduction in road accidents with fatalities on the Vaziani-Sagarejo-
 Bakurtsikhe-Gurjaani-Telavi section. Phase III of small scale road safety works is ongoing and will be completed by August 30. The ongoing Road
 Safety Awareness and Education campaign is expected to help increase the public awareness of the need to improve road safety behavior and better
 educate different groups of road users in traffic rules in Kakheti region.
