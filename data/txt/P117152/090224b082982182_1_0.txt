 Project implementation is progressing well and on track towards the achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO).
 So far, the upgrading of the road Linking Vaziani, Gombori, and Telavi successfully contributed to a reduction in travel time by more than 50% (from 120
 min to 55 min), and a reduction in vehicle operating costs, which have been reduced for cars from US$0.36 per veh per km to US$0.25 and for trucks
 from US$1.05 to US$0.72. Furthermore, implementation of road safety improvement works on the Vaziani-Telavi road contributes to a reduction in road
 accidents, as the number of road crashes with fatalities has been reduced by 51.7%, exceeding the final target of 30%.
 Rehabilitation of Sasadilo-Sioni road is ongoing and progressing well. Implementation of Phase 2 small-scale road safety works on the Vaziani-
 Telavi road is about to be completed, and the Roads Department (RD) is proceeding for the development and implementation of Phase 3 small-scale
 road safety works. Road safety campaign is about to be launched and carried out by NGO in Kakheti region.
