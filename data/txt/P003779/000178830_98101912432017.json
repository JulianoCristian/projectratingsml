lives\n            and damage to property caused by flooding of rivers in the\n            Indramayu area of West Java. The project consists of:\n            construction of river training, flood control and related\n            works; a river estuary study to enable a description and\n            analysis to be made of the coastal and littoral process in\n            the vicinity of Indramayu; and a flood control operations\n            study to ensure that the project works will function\n            effectively in a flood emergency. The project will create a\n            demand for some 27,500 man-years of labor over the\n            construction period, and will increase rice production by\n            about 6,100 tons per year by 1989. The project will bear\n            moderate risks, as is normal for flood control projects."}, "docdt": "1979-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
