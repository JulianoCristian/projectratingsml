Agreement. Twoof these actions needto be amended.

5.      Action 3 states, Social
                        "The     Cabinet approvedoperational
                                        has       an          manual,
prepared by the Borrower's National Institute for price Stabilization (INESPRE), for a
targetedfoodsubsidyprogram,andsuchInstitutehasinitiatedtheimplementationof
such program."

6.      InAugust2004,PresidentFernandezannounced the launch of anewfoodsubsidy
program, "Comer es Primero" ("EatingcomesFirst").Thisprogramusestheupdated
National Poverty Map (prepared as part of this loan's activities) and a new system      for
beneficiary identification (also developed underthis loan) to select householdsin extreme
poverty. These households receive an electronic debit card they can use to purchase food
atlocalgrocerystores.Theprogram,supportedbyBankstaff,featuresimproved
targeting, less leakage, lower administrative costs, and greater accountability compared to
theprogramdeveloped by INESPRE.Accordingly,theLoanAmendmentneeds                     to be
amended to state:

7.      "TheSocial
                 Cabinet        has approvedoperational
                                            an          manualpreparedthe
                                                                    by
Borrower for the targeted food subsidy program,"Comeres Primero", and the Borrower
has initiated the implementationof such program."      *



8.      Action 4 states,"TheBorrower'snon-contributoryhealthinsuranceprogramhas
enrolled and affiliated at least 70,000 poor families in the Borrower's health regionsIv
and V defined in the Borrower's General Health Law, dated, March ."  2001

9.      In fact,theBorrower'snon-contributoryhealthinsuranceprogramenrollsand
affiliates poor individuals, not entire families (although typically all individual members
of poor families are enrolled, so long as they have documentation). The national health
insurancedatabasedoesnotlinktheseindividualsbyfamilymembership,                   so it is
impossibletoknowhowmanyfamilieshavebeenenrolled.Therefore,theLoan
Agreement needs to be amended to state:

10.     "TheBorrower'snon-contributoryhealthinsuranceprogram              has enrolledand
affiliatedatleast 70,000 poorindividuals in theBorrower'shealthregions          N and V
definedin the Borrower's General Health Law, dated, March ."   2001


11.     In viewoftheBorrower'srequestandtheoverallperformance'andprogresswith
the implementation of the program supported by theloan,theBank has informedthe
Borrower of its readiness to sign the Amendmentto the Loan Agreement, which includes
a two month extension to complete civil society monitoring of Borrower's actions.
