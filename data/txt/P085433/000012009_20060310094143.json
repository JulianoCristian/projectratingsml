Lessons are as\n            follows. 1) Lending in the social protection sector - The\n            launching of the Unified System of Beneficiary Selection was\n            a significant achievement for the Government. However, for\n            it to reach its full potential, and ensure objective\n            targeting of social safety net programs, the system may need\n            to be adapted to address specific requirements of particular\n            agencies. The census of beneficiaries also needs to be\n            carried out with a transparent sampling plan (to avoid any\n            appearance of favoritism of urban/less poor areas over poor\n            rural areas). Also of importance are the local technical\n            expertise, technical capability, and, the complexity of the\n            issue of undocumented families and individuals. 2) Lending\n            in a crisis situation - the experience of this operation\n            demonstrates that in a crisis situation, Bank lending can\n            effectively achieve short-term crisis alleviation, along\n            with modest advances on medium policy actions. Flexibility,\n            setting realistic expectations and a frank appraisal of\n            risks as input to program design (the establishment of loan\n            conditions), and, collaboration across sectors and with\n            other major donors are critical to success in Bank lending\n            under these conditions, although moral hazard remains a risk."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
