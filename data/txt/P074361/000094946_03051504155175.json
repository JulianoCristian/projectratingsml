Investment Fund Project, which identify\n            environmental impacts resulting from the project\n            implementation, review the country's environmental laws\n            and regulations, and assess mitigation measures. The\n            infrastructure works concerning primary health, and\n            education facility micro-projects, will potentially induce\n            contamination from waste materials, hamper drainage systems\n            and water quality, due to polluted effluents and hazardous\n            wastes, as well as impact air quality, disturb natural\n            habitats, and affect the social environment. Measures to\n            mitigate these effects call for the protection of soil\n            surfaces, through a daily clean-up and control in\n            construction sites, which includes the provision of adequate\n            waste disposal services; drainage systems should be\n            inspected regularly, taking into consideration a special\n            disposal of oil, and hazardous materials, and, include as\n            well adequate sanitation, and waste disposal systems;\n            construction will be restricted to daytime working schedules\n            to reduce noise disturbances; and, degradation of natural\n            vegetation should be avoided as possible by considering\n            alternative sites, and re-vegetation practices following\n            construction. Works regarding water supply, small scale\n            irrigation, wastewater and sewage, and, waste management\n            micro-projects should consider mitigation as follows: soil\n            degradation should be protected during construction through\n            vegetative propagation and physical stabilization of soils;\n            preventive water contamination should consider a minimal\n            distance from human settlements and agricultural areas, and\n            appropriate drainage; waterborne diseases should be taken\n            into account, particularly through appropriate design,\n            testing, and training provision; water quality degradation\n            should be prevented through the control of agrochemical\n            uses, monitoring, and adequate maintenance planning."}, "docdt": "2003-02-28T22:39:00Z"}
