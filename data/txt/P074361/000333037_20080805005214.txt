1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)
1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)
Georgia is a small transition economy which, at the time of Appraisal (2003), had a population of about
five million people, and a per capita GNI of US$730 (2002), after over a decade since independence in
1991. Prior to independence, Georgia had exported agricultural and energy-intensive industrial products to
the former Soviet Union and was a popular tourist destination for the region. The economy collapsed after
independence under the impact of the civil war and the loss of preferential access to FSU markets as well as
large budget transfers from the Soviet Union. The civil war, followed by regional conflicts resulted in a
significant toll, with about 300,000 people displaced, much of physical capital destroyed, important trade
routes disrupted, and the authority of the new State undermined in large parts of the territory. Georgia
suffered the worst decline suffered by any transition economy, with output falling by 70 percent and
exports by as much as 90 percent.

By the mid-1990s, Georgia's economy had begun to recover and reform efforts gathered momentum.
However, progress was adversely affected by the Russian economic crisis, droughts, an earthquake, and
internal political fragmentation. Despite these setbacks, the economy recorded a cumulative expansion of
45 percent since 1995 up to the time of Appraisal as the private sector began to take advantage of economic
liberalization. Public sector initiatives also showed results in areas where they have been adequately
financed.

The period of 2000 to 2003 leading up to this project was a difficult period for Georgia. Notwithstanding
economic growth, the fiscal and governance situation were deteriorating. In this environment, community
and social infrastructure were not receiving adequate attention outside of the SIF structure.

Sector Background: At the time of Appraisal, Georgia was experiencing extensive poverty, deteriorating
social and economic infrastructure, and insufficient formal safety nets. As noted in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD), 43 percent of the population was living below the official poverty line at that time.
Many households were vulnerable to the risk of income shocks; they lacked the resources and support
systems to mitigate such risks. Although still better than many countries at similar income levels, health
status and educational achievements were threatened, especially among the poor, as the provision of quality
education and good health care was jeopardized by systemic inefficiencies and inadequate resources.

As the GDP declined drastically between 1990 and 1994, the share of public education expenditure fell
from 7 percent of GDP to less than 1 percent in 1994 and remained at that level for several years, compared
to an average of about 5 percent for countries with similar levels of education participation. With regard to
health care, the health of family members in poor households worsened ­ reflecting poor nutrition, cold,
damp housing, increased stress, and inattention to minor ailments. The SDS survey which began in 2000
found that for the poorest 20 percent of households, average food consumption per adult was less than 1700
Kcal per day, as compared to the recommended minimum of 2000 Kcal. At the same time, access to assets,
or asset creating opportunities, were lacking, especially for poorer households, thus severely limiting
income generation.

The absence of adequate infrastructure and some basic services, as well as the lack of access to capital,
gradually became the principal obstacles to local development efforts and improved welfare of the
population, especially the poorer income groups and those living in the conflict zones. Rural areas had
been particularly hard hit. Although agriculture was providing support for over half the population and was
the only source of income for many rural communities, the lack of a functioning rural environment and an
economic infrastructure that could reduce fluctuations in output and family income were impediments to
coming to grips with poverty. At the same time, the institutional capacity at the local government and
community levels was inadequate to effectively address social sector issues. While Georgia managed to

                                                      1

provide health and education services despite a marked decline in GDP and severe fiscal constraints, the
quality of services suffered reflecting poor maintenance that resulted in dilapidated premises throughout the
country.

Government Priorities and the Role of the Georgia Social Investment Fund II: The Government had
begun to develop a comprehensive long-term poverty reduction strategy prior to Appraisal aimed at
reversing the decline in welfare among the population and reducing vulnerability of households to risks
arising from both income and non-income shocks. An I-PRSP for Georgia was discussed by the Board in
December 2000, and a PRSP status report was presented to the Board in July 2002.

A central element of the Government strategy was the decentralization of economic management to local
self-governments and the promotion of community-driven development through a participatory process
involving citizens and communities at the local level, building upon some notable achievements in this area.
Major achievements included the elections of local governments in October 1998 under the Organic Law
on Local Government and Administration, delineation of responsibilities among different levels of
government (central, regional, local) and the introduction of fiscal responsibility. Another significant
achievement was the establishment of the Georgia Social Investment Fund (GSIF) as an important vehicle
for improving local and community level social and economic infrastructure. This Fund reflected the high
priority accorded to improving the population's access to basic social and economic infrastructure, such as
schools, water supply, sanitation, health clinics, irrigation, small hydropower schemes, and roads,
particularly in the poorer areas.

The GSIF II Project built upon the experience of the GSIF I project which had improved access to
vulnerable groups to social and economic services on a sustainable manner, with the completion of 375
micro-projects increasing access for more than 2.4 million citizens from poor communities throughout
Georgia. A process was started under the GSIF I Project for engaging communities through consultative
and participatory approaches used throughout the micro-project cycle.           This process was key, as it
facilitated communities to develop their ability to work in partnership with other stakeholders, and to gain
their trust. The project also helped build the institutional capacity of the State Department of Statistics to
conduct household surveys and to produce reliable poverty evaluations. However, more work needed to be
done to build on the organizational capacities of communities facilitating interactions between community
members and local self-government authorities.

The Bank's Development Assistance Strategy: At the time of Appraisal, the existing Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) did not cover FY03, and, as a consequence, the GSIF II Project was presented to the Board
under regular procedures. Nevertheless, the GSIF II project preparation process took account of the core
objective of the draft CAS at the time, which aimed at supporting the Government in its efforts to reduce
vulnerability among the population. This was to be accomplished through a multifaceted social risk
management strategy to direct resources to improve coverage and targeting of benefits and services to the
poor and provide them with opportunities to rise out of poverty. Given the deteriorating fiscal and
governance situation, focusing Bank support on ensuring the continuation of community and social services
was considered one of the highest priorities.

The GSIF II Project, which had begun operations in 2003, was consistent with the above objectives. The
Bank, in fact, drafted a CAS in 2003 (which was provided to the Board but ultimately withdrawn following
the Rose Revolution) which highlighted the need to focus on community development through
rehabilitation of small-scale economic and social infrastructure in poor rural and peri-urban communities.
Furthermore, as noted in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the GSIF II Project was designed to
complement the work of a number of other Bank financed projects in the areas of water supply, rural
infrastructure, health, education, municipal development and decentralization, and social protection. In
particular, the GSIF II Project complemented the Municipal Development and Decentralization Project
(MDDP). While the MDDP focused on improving performance at the local government and large city

                                                      2

levels, the GSIF II Project focused on local self-government levels in areas where it financed micro-
projects. Specifically, the GSIF focused on capacity building to strengthen local decision-making and
implementation capacity, strengthen interaction between local self-government and citizenry, improve
problem solving, and lead to improved governance and democratic decision-making.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Second Georgia Social Investment Fund Project (GSIF II) had the following development objectives:
(i) participating local self-governments use enhanced management skills and a participatory process in
establishing local development plans and setting investment priorities; (ii) participating poor communities
apply for, manage and use micro-projects in a sustainable manner; and (iii) participating poor communities
benefit from improved social and economic infrastructure and related services.

To attain these objectives, the project placed an explicit emphasis on strengthening the interaction between
local self-government and citizens in improving the quality of life in communities. The project, as
described below, was to introduce community development planning through a participatory process
involving local self-government and citizenry. It was to finance community level micro-projects generated
through that process and undertake asset management at the local self-government level.               At the
community level, it was to develop community mobilization and advocacy skills to strengthen self-reliance
and self-help mechanisms.

The key performance indicators reflect monitorable outcomes and impacts in key areas of the project. They
include quantitative indicators (measurable improvements and outputs relating to micro-project completion
and improved social and economic infrastructure) and qualitative assessments of demand-driven
mechanisms, service delivery, local self-government processes and community participation. Specific
areas that were to be assessed include: (i) project impact, i.e., local self-government attitudes to
participatory processes and their readiness to sustain them; community mobilization for the micro-project
cycle; and advocacy in participating communities; (ii) outputs relating to micro-project completions,
training programs for local self-governments and communities; and (iii) process, relating to GSIF operating
efficiency.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
N.A.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as captured in
the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to benefit from the project)
While the project was nationwide in scope, the primary target group comprised the poor communities in
peri-urban areas, rural towns and villages. The main benefits were to be: (i) improved economic and social
infrastructure; (ii) increased ownership and accountability for such infrastructure; (iii) increased
participation in local decision-making; and (iv) improved self-reliance and self-help capabilities.

The secondary target group was to be local self-government (LSG) authorities who would benefit from
training in management skills, administration, and participatory community action. Such training would
enhance the capacity of LSG officials to conduct participatory processes in establishing local priorities and
implementing local development plans and to function more effectively in carrying out increased
responsibilities under decentralization.

At the national level, the main beneficiaries were to be the central government agencies responsible for the
promotion of the Government's decentralization program through enhanced management skills at the local
level and the introduction of local and community partnerships in poverty alleviation and economic
development.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Component 1: Capacity Building (Total estimated base cost: US$3.8 million)
This component was to support the Government's decentralization effort through the provision of training
and technical assistance to enable communities and local self-governments to address the needs and
priorities for local development. This was to be achieved through a capacity building program aimed at
increasing the competences of local self-governments, involve citizens in decision-making and, ultimately,
create empowerment at the local level. Capacity building activities were to be linked to micro-project
development and implementation, focusing on communities and local-self government. The capacity
building component included two sub-components: (1) community development planning and related
micro-project development, and advocacy; and (2) institutional strengthening of local self-governments in
line with their evolving responsibilities for local utility services, taxation, budget planning and local
management.

Community development planning and micro-project development was to focus on strengthening the
capacity of community members to formulate community level development plans and integrating them
into consolidated local self-government plans using participatory methods. The aim was to: (i) help move
communities from a dependency culture focused on short-term interventions to one that recognizes that
communities can have the ability to improve their living conditions for sustainable development through
their active involvement as community members; (ii) introduce a comprehensive local development
framework for overcoming poverty issues through prioritization of investment needs, as well as through the
interaction between community members and local self-government authorities; and (iii) identify micro-
projects for GSIF financing.

Institution-building at the local self-government level was to provide training to local self-governments in
the areas where micro-projects are being implemented. It was to focus on enhancing understanding of
current legislation relating to decentralization and local self-government and to strengthen skills in local
financial administration, asset management, information dissemination, and participatory planning process

Component 2: Community-Based Micro-projects (Total estimated base cost: US$22.2 million)
This component was to finance, on a grant basis, community-level economic and social infrastructure
micro-projects located in poor peri-urban areas and rural towns and villages. Micro-projects would be
proposed for GSIF financing based on priorities set up by the participatory local development planning
process. The component was also to finance consultant services for micro-project design and supervision
to ensure good quality of works.

Component 3: Institutional Support to GSIF (Total estimated base cost: US$3.15 million)
This component was to support for the Project Management Unit (GSIF) through the provision of limited
office equipment, vehicles, consultants' fees, operating costs for items such as communications, local travel,
utilities, printing and publication, office supplies, fuel, vehicle insurance and inspection, vehicle
maintenance and repair, project audits, training and technical assistance, and monitoring and evaluation.

Project Financing
The major share of financing came from a US$15.0 million equivalent IDA Credit. The Government was
to contribute US$5.8 million and local communities a total of US$1.7 million. A partnership agreement
was envisaged between GSIF and USAID, whereby USAID would provide US$3.0 million. The German
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) was to provide US$4.7 million under a parallel financing
arrangement.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)
A number of significant organizational, procedural and functional changes took place during project
implementation, the majority of which were initiated at the request of the Government. These relate to the
organizational structure of the GSIF, partnership arrangements with USAID, legislation on Local-Self
Government, the length of the micro-project cycle, community contribution arrangements, operations and
maintenance arrangements, and the introduction of a new disbursement category.                Specifically, the
following changes were introduced:

Organizational Structure of the GSIF. Prior to December 2005, Georgia Social Investment Fund functioned
as a stand alone government agency, tasked inter alia with implementing SIF I and subsequently SIF II IDA
financed projects. Starting in 2006, in accordance with the Presidential Decree which was passed in
December 2005, GSIF Project was integrated into the Municipal Development Fund of Georgia (MDFG), a
Legal Entity of Public Law. This was done as part of the Government's effort to consolidate project
implementation units. The MDFG was created with the objective of supporting the institutional and
financial capacity of local government units, investing financial resources in local infrastructure and
services, and improving on a sustainable basis the primary economic and social services for local
communities. The GSIF was converted to a Social Investment Department (SID) within the MDFG which
became the legal entity assuming all the rights and obligations of the GSIF. The key objective of the
organizational change was to integrate the management of the GSIF Project into the government structure
and use the services of the GSIF to manage projects funded by other donors and agencies, thus sustaining
GSIF management activities beyond the project. The GSIF Credit Agreement and Project Agreement, as
well as the GSIF Operational Manual, were all revised to reflect this organizational change.

Partnership Arrangements with USAID. In April 2004, after extensive discussions between the WB, GSIF
and USAID, the proposed arrangement with USAID to co-finance the GSIF II capacity building component
through the continuation of two ongoing USAID capacity building programs was dropped. This did not
adversely affect implementation of the capacity building component because GSIF was able to adjust to the
situation and successfully carry out planned activities.

Legislation on Local Self-Government. The capacity building component was designed on the basis of the
1998 Organic Law on Local Government and Administration under which the two-tier sub-national
government structure was established. Under the first tier, villages, towns and cities were incorporated into
districts. The second tier comprised the territorial units referred to as districts. Under this law 1,000 local
self-government units were established. In December 2005, a new Law on Local Self-Governance was
passed by Parliament. In accordance with this law, self-governing units were merged establishing self-
governance units in 67 districts and 5 towns. The focus shifted to larger municipalities that assumed a
stronger role in terms of local economic development. The institutional structure of the smaller village,
town and city districts, which was the focus of the capacity building program under the project, no longer
existed under the new law. The local self-government training under the project was revised to target local
government representatives in larger municipalities. These changes together with the frequent turnovers in
government brought about initial delays in the implementation of the capacity building component and
uncertainty regarding the local government structure.

Duration of the Micro-project cycle and Procurement Arrangements. Following the Rose Revolution in
late 2003, the new Government was firmly committed to making improvements in the living standards of
the population. Accordingly, the Government paid particular attention to the GSIF which was seen as a key
agent for achieving those improvements in the poor areas. In September 2004, the Government took the
decision to shorten the duration of the micro-project (MP) cycle from 7 to 5 months. This came as a result
of the Government's concern that the MP cycle was too long and that the project ran the risk of not
covering on time the poor communities targeted under the project. This change in procedure had an impact,
particularly on the initial outreach and training phase of the MP cycle, which was reduced from 9 to 6

                                                      5

weeks. Linked to the decision to shorten the duration of the micro-project cycle was the centralization of
procurement activities in the MDFG/SID Office, which were previously the responsibility of local
communities participating in micro-projects. However, the CBOs/CDCs remained closely involved in
micro-project procurement activities by being present at bid openings, taking part in the evaluation of
proposals, and in decisions regarding contract awards, the process of which was administered by the
MDFG/SID.

Community Contribution and Operations and Maintenance. In November 2004, close to one year into
project implementation, a change was made to ensure the timely submission of community contributions,
the participation of the poorest communities, and the proper maintenance of micro-projects. The
Government took the decision to pay the micro-project contribution on behalf of poor communities as well
as assume the responsibility for the operations and maintenance of micro-projects.

Introduction of a new Disbursement Category. In August 2007 the Credit Agreement was revised to
include a new Disbursement Category which would encompass all expenditures related to micro-projects
such as goods, works, consultants' services, training, incremental operating costs incurred after June 25,
2007. The remaining balance of the Credit was allocated to this new Category to ensure the effective
implementation of the final stages of the remaining micro-projects and related activities, thus avoiding a
series of reallocation requests between different Categories and ensuring speedier disbursements.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their mitigations
identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

Quality at Entry. The project's quality at entry was satisfactory. The importance given by the project team
to project preparation, design and quality at entry was critical to the successful implementation and
achievements of the GSIF II Project. Although there was no QAG review of quality at entry, the team took
into account lessons learned from the GSIF I project and other similar type operations in the Region, as
well as the 2002 OED report entitled "Social Funds: A Review of World Bank Experience", identified risks
and their mitigations, and focused on developing more effective participatory processes.

Project Design. The project was kept simple with three interrelated components focusing on: a) capacity at
the local level; b) identification, development and implementation of community-based micro-projects
benefiting the poor communities throughout Georgia; and c) project management. The project was to
complement the work undertaken by a number of other Bank projects underway or being developed in
Georgia. The design reflected a fundamental shift in the practice of GSIF interventions from straight-
forward financing and implementation of micro-projects with limited community involvement towards one
that aims as fully engaging the community in the local development planning and decision-making process.
The emphasis of the design was on putting in place effective implementation arrangements incorporating
institutional mechanisms aimed at building organizational capacities of communities. The project
preparation team prudently assessed the operations' risks and set suitable provisions for mitigating them.
The design was in line with the central element of the Government's poverty reduction strategy focusing on
the provision of access to better quality social and economic infrastructure in a sustainable manner,
strengthening local self-government, and building up self-reliance and self-help capabilities at grassroots
level.

The design of the GSIF II took into account lessons of GSIF I Project and also introduced a number of new
features focusing on an innovative community development framework to support local self-government
initiatives. Some of these features included: (i) strengthened interaction between local self-government and
citizens by engaging the community in the local development planning and decision-making process under
an improved participatory framework; (ii) capacity building activities at the local level integrated as part of

                                                       6

community outreach and promotional activities; (iii) an improved poverty targeting strategy; and (iv)
strengthened procedures related to quality of works focusing in particular on micro-project works design
and supervision. The aim was to secure a much higher degree of community preferences and priorities,
while at the same time improving their sustainability.

With emphasis on community mobilization and expectations of consequent longer term engagement with a
community, consideration was given to the appropriateness of the GSIF structure in addition to staffing
skills and needs, as well as micro-project procedures. While the project would benefit from some of the
institutional and implementation arrangements that were put in place under GSIF I, it was agreed that the
organizational structure of the GSIF II Project needed to be restructured to meet the institutional challenges
of the enhanced scope of the project, focusing on community mobilization and advocacy. The new structure
would allow a more integrated and cost-effective approach to local development. In particular, the
introduction of decentralized area management and task teams were created to enhance capacity building at
local levels and contribute to increase micro-project quality. The Executive Board structure was retained
although under a new name as the Supervisory Board and with the introduction of a stronger civil service
presence. Regional supervisors were to be retained to assist in operating and training activities at the local
level. These organizational changes together with strengthened outreach and training arrangements made it
possible to carry out activities at the local level more effectively under a shorter micro-project cycle.
Accordingly, the micro-project cycle was significantly shortened from its average of 560 days under the
GSIF I to a maximum of 350 days.

Project Preparation Activities. Project preparation activities were carried out on a timely basis and
provided valuable inputs for the design of the follow-up operation. A Japanese Grant of US$427,000, of
which US$261,665 was disbursed, provided assistance to the GSIF in the preparation of the follow-up
operation. The Grant provided financing for the needed technical assistance to support the GSIF in: (i)
carrying out an institutional assessment of local institutions to be used for the design and development of
the capacity building component; (ii) development of a Quality of Works Improvement Action Plan which
included training to GSIF staff and contractors; (iii) developing the Operational Manual; (iv) carrying out a
vulnerability and social care services needs assessment; (v) upgrading the Management Information
System; and (vi) financing a Grant audit.

Poverty Targeting. GSIF I targeted people living in poor and remote communities, particularly those living
in the mountainous areas and considered among the poorest and most in need of infrastructure investments.
Under GSIF II, the poverty targeting strategy was further developed as an integral part of the local level
development process, based on an innovative decentralized community identification methodology that
preceded the community mobilization stage and the micro-project cycle. The targeting was nationwide in
scope, covering all regions in Georgia, with priority given to poorer communities in peri-urban areas, rural
towns, and villages. Within each of the 63 districts, all local self-government units were ranked on a
transparent needs-based approach by the representatives of the main stakeholders based inter alia on a set
of key socioeconomic indicators. The representatives included the District Local Self-Government Council
members, the heads of the district administration (Gambgebeli), local NGOs, representatives of
professional groups, such as teachers and health workers, and other significant social groups. The resulting
rankings were cross-checked by the MDFG Task Team using available data. On the basis of this process,
three of the poorest self-governing units were selected initially for participation in the local development
process.

As regards the regional allocation of project funds, there was broad agreement with the Government on the
need for selectivity, and the sensitivity of limiting funds to a few chosen regions or districts, while
excluding others.      It was also agreed to initially, on a notional basis, limit IDA funds available to any
district over the life of the Project to US$160,000, and not to allow more than five projects within that limit.
This allocation was subject to review and revision after the first year. Districts eligible for KfW funds were
not eligible for IDA funds.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions taken, as
applicable)
The implementation of project activities started in April 2004, six months after the project became effective,
due to the aftermath of presidential elections. Notwithstanding a shortened implementation period of 3.4
years, the project was able to move forward at an accelerated pace managing to complete 225 micro-
projects benefiting the poorest communities throughout Georgia and building the needed capacity at the
local level in support of local-self government initiatives. The project adjusted very well to an environment
of political uncertainty and a series of changes that took place during implementation.

The political instability in Georgia marked by frequent changes in the Government did affect the GSIF II
Project. The high turnovers in Government caused many changes in the membership of the GSIF II
Supervisory Board. However, the Ministry of Finance did its best to ensure the smooth continuation of the
Board's functioning, providing the needed oversight of its operations, including the required review and
approval requirement of micro-projects above a certain threshold.. As of August 2004, the Board became
fully operational and became very active under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Following
presidential elections in January 2004, the Executive Director of the GSIF I, stepped down from his
position. A high level staff of the Ministry of Finance was hired in July 2004 as the new Executive
Director. In the absence of an Executive Director and a Board that was fully operational, the Ministry of
Finance assumed a greater role in the management of the GSIF II Project enforcing key changes under the
project. These relate to the organizational structure of the GSIF, the length of the micro-project cycle,
community contribution arrangements, and operations and maintenance arrangements (see Section 6.7 for
details).

The Government's decision to merge the GSIF Project with the Municipal Development Fund made sense
institutionally because it mainstreamed the management of the GSIF into the government structure, making
use of the skilled staff and services of the GSIF to manage projects funded by donors and agencies         of
Georgia and sustaining GSIF management activities beyond the project. With regard to the procedural
changes that took place under the project, the key intention was to accelerate activities related to micro-
projects. The consequent decision to shorten the length of the micro-project cycle and to centralize
procurement under the management of the MDFG brought about a significant acceleration of the pace of
micro-project implementation. This change had some impact, particularly in the initial outreach and
training phase of the MP cycle, which was reduced from 9 to 6 weeks, and resulted in more intensified
outreach and training efforts in a shorter time. These activities were implemented with the combined efforts
of various teams comprising GSIF task teams, regional supervisors, and NGOs, and were sufficient to
effectively carry out outreach and training activities. Similarly, the decision to centralize micro-project
procurement, (originally the responsibility of the communities), in the MDFG/SID Office, was also an
important factor in the acceleration of micro-project activities. However, training in procurement was
continued at the community level, although the key responsibility of the process shifted to the MDFG/SID.
These changes and the resulting procedures were enforced, reflecting the Government's strong interest in
the implementation of micro-projects targeting poor communities.

The changes in legislation regarding local-self government and the related institutional changes at the local
government level, led to some initial delays in the implementation of the capacity building component,
which were overcome by the shorter and more intensified training programs.. During the first two years of
implementation, GSIF operations faced a number of uncertainties regarding: (i) the establishment of a
stable and functioning local-self-governing structure; and (ii) the orientation of the new government
particularly regarding decentralization. It was not until September 2005, close to two years after project
effectiveness, when Local government training activities under the project started with a focus on smaller
village, town and city districts. As a consequence of this delay, the performance of the project was rated
"moderately satisfactory" in the June 2005 Implementation Status Report. When the new Local Self-


                                                       8

Governing Law was passed in December 2005, the focus of training activities shifted to larger municipal
districts.

The decision by the Government to pay the contribution on behalf of communities, helped fill a financing
gap in the poorest communities that could not otherwise afford to contribute. At the close of the project,
the Government's contribution towards micro-projects came to a total of US$5.1 million (out of a total
Government contribution of US$7.1 million). According to the Beneficiary Assessment, this decision did
not affect the key motivation of communities to participate in micro-projects. Beneficiaries acknowledged
that the their full engagement in the planning, targeting, selection and implementation associated with
micro-projects, had the most positive impact in motivating them to actively participate in micro-projects.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that the community contribution which amounted to a total of US$1.3
million, came close to the Appraisal target of US$1.7 million.

According to the post-completion reviews carried out by the CDCs and the MDFG/SID task teams, the
Government's decision to assume the responsibility of the operations and maintenance of micro-projects, ,
had little impact on the sustainability of micro-projects reviewed, as it was found that communities
assumed a greater responsibility for operations and maintenance. This analysis covered a total of 78
facilities comprising schools (35), water/sanitation (19), and others. The SID's analysis of the results of
post-completion monitoring activities shows that school micro-projects, in particular, were well maintained.
The operations and maintenance responsibility for micro-projects was assumed by communities, in
accordance with the recent policy developments and the related legal frameworks. The autonomy of
schools where the parents are represented on the boards, associated with the per capita formula allowed for
both increased revenues and better management and maintenance of resources. All 35 school facilities
reviewed were judged to be well maintained. With regard to water/sanitation projects, out of a total of 19
micro-projects assessed, only 2 (needing valves) had shortcomings in maintenance. Nevertheless, it was
found that the required water fees were paid by the water-user associations to the water companies.

In 2004, a new procedure initiated by the Government was implemented requiring the Supervisory Board to
review and clear all micro-projects proposed by communities. The objective of this change in procedure
was to ensure that micro-projects targeted were benefiting poor communities and that the facilities to be
renovated were in line with recent government policies. The review process was carried out on a timely
basis with no serious delays experienced. There were no cases of projects approved by the Board that were
not approved by communities in accordance with procedures set out in the Operational Manual. This was
confirmed in the findings of the Beneficiary Assessment, where the majority of communities felt that the
micro-projects implemented in their communities reflected priority projects selected by community
members.

The other change that occurred under the project was the termination of negotiations between USAID and
the GSIF regarding co-financing arrangements. It had been originally agreed that USAID would provide
US$3.0 million to finance the implementation of the capacity building component. However, in April 2004,
USAID informed the GSIF and the Bank that the focus of their lending strategy in Georgia had shifted to
community-based employment creation. This change in strategy resulted in USAID withdrawal from the
proposed co-financing arrangement. While this outcome reduced the resources that would otherwise have
been available for micro-projects, the component was retained and implemented with the support of GSIF
task teams and regional supervisors, as well as NGOs contracted under the project, working under a shorter
and more intensified training. The total financing for the capacity building component was reduced from a
planned amount of US$3.8 million to US$1.7 million. This reduction was made possible by the extensive
use of trained SID staff together with local supervisors and specialized NGOs, in a cost-effective manner.

In the course of project implementation, the GSIF II benefited from additional project financing resulting
from exchange rate gains, increases in Government contribution and in KfW parallel financing. As a result
of favorable exchange rate of the SDR vis-à-vis the US Dollar, the project gained US$1.2 million, bringing

                                                      9

the IDA Credit to US$16.2 million. In addition, the Government contributed a total of US$7.1 million,
with an additional US$1.3 million to the planned contribution of US$5.8 million. The parallel financing
from KfW increased from US$4.7 million to US$10.2 million. Thus, the net increase in project financing
reached a total of US$34.5 million from the planned US$30.2 million, which takes into account the
elimination of the US$3.0 million co-financing from of USAID. The major part of the additional financing
was allocated to the community works components.

The project changes that took place under the GSIF II Project were properly documented in mission reports,
ISRs, and in the Mid-term review. These documents mainly focused on procedural aspects relating to the
changes that took place in the course of implementation, which consumed a significant amount of time and
attention. Thus, a great deal of effort was concentrated on trouble shooting and steering the project towards
the completion of project activities with full disbursements. As a result, less efforts were devoted to more
in depth analysis of project outcomes, poverty targeting and costs effectiveness.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Project monitoring was a joint responsibility of the MDFG/SID, the Community Development Committees
(CDCs), and the Bank supervision team. The objectives of the monitoring and evaluation activities were
to: (i) ensure that procedures carried out for implementing micro-projects, executing contracts, and
managing project accounts were in compliance with the Operational Manual; (ii) provide information
regularly on progress toward achieving project objectives and facilitate reporting to the MDFG, the
Government, and donors; (iii) provide information on project performance in terms of development
outcomes; (iv) alert managers to actual or potential problems in implementation so that corrective actions
could be taken in a timely manner; (v) determine how the project was affecting the intended beneficiaries;
(vi) provide a vehicle whereby beneficiaries could reflect on and improve their performance; and (vii)
ensure the sustainability of micro-projects through regular reporting.

The monitoring and evaluation framework included: (i) micro-project monitoring and reporting by the
MDFG/SID task teams and engineers, CBO/CDCs, and local and technical supervisors carried out every
two weeks; (ii) a well-designed and effective management information system (MIS), (iii) financial audits;
(iv) a beneficiary assessment; (v) special inspections of micro-projects carried out by CDCs before the final
hand-over of projects; (vi) micro-project completion reports prepared by the GSIF task teams countersigned
by the CDC/LSG; (vii) reports on the operations and maintenance of micro-projects prepared by the
CDC/LSG and by the MDFG/SID task teams prepared every six months following micro-project
completion (viii) semi-annual Bank supervision missions; (ix) a mid-term review; and (x) quarterly and
annual progress reports prepared by the MDFG/SID.           In addition, seminars on social and technical
monitoring and on operations and maintenance were conducted for completed micro-projects, six months
after the final handover. The GSIF also maintained a Web Page (WWW.mdf.org.ge) which proved to be a
very effective information dissemination tool used as an integral part of outreach activities under the
project. All information related to micro-projects, including the competitive selection of contractors were
posted on the Web Page.

The MIS system, which was assessed during the May 2008 ICR mission, was judged to be highly efficient
providing transparency and accountability of GSIF activities, maintaining data relevant to poverty targeting,
and facilitating contracting and payment by storing information on contractors, unit prices and field
progress. It operated on an n-tier system, having as a backend and as a front-end, Microsoft Access. It also
has a capacity for on-line WEB presentations, which includes information on the micro-projects as well as
main reporting. It tracks activities in the micro-project cycle, including micro-project data, progress of
works, cost overruns etc. The MIS was also used as a progress evaluation tool that helped prepare and
present progress reports to the GSIF staff, the Supervisory Board, the Government, the World Bank and
donors. In the absence of linkage between the GSIF accounting system and the MIS Follow-Up module,
accounting data was entered in parallel to these two systems from the Follow-up and Accounting Units.


                                                      10

This was not judged to be an issue, as it allowed cross-checking of the accounting figures between the two
systems, to identify possible entry errors.

During project implementation, the performance indicators monitored and tracked in the MDFG/SID
Progress reports, Bank Mission Reports, and in Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) reflected both
output-based and outcome-based indicators. The latter provided information on: (i) outcomes related to
LSG training such as the formulation of community development plans; (ii) the number of community
members benefiting from community level training in regard to micro-project management and how such
training helped move communities from a dependency culture to a proactive approach in micro-project
management; (iii) the number of micro-projects completed by typology and the impact on the living
standards of communities; and (iv) the development outcomes at the community level results from
qualitative assessments (i.e., beneficiary assessments) documenting the levels of satisfaction with services
received, and the positive effect the project had on social integration.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Safeguard Compliance. As a financial intermediary project, the environmental category for the GSIF II
was F. Some of the projects clearly had beneficial environmental impacts (e.g. sanitation, solid waste
management), but others had minor negative impacts. These negative impacts were mitigated.

Local capacity, while limited, was considered sufficient for case-by-case review and assessment of
environmental impacts and recommended mitigation measures by GSIF staff. During the preparation stage
of the project, GSIF staff successfully identified, jointly with the community, mitigation measures and
monitored their implementation. According to procedures set out in the Operational Manual, each micro-
project was screened and reviewed by the engineer in the GSIF for negative impact, as well as needed
mitigation measures. The micro-project proposals included an environmental review checklist, and the
micro-project appraisal document included mitigation measures. No micro-project was identified under the
project to have an identifiable negative impact. As a standard procedure, during outreach activities the
GSIF held discussions on-site with the community during screening and with both the community and the
local self-government in preparing and reviewing environmental assessments. GSIF engineers together
with local supervisors routinely monitored and supervised the quality of works and assessed environmental
standards. Training on environmental assessments was provided under the project to all 20 GSIF engineers
through regular training programs organized by the World Bank, as well as other in-house training.
However, the annual technical reviews which were planned to be carried out by independent consultants to
assess the quality of works, including environmental standards on a selected number of micro-projects,
were not carried out. In the course of implementation, it was decided the supervision of the quality of
works would be carried out jointly between the GSIF engineers, the local supervisors and by local firms
contracted for micro-project design and supervision. The advantage of an independent review would have
been to provide an objective assessment of the quality of works and on the compliance with environmental
standards.

Fiduciary Compliance. The GSIF spent considerable time and effort during project preparation on
strengthening financial management arrangements with new Bank financial requirements. With funds
under the Japanese Grant, an accounting consultant was hired to develop a Financial and Administrative
Procedures Manual based on the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS),
including accrual accounting setting out procedures relating to financial management, internal controls,
accounting and auditing. The consultant also provided on-the-job training to GSIF financial management
staff in the application of IDRS, including the principles of accounting, and other financial management
procedures as per the new FSPM. The GSIF also developed new accounting software, which became
operational shortly after the project became effective. Accounts were maintained in accordance with the


                                                      11

required financial standards and World Bank Guidelines and were audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA.

The financial audit reports, which provided unqualified opinions on the project, and the Bank's reviews of
financial management arrangements carried out routinely under the project, confirm that the financial
management system ­ including accounting, controls, auditing and reporting ­ continue to be adequate and
satisfied the Bank's financial requirements.      Internal control procedures were documented and duly
followed by project staff.      The project maintained its accounting records adequately and regularly
reconciled all general ledger account balances with relevant source documents. Audit reports for project
accounts were submitted on time and were acceptable to the Bank. The FMRs were on time and found
satisfactory in terms of format and content.

Procurement management arrangements under the GSIF II were simplified incorporating participatory
procedures for community works projects. There were no major issues raised in the procurement reviews
carried out by the Bank. Procurement plans were submitted on a timely basis and procedures in the GSIF
were judged to be satisfactory and in compliance with Bank requirements. Bid documentation was found
to be complete, covering technical specifications, technical drawings, and description of time frame
required to completed works.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by present
operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional capacity, and next
phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)
The Government's decision to merge the GSIF Project with the Municipal Development Fund was
fundamental institutionally because it integrated the management of the GSIF into the government structure,
making use of the skilled staff and services of the GSIF to manage projects funded by donors and agencies
of Georgia, and sustaining GSIF management activities beyond the project. This organizational change
shows that the Government had been thinking about how best to sustain the activities of the GSIF beyond
the project. The Government had a clear vision of the future of the GSIF as an effective institutional entity
engaged in providing opportunities for community development by offering high quality services in support
of local initiatives for improving the living conditions of the poor through small and medium-scale
infrastructure construction renovations. The MDFG/SID is currently managing a total of four projects
funded by the Bank and other donors and agencies. This confirms that the services of the GSIF will carry
on their operations in the future.

Similarly, the Government's decision to assume responsibility for maintenance and operation of
community investments and to centralize procurement activities related to community works projects is
linked to the Government's initiative to institutionalize activities related to community works at the
Ministry level. This was made possible through the services of a dedicated, experienced and qualified staff
in the GSIF that had been effectively providing services to the poor over a period of about eight years. All
of these changes reflect the Government's top priority on strengthening institutional arrangements within
the Ministry with the key focus of providing adequate infrastructure and basic services to poor communities
especially the poorer income groups and those living in the conflict zones. While these changes point to a
centralized framework focusing largely on infrastructure services, at this stage, it is less clear the extent to
which the Government is committed to continue building on the efforts started under the GSIF I project and
further developed under the GSIF II project related to community participation and local self-government.
Nevertheless, a process was started at the local level that evolved over time which brought new ways of
thinking in communities focusing on self-help mechanisms and participatory decision making processes,
and as reflected in the Beneficiary Assessment under the GSIF II Project, had their impact. Should the
Government wish to build on these efforts in the future, a strong foundation has been laid.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)
The Government of Georgia had embarked on developing a comprehensive long-term poverty reduction
strategy aimed at reversing the decline in welfare among the population and reducing the vulnerability of
households. A central element of this strategy was, and still is, the strengthening of economic and
infrastructure management at local self-government levels and the promotion of community-driven
development through a participatory process that actively involves citizens and communities in local level
decision-making. The initial emphasis on local self-government and community mobilization was aimed at
facilitating the supply of critical small-scale infrastructure needs at local level, especially in poorer areas,
e.g. primarily school and health facilities, rehabilitation or small water supply schemes to provide drinking
water and sanitation rehabilitation, irrigation and road rehabilitation. The major objective of the GSIF II
Project was to support a decentralized participatory process designed to improve access in participating
poor communities to such basic economic and social services on a sustainable basis, in a way that advances
their empowerment and strengthens the participatory nature of the local planning process.

One of the key objectives of the Bank at this time was to develop and strengthen human capital and social
protection as well as environmental protection, both through short-term interventions and longer-term
sustainable programs to protect the most vulnerable.            This was particularly important given the
deteriorating fiscal and governance situation prior to the Rose Revolution.           The GSIF II Project is
consistent with this objective, given the focus of GSIF II on community development through rehabilitation
of small-scale economic and social infrastructure in poor rural and peri-urban communities. Furthermore,
the GSIF II Project complemented the work of a number of other Bank- financed projects in the areas of
water supply, rural infrastructure, health, education, municipal development and decentralization, and
social protection.

As described in Section 3.2 below, the achievements of the GSIF II Project during project implementation
were consistent with the current country and global priorities as well as with the Bank's assistance strategy.
This was accomplished through: (i) the carrying out of a well designed capacity building program at the
local level leading to strengthened participatory development processes and a set of new administrative
techniques at the LSG level; and (ii) a wide range of social and economic infrastructure micro-projects
benefiting poor communities throughout Georgia. The new Government that came into office following
the Rose Revolution made good use of the SIF to continue to channel funds to the local level in support of
social and community infrastructure.      Later, as the situation started to stabilize and improve, the SIFII
adapted and mainstreamed into the Government structure through the MDFG. This also helped strengthen
the emphasis on community capacity building more generally, and to ensure a unified approach to
supporting local infrastructure needs.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on outputs in
Annex 2)
The achievements of project development objectives are as follows:

Project Development Objective 1: Participating local self-governments use enhanced management
skills and a participatory process in establishing local development plans and setting investment
priorities ­ Rating: Satisfactory.
The GSIF II Project achieved this objective by strengthening the institutional capacity at the local self-
government (LSG) level through training of LSG officials designed to increase their participation with
communities in local level planning and implementation. The new administrative systems and techniques
acquired through this training were put into effect in the course of project implementation. As shown in
Table 1 below, a total of 225 officials participated in these training programs over a total duration of 402
days. The training was provided by two local NGOs and GSIF Staff.

                                                       13

The main outcomes of these training programs, as reported in the Beneficiary Assessment and other reports
were:
    · A total of 225 community development plans were prepared, with copies available at the LSGs
        and the MDFG.
    · The effective participation of LSG officials with the community representatives and other
        stakeholders in developing a poverty targeting strategy, establishing community development
        plans, identification of the three poorest self-governing units in each district through a ranking
        system, examining project priorities, and in the implementation of micro-projects. Significant
        improvement in the role of the LSGs in processes of procurement announcements, bid openings,
        and the selection of contractors;
    · Participation of LSG officials in an integrated approach to local level development which
        strengthened their links with community members and helped them to better understand the needs
        of communities and help formulate appropriate responses; and
    · Participation of former village council members, with enhanced skills, in local development within
        the new municipal district institutional framework.

                Source: MDFG/SID


Project Development Objective 2: Participating poor communities apply for, manage and use micro-
projects in a sustainable manner ­ Rating: Satisfactory.
The GSIF II Project achieved its second development objective by strengthening the institutional capacity
of community based organizations (CBOs) and community development committees (CDCs) to work with
LSG officials in local level planning and implementation. As shown in Table 1 above, 108 community
members and 117 CDC representatives participated in these training programs over a total duration of 900
days. The training was provided by CARE, Mercy Corps, two local NGOs and GSIF Staff.

The main outcomes of the training provided at the community level, as reported in the Beneficiary
Assessments and other reports, were:
    · Increased knowledge, participation, and confidence relating to the management of the different
       stages of the micro-project cycle and greater scrutiny of the quality of delivered works at the hand-
       over stage, reflecting a movement away from a dependency culture towards greater pro-activeness.
       Some works were re-scheduled by the communities when defects were revealed during inspection.
       As noted in the BA, 90 percent of the respondents said that their community had been involved in
       the micro-projects one way or another;
    · Increased participation at the local level; an average of 60 members in each community targeted
       participated as representatives of local groups formed at the initial stage of the Micro-project cycle
       (poverty targeting, formulation of local development plans, micro-project selection).
    · High level of commitment by the communities for beneficial micro-projects, as reflected by their
       substantial cash contribution of US$1.3 million and in-kind contributions (mainly labor) towards
       construction;
    · Better organization of operation and maintenance of rehabilitated facilities, particularly schools,
       water supply and bridges, reflecting an experience covering 8 years of training under GSIF I and
       GSIF II. Those involved in maintenance comprised about 24 percent from LSGs and the rest (74
       percent) from the communities. The assessment of 78 facilities carried out by the CDCs as well as

Project Development Objective 3: Participating poor communities benefit from improved social and
economic infrastructure and related services ­ Rating: Satisfactory.
The GSIF II Project achieved its third development objective of providing improved social and economic
infrastructure and related services to participating poor communities. The success of GSIF II is attributable
to its implementation of priority micro-projects which made a tangible development impact on living
conditions throughout Georgia, focusing in particular on the poorer segments of the population

As shown in Table 2 below, the GSIF II Project financed 225 infrastructure projects from a target of 300
micro-projects located in Zone B (Western Georgia) and Zone C (Eastern Georgia). This shortfall was
essentially due to the sharp escalation of construction costs during project implementation. Zone A,
consisting of Southern Georgia was served by KfW which provided parallel financing for a total of 60
micro-projects. The micro-projects financed by IDA served a total of 603,568 direct beneficiaries. Slightly
over 75 percent of the projects were schools or water supply systems. Also as shown in Table 2 below, the
micro-project typology covered a wide variety of priority economic and social infrastructure needs. (see
Annex 2 for details).

The main outcome relating to the third development objective is that communities are now benefiting from
rehabilitated and improved schools for their children, potable water in their homes, improved availability of
electricity and gas supply, access roads to neighboring communities, and multi-purpose community centers
and local market places. As noted in the Beneficiary Assessment, communities confirmed that these micro-
projects have produced "a very positive effect on the life of its beneficiaries". Higher scores were given in
the cases of schools, bridges, and roads, while lower scores were assigned to water supply and gas
networks owing to problems of access and connection rates. Some specific outcomes were:
     · Higher motivation of children and teachers (as perceived by beneficiaries), improved physical
          safety, and higher enrollment rates as a result of school rehabilitation; the kindergarten in Borjomi
          for example, witnessed an increase in enrollment from 50 to 150 children as a result of the
          rehabilitation;
     · The newly built ambulance center in Obacha I, serves for three other adjacent villages;
     · Bridges have greatly improved mobility, access to main roads, and links to agricultural lands on
          both sides of rivers;



                                                       15

     · Community centers have helped strengthen social interaction and income generation; for example,
          one in Boriti which is being intensively used by the community, both for cultural needs and as a
          source of income generation by renting out a part of the building

Infrastructure projects generated 548,660 days of temporary labor, an important contribution given
Georgia's high unemployment rate. These micro-projects also stimulated the local construction industry
through the engagement of 80 design/supervision firms and 144 construction companies. The cost per
micro-project averaged US$81,000, while the cost per beneficiary averaged around US$30. The average
cost of a micro-project was higher than the target of US$50,000 envisaged in the Project Appraisal
Document due to a sharp escalation of construction costs during the implementation period.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost, and
comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)
Given the nature of the project, where the list of micro-projects to be financed cannot be known in advance,
it was not considered feasible to calculate an economic rate of return (ERR) or a net present value (NPV) of
the GSIF II Project. Instead, during project implementation the GSIF staff carried out an ex ante simple
cost-effectiveness analysis for each micro-project proposal presented by the communities. This analysis
was based on the evaluation of viable alternatives, least-cost solutions, unit cost estimates from private
construction firms, specific circumstances of the community, benefits envisaged from the project, the
number of beneficiaries, and other relevant factors.

As noted in the PAD, the carrying out of an ex-post cost-effectiveness analysis was to be discussed during
the mid-term review of the project, based on the progress in implementing micro-projects. Such an
analysis was to include: (i) the project rationale within the broader context of national development
objectives, government strategy, and the Bank's country assistance strategy; (ii) effective targeting of
project funds to poor areas; and (iii) the cost-effectiveness in the use of project funds for micro-projects
completed under GSIF II compared with those of government programs, or NGO sponsored projects.
However, such an ex-post cost-effectiveness study was not carried out. The project team was of the view
that first, there were no similar publicly funded investments that could have been used as comparators.
Second, they drew attention to the sharp cost escalations in the construction of micro-projects which would
have affected the cost-effectiveness calculations. Finally, the project team noted that cost effectiveness was
not an issue as long as there were solid technical preparations and a competitive selection of contractors.

Instead of a comprehensive cost-effectiveness study, the MDFG/SID, with concurrence of the Bank team
and the Government, proceeded to regularly monitor construction costs, including unit costs and costs per
beneficiary, according to project typology. The MIS also regularly recorded the costs of completed micro-
projects, costs of materials, labor, transport, overheads, as well as employment created. These exercises
were rather limited in scope, due to lack of analysis against the cost structures of the country's construction
industry at large.

Notwithstanding the quality at entry of each micro-project (through cost-effective and good quality designs,
and project evaluation), such an ex-post cost-effectiveness analysis would have been useful for two reasons.
First, it would have provided insights on the end results (reflecting changes or problems during
implementation) of micro-projects, by assessing the effectiveness and efficiency in the use of project funds
compared to alternative modes of construction noted above, at least in the case of the newly constructed
micro-projects. Cost escalations could have been taken account of with the use of suitable deflators
applicable to the construction industry. Second, it would have provided insights on the targeting of funds
to the poorer areas, and on its contributions in attaining broader national development objectives. Finally,
such an assessment would have provided insights and indicators for mid-course corrections to improve cost
effectiveness.


                                                      16

No financial analysis was carried out as the GSIF II Project was a non-revenue earning one. Nevertheless,
some financial management aspects were taken into account at the micro-project level: (a) cost recovery: in
some micro-projects, such as water supply and gas supply, connection rates were introduced; and (b)
community contributions: the beneficiary communities contributed a total of US$1.3 million towards the
financing of the GSIF II Project, in addition to in-kind contributions mainly in the form of labor.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Satisfactory
The project achieved its development objectives by effectively delivering benefits to target groups
identified. The first development objective was achieved through strengthening the institutional capacity at
the local self-government (LSG) level by training LSG officials, designed to increase their participation
with communities in development activities. As a result, using new administrative techniques, LSG
officials effectively participated with the communities in developing a poverty targeting strategy,
formulating community development plans, and identifying the poorest self-governing units in each district.
Furthermore, the LSG officials strengthened their bonds with local communities and effectively
participated in the micro-project cycle.

The second development objective was achieved by strengthening the institutional capacity of CBOs and
CDCs to work with LSG officials in local level planning and implementation. As a result, communities
were in a position to effectively participate in the various stages of the micro-project cycle with greater
knowledge and confidence, and move away from a dependency culture towards greater proactiveness.

Capacity building at the LSG and community levels played a key role in effectively achieving the third
development objective of providing improved social and economic infrastructure and related services to
participating poor communities through the construction or rehabilitation of a varied range of social and
economic infrastructure micro-projects. These micro-projects made a tangible development impact on the
living conditions throughout Georgia through better schools, improved water supply, electricity and gas
supply, improved road access, and a variety of other micro-projects noted in Section 3.2. However, small-
scale surveys of communities (in addition to the BA), if conducted, could have provided further qualitative
and quantitative data on outcomes of the project.

The BA demonstrated that beneficiaries greatly valued the GSIF II Project and believed that the project
significantly improved their lives. The project did not have any significant shortcomings, inefficiencies or
other inadequacies. Its accomplishments are still consistent with Georgia's present development priorities
and current Bank assistance strategies and goals. The achievements of the GSIF II Project remain relevant.
The remarkable achievement of this project was that in a macro political climate of tension and distress, its
tangible results at the local level were carried out for and by the people providing hope for a better future.
Considering the achievement of the project development objectives, the efficiency with which they were
achieved, and their relevance, the overall outcome rating for the GSIF II Project is judged to be satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Poverty Impacts.
Historically and prior to the Rose Revolution in late 2003, the poverty index was estimated at around 50
percent. The most recent estimates suggest the overall poverty rate of 23.6 percent in 2007. The non-
income dimensions of poverty show strong improvement as well. GSIF projects have contributed to the
trend particularly in terms of access to education, safe water and natural gas supply.



                                                      17

In line with the Government's priorities and the Bank's objectives noted above, the focus of the project was
on providing access to better quality social and economic infrastructure and related services in a sustainable
manner, strengthening local self-governance, and enhancing self-reliance and self-help capabilities in the
poorer regions. At the regional level, at which poverty data are representative, ex-post analyses carried out
by the ICR team show that project funds for economic and social infrastructure were, in fact, disbursed to
the poorer regions as well as the populous regions with high levels of poverty.

The two poorest regions (outside Tbilisi), Kakheti and Adjara, with poverty rates of 46.2 and 44.6 percent
respectively, received a disbursement of 21 percent of total disbursements on micro-projects (see Annex
10). These two regions had extreme poverty rates of 21.9 and 15.6 percent respectively. Also, the most
populous regions outside Tbilisi, Imereti and Kvemo Kartli with a combined population of 37 percent of
the total population (outside Tbilisi), with poverty rates of 23.0 and 35.1 percent respectively received a
disbursement of 23 percent of total disbursements on micro-projects. These two regions had extreme
poverty rates of 7.6 and 12.7 percent respectively, compared to a nationwide average of 10.7 percent.
Overall, the ex-post analysis of disbursements by region, carried out by the ICR team, showed a relatively
high degree of correlation of 0.89 (in a range of 0 to a maximum of 1) of allocations versus disbursements
(see Annex 10). This analysis points to the conclusion that the actual disbursements in relation to the
allocations were very satisfactory.

More generally, according to the BA, communities confirmed that the micro-projects completed under
GSIF II had a very positive effect on their lives in terms of reducing non-income poverty. The project
certainly made the communities more livable and enhanced their quality of life. For example, rehabilitated
schools provided a better learning environment for children, road reconstruction led to reduced transport
costs, and improved water supply reduced health costs.

Although the project was not specifically designed to generate incomes, the micro-projects generated
548,660 days of work that provided short-term income, estimated at around US$5.5 million. However,
there were no small-scale income and expenditure surveys conducted in beneficiary communities in peri-
urban and rural areas, after the completion of micro-projects to assess how income and expenditure patterns
would have changed these communities.

Social Development. The main social development achievements were empowerment of communities
through participation in subproject decision-making and creation of social capital through cooperation in
community subprojects. Many community members interviewed under the BA felt that they had received
new experience of working in groups and that the training that they received helped them to be aware of
their responsibilities and obligations as citizens. A total of approximately 50,000 participants from 225
communities took part in over 1,000 General Community Meetings. Over 1,000 Community members
served on a total of 225 Community Development Committees. The project also empowered communities
through training and capacity building. Two thirds of BA respondents claimed that there were positive
changes in the self-organization of the community and in the attitude of community members to the
Sakrebulo (Village Council representative) and district authorities during the micro-project implementation.
A total of 72 percent of respondents felt that the level of residents' engagement in decision-making process
was increased as a result of the project.

Gender Aspects. The results of the BA revealed that there was a low to average level of participation from
women in micro-project related activities. Roughly 30 percent of women participated in decision-making
meetings, and the proportion of women as chair person in the micro-project committees was 25 percent.
For the most part, this level of participation was explained by the fact that the community works projects
did not for the most part provide employment to women and women were busy with their traditional
workloads in the households. Women did participate in some projects more than others, providing meals to
the workers and cleaning the micro-project sites.


                                                      18

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
Building on GSIFI, the GSIF II Project achieved a notable institutional development impact at the local
community and central government levels focusing on three key institutional entities: (i) local-self-
governments; (ii) local communities; and (iii) the MDFG/SID located in the Ministry of Finance. The
project helped strengthen interaction between the local self-government and citizens by engaging the
community in the local development planning and decision-making process under an improved
consultation and participatory framework.         LSG representatives, CBO/CDC members, and NGO
representatives took part of local representative groups participating in poverty targeting, formulation of
local development plans in which they ranked investment priorities, micro-project selection and micro-
project implementation. The result of this close working relationships formed at the local level was that
seventy one percent of respondents in the BA stated that their relations with authorities had improved as a
result of the project. In addition, according to a study carried out by KfW in the districts targeted in the
southern region (Zone A), close to 80 percent of former village council members, with enhanced skills,
participated as village council representative within the new municipal district institutional framework.
The project demonstrated that it is possible to bridge macro and micro activities by linking local
communities to civil society and local governments in ways that build up local institutions that empower
the poor. This was largely due to an innovative design that integrated multi-sector community-based
projects with local institution-building and empowerment.

Specifically, the GSIF focused on capacity building to strengthen local decision-making and
implementation capacity, strengthen interaction between local self-government and citizenry. This was
accomplished through participatory management processes which emphasized problem solving and conflict
resolution, towards the goal of improving governance and democratic decision-making. As a result of this
training, LSG authorities learned to apply new participatory processes by developing their management and
administrative skills and using new consultation processes more effectively. Community members learned
and applied improved procedures and new approaches in working together with local government
authorities. This was achieved in the process of formulating community development plans, carrying out
poverty targeting strategies, and managing micro-projects. Thus, the project was able to effectively connect
local governance reform with community development initiatives.

The institutionalization of participatory planning and self-management processes as part of the local-self
government structure was key to engaging the community at large.                The process of community
empowerment and engagement was strengthened both by improved procedures under the GSIF but also by
an evolving process that was taking place between the GSIF I and II requiring a long-term engagement with
communities. As a result of GSIF II institutional arrangements at the local level, the GSIF effectively
engaged a total of 60 community members per community in the initial stages of the micro-project cycle.
The institutional impact at the community level was more noticeable under the GSIF II Project after close
to eight years of GSIF working with communities throughout Georgia.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The unintended outcome of the GSIF II Project was the institutionalization of the GSIF starting in 2006
into the Government structure ensuring the sustainability of GSIF activities beyond the GSIF II Project.
The decision to institutionalize the GSIF assured the sustainability of the services of the GSIF by providing
an organizational structure at the central government level staffed with trained and experienced specialists
who could be deployed to effectively work with local communities in delivering services throughout
Georgia.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)
A Beneficiary Assessment (BA) was conducted on 25 completed micro-projects (MPs) in all regions of
Georgia. The assessment was conducted in three weeks in early 2007 by a consortium of three local

                                                      19

research entities, CENN, BCG, and DPI. After reviewing relevant documentation, the BA carried out a
field study consisting of a total of 388 interviews with community members (361), representatives of
contracted construction companies (20) and regional coordinators who supervised the construction of the
MPs. The selection of the 25 micro-project communities and of the 361 representatives of the beneficiary
communities may well have not been true to random sampling procedures. The primary instrument used in
this inquiry, was a form of 18 pages and 133 open and closed questions, a questionnaire rather than an
interview guide. Findings revealed a project which was seen by its intended beneficiaries to have realized
their own felt needs and, in the process, increased social capital in their communities. The vast majority
(83 percent) of community respondents stated that the communities had been involved in the identification
process which selected the MPs. Slightly over two thirds (68 percent) saw no problem with the
implementation process and most gave a high rating (4.5 out of 5) to the implementation unit of the project
(MDFG/SID) regarding the quality of work performed, general payments discipline, and timely conclusion
of works. Regarding social capital formation, three-quarters (74 percent) of the respondents said that their
linkages with each other had improved and almost as large a proportion (71 percent) said that their relations
with authorities had improved as a result of the project, thereby enhancing both bonding and bridging
dimensions of social capital, respectively. Finally, most (82 percent) of the respondents stated that the
micro-projects had had a positive impact on their communities, with almost all (93 percent) of those
interviewed pointing to improvements in access to services and almost as many (84 percent) stating that the
quality of services had also improved. While outstanding questions remain concerning the degree to which
both the project sites and the community members selected for the assessment were representative of their
respective universes, this BA does portray an intervention in the municipalities of Georgia which was
considered by a significant proportion of its intended beneficiaries to have brought about an improvement
in their lives.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Now that the GSIF is fully mainstreamed as part of the Government's structure, it is expected that the
MDFG/SID will sustain its management activities and continue to serve the poor in Georgia. What is less
clear is the sustainability of capacity building activities focusing on local self-government, because of the
political uncertainties in this regard with how the new streamlined local self-government structure will
work. Accordingly, the project's risk to development outcome is determined to be moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank's work during the preparation of the project was of high quality. Its strategy and instruments
were appropriate. The project's design took into account lessons learned from the Mid-term review carried
out under the GSIF I project, as well as from evolving social funds in the Region. The shift in emphasis
from mostly the provision of infrastructure to a greater role of institution building in support of the
Government's policy on local self-government was a good decision on behalf of the project team.
Appraisal of the commitment of the Government, the implementing agency and potential beneficiaries for
the tasks appear to have been generally sound. Technical aspects were thoroughly examined, as were the
fiduciary elements. Links with other donors were well considered and incorporated.

The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry of the project is rated satisfactory. This takes into
account the efficacy of the work carried out in the activities described above, which covered the most
important aspects of the project's strategic relevance and its preparation.



                                                      20

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The project was closely monitored through frequent supervisions monitoring project activities and dealing
with emerging changes during the initial difficult period of project implementation. The Bank team was
diligent in their communication with the GSIF team, Government officials and Bank Management,
providing up-to-date information and analysis on the status and impact of project activities, issues
encountered, and options as to how best to deal with the changes that occurred during project
implementation. These changes required a number of modifications to the legal documents which were
effectively carried out in a timely manner. The mission reports, including the Mid-term Review, the ISRs
and follow-up letters to the Government, were submitted on a regular basis. The Bank staff had a good
working relationship with the GSIF staff and provided effective support to the team during the difficult
period of uncertainty and in particular the frequent changes in Government and the transitional phase of
mainstreaming the GSIF into the Government structure. Throughout this difficult period, the Bank provided
professional leadership and the needed moral support in the GSIF. The result of the joint efforts between
the GSIF and the Bank was that, despite the initial delays experienced, the GSIF was able to accelerate its
activities, fully disburse the project funds and achieve the project's development objectives. It is worth
noting, that throughout project implementation, the Bank carried out joint supervision missions in Georgia
with KfW staff.

While the above activities represented supervisory functions focusing on important organizational and
procedural changes, the project performance could have been enhanced through in-depth analyses and
assessments. A quality of works study carried out by technical specialists, for example, could have verified
whether the original designs and standards of micro-projects as specified in the contracts have been
complied with. Likewise, as noted above, an ex-post cost-effectiveness study could have provided valuable
insights on the efficient and effective use of project funds compared with other modes of operation such as
construction by government agencies or NGOs. Capacity building is another area that could have benefited
from an institutional assessment. Such an assessment would have provided before and after snapshots of
the quality and the extent to which institutional capacity at the local level has been strengthened. Finally,
small-scale surveys of communities (in addition to the BA) could have provided further qualitative and
quantitative data on the outcomes of the GSIF II Project relating particularly to income and non-income
poverty reduction.

Given the above, the Bank's performance on the quality of supervision is judged to be moderately
satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank's overall performance is rated satisfactory on the basis of the aforementioned factors and the
other elements of the Bank's work described elsewhere in this report.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The Government's proposed changes under the project were on the whole considered to be positive, with
sufficient consultation with the Bank's team. After the initial delays experienced in the initial phase of
project implementation, the Government became committed to the GSIF II Project and took some
important decisions to implement changes under the project. The organizational and procedural changes
implemented reflect the Government's top priority on strengthening institutional arrangements within the
Ministry of Finance with the key focus of providing adequate infrastructure and basic services to poor
communities. The Ministry of Finance worked closely with the GSIF and Bank teams to ensure a smooth
transition to implement the organizational and operational changes needed. All revisions to the legal

                                                      21

documents reflecting key changes were processed on a timely manner. These joint efforts led by the
Ministry enabled project completion within a period of 3.4 years. As noted in this ICR, the merging of the
GSIF into the Government structure shows that the Government had given some thought to the role of the
GSIF in the long-term and how best to sustain the activities of the GSIF beyond the project. The
Government had a clear vision of the future of the GSIF as an effective institutional entity engaged in
providing opportunities for community development by offering high quality services in support of local
initiatives for improving the living conditions of the poor through small and medium-scale infrastructure
construction renovations.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly satisfactory
The performance of the GSIF as the Implementing Agency of the GSIF II Project is judged to be highly
satisfactory. The GSIF team worked under intensive pressure as a result of the political situation and the
uncertainties it brought with frequent Government turnovers. Nevertheless, the team was determined and
committed to carrying out their work as best they could under very difficult circumstances. With each
change that took place under the project, the GSIF team adjusted and moved forward with the objective of
accelerating project activities to meet the project's development objective and to serve the poor
communities throughout Georgia. During project implementation the GSIF effectively administered its
operations building on its solid technical and professional capacity based on close to 8 years of experience.
In the course of project implementation the GSIF staff received training (local and international) in the
areas covering procurement, local development, micro-project design and supervision, and environmental
protection. The GSIF was very effective in carrying out the project's activities. It established itself as a
credible implementing entity with demonstrated competence in the delivery of technical, managerial and
organizational support to Georgian communities. Now that it is integrated as part of the Government
structure, it would sustain its management activities and continue to serve poor communities in Georgia.
The findings of the Beneficiary Assessment carried out under the Project gave the GSIF very high marks
for the quality of their services and for their commitment to their work.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating for Borrower Performance is rated satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

The following are lessons learned from the GSIF II Project:

Sustainability. There were a number of important lessons learned on project sustainability under the GSIF
II Project covering the: (i) the need to focus on local-self governing structures and to develop an effective
framework (structure, systems and procedures) to facilitate interaction between community members and
local self-government authorities.      This was essential in helping move communities and local self-
governments from a dependency culture focused on short-term interventions to one that recognizes that
communities can have the ability to improve their living conditions and prospects for sustainable
development through the active involvement of community members; (ii) the importance of focusing on
implementation arrangements incorporating institutional mechanisms aimed at building organizational
capacities of communities; (iii) the need to ensure good quality of works though improved procedures and
an enhanced monitoring and supervision framework; (iv) the need to devote greater attention to operations
and maintenance of micro-projects by ensuring adequate demand-orientation and community participation
in the choice of subprojects and through local-capacity building; and (v) the importance of
institutionalizing the administration of micro-projects in the government structure to create effective
linkages between the central government and local communities, ensure effective service delivery through


                                                      22

qualified staff in the government structure, and thereby sustain project activities beyond project
implementation.

Capacity Building. An important lesson learned from this project is the sustainability of community
investments through mobilization and training to enable communities and local self-governments to address
the needs and priorities for local development through a capacity building program. The training on
community development plans and micro-project development was essential in helping community leaders
and citizens develop local self-government plans using participatory methods.          The complementary
interaction between institutionally-strengthened local governments and mobilized community members
participating in micro-project planning, selection and implementation helped create bridges between local
government and communities.

Links to Government Policies and Priorities. Experience under social funds have shown that it is
important to ensure that social fund activities are consistent with social sector strategy priorities,
government reform programs, and activities of municipal, NGO, UN and donor agencies. Under the GSIF
II Project, a Supervisory Board was created with the main task of ensuring that project activities are
consistent with social sector strategy priorities and government reform programs in relevant sectors.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

A. Project Component 1: Capacity Building (Actual Cost: US$1.70 million)
The first two PDOs were achieved through this component which supported the Government's
decentralization effort through the provision of training and technical assistance to enable communities and
local self-governments to address the needs and priorities for local development. Capacity building
activities were linked to micro-project development and implementation, focusing on communities and
local-self government. The capacity building component included two sub-components: (1) community
development planning and related micro-project development, and advocacy; and (2) institutional
strengthening of local self-governments in line with their evolving responsibilities for local utility services,
taxation, budget planning and local management.

Under the first sub-component, a total of 225 community development plans were prepared, with copies
available at the LSGs and the MDFG. As shown in Table 1 below, a total of 225 officials participated in
these training programs over a total duration of 402 days. The training was provided by two local NGOs
and GSIF Staff.       The second-component supported the strengthening the institutional capacity of
community based organizations (CBOs) and community development committees (CDCs) to work with
LSG officials in local level planning and implementation. As shown in Table 1 below, 108 community
members and 117 CDC representatives participated in these training programs over a total duration of 900
days. The training was provided by CARE, Mercy Corps, two local NGOs and GSIF Staff.

B. Project Component 2: Community-based Micro-projects (Actual Costs: US$29.66 million)
The third PDO of the GSIFII was achieved through this component which supported the implementation of
225 micro-projects, accounting for 86 percent of the total project cost. The original target of some 300
micro-projects could not be achieved due to the sharp escalation of construction cost during project
implementation. Each CDC submitted an average of 12 progress reports on micro-project implementation
activities. To monitor the sustainability of micro-projects completed CDCs prepared and submitted reports
every six months on the sustainability of 78 micro-projects completed. These reports were complemented
by social and technical reports prepared by MDFG/SID on the sustainability of the 78 micro-projects
completed. The micro-projects financed by IDA served a total of 603,568 direct beneficiaries. Slightly over
75 percent of the projects were schools or water supply systems. The total number of micro-project
proposals received (261) was slightly higher then the total number of proposals approved (225). This had
to do with the new procedures under the GSIFII under which proposals were submitted as part of a
decentralized organized process led by LSGs and communities. Members from the 225 communities
targeted selected the top priority project out of a series of projects discussed. The additional 26 proposals
submitted represent the number of communities targeted that submitted proposals which were approved,
but not implemented due to the non-availability of funding. Contributions for micro-projects came to a
total of US$6.16 million (communities: US$1.03 million; government: US$5.13million) which represents
20 percent of the total micro-project costs).

The micro-projects generated 548,660 days of temporary labor which was an important contribution, given
Georgia's high unemployment rate. These micro-projects also stimulated the local construction industry
through the engagement of 80 design/supervision firms and 144 construction companies. The cost per
micro-project averaged at US$81,000, while the cost per beneficiary averaged at around US$30. The


                                                      25

average cost of a micro-project was higher than the target of US$50,000 envisaged in the Project Appraisal
Document, due to a sharp escalation of construction costs noted above.

As shown in Table 2 below, the micro-project typology covered a wide variety of priority economic and
social infrastructure needs in all regions outside Tbilisi. The coverage excluded Tbilisi where a large
number of development agencies were involved in development work. Table 2 provides a summary of the
micro-projects by typology implemented nationwide, while Tables 2.1 through 2.11 shows the regional
distribution of these micro-projects as well as their direct beneficiaries and the job days created. The
communities are now benefiting from rehabilitated and improved schools for their children, potable water
in their homes, improved availability of electricity and gas supply, access roads to neighboring
communities, and multi-purpose community centers and local market places.

C. Project Component 3: Institutional Support to GSIF (Actual Costs: US$3.14 million)
The project helped develop the GSIF and later the SID under the MDFG into an effective and broader
based institution to deliver its services throughout Georgia.      Such institutional strengthening was
accomplished through local as well as international training.

During the GSIF II project implementation period, 37 members of the MDFG/SID comprising managers as
well as technical staff participated in 1- 2 week long training programs at various levels, both local and
international. Local training programs were conducted by the GSIF management/technical staff as well as
external trainers such as Mercy Corps and CARE. The coverage of training included: local development;
MPs design concepts and process; MPs appraisal concepts and processes; procurement; follow up; MIS;
and    Management      and    planning.   MDFG/SID       staff members     also  attended    international
training/seminars/conferences which covered the following areas: procurement, management; local
development, environmental protection, project implementation, employment and public investment.
These training programs were carried out in various countries including Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia,
Albania, Macedonia, Italy, USA, and Turkey.

All these training programs proved to be very useful and productive for staff development and capacity
building. As a result, the MDFG/SID staff members were much better equipped to handle the substantive,
technical, and procedural aspects of project implementation.

One innovative feature developed by the MDFG/SID was the creation of a GSIF Website to disseminate
information very widely.       A total of 32,532 visits to this website were recorded during project
implementation.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

The demand driven nature of the project, which responds to micro-project proposals from poor
communities during the life of the project, and the fact that neither their size nor their type were known ex
ante clearly precluded the ex-ante use of traditional methods of cost-benefit analysis. Also, at the micro-
project level, although the costs of projects are known with some precision at the appraisal stage by the
GSIF, data deficiencies at the community level precluded the quantification and valuation of the wide range
of benefits and externalities generated by micro-projects. It was therefore not considered feasible to
calculate an economic rate of return (ERR) nor a net present value (NPV) of the GSIF II Project.

During project implementation, the GSIF staff carried out an ex ante simple cost-effectiveness analysis for
each micro-project proposal presented by the communities. This analysis was based on the evaluation of
viable alternatives, least-cost solutions, unit cost estimates from private construction firms, specific
circumstances of the community, benefits envisaged from the project, the number of beneficiaries, and
other relevant factors.

As noted in the PAD, the carrying out of an ex-post cost-effectiveness analysis was to be discussed during
the project MTR, based on the progress in implementing micro-projects. Such an analysis was to include:
(i) the project rationale within the broader context of national development objectives, government strategy,
and the Bank's country assistance strategy; (ii) effective targeting of project funds to poor areas; and (iii)
the cost-effectiveness in the use of project funds for micro-projects completed under GSIF II compared
with those of government programs, or NGO sponsored projects.               However, such an ex-post cost-
effectiveness study was not carried out. The project team was of the view that first, there were no similar
publicly funded investments that could have been used as comparators. Second, they drew attention to the
sharp cost escalations in the construction of micro-projects which would have affected the cost-
effectiveness calculations. Finally, the project team was of the view that cost effectiveness was not an issue
as long as there were solid technical preparations and a competitive selection of contractors.

Instead of a comprehensive cost-effectiveness study, the MDFG/SID, with concurrence of the Bank team
and the Government, proceeded to regularly monitor construction costs, including unit costs and costs per
beneficiary, according to project typology. The MIS also regularly recorded the costs of completed micro-
projects, costs of materials, labor, transport, overheads, as well as employment created. However, this
effort was rather limited in scope, due to lack of analysis against the cost structures of the country's
construction industry at large.

Notwithstanding the quality at entry of each micro-project (through cost-effective and good quality designs,
and project evaluation), such an ex-post cost-effectiveness analysis would have been useful for two reasons.
First, it would have provided insights on the end results (reflecting changes or problems during
implementation) of micro-projects, by assessing the effectiveness and efficiency in the use of project funds
compared to alternative modes of construction noted above, at least in the case of the newly constructed
micro-projects. Cost escalations could have taken account of the use of suitable deflators applicable to the
construction industry. Second, it would have provided insights on the targeting of funds to the poorer areas,
and on its contributions in attaining broader national development objectives. Finally, such an assessment
would have provided insights and indicators for mid-course corrections to improve cost effectiveness.

No financial analysis, encompassing NPV and FRR analyses, was carried out as the GSIF II Project was
not a revenue-earning one. Nevertheless, some financial management aspects were taken into account at
the micro-project level: (a) Cost recovery. In some micro-projects, such as water supply and gas supply,
connection rates were introduced; and (b) Community Contributions. The communities made significant
in-kind contributions and some cash contributions towards the construction of the micro-projects. Women
also participated to a lesser extent in the micro-project construction phase, by providing meals for workers.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The objective of this Beneficiary Assessment (BA) was to evaluate the impact of selected micro-projects
(MPs) as regards the formation of social capital and the beneficiary communities' valuation of inputs,
outputs, and outcomes (quality and quantity). The assessment covered 25 micro-projects selected by the
assessment contractor and implementing party. Two thirds of these (17) were school building repairs, one
quarter (6) water and one each covering bridge rehabilitation and gas supply system reconstruction. The
degree to which these selected micro-projects accurately represented the universe of activities supported by
the project is left unclear. The assessment was conducted by three local private entities, CENN, BCG, and
DPI in a three-week period in early 2007. The methodology was two-fold. First a desk study of the
documentation relevant to the MPs; second, a field study consisting of 388 "structured interviews" with
three groups:
      · Members of community stakeholder organizations and groups, including the community
          development committees (CDCs), local self-government representatives and representatives of
          community residents (361 interviews)
      · Sub-contracted construction companies (20 interviews), and
      · Regional coordinators who supervised the implementation of the MPs (7 interviews).

 Different interview guides were administered to each of the three groups. The one given to the members of
 the community groups, who may not have been representative of the communities as a whole, was a list of
 133 open and closed questions covering 18 pages of what is far more accurately described as a
 questionnaire than an interview guide. An average of 15 "interviews" was conducted in each of the 25
 communities covering all eight regions of the country.

 Findings

 An analysis of the findings of the survey done for this assessment reveals that for those 25 micro-projects
 covered the communities affected experienced both an increased formation of social capital and a
 realization of their perceived needs.

 Participation in the project was generally high, but uneven. The vast majority of community respondents
 (90 percent) said that their community had been involved in the micro-projects in one way or another. Less
 than half (43 percent) of the respondents stated that they personally participated in the project
 identification process. Most significantly, less than five per cent of the community residents attended the
 initial meetings held to identify the micro-projects. This discrepancy (43 and 5) confirms that the
 respondents to this assessment survey were outstanding members of the community, not ordinary citizens.
 Certain of the projects chosen, particularly those involving water and gas, may have been selected by these
 non-representative persons and benefited the few over the many, with connections to these services. Still,
 basing our understanding of the project on what the respondents reported, the vast majority (83 percent) of
 those questioned stated that their communities had been involved with the identification of the micro-
 projects, while a slightly lower but still clear majority (72 percent) saw no problem with the identification
 process.

 Similar to the experience with identification, close to half (54 percent) of the community respondents said
 that they had been personally involved with the implementation of the MPs and a clear majority (68
 percent) found no problems with the implementation process. The project implementing unit (MDFG/SID)
 was given a high rating (4.5 out of 5) regarding the quality of work performed, general payments
 discipline, and timely conclusion of works. Most (82 percent) of the respondents stated that the micro-
 projects had had a positive impact on their community, with a) almost all (93 percent) saying the access to
 services and b) almost as many (84 percent) declaring that the quality of services had improved.



                                                       32

The formation of social capital does appear to have been a major accomplishment of this municipal
development project. Three-quarters (74 percent) of the respondents said that their linkages with each
other, bonding, had increased due to the project. Somewhat less (70 percent) saw related improvements
brought about by the project on local self-organization. Notably, a similar clear majority (71 percent)
stated that relations between community and local authorities, bridging, had improved due to project
activities. Still, the pervasiveness and durability of these indicators in open to question. Only slightly over
a quarter (28 percent) of those surveyed saw the decision-making culture as being changed in their
communities due to the project. Less than half (45 percent) saw the communities participating in the
maintenance of created infrastructure, and only about half (53 percent) were aware of the existence of the
community development committee (CDC), a major institutional legacy of the project.

Conclusion

While this Beneficiary Assessment appears to have been skewed to favor opinions of community leaders
over those of normal residents and may not have been conducted in fully representative project sites, it
does portray a generally successful development undertaking, both in terms of realizing people's expressed
needs and forming social capital. Project improvements could and should be made in increasing the
participation of community members in the planning and identification phase and in more fully and
effectively disseminating information about the project. Nevertheless, on balance, this intervention in the
municipalities of Georgia was clearly considered by its intended beneficiaries to have brought about an
improvement in their lives.

II. Major Developments and achievements related to the Project Objectives

a. Project Management and Activities

    The Georgian Social Investment Fund (GSIF) was established by the Presidential Decree (1996,
August 16). It was the joint initiative of the Government Of Georgia, World Bank and USAID. On 30
April, 1998 the GSIF has became an legal entity under the public law. With the purpose of better
coordination and improvement of social investments implementation, the Government decided in 2005 to
integrate GSIF into the MDFG. The Decree of the President of Georgia was issued (#1027, December 6,
2005) "On merger of the Juridical Entity of Public Law- Georgian Social Investment Fund with the
Juridical Entity of Public Law-Municipal Development Fund". The Government of Georgia issued the
Decree #4 on January 12, 2006 and approved the new Charter of the MDFG. The GSIF has been
integrated into the MDFG legally and correspondingly the MDFG has assumed all rights and obligations
of the GSIF, including those set forth in the Project Agreement, the Operating Manual, and the Ministry
of Finance-GSIF project implementation agreement. In Development Credit and Project Agreements,
each and every reference to the "Georgian Social Investment Fund" is replaced with the "Municipal
Development Fund of Georgia", and each and every reference to the "GSIF" is replaced with the
"MDFG". On March 20, 2006 WB signed the Amendment of the Development Credit and Project
Agreements (Georgian Social Investment Fund project /Credit #3758 GE/).

    b. Second Social Investment Fund Project (CREDIT # IDA 3758 GE)

    Initially, the total cost of the Georgian Social Investment Fund (GSIF) Project was financed by the
World Bank and later was added loan, allocated by the German Reconstruction Credit Bank for
implementation of the "Employment Generation Program in Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park Support
Zone" (as a continuation of the previous project GSIF 1-BMZ-# 1999 65 989).
        The following project following components had been implemented:

-    Part A: Support to the communities, Local Self-Governments and local non-governmental
     organizations.

                                                       36

  · Provision of training and technical assistance to: (i) communities and Community Development
     Committees in community development planning, mobilization for Micro-project
     implementation, and advocacy skills; (ii) Local Self-Government in community development
     planning and strengthening management and administration skills; and (iii) local non-
     governmental organizations. The MDFG SID provided the training and technical assistance to
     various communities and Community Development Committees in community development
     planning on various levels; Mobilized them for Micro-project implementation and advocacy
     skills; strengthened management and administration skills of the Local Self-Government in
     community development planning and local non-governmental organizations. During the
     project implementation (IDA portion) there was established 225 Community Development
     Committee (CDC), prepared 225 Local Development Plan (LDP), in 874 Sakrebulo, among the
     presented proposals the highest demand by typology comes on education facilities, then comes
     water supply facilities, gasification, culture centers, roads, bridges, health facilities, power
     supply, communications, dam constructions, melioration, etc. The CDC and CBO members
     were: Community population, local Sakrebulo members (LSG-Local Self Government), head of
     Sakrebulo, etc. More than 10 000 person was employed in the implementation and construction
     process. It should be mentioned that local economic activities were increased and developed;
     competitive process in private sector was motivated and works supervision skills were improved
     at the local level; as a result of the GSIF activities the demand on local labor force, materials,
     contractors and suppliers was increased (total share of labor force employed in the micro-
     projects made 30 percent). In order to stimulate the competitive environment and facilitate
     activities of private companies more than 300 biddings were announced, where more than 500
     local contractors took part. More than 9000 community meetings were conducted; where over
     60,000 community members participated. Among participants over 25 000 were women and 300
     representatives of the local authority.

- Part B: Micro-projects of Small-Scale infrastructure
  · Financing of Micro-projects to improve social and economic infrastructure in accordance with
     the provision of the Operating Manual. MDFG SID (SIF-2) conducted works in eleven districts
     (IDA portion): Achara (microprojects: 19 - completed); Guria (microprojects: 14 - completed);
     Imereti: (microprojects: 36 - completed); Kakheti (microprojects: 29 - completed); Conflict
     zone (microprojects: 12 - completed); Mtskheta-Mtianeti (microprojects: 18 - completed);
     Racha-Lechkhumi (microprojects: 23 - completed); Samegrelo-zemo Svaneti (microprojects: 32
     - completed); Samtskhe-Javakheti (microprojects: 9 - completed); Kvemo Kartli (microprojects:
     21 - completed); Shida Kartli (microprojects: 12 - completed). In total 225 microprojects has
     been completed. According to the procedures the activity was conducted with the poorest
     communities (Sakrebulos) selection of which was considering establishment of poverty level
     determining indicators and compilation of questionnaire on their basis.

- Part C: Institutional Support for the GSIF
  · Strengthening of the Fund's operational capacity through: Provision of training and technical
     assistance to the Fund's staff in areas related to community development, Micro-project cycle,
     and monitoring evaluation; Provision of equipment, material and vehicles; and Carrying out of
     technical, managerial and financial audit. The MDFG worked on its regular publications in
     Georgian and English languages. It continued cooperation with the mass media representatives
     updates the formed Internet Webpage regularly and the proper information are on the following
     e-address: www.mdf.org.ge (before on www.gsif.ge). All bid announcements were transparently
     placed on the MDFG said web page and in a local/international newspapers. MDFG staff took
     videos of working meetings in cities and districts. The video archives were being updated and
     arranged. The IT department performed various development activities for reports and similar
     subjects. The MDFG used to conduct different consultation meetings/seminars/training with the
     various line ministries, local and international organizations. The GSIF Beneficiaries Impact

                                                    37

         Assessment was conducted. The Fund's operational capacity has been strengthened through the
         various training (local/international) and technical assistance in areas related to community
         development, microproject cycle, monitoring evaluation, procurement, etc.; Equipment, material
         and vehicles gas been provided to the MDFG SID and technical, managerial and financial audit
         was carried our regularly.

III. Bank and Borrower performance

            a. Bank
    IDA's supervision missions visited Georgia regularly (quarterly or twice a year) to assess progress in
    the implementation of the project and the supervision team acted always diligently to smooth out
    implementation problems and timely presenting the supervision reports. Based on the above, the
    Bank's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

            b. Borrower
    The Borrower was actively engaged in project preparation and contributed to shape the physical
    component of the project. The government was always open to discussions with IDA on various
    issues. No delays with co-financing has been from Borrower's side. Based on the above, the
    Borrower's performance is rated as highly satisfactory.

            c. Implementing Agency
    The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and the staff were following the agreed procedures, project
    implementation plan, and supervision missions' recommendations. Based on the above, the Fund's
    performance is rated as highly satisfactory.


IV. Lessons Learned

    The design and implementation of the project offers the following considerations that might be useful
    in shaping future projects of this nature. The experience under the project, including the findings of
    World Bank supervision missions, beneficiary assessments conducted by GSIF staff and external
    consultants, etc. are valuable and received positive evaluation and is regarded as a successful project.
    Nevertheless below are presented some lessons learned during the project implementation:
    · Sustainable community development requires engagement by community members as well as
        local governments (participation);
    · The initial project framework and cost limits were fixed already at the project appraisal stage (in
        2003). From the background of the significant increase of construction costs (between 2003-
        2006) it was agreed to increase the micro-projects costs limits;
    · The MDFG acquired relevant experience and expertise for managing a large-scale infrastructure
        program and now is responsible for implemented bigger projects (including school constructions)
        funded by the WB and also other donors.

Annex 10: Poverty Targeting Strategy and Allocation of Funds

Targeting Methodology

The Project's poverty targeting strategy was based on an innovative decentralized community identification
process that preceded the community mobilization stage and the micro-project cycle. The targeting was
nationwide in scope, covering all regions in Georgia, outside Tbilisi, with priority given to poorer
communities in peri-urban areas, rural towns, and villages. Tbilisi was excluded, given the large number of
organizations involved in poverty reduction programs such as UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF, USAID, WHO,
GTZ, FINCA and others. Within each of 63 districts, all its local self-government units were ranked on a
transparent needs-based approach, by the representatives of key stakeholders. They included the District
Local Self-Government Council, the heads of the district administration (Gambgebeli), local NGOs,
representatives of professional groups, such as teachers and health workers, and other significant social
groups. The ranking was carried out using completed questionnaires which include, apart from some basic
information, responses to questions relating to the following socioeconomic indicators:

    1. Access to basic social and economic infrastructure;
    2. Income levels and economic activity;
    3. Unemployment;
    4. Extent of government and donor intervention;
    5. Lack of natural resources;
    6. Location ­ distance from the district center, and altitude;
    7. Qualitative indicators that reflect the level of organization and participation of communities.

The resulting ranking was cross-checked by the MDFG Task Team, using available data. On the basis of
this process, three of the poorest self-governing units were selected initially for participation in the local
development process.

Allocation of Project Funds across Regions

There was broad agreement with the Government on the need for selectivity, and the sensitivity of limiting
funds to a few chosen regions or districts, while excluding others. It was therefore agreed that the project
would be nationwide in scope, and as noted above, that priority to be given to poorer communities in peri-
urban areas, rural towns, and villages. It was also agreed to initially, on a notional basis, to limit IDA funds
available to any district over the life of the Project to US$160,000, and not to allow more than five projects
within that limit. This allocation was subject to review and revision after the first year. Districts eligible
for KfW funds were not eligible for IDA funds.

On an ex-post basis, two questions could be posed at this stage, relating to the regional allocation of funds
and the subsequent revisions during the life of the project. These are:

    A. How far did the actual disbursement of project funds correspond to the allocations?

    B. To what extent were the project funds targeted to the poorer regions, as measured by the poverty
        indicators, which are considered representative at the regional level?

With regard to Question A, Table 1 below shows the regional allocation of project funds and the actual
disbursements. The analysis carried out by the ICR team shows a relatively high degree of correlation of
0.89 (compared to a maximum of 1.0), of the allocations versus the disbursements. This analysis points to
the conclusion that the actual disbursements in relation to the allocations were satisfactory.

As regards Question B, some conclusions can be made, notwithstanding the lack of direct comparability of
the above data with Poverty Assessment data (which includes Tbilisi). Moreover, the above Table shows a
sizeable disbursement to the conflict zones, and these zones do not feature in the regional demarcations in
Poverty Assessment reports.

The most populous regions outside Tbilisi are Imereti and Kvemo Kartli with a combined population of 37
percent of the total population (outside Tbilisi), with poverty rates of 23.0 and 35.1 percent respectively
(compared to a nationwide average of 31 percent in 2006 (see Table 2 below). These two regions received a
disbursement of 23 percent of the total shown in Table 1 above. These two regions also had extreme
poverty rates of 7.6 and 12.7 percent respectively, compared to a nationwide average of 10.7 percent (see
Table 2).

The two poorest regions (outside Tbilisi) are Kakheti and Adjara, with poverty rates of 46.2 and 44.6
percent respectively. Their combined population amount to 24 percent of the total (outside Tbilisi). These
two regions received a disbursement of 21 percent of the total shown in Table 1 above. These two regions
also had extreme poverty rates of 21.9 and 15.6 percent respectively.

Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti received the largest share of the disbursement (15 percent), with a population of
close to 15 percent of the total (outside Tbilisi). This region had a poverty rate of 29.4 percent and an
extreme poverty rate of 8.5 percent. The conflict zones received a disbursement of close to 7 percent of the
total shown in Table 1, based mainly on criteria relating to assessment of damages to infrastructure
facilities

These results point to the conclusion that, on an ex-post basis, project funds had been satisfactorily
disbursed to the largest and the poorest segments of the population, as well as to those living in the conflict
zones.
