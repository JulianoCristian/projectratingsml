CHILE
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
i.        A Bank Loan of US$10.8 million is proposed for the construction
and improvement of four primary and secondary roads in Chile, totalling
about 165 km, together with consulting services for supervision of the
construction and for studies of future highway projects.
ii.       Because Chile is 4,250 km long, but on the average less than 200
km wide, the highway network is extensive. The backbone of the network is
the Longitudinal Highway, which is paved for 3,430 km. Little additional
network expansion seems warranted at this time outside the Santiago area,
as, generally, there is adequate highway capacity, although as traffic vol-
umes increase, upgrading of sections of the network will become necessary.
Congestion is, however, becoming a serious problem in the Santiago area,
where half of Chile's ten million people live. All but one road in the
project will help alleviate congestion in this area.
iii.      The main benefit from the project will be road user savings re-
sulting from the improvement of riding surfaces and alignment and the re-
duction of congestion. The rates of return on the individual roads range
from 14% to 27Z.
iv.       There is an extensive railroad network, but road transport is
rapidly becoming more important and serving an increasing share of trans-
port demand. As the railroad system has not been rationalized and has
not concentrated on operating where it has an economic advantage, it is
now experiencing operating deficits of about US$30 million equivalent
annually. This is at present the main problem within the transport sec-
tor in Chile. The government is, however, taking steps to improve oper-
ations with the help of consultants. A study for improving the organi-
zation, financing and operations of the Chilean State Railways together
with technical assistance in implementation, financed by UNDP, with the
Bank as executing agency, is expected to be completed in December 1970.
The Government has communicated to the Bank a program of action under
which the State Railways would effect organizational changes, operation-
al improvements, reductions in personnel, tariff adjustments and the
elimination or rationalization of uneconomic branch lines and services.
This should lead to a substantial improvement in railroad services and
should enable CSR to cover their operating costs by 1975 at the latest.
It will also reduce the tendency of rail traffic to be diverted to the
highway system, thus avoiding uneconomic demand for road improvement.
v.        This would be the fifth operation of the Bank/IDA in the highway
sector and the second for highway construction. The first two investments
were made simultaneously by the Bank and IDA in 1961: they were a US$6.0
million loan (287-CH) for road maintenance equipment and an IDA Credit
(4-CH) for US$19.0 million for highway reconstruction and improvement. In



- ii -
1966, the Bank provided a Technical Assistance Grant of US$210,000 equiva-
lent for highway planning and feasibility studies. These studies serve as
a basis for the proposed loan. Although the Bank's earlier connection
with highways in Chile suffered setbacks -- delays, poor administration and
organization, inadequate detailed engineering and rising costs -- there has
been progress in management, maintenance and planning which justified the
Bank providing a loan (558-CH, US$11.6 million) in 1968 to support a high-
way maintenance program; there was some delay in making this loan effective,
and it is too early to pass judgement on this project.
vi.       The cost of the proposed project is about US$23.8 million equiv-
alent. The foreign exchange component of the project is about $10.8 mil-
lion equivalent, and a Bank Loan for this amount is proposed.
vii.      Execution of the project is the responsibility of the highway
department (Vialidad) of the Ministry of Public Works. The detailed en-
gineering was prepared by Xaver Dorsch, a firm of German consultants, in
association with Vialidad. Construction will be by contract awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding. Consultants will assist
in the supervision of the construction. The project will be completed
by mid-1974. Further studies of priority highway projects by consul-
tants are planned after Vialidad has made a preliminary study of the ex-
pected highway needs from 1973 on.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$10.8
million equivalent. An appropriate term would be 25 years including a
grace period of four years.



CHILE
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Chile has requested the Bank to help finance
a project consisting of: (a) the construction and improvement of primary
and secondary roads, totalling about 165 km; and (b) the services of con-
sultants for (i) the supervision of construction and (ii) future economic
and engineering studies of projects yet to be identified. The cost of
the project is estimated at US$23.8 million equivalent, and the Govern-
ment has requested a loan to meet the foreign exchange costs, amounting
to approximately US$10.8 million equivalent.
1.02      This would be the fifth operation of the Bank and IDA in the
highway sector in Chile, and the second one for road construction.
The first two investments were made simultaneously by the Bank and IDA
in 1961, after a severe earthquake devastated Chile's southern region.
The loan of US$6 million equivalent (Loan 287-CH) was for the purchase
of urgently needed road maintenance equipment, and the credit of US$19
million equivalent (Credit 4-CH) was to reconstruct and improve 3,900
kim of secondary roads, estimated to cost US$53 million equivalent. In
1966 the Bank made a Technical Assistance Grant of US$210,000 equivalent
to provide consulting services for (a) a highway planning study embrac-
ing some 200 roads, totalling 6,000 km, and (b) feasibility studies of
seven other roads, totalling about 300 km. In 1968 the Bank made a Loan
(558-CH) of US$11.6 million equivalent to help finance (a) the purchase
of equipment to implement a four-year highway maintenance program with
the assistance of consultants (para. 3.18) and (b) additional consulting
services for continued supervision of highway construction initiated un-
der Credit 4-CH, for feasibility studies and engineering for a new high-
way program (para. 1.04) and for advice on transport coordination and in-
vestment planning (para. 2.17).
1.03      Construction work under Credit 4-CH was not satisfactory initial-
ly. Problems developed from (i) underestimation of costs, (1i) lack of de-
tailed engineering, (iii) delayed availability of local funds, (iv) inef-
fective use of consultants, and (v) poor supervision of works. In 1963,
the Association partially suspended disbursements and performance improved
after the Government created an office staffed with capable young engineers
to coordinate the project. A Bank staff member was also stationed in Chile
to assist and advise Vialidad and to supervise the execution more closely.
Disbursements were resumed in 1964. The initial program was adjusted in
1963, in 1967, and more recently in 1969, and the cost, originally estimated
at US$53.0 million equivalent, will ultimately be about US$93 million equiv-
alent. The adjustments have involved revision, additions and higher con-
struction standards. The estimated date of completion is 1971. Earlier con-
pletion cannot be achieved due to climatic conditions which limit the con-
struction season to six or seven months in the year. The IDA Credit was ful-
ly disbursed by December 1968, and the Government is providing the remaining
funds to complete the program.



- 2 -
1.04      The initial poor performance under 287-CH and the delay in obtain-
ing much needed maintenance equipment were due to the lack of a good main-
tenance organization and a clear maintenance plan. However, a plan was de-
veloped by 1964 and equipment was procured by 1966. Although implementa-
tion of the maintenance plan was interrupted by the earthquake and floods of
1965/66, the foundation was laid in this earlier project for the maintenance
loan (558-CH) which was made in 1968. This latter loan was not made effec-
tive until 1969 and it is too early to judge the success of this project.
1.05      Despite setbacks in earlier projects, there has been progress in
a number of directions -- in the management of Vialidad, in acceptance of
planning principles, and in maintenance -- although much remains to be done.
The proposed project would, together with the highway maintenance project
(Loan 558-CH), support and encourage further improvements in Chile'Is high-
way development.
1.06      The current project resulted from the highway studies financed
under the Techaical Assistance Grant. The final studies and detailed en-
gineering for thts project were carried out by a German consulting firm
(Dorsch), engaged by Vialidad with Bank approval under Loan 558-CH.
1.07      This appraisal is based on the studies and etigineering refer-
red to above and on the findings in August 1969 of a Bank appraisal mis-
sion composed of Messrs. Migliorini (engineer), Shields (economist) and
Ahlstrand (ecoaomist).

2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Chile extends for 4,250 km along the western slope of the Andes.
It is bordered by Peru to the north and Bolivia and Argentina to the east.
2.02      The Northern Region, which is rich in nitrates, was formerly of
great economic importance. It is a desert with a little irrigated agri-
culture. Copper is mined in both the Northern and Central Regions. Cen-
tral Chile has a mid-Mediterranean type climate and produces a wide range
of crops. The Southern Region produces livestock and timber.
2.03      Chile has a population of about 9.3 million, growing at about
2.1% per annum; half live within a 160 km radius of Santiago, the capital.
About 26% of the working population is employed in agriculture, but con-
tributes less than 8% of GDP. Manufacturing, construction and mining employ
about 28% of the labor force, contributing 42% of GDP. Trade and services
account for the rest. Between 1960 and 1969 GDP was growing at an average
annual rate of 4%. However, in 1968, GDP grew only 2.7%, and the estimated
growth rate for 1969 is about 3.5%. The main reason for the slowdown was a
very severe drought which not only affected agricultural production, but,
because of power failures, also industrial production. Per capita GDP is
now about $530.
2.04      There has been a failure to reduce inflation, now running at over
30% p.a., because it was not possible to limit public sector demands and
the Government has been unable to maintain a policy of wage and salary re-
straint.
B. The Transport Sector
General
2.05      Apart from mining, most economic activity is concentrated in the
Central and Southern Regions. An extended road and rail transportation
system is maintained, stretching from the northern border with Peru to the
southern tip of the continent. Because of the distances involved and the
lack of sufficient economic activity, a large part of the transport system
operates with very low traffic density and consequent excess capacity. It
is important, therefore, in planning future investment in transport facil-
ities that unnecessary expansion, creating even more excess capacity in
the system, should be avoided. A summary of the estimated modal distribu-
tion of freight traffic in 1968 is given below:



-4 -
m ton-km             % Share
Coastal Shipping                7,899                54.4
Road                            4,390                30.2
Rail                            1,918                13.2
Air                                25                 0.2
Pipeline                          298                 2.0
14,530               100.0
Highways
2.06      The highway system, described more fully in Chapter 3, is ex-
tensive and adequate for current needs in terms of overall mileage
(about 60,000 km). Until recently, lack of design and poor maintenance
resulted in roads which had to be rebuilt frequently, making the true
cost of road building very high. The 1968 Bank highway maintenance loan
of $11.6 million (558-CH) should help to remedy the situation.
2.07      Road freight transport which has been growing at almost 6.0%
p.a., is currently estimated at roughly 5 billion ton-km, or more than
double rail freight traffic. Passenger car traffic is increasing at
9.0% p.a.
Railways
2.08      Of the 7,540 km of railway in Chile, 6,640 km belong to the
Chilean State Railways (CSR), 450 km to the Antofagasta-Bolivia Rail-
way and 450 km to private mining companies. The CSR is composed of
five networks -- the Southern, Northern, and three auxiliary networks.
The Southern network is by far the most important of the CSR networks,
carrying 96% of passenger traffic and about 75% of freight traffic.
Between 1964 and 1968, passenger traffic on the Southern network grew
by 2% p.a., and freight traffic by 1.5% p.a. On the Northern network,
in the same period, passenger traffic declined at an average rate of
12% p.a., while freight traffic, of which 87% was mineral ores, grew
at 9% p.a. Traffic densities on the CSR average only 300,000 ton-km
per route kilometer, with many branches carrying lower volumes. Be-
tween 1966 and 1968, the annual deficit for operations, net of any de-
preciation charges, ranged from $27 million to $29 million. A study
of measures for improving the efficiency of the CSR is nearing comple-
tion. It was financed by the UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency
and carried out by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France). The Bank has not
yet financed any railway projects.



- 5 -
2.09      Earlier this year, the Government communicated to the Bank a plan
of action covering a number of measures intended to achieve substantial im-
provement in railroad services and to enable CSR to cover its operating
costs by 1975. This plan of action entails:
(i) implementing various measures recommended by
SOFRERAIL for improving the operating effi-
ciency of the railway (See Annex A);
(ii)  studying 23 branch lines for possible ratio-
nalization of service or closure;
(iii)  tariff changes and other steps which would
eventually bring the operating account of
the CSR into balance (the present operating
ratio is 158);
(iv) reducing the number of surplus employees;
and
(v) substantially reducing the railway capital
investment program until the measures for
improvement of efficiency are implemented.
Pipelines
2.10      The approximately 600 km of pipeline in operation carry the bulk
of the country's petroleum products from the refineries of Concon and Con-
cepcion to Maipu (near Santiago). Major extensions between Concepcion and
the South are planned. These have no implications for any of the highway
projects discussed in this report.
Civil Aviation
2.11      Air Transport is of minor importance for freight traffic (23 m
ton-km in 1967) compared with the total of such traffic carried by all
modes. However, it provides a fast, reliable means of covering the long
distances in the country. There are 14 registered airlines, but the
state-owned airline (LAN-Chile) carries over 90% of domestic passenger
traffic and 45% of freight traffic.
Shipping
2.12      In terms of goods transported, coastal shipping is the most im-
portant mode. Almost 8 billion ton-km were attained in 1968. The only
cargoes which are increasing are bulk liquid and bulk ore traffic, general
cargoes having been declining for the past ten years.
2.13      Almost all foreign trade comes by sea.  There are 68 ports, most-
ly of minor economic significance, serving foreign traffic and coastal
shipping. Valparaiso and San Antonio handle 50% of all public port traffic.



- 6 -
The Bank has been considering a US$8 million loan for improvements to these
ports on condition that the national port authority be reorganized. How-
ever, the Chilean government has indicated that it cannot obtain the neces-
sary legislation. The Bank is presently considering whether necessary
changes in port administration can be achieved without congressional action.
C. Transport Coordination
2.14      Three modes of transport in Chile (road, rail, and coastal ship-
ing) are in direct competition. Since the highway system is already ex-
tensive, future improvements should for the most part be confined to reha-
bilitating and progressively improving standards and capacity as traffic
demand increases. There has been considerable diversion of traffic from
rail to road, because of poor service on the railways. Some of this traf-
fic is expected to return to the railway when the improvements described
in para 2.09 above have been implemented. The railroad has not broken
even on its operating account since 1944.  Coastal shipping has lost a
great deal of its general cargo to roads and this item now constitutes
only 9% of total coastal ton-km compared with 25% in 1960.
2.15      The machinery for transport coordination already exists in the
Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT). The creation of the Min-
istry in December 1967 by the merger of the former office of the Under-
Secretary for Transport in the Ministry of Economy with the Ministry of
Public Works, was the first step, and in September 1968, a sectoral of-
fice of the National Planning Office (ODEPLAN) was created in the MOPT.
2.16      In April 1969, the Transport Planning Division of Planning and
Budget in MOPT (see Chart 1) circulated an informative study entitled
"Situation and Prospects for Growth of the Transport Sector, 1968-70",
which is a statement of transport policy. This document stated that in
the transport system as a whole there was a great deal of excess capacity
and duplication of facilities; that the Government intended to pursue a
policy of equalising intermodal competition by introducing tariffs which
reflected the true costs of the different modes; that where social ser-
vices were performed, the transport mode affected would be compensated by
the government; that the recommendations of SOFRERAIL would be acted upon,
including the abandonment of uneconomic lines and a gradual rationaliza-
tion of the rail tariff which would make the CSR financially independent
within 10 years, (the first stage would be to enable the CSR's revenues
to cover its operating costs); and, that the Government intended to create
an autonomous National Port Authority.
2.17      To minimize duplication of services by different modes, the de-
cision-making authority must have accurate information on the implications
of alternative courses of action in the fields of transport pricing and in-
vestment. The Ministry has engaged two French transport experts to work
with the Planning and Budget Section over a period of 17 months. They will
assist the Ministry in developing and strengthening the machinery for plan-
ning transport investment. They will establish criteria to guide transport



investment during the period 1971-1980, paying particular attention to the
accompanying pricing and taxation policies. They will also assist in the
training of the local transport economists who will be associated with them.
Finally, the experts will identify any further studies which may be neces-
sary for the preparation of an economically based national transport de-
velopment program. Funds for these experts were included in Loan 558-CH.
2.18      Although the solution of the problem of excess capacity and
duplication in Chile's transport system is very important, the highway
improvements considered in the present project have no serious implica-
tions for intermodal allocation of traffic. Improving the Loncomilla-
Constitucion highway might, however, facilitate the closing of a nearby
uneconomic branch railway line (para. 5.14).

3. HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. Highway Network
3.01      Chile's highway network totals about 60,000 km.  The Longitudinal
Highway, which lies in the central valley, is the back-bone of the system.
With the exception of 150 km, the Longitudinal Highway is paved over its
3,580 km between the Peruvian border and Chiloe Island; it coanects the
main inland urban centers and most of the other highways feed into it from
mining, farming and industrial areas and seaports. In the last eight years
the Government has concentrated its efforts on (i) realigning and paving
the Longitudinal, (ii) improving and reconstructing major transversal roads
in the South (under Credit 4-CH), (iii) improving the Valparaiso-Santiago
connection by initiating the construction of the Tunnel "Lo Prado" and its
access roads to provide a shorter, easier link between the capital and its
major port, and (iv) reconstructing the Valparaiso-Mendoza (Argentina) road
(with assistance from I.D.B.).
3.02      The composition of the national network in 1960 and 1969 is
given below:

In addition, there are municipal and other local roads constructed and main-
tained by the local authorities. The most important highways are indicated
in the attached Maps. Table 1 gives a breakdown of the national network in
1969 by region, type of road and surface.
3.03      The existing road network is dense enough for present requirements.
The future development of the regions off the Longitudinal artery, however,
demands the improvement of some of the transversal connections, the majority
of which consist of gravel and earth roads. The policy over the last nine
years has been to extend pavement at the rate of about 8.5% per year, while
extending the network only by a negligible amount.

B. Highway Administration
3.04      The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MOPT) is in charge
of planning, study, design, construction, expansion, and maintenance of
public works. It is the coordinating organization for the execution of
the work performed by its departments and other agencies. The organiza-
tion is shown in Chart No. 1.
3.05      Responsibility for the design, construction and maintenance of
the national highway system is vested in the Highway Department (Vialidad),
which is the most important branch of MOPT (see Chart 2). The department
has the following five main divisions: Highway Construction, Highway Main-
tenance, Bridge Design and Construction, Equipment and Purchasing, and
Highway Design.
3.06      Two foreign consulting firms are at present assisting Vialidad,
namely, IECO (USA) in the implementation of the highway maintenance pro-
gram and in the supervision of construction under the Credit 4-CH project,
and Dorsch (Germany) in the preparation of engineering studies for the
roads which constitute the proposed project. During the peak of the 4-CH
program, a Bank engineer was stationed in Chile to assist with its execu-
tion.
C. Highway Financing and Planning
3.07      A breakdown of expenditure in highway construction and mainte-
nance for the years 1960 to 1968 and forecast expenditure up to 1975 is
given in Table 2. From 1962 through 1966 the investment in highway con-
struction increased every year in real terms and reached a figure of
about US$65 million equivalent in 1966. Between 1966 and 1968, it de-
creased by over 30% to US$43 million equivalent as a consequence of the
Government's decision to restrict expenditures on highway construction
and to increase those in the industrial sector and for health, educa-
tion and community programs. The decrease in highway investment was
also influenced by the Government's wish to complete feasibility and
detailed engineering studies before embarking on large scale highway
programs. Vialidad is presently completing only past construction com-
mitments which comprise the road program initiated under Credit 4-CH,
the improvement of the I.D.B.-financed road from Valparaiso to Mendoza
and the Lo Prado tunnel on the Santiago-Valparaiso highway. From 1962
to 1967, expenditure on maintenance increased from US$15.2 to US$24.5
million equivalent. There was a slight reduction in 1968.
3.08      Budget allocations have sometimes fallen short of actual re-
quirements for a project. When this situation arises, the procedure for
reallocation from one project to another is slow. There is a possibil-
ity of obtaining supplementary funds from outside the Vialidad budget,
but this has proved difficult in the past. In order to ensure that
sufficient local funds are available for the execution of the proposed
project, during negotiations the Government agreed that every year Vialidad



- 10 -
will, with the supervisory consultants, prepare a detailed estimate of
the funds required for the project for the forthcoming fiscal year. On
the basis of such estimates Vialidad will consult with the Bank on the
preparation of its annual budget, and a similar procedure will be fol-
lowed for any budget adjustment needed during the course of the year.
The Government has agreed that it will not amend budget allocations for
the project, without prior reference to the Bank.
3.09      Until recently, there was no highway planning effort by Viali-
dad. The first attempt at preparing a national plan was the Bank-financed
study of 6,000 km of principal highway (para. 1.02) which has served as a
basis for subsequent studies. Traffic counts were taken three times in
1966 and in 1968 at several hundred stations. It is planned to repeat
this every two years from now on. Furthermore, twenty permanent counting
stations have been sited on principal routes, and traffic is also recorded
at seven highway toll stations. Vialidad has begun to conduct origin and
destination surveys in connection with project planning. In addition, a
highway inventory is now available. However, because they lack economic
expertise, the staff of Vialidad is not able to establish priorities based
on the economic evaluation of a project, although some experience was
acquired from consultants during the preparation of feasibility studies
for this project and previous Bank/IDA-financed projects. Bank staff will
assist Vialidad during supervision of the proposed project to determine
priority needs for further study.
D. Highway Engineering
3.10      In the past, location and design of roads were inadequate.  The
shortage of engineering staff hindered efforts to prepare detailed plans
with accurate quantity estimates. As a result, frequent increases in the
estimated costs of projects took place during construction. Because en-
gineering has commonly been incomplete at the time of bidding, contractors
have bid very low prices knowing that quantities are likely to increase
considerably during construction to the extent which would justify renego-
tiation of prices. The completion of final engineering for the project
under review should ensure that this does not happen in this case.
3.11      Together with the consultant, Dorsch, Vialidad has established
design standards for different classes of road, based on the estimated
future average daily traffic and the type of terrain. The design stand-
ards for the proposed project are summarized in Table 4. These standards
are consistent with accepted modern engineering practice.
3.12      The Construction Department has established a network of testing
laboratories which have improved quality control and provided design data.
3.13      District organizations are, in general, competent and well or-
ganized, but staff shortages are responsible for most of the problems of
supervising and administering highway construction. In general, Vialidad
supervises construction works with its own personnel. In the past, for



- 11 -
example during the Credit 4-CH program, insufficient supervisory staff and
inadequate utilization of consultants' advisory services led to delays in
making decisions on urgent construction problems, and as a result con-
tractors have had too free a hand. For the proposed project, Vialidad
will arrange for sufficient, qualified personnel to reside on the site of
the works and utilize the services of at least one experienced advisor for
each supervisory team.  This will permit both adequate supervision and the
acquisition of experience by local personnel.  Payments to contractors can
only be based on certificates provided by government officials; the ad-
visors should however verify the monthly statements for payments to con-
tractors, and prepare and countersign the Government's requests for loan
disbursements. This should ensure compliance with specifications and
approved design. Table 3 indicates the tentative disposition of super-
visory staff agreed with Vialidad during negotiations; the advisors will
be provided by a firm of consulting engineers.
3.14      Vialidad's capacity for designing and supervising highway pro-
jects is limited. Supervision of construction of the roads in the cur-
rent project can, however, be arranged without endangering the efficiency
of supervision on other contracts currently in progress, because many of
them, for example the 4-CH program and the Lo Prado Tunnel, are near-
ing completion and some supervisory staff will be available for reas-
signment. In addition, there are many practicing Chilean engineers
who could be contracted by Vialidad to assist them, in the same manner
as they have been employed to work with consultants on the final engi-
neering of the roads in this project.
E. Highway Construction
3.15      Highway construction is normally by unit price contract, let
after competitive bidding. The Chilean construction industry has de-
veloped with the construction of the Longitudinal Highway and the works
financed under Credit 4-CH, and there are now several major contracting
firms capable of handling large road contracts. There are four major
foreign contracting firms, two Argentinian and two U.S., working in the
country, and others may be attracted.
3.16      Equipment is imported either paying all duties, and is free to
be sold afterwards, or under a temporary importation license, in which
case no duties are paid but the equipment has to be re-exported from the
country when the permit expires.
F. Highway Maintenance
3.17      In August 1968, the Bank made Loan 558-CH for $11.6 million,
for a four-year highway maintenance program. It was essentially to
finance consulting services, the purchase of maintenance, shop and
other equipment and the training overseas of Vialidad maintenance per-
sonnel. U.S. Consultants (IECO) are providing advisory services. In
addition, the German Government has recently made a loan of about US$1
million equivalent for the purchase of maintenance equipment.



- 12 -
3.18      At present, road maintenance is undertaken by a combination of
contractors and Vialidad's own forces. In the future, most maintenance will
be undertaken directly by Vialidad. The equipment which will be purchased
shortly (after some delay in obtaining and evaluating bids) will enable the
department to carry out this work on its own account.
3.19      Under Loan 558-CH the Government agreed that Vialidad would (i)
adequately maintain the national highway system, (ii) enforce the law gov-
erning size and weight of vehicles and (iii) collect data necessary for
systematic highway planning. Vailidad has already introduced a system for
recording the operating costs of maintenance equipment, and is collecting
other data required for highway planning. The Government is in the pro-
cess of strengthening the machinery for enforcing vehicle regulations, but
this machinery is still to be put to effective use. During loan negotia-
tions, the Government reaffirmed the above undertakings and agreed to in-
troduce a highway maintenance cost accounting system. As regards the vehi-
cle weights and dimensions regulations, the Government will agree wit-b the
Bank on a timetable for their implementation by mid-1971, by which daLe
ongoing studies of the overloading problem will have been completed.
3.20      As Loan 558-CH did not become effective until April 1, 1969, and
new equipment to be provided thereunder for the maintenance program is not
yet available, it is too early to comment on the success of the program.
Expenditure on maintenance in 1968 (US$21 million equivalent) was somewhat
less than in 1967 (Table 2), and was far less than was anticipated (US$30
million equivalent) under the agreed 1968-1971 maintenance program; this
was due to the delay in Loan effectiveness and the consequent deferral of
the program. A sum of US$28 million equivalent has been provided in the
1970 budget; the details of this budget have been reviewed and found sa-
tisfactory.
G. Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.21      Between 1960 and 1968, total vehicle registrations in Chile grew
at an annual average rate of 9.2%, from 126,000 to 257,000. Passenger ve-
hicles (including buses) increased at the rate of 10.4% p.a., while trucks
increased by 5.7% p.a. As a result, the proportion of trucks in the vehi-
cle population declined from 28.4% in 1960 to 22.1% in 1968. Recent pro-
jections by the Government Planning Office of 435,000 cars in 1980, com-
pared with 130,000 in 1968, imply a growth rate of 10.4% p.a., which is
reasonable. Gasoline consumption grew at the rate of 8.4% p.a. It is not
possible to make a judgment on the trend in the use of trucks, since diesel
used for motor fuel cannot be estimated with any satisfactory degree of ac-
curacy, as separate figures are not maintained for different uses. Statis-
tics on vehicle registrations and gasoline consumption are given in Tables
5 and 6.
3.22      The motor industry, although small, is one of the most rapidly
growing in Chile. The output of passenger cars, vans and light trucks
assembled from locally manufactured and imported components has been
growing at the rate of over 20% p.a. since 1962. Production in 1968 was



- 13 -
20,000 units, and planned output in 1969 was 34,000. Imports of fully as-
sembled passenger cars are prohibited and imports of trucks are permitted
only in the case of trucks and chassis for use in mining, construction and
lumber industries or for transportation of liquid gas and refrigerated
goods. To accelerate the development of the remote provinces of Tarapaca,
Atacama, Chiloe and Magallanes, trucks imported through the free ports of
these provinces are not subject to import duties. Through other ports,
duties amount to 80% if imports are through cooperatives and 160% if by
individuals.
3.23      The Government recently enacted legislation to create a special
financial institution to extend credit for car purchases. Initially, at
least, this will sustain the growth in the automobile fleet.
3.24      Revenues from taxes on the use and ownership of motor vehicles
yielded an estimated $72 million equivalent in 1967.  This covered the
outlay (recurrent and investment) of the highway department on the nation-
al network in the same year, and, with the assumed rate of growth in traf-
fic, future revenues will cover expected expenditures until 1975. Using
the replacement value of the intercity road net as a basis for comparison,
1967 charges on road users yielded about 75% of this value.
3.25      However, the basis for levying highway user charges may need
rationalizing. Annual license fees are composed of municipal and state
taxes which, in the case of passenger cars, are levied as percentages
of the value of the vehicle. The state tax on trucks is proportional to
load capacity, but varies according to the age of the vehicle. The tax
is equivalent to about US$6.66 per ton load capacity for vehicles manu-
factured in or prior to 1962 and US$13.32 per ton capacity for those man-
ufactured in later years. The only tax which recognizes that there may
be more than proportionally higher costs imposed on the road system by
heavier vehicles is the municipal tax on trucks. In the case of tolls,
Vialidad already charges differential rates for different types of vehi-
cles at different times of the day and of the week. For example, the
Friday to Sunday toll on the Santiago-San Antonio highway is between 67%
and 80% higher than the Monday to Thursday tariff. The assistance of the
transport coordination experts to the MOPT is expected to result in recom-
mendations for the rationalization of road user charge policy.

4. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(I)  the construction or reconstruction, including paving,
of about 165 km of four national highways;
(ii)  construction supervision for the above; and
(iii)  pre-investment studies for future highway construction
programs.
According to projections made by MOPT (Table 7) for the period 1971-1974,
the proposed Bank financed project would constitute about 8% of the con-
struction program of Vialidad during this period. The Bank loan itself
will provide about 3.5% of total funding for the road program. The other
currently identified source of external finance is IDB which during the
same period will make a contribution of about the same order of magnitude
to the highway construction program.
B. Highways to be Constructed or Reconstructed (Map)
4.02      Padre Hurtado - San Antonio (Puangue) Expressway:  This 77 km
highway is the shortest route between the port of San Antonio and the city
of Santiago. The project to be financed consists of: the addition of 2
lanes to 4 km of the present road between Padre Hurtado and Malloco (see
map 2), a grade separated interchange at Malloco, and construction of a
new four lane access controlled highway for 12 km from Malloco to Talagante.
The 13 km section between Talagante and El Paico will be constructed with
the Government's own resources. Vialidad has let a contract for four lane
construction of 10 km of this section, and the construction is already in
an advanced stage. The project will then continue with a 29 km, two lane
access controlled road between El Paico and Puangue, bypassing Melipilla,
with an intersection and connecting road to Melipilla, and a grade separated
interchange at Puangue. From Puangue to San Antonio the present road will
have sufficient capacity.
4.03      San Antonio - Algarrobo:  This is a 25.5 km road which joins the
main San Antonio - Santiago Highway. The present pavement, 6 m wide, is
deteriorating rapidly under growing traffic. The proposed reconstruction
will include partial realignment (reducing the length to 24.5 km), widen-
ing, improved drainage works, the construction of four new bridges, and
paving with 6 cm. bituminous roadmix.
4.04      Puchuncavi - La Laguna:  The main purpose of this 14.5 km road
is to carry copper ore for refining to Ventanas near Puchuncavi. The
work proposed includes partial realignment, bridging, improved drainage
and double bituminous surface treatment.



- 15 -
4.05      Loncomilla - Constitucion:  This 67 km section connects the port
town of Constitucion with the Longitudinal Highway near the town of San
Javier. The area is an important forest zone. The Chilean Government in-
tends to establish a plant near Constitucion to produce 175,000 tons of
cellulose per annum. The proposed improvement includes realignment, drain-
age works, and double surface treatment.
4.06      All the project roads will be built to Class M standards as de-
scribed in Table 4, except for the Padre Hurtado-San Antonio Expressway
which will be built to Class K. The design standards for the project roads
generally follow those adopted nationally, but with certain minor accept-
able modifications.
C. Consulting Services
For Roads and Bridges to be Constructed or Reconstructed
4.07      Detailed engineering, prepared by Vialidad, was reviewed, revised,
and is being completed by Dorsch (Germany). Dorsch's services are being
partially financed from Loan 558-CH. Full detailed engineering will be com-
pleted in May 1970. The engineering work is satisfactory.
4.08      The project road construction should be supervised by consultants,
who will operate as advisors to Vialidad. The past experience on supervi-
sion and arrangements desirable for the proposed project were discussed in
para. 3.13. The Government proposes to employ a firm of consultants accept-
able to the Bank for supervision of construction following these arrange-
ments. The scope of the consultants' services was discussed and agreed
during loan negotiations.
4.09      Construction will last 3-1/2 years, and for this period about 180
man-months of consultant's services will be required, including assistance
to Vialidad for bid evaluation. Vialidad has already, with Dorsch's assis-
tance, initiated the prequalification process and an analysis of applica-
tions and recommendations for prequalification will be sent to the Bank for
review shortly.
For Pre-Investment Studies for Future Construction Projects
4.10      In spite of the studies financed by the Bank Technical Assistance
Grant four years ago, a great deal of work for a national highway develop-
ment program is still needed. Vialidad has already collected information
which could be used for the preliminary selection of projects for a nation-
al highway investment program (para. 3.09). During negotiations, it was
agreed that the Government would prepare, by July 31, 1970, a list of highway
projects in order of priority. This will be used for the purpose of de-
termining, in agreement with the Bank, the highways for which feasibility
and engineering studies to be financed under the project should be under-
taken. It is expected that a program consisting of up to 500 km of road



- 16 -
feasibility study will result. The feasibility studies would be commis-
sioned from consultants in 1971 and subsequently final engineering would be
undertaken for those sections for which the feasibility is demonstrated.
On this basis they would be suitable for Bank consideration by about 1973.
D. Cost Estimates, Financing and Disbursement
4.11      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$23.8 million
equivalent, including allowances for quantity and price escalation. A
suDmary (showing the foreign exchange component which the loan would fi-
nance) follows:

4.12      The cost estimates were prepared by Dorsch on the basis of de-
tailed engineering which was 80% complete at the time of appraisal and
is now virtually completed. The estimates were reviewed and confirmed
during negotiations and are considered satisfactory.
4.13      The right-of-way for the roads to be constructed would be ac-
quired by the Government under its existing powers, which are adequate.
No significant problems have been encountered on previous projects, and
none are anticipated on the proposed project, for which right-of-way
will have been acquired before contracts are awarded.
4.14      A ten percent contingency for quantity increases has been pro-
vided in the cost estimate, and this is considered reasonable in view of
the advanced stage of detailed engineering. In addition, a five percent
contingency has been allowed for global price increases during the course
of the project. Local cost increases will be accommodated by the govern-
ment's escalation formula and it is assumed that adjustments in the for-
eign exchange rate of the escudo will generally parallel changes in its
domestic purchasing power.
4.15      The costs of consulting services for items 2 and 3 have been es-
timated on the probable number of man-months required for the work de-
scribed (para. 4.08-4.10) applying average local and foreign man-month
rates. A contingency allowance of 10% has been added to the estimated
cost of these services.
4.16      It is proposed that the loan would finance the foreign exchange
component of construction cost which is estimated by the consultants, on
the basis of half of the work being awarded to foreign contractors and
half to local, to be 45% of the total. This estimate is considered real-
istic.   The loan would also finance the actual foreign exchange cost of
consulting services for construction supervision and for preinvestment
studies.
E. Execution
4.17      Vialidad is being assisted by Dorsch in prequalifying contractors.
The consultants to be employed for supervision of construction will analyse
bids and make recommendations for award of contracts.
4.18      Vialidad intends to call for bids for the Padre Hurtado-Puangue
and Loncomilla-Constitucion roads by September 1970 and for the other roads
in 1971. On this basis, the tentative annual breakdown of expenditures be-
tween the Government and the Bank would be as follows:

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      Reduced operating costs on the project roads will stem from
improved riding surfaces, better alignment and reduced congestion.
Table 8 contains a 1968 estimate of average vehicle operating costs in
Chile, net of taxes, for different road conditions.
B. The Project Roads
(i) Padre Hurtado - San Antonio Expressway
5.02      Traffic volumes on this highway fluctuate widely, and its
capacity is reached frequently. The built-up areas, particularly be-
tween Padre Hurtado and Melipilla, become serious bottlenecks during
peak traffic hours. As more and more people move to the suburbs along
this axis and commute to Santiago, the problem is being accentuated.
Many industries are being sited in the vicinity of the Santiago - Meli-
pilla road. The 1968 ADT varied from about 2,000 to 7,500 vehicles
(Table 9), and peak traffic volumes attained 1,500 vehicles per hour
and 11,000 per day.
5.03      The work on this highway will be the first stage of the con-
struction of a future four-lane restricted access highway between Santia-
go and the port and coastal resort of San Antonio. The section Santiago-
Padre Hurtado is already four-lane. The present project consists of the
construction of 12 km of four-lane highway and 33 km of two-lane highway
between Padre Hurtado and Puangue.  The sections from Puangue to San An-
tonio will require no additional capacity for many years. Average annual
traffic growth along the corridor served by this road in recent years has
been about 10%, and the consultants realistically forecast a growth until
1990 of about 7% per annum. Detailed traffic projections are included in
Table 9.
5.04      No increase in traffic from diversion or generation is foreseen.
However, there is an important railroad link between Santiago and San An-
tonio, which carries only 20% of the number of passengers carried by the
road, but 120% of the freight traffic moving by road. The improved road
will not by itself change the modal allocation of traffic because of the
mineral nature of the railway traffic and its origin in the copper produc-
ing areas southeast of Santiago. Future construction of shorter routes
from the mineral area round Rancagua may, however, lead to the diversion
of some freight traffic from rail to this road.
5.05      It is estimated that vehicle operating cost savings, net of
passenger time costs, would be equivalent to a first year benefit from
the proposed investment of 15%. The increase in vehicle operating cost
savings will average 12% p.a. until 1990. The rate of return over a 20-
year economic life will be 27%.



- 21 -
5.06      The present road is a toll facility and, as described in para-
graph 3.25, Vialidad already varies the toll in an attempt to spread the
traffic. The Government has expressed its intention to continue this
practice. The transport coordination experts will pay attention to toll
pricing in the context of their review of transport pricing (para. 2.17).
(ii) San Antonio - Algarrobo Highway
5.07      This is a coastal road whose existing paving is failing badly
under increasing traffic volumes.
5.08      In 1968, the annual ADT was 1,200 vehicles, with only 30% trucks
and buses. The summer ADT is 250% of the annual ADT. Since 1966 traffic
has grown at 15% p.a. (see Table 9). The consultants have used a some-
what conservative traffic forecast growth rate equivalent to 6% p.a. un-
til 1990.
5.09      Benefits from savings in vehicle operating costs will grow normal-
ly at 6%, the same rate as traffic. On the basis of these alone, the rate
of return over the 20-year economic life would be 20%.
(iii) Puchuncavi - La Laguna
5.10      This road is a section of the coastal highway which runs from
Vina del Mar to the Longitudinal Highway near Papudo; it is at present
paved as far as Puchuncavi, 5 km north of the Ventanas copper refinery.
The main benefit from paving the road will be the road user savings from
present traffic and its normal growth, together with some traffic divert-
ed from unpaved roads.
5.11      In 1968 the ADT was estimated at 400.  The traffic distribu-
tion is 60% cars, 35% trucks and 5% buses. Summer ADT is about 230% of
annual ADT. The consultants' forecast, which implies an annual growth
of 18% in traffic between 1966 and 1970, appears unduly optimistic, as
there has been a recent annual increase of only 14%. However, even if
traffic grows by only 15% p.a. (which allows for an acceptable level of
diverted and generated traffic), the first year benefit in 1971 would be
12% of the investment. The consultants forecast a rate of return of 23%,
but even with the reduced initial rate of growth mentioned above, the
rate of return on investment would be about 18% over its 20 year econom-
ic life.
(iv) Loncomilla - Constitucion Highway
5.12      This road is part of the highway between San Javier on the
Longitudinal Highway and the coastal town of Constitucion. The first
12 km from Loncomilla, currently being reconstructed by Vialidad, is
expected to be completed by the end of 1969. The length remaining for
improvement is 67 km.



- 22 -
5.13      The ADT on different sections of this road in 1968 varied from
359 to 169 with a weighted average of 192. The feasibility of reconstruc-
ting and paving the road has been tested using three different assumptions
about the rate of traffic growth, 5% and 10% p.a. for the period 1968-1990,
and 10% between 1968 and 1972 and 7% between 1972 and 1990.
FIRST  YEAR      INTERNAL RATE
ANNUAL TRAFFIC INCREASE          BENEFIT          OF RETURN
1968-1972     1972-1992           1972            1972-1992
Low                  5              5               10                10
High                10             10               12                17
Most Likely         10              7               12                14
The first two assumptions appear to provide reasonable upper and lower lim-
its (the consultants' 1970-1990 forecast implies an annual traffic growth
rate of 9%). If the third, and most realistic, assumption regarding traf-
fic growth is adopted, then the First Year Benefit in 1972 would be 12% and
the Internal Rate of Return would be 14%. However, this traffic forecast
is dependent upon the opening of the proposed cellulose plant at Constitu-
cion by 1972 (para. 4.05). Assurance has been given that this plant will
be built, and, in fact, construction work has already begun.
5.14      There is another potential source of additional traffic.  The
narrow gauge branch railway line which runs from Talca to Constitucion is
in deficit. The extent has not been accurately ascertained, but it is
one of the lines to be studied in the near future (para. 2.09) with
a view to possible closure of the line, which, in 1968, carried 30,000
tons of freight (25,000 in one direction) and 200,000 passengers. If the
line were to be closed, about 60 vehicles per day would be diverted to
the highway. There would be, in addition, savings from the discontinua-
tion of the subsidy to the branchline.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following principal points:
(i) the appointment of consultants for project supervision
(paras. 3.13 and 4.08);
(ii) consultation with the Bank on Vialidad's annual budget,
to ensure the provision of adequate local funds for the
project (para. 3.08);
(iii) the timetable for the implementation of vehicle weights
and dimensions regulations (para. 3.19); and
(iv) the process for selection of priority roads for feasibil-
ity study (para. 4.10).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of $10.8 million. On the basis of the economic life of the highways in the
project, a term of 25 years, including a grace period of four years, would
be appropriate.
