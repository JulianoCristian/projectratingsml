Out of the four roads proposed in this project,\n            three are located in the densely populated central zone\n            between Santiago and the coast. The fourth road, connecting\n            Loncomilla with the port of Constitucion further south, will\n            serve a new cellulose plant, under construction near\n            Constitucion and may facilitate the closure of a branch\n            railway line which is likely to prove uneconomic."}, "docdt": "1970-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
