However, there\n            were several problems during the first three years of the\n            project with the selection and work of the consultants who\n            assisted Housing Development Administration with design and\n            construction supervision for the four main construction\n            components. These difficulties significantly contributed to\n            the initial implementation delays. Furthermore, there was\n            poor government commitment to the institutional components\n            attempting to strengthen Turkey's preparedness for\n            future earthquakes. The lessons learned from this project\n            include: 1) Give preventive and institutional development\n            measures a more prominent role. 2) Maintain reasonable\n            Quality at Entry even for urgent projects. 3) Local\n            involvement is key to success. 4) Seek to limit the number\n            of sectors included. 5) Avoid extensions. It would have been\n            better to close the project in 1996 and identify new\n            operations in response to future disasters on the basis of\n            the merits of those cases."}, "docdt": "2001-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
