The project will finance demolition,\n            reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repair activities in the\n            urban and rural areas including: (a) cooperative and\n            government housing, hospitals, office and shop buildings and\n            key infrastructure; (b) procurement of critical commodities\n            including livestock, and (c) training and studies to reduce\n            earthquake vulnerability.  Bank involvment will help prevent\n            the recurrence of similar earthquake damage in the future by\n            providing technical training for the construction industry,\n            identifying existing public buildings which can be\n            structurally reinforced through retrofitting, and upgrading\n            the institutional and financial arrangements which deal with\n            disasters in Turkey."}, "docdt": "1992-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
