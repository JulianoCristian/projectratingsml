A. Project Development Objective

 1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The project development objective is to improve pupilperformance and retentionthrough ensuring an
adequate supply and better use o f instructionalmaterials. The project would support the Government's
new policy o f Free Primary Education(FPE), and it would also assist the country to move towards the
Millennium Development Goal o f having all children throughout Kenya able to complete a full course o f
primary schooling by Year 2015.

The democratic electiono f a new Government inKenya on 27 December, 2002 presents an exciting new
opportunity for the Bank group to resume and strengthen its programo f support to the country, as the
new Government is quickly moving forward to address problems o f governance and corruption, and to
strengthen poverty reduction efforts. One o f the Government's highest priorities i s education, and some
bold policy changes are now being introduced. Inparticular, the Government needs urgent support to
enable it to deliver on its commitment to FPE. The proposed project i s intended to provide an initial
phase o f support to the Government to assist it as quickly as possible to deal with the immediate
challenge created by the new policy environment and particularly the abolition o f primary school fees. It
would also assist the Government to plan for a further round o f external assistance inthe education
sector.

2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The key performance indicators and targets o f the Project will be the following:

          An increase by June 2006 inthe proportiono fchildren reachingdesired standards o f
          achievement (inEnglish,Kiswahili, Mathematics and Science, in standards 2,4 and 6),
          disaggregatedby province, gender, urbadrural and intra-rural.
     0    An increase inthe proportion o f local school management committees, and parents and children,
          rating their school as satisfactory or above for the learningprocess by June 2006.
     0    A reduction indrop-out rates at all standards by June 2006.
     0    The completion o f a plan for a follow-up project to strengthen the education sector, using
          studies and training provided, approved by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry o f Education,
          Science and Technology, and addressing the concerns o fkey stakeholders.

8. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supportedby the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: No. 18391 KE (IDNR98-137)
                                -                           Date of latest CAS discussion: 09/24/98
The existing country assistance strategy (CAS) dates from 1998, and focuses on (i)     the need for Kenyan
designedand owned approaches to reform, and (ii) imperative to have broadbasedparticipationto
                                                     the
ensure the impact o f Government and World Bank supported activities. A new CAS has been under
development over the last year, embracing the draft Kenyan Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
and its underlying principles. The draft PRSP was subject to a preliminary Joint Staff Assessment, but it
i s now under review and possible revision by the new Government. The proposed strategy maintains the
conclusion o f the last CAS that sustained improvements ineconomic governance are key to providing a
basis for the effective implementation o f a poverty reduction strategy. With the recent election o f the
new Government, the Bank group i s now reactivating its program o f support to Kenya, as the
Government starts to address aggressively problems o f governance, corruption and poverty.

On the macroeconomic front, inrecent years Kenya has slipped from its formerly goodrecord o f
economic stability and growth, reflectingthe slow pace o f structural reforms, declining investment rates,
weak infrastructure, pervasive governance problems and, more recently, the withholding o f external aid
bythe internationalcommunity. Stagnation inoutput growth has affectedall sectors, and has beenmore
pronounced inagriculture and manufacturing. The failure to generate growth has increasedpoverty and
worsened social indicators. The challenge for the new Government i s to increase growth while
maintainingmacroeconomic stability. Specifically, Kenya needs to reduce the domestic debt burden,
reduce the budget deficit (now at about 6 percent o f GDP), improve the competitiveness o f the exchange
rate, and address constraints to private sector development and export growth. The World Bank i s
supporting key economic reforms via its Economic and Public Sector Reform Credit (EPSRC) o f $150
million, which includes measures to improve accountability in Government financial management,
privatize some key parastatals, and reformpublic procurement, public audits, the civil service, the
judiciary, and public expenditure reporting (including on core poverty programs). The World Bank i s
presently drafting both a Country Economic Memorandumand also a Public Expenditure Review (PER)
report, and discussions are underway with the IMFabout a possible program o f support.

There i s now an air o f expectancy in the country, and a deep hope that things will change for the better.
The new Government is under intense pressureto deliver on its electoral promises and to show some
results inthe near future. One o f the highest priorities for the new Government i s the education sector,
and the Government has requestedurgent support from the World Bank.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Inthe education sector, a great deal o fanalyticalwork has beendone inrecent years, and the Bank is
now inthe process o f updating its sectoral knowledge, includingthrough the PER. Ingeneral, Kenya
made considerable achievements inthe first two decades o f independence, with steady progress towards
equal education opportunities. For example, the gross enrollment ratio (GER) increased from 50 percent
in 1963 to 105 percent in 1989. However, primary and secondary school gross enrollment rates both
dropped significantly through the 1990s, largely due to the increasing costs o f educationto parents and
the stalling o f economic growth. By 2000 the primary school GER had dropped to an estimated 88
percent. Then, at the start o f 2003, the Government declared FPE, and the result was a very substantial
increase inenrollments in schools. It i s now estimated by the Ministryo f Education, Science and
Technology (MOEST) that primary school enrollment i s presently about 7.2 million pupils (with the
GER at 104percent), havingrisenby nearly 1million from 2002. There are about 17,750 primary
schools inthe country: the average school size in2002 was about 370 students, with the largest primary
school then having about 1,600 students; but with the new FPEpolicy, these figures have increased to
about 400 and substantially over 2,000 respectively.

There are many issues that the Government now needs to address inorder to achieve the stated goals o f
universal and free primary education, education for all (EFA), improved equity, relevance and quality o f
education, and adult education inthe context o f life-long education. Inparticular, the Government must
address and resolve the cost constraints and financing arrangements which have led to the deterioration
o f education at all levels. Kenya i s one o f the highest spenders on education inSub-Saharan Africa (over
6 percent o f GDP, and 36 percent o f recurrent expenditure), and Government needs to adopt policies and
strategies at least to ensure that public financing does not rise any further as a proportion o f total
government spending, to address the householdcost burdeno f financing education ,and also to address
the highpercentage o fpublic expenditure allocated to personal emoluments at the expense o f other
education services. It also needs to raise the internal efficiency o f the schooling system. Necessary
measures include: reducing the unit costs o f education ($60 per pupil at the primary level inYear 2002);
increasing public expenditures on non-salary costs o f education, such as textbooks and other learning

materials; implementingthe revised curriculum to allow more time on task for core subjects and to help
reduce the costs o f education; preparingand adopting an action plan for the training, redeployment,
hiringand upgradingo fteachers; revisingthe EducationAct andregulations to decentralize decision
making to district and school level administrators, and to parents' representatives; and including
education expenditures more systematically inthe processes o f the PER and the Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF). There i s now an enormous demand from parents for education for
their children, butthere are serious doubts about the country's attainment o fthe MillenniumDevelopment
Goals (MDGs) inthis sector unless such new policies are adopted to reverse the deteriorationo f recent
years.

                                 Phasing o f the Introductiono f the New Curriculum




The process o f implementingreforms inthe education sector has already been started by the new
Government. Inparticular, it has introduced FPE, although some o f the details (such as payment o f fees
for classroom constructionand the recognitiono f some non-formal schools), are still to be fully clarified.
This has resulted inthe majorjump inenrollmentnumbers for the first school term o fYear 2003, as it i s
clear that the previous costs being charged to parents were the biggest constraint on many children
attending school. Significant changes have started to be made inthe curriculum: the number o f primary
subjects has already been reduced and further curriculum changes will be introduced inall o f the primary
school standards (1-8) over next four years. The pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) has been increased
substantially (from about 32/1 to about 41/1), and the Government has agreed to having multi-grade
teachers in some schools. As part o f a move towards increased decentralization, the selection o f teachers
for primary schools has now been moved down to the district level, and to the school level for teachers
insecondary schools. All o fthese policy changes are consistent withthe advice o fthe Bank. Further
policy changes are also now being considered by a Task Force created for this purpose by the
Government.

Untilrecentlypublic spending on the provision o ftextbooks and instructional materials was limitedto a
small number o f primary schools. The available public and donor funds were targeted to the schools in
Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) areas, as well as schools located inareas believedto have particularly
highlevels o fpoverty. The rest o fthe schools have had to rely onparental and community contributions.
Butbecause o fthe highcosts involved, many households failed to purchase adequate numbers o fbooks
for their children, with the result that there were (and still are) many instances o f unacceptably high
pupi1:book ratios. Many children were also excluded from school due to their inability to buy books.

However, over the last three years, there has been a program o f major reforms inthe textbook
procurement and distribution systems. This has been done with support initially from the Netherlands
Government, and then with increased funding from the United Kingdom Department For International
Development (DFID). Inthe last 1990s, DFIDwas the only donor providing significant support to



                                                          - 6 -

primary education. The current DFIDeducation support program (SPRED 3) provides $18 million o f
financial support for the purchase o f learningmaterials for needy primary school pupils, and $3 million
for a distance learning, school-based teacher development program. The aim o f the program has been to
improve access, retention and quality o f primary education by reducing a major part o f parental costs and
providing key education materials to a system starved o f material support. Specifically, the program
supports the implementation o f a new textbook policy: textbook preparation and publication have been
liberalized; the principle o f the shared use o f textbooks has been accepted; approved lists o f textbooks
are now available; and there has been full financial decentralization o f textbook procurement to school
communities. Under SPRED 3, DFID support has matched governmental allocations for primary
textbook funding; and both Government and DFIDfunds are transferred directly to schools, via the
commercial banking system. There are School InstructionalMaterial Selection Committees (SIMSC)
comprising school teachers and parents, and they select textbooks from an MOEST approved list
(Approved list o f Primary School Textbooks and other Instructional Materials), and purchase textbooks
usinga transparent tendering process. These procurement systems are audited independently byjoint
commercial/Government auditors, who have also undertaken an impact assessment o f the book program.
The major benefits o f the program also include improved management o f the sector at Ministrylevel,
decentralized community management through school committees, and improved procurement. By the
endo f SPRED 3, all 17,750 primary schools inKenyawill have receivedat least some limitedtextbook
fundingunder the scheme. The procedures are working well, butthe amounts of financial support so far
are very modest due to the national budget constraints.

Inorder to explore inmore detail the costs andmodalitiesfor implementingFPE, the MOEST
established a Task Force inJanuary 2003. The Report o f the Task Force has recently been issued, and it
has concluded that about KSh 15 billion (about $200million) i s needed for the FPE program inthe
period up to June 2004. The breakdown o f the total costs i s $115 million for instructional materials, $26
million for staff training, $33 million for infrastructure, $19 million for the needs o f disadvantaged
groups, and $7 million for transport. Inreviewing the figures with the MOEST, however, it was felt that
some economies could be achieved by reducing the specifications for the instructional materials and the
amount o f stationery to be suppliedto pupils by the Government (allowing $10 per pupil in2003, and $2
per pupil in2004 for replacement items). It was also felt that the needs for infrastructure (particularly
classrooms) shouldbe reviewed further in the light o f a school mapping exercise. Undoubtedly more
classrooms will be needed in the medium term, but inthe short-term the authorities and many o fthe
schools are findingways to cope (through double shiftingand various forms o f improvisation). It was,
therefore, suggested that a more realistic target mightbe to aim for about 1,400 classrooms to be built
annually at a unit cost o f about $4,000. Ingeneral, the total number o f teachers i s not a major constraint,
although the deployment o f teachers remains inefficient and new measures will be needed infuture to
improve their utilization. It was also concluded that the training activities would needmore than 18
months to carry out, and that the cost figures should therefore be scaled back. Similarly, there i s need to
strengthen the management o f the education system and carry through further on decentralization, but
such policy steps require more planning and could be introduced as a second stage o f the reform
program. While the present focus o f the Government i s particularly at the primary level, there will also
be a need to focus on additional policy changes at the secondary level (and indeedtertiary level) indue
course.

3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The new policy changes inthe financing o f education have led to a huge challenge for the new
government. Many schools, especially inthe urban areas, are facing a massive influx o f children. In
addition to the 7.2 million children already enrolled, there are still others to be enrolled. The financing
needs are considerable, and without adequate fundingthere i s a danger that the newly enrolled
school-children will fail to learn much inthe schools and that the existing highlevel o f drop-outs inthe
school system will rise even further. At the political level, the Government faces a major reputational
riskifit fails to follow through on itspledge of FPE. This, indeed, is likelyto be seenbothnationally
and internationally as a major test o f its commitment to improve the lives o f the poor.

The proposed World Bank response to this situation i s to support for a project focused on the most
immediate challenge created by the new policy environment, and specifically to provide urgent financial
support to the Government to enable it to deliver on its commitment to FPE. Indesigning the proposed
project, it was felt that a specific sectoral investment project would be appropriate, with the funds being
disbursed as quickly as possible. It was also felt that the focus o f project shouldbe relatively narrow and
mainly covering instructional materials, as well as some related staff retraining and capacity building, for
several reasons. First, based on international evidence about the impact o f textbooks on the quality o f
education, it i s believed that such a project would have a direct impact on learning inthe schools.
Second, such a project would help to defray the costs o f education to parents. Third, it could be designed
relatively quickly, with money flowing to the country very early inFY04, as it could buildupon the
highlysuccessfulprogrampilotedover the last three years bythe Netherlands Government andDFID.
Fourth, it would provide additional momentum for the phased introduction o f the new curriculum,
although there would also be support for some books under the old curriculum.

As noted above, the Government faces urgent problems inseveral areas, butparticularly it needs
additional instructional materials (especially textbooks, but also supplementary readingmaterials,
reference books, dictionaries, exercise books and other stationery items, etc), as well as having its staff
retrained to cope with the new situation inthe classrooms. Interms o f funding, against a revisedestimate
o f about $98 million, there are so far three main external sources o f financing for the instructional
materials and teacher retraining program: DFID, the Government o f Sweden and IDA. It i s likely that the
Government o f Sweden would provide about $5 million for the program, and that the funding would be
channelled through DFID (which i s providing about $21 million intotal). Assuming that the proposed
IDA-supportedproject i s approved, along with the additional funding from DFIDand the Government of
Sweden, and also assuming that about $25 million from the Government's anticipated supplementary
budget o fK.Sh 2.8 billion (about $37 million) would also be spent on instructionalmaterials, that would
still leave about $12 million o f budgetary funds for the MOEST to use on other urgent school needs
(particularly storage for the new instructionalmaterials and sanitation for the substantially increased
numbers o f pupils attending school). While the primary focus o f the proposed project would be on
instructional materials and principally textbooks, it was felt important to also support some capacity
buildingthrough the project for three purposes: (i) complementthe design, implementation and
                                                       to
monitoring o f the textbook component with the in-service training o f teachers, including inthe use o f the
new instructional materials; (ii)  to ensure that fiduciary risks are minimized through financial
management training and publicity campaigns; and (iii)      to facilitate the design o f a planned future
education project inFY04.

While the Government's new primary education policyneeds support inother areas too, there are three
reasons for focusing the proposed project quite tightly on instructional materials and capacity building.
First,the other required items are less o f a priority than the instructional materials and associated staff
retraining and capacity building. Second, some o f the items would take time to provide: for example,



                                                      - 8 -

while additional classrooms are needed especially inthe urban areas, time i s neededto specify the
precise needs and to organize their construction (and interim solutions are also possible). Similarly,
while decentralization i s certainly needed, it needs to be plannedwell and carefully. Third, the proposed
 support from IDA would be supported by complementary programs o f assistance to the education sector
 from other donors. Inaddition to DFIDand the Government o f Sweden, UNICEF already has available
 $2.5 million principally for teaching and school improvements, with a focus on nine remote districts in
the north o f the country; and it has launched an appeal for a further $4.5 million for another 35 districts
for the period April-September, with a thirdphase tentatively planned to cover the whole country later.
UNESCO i s planning a needs assessment at the school level, and it i s also looking to assist the
Government with an HIV/AIDS strategy (inconjunction with the Aga Khan Foundation). Other external
agencies and governments (including the European Union, and the Governments o f Canada, Japan,
Norway and the USA) have also expressed interest in supporting the development o f the education
sector, but specific plans have not yet been made. Two international NGOs, Action Aid and OXFAM,
are also supporting relevant policy-related studies.

Inaddition to the proposedproject inFY03, the World Bank`s strategy inthe sector would be to continue
to work with our counterparts on key sectoral policy issues (including through the ongoing PER, the new
CAS and the ongoing sector work). This work would focus on some key sectoral challenges, and
especially the financing, efficiency and sustainability issues. Intensive work would also be restarted on
the detailed planning for the planned larger program o f assistance to the education sector inFY04 or
FY05 (probably through an education sector program), with a broader focus on secondary as well as
primary education. This would support the design and implementationo f a longer-term strategy for the
sector, and would buildupon the design work that was carried out earlier for the Strengthening o f
Primary and Secondary Education (STEPS) project.

4. Rationale for IDA Grant Financing.

There are three main reasonsjustifying the fundingo f the proposed project by a grant from IDA. These
include the overall country situation, the design o f the project and its expected strong human
development impact, and the highly coordinated approach and strong partnerships with other major
external organizations active inthe education sector in Kenya.

First,Kenya is eligible for IDA Grants inFY03, beingan IDA-only country (under $360 per capita). The
entire grant allocation will be used for this project. A new CAS i s planned for early FY04, and it will
present a strategy for the use o f IDA grants inKenya. Moreover, the newly elected Government has
committed itself to fighting corruption, prioritizing poverty reduction and providing education for all
children. It i s strategically important for IDA to support the new Government's efforts, and help it to
deliver results quickly to keep up the existing massive support and goodwill o f the people. Poor
Kenyans, as well as the donor community, will gain tremendously ifthe new Government can succeed in
these efforts. Moreover, this project has particularly strong ownership by the Government, and it could
be a very good signal and showcase for positive results throughout the country. To provide financing as
a grant instead o f a loan would signal the Bank's strong support, and give it goodwill amongst all
stakeholders.

Second, at the project level, there i s expected to be a substantial human development impact. Primary
education i s a major determinant o f economic well-being and growth, although the return from such
investments may take a longer time to realize than other types o f investment. The project i s supporting
the new policy o f FPE. However, with the introduction o f the major new policy, there are some initial
costs before the new routines and procedures are fully instituted, and thus some project costs could be
higher inthe short-term than they would be inthe longterm. This strengthens the case for fundingthe

project by a grant instead o f a credit. The project i s also aimed at helping children who previously were
the losers o f education policies, as their poverty excluded them from school. The project will help Kenya
to move towards EFA and enhance the likelihood o f meetingthe MDGon education for all by Year
2015. IDA grant financing could also enhance further the impact o f the project, through its
demonstration effect especially for other donors, and through encouraging sustained fundingo f the
program by the Government as the country's fiscal situation improves. Finally, the project will also
support the development o f the private sector inKenya, and particularly the publishingand printing
industries,as well as bookselling and delivery companies.

Third, the grant would strengthen further the partnerships with other donors. Inaddition to IDA, and as
noted above, there are several other agencies and governments which are either strong supporters of the
education sector already, or which are expected to become donors to the new program o f FPE inthe near
future. The design of the project i s built upon close donor collaboration, and this pattern o f strong donor
cooperation and coordination would be enhanced and facilitated substantially by a IDA grant.

C. Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description andAnnex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
The proposed project, with a total cost o f $55 million equivalent, would have three components.

A. Component 1-InstructionalMaterials ($46.5 million).

The bulk o fproject funds would be used for the scaling-up o f the recently evaluated Government/DFID
textbook program, using school grants, the existing procurement system (which i s considered to be
competitive), and the existing financial management system (though with additional training o f school
staff and local community representatives). Under this approach, financing i s made available on the
basis o f per capita textbook grants to schools. The SIMSCs (comprising head teachers, other teachers
and representatives o f the school committees) select the textbooks needed from the approved list of
textbooks, inline with the funds allocated to the school through the grant scheme. The project would,
therefore, support the provision o f textbooks and stationery to all primary schools by financing an
expansion o f the national program for the provision o f instructional materials. The project would cover
textbooks for both the old curriculum subjects, as well as the new ones (standards 1, 2, 5 and 6) as they
are introduced.

The MOEST has now decided upon the package o f minimumrequirements for instructional materials
provision for all primary schools and pupils. This minimumpackage has been designed to provide the
essential support needed for education o f an adequate quality, and to be the foundation for the teaching
and learning needs o f the new curriculum. Under the program, schools have discretion over the exact use
o f their instructional materials funding, but they are expected to achieve the following in their spending
decisions: (i) the provision o f the specified basic supplies o f stationery to every student inevery school;
and (ii) the achievement o f at least the basic supply targets for each o f the specified categories o f
instructionalmaterials described below. The MOEST has also specified two basic standards o f
stationery supply - one for lower primary students and one for upper primary students.

For 2003, schools will receive per capita instructional materials budgets o f approximately K.Sh 1,000
($13). The funds will be released during2003 inthree phases in April (DFID, the Government o f
Sweden and Government funds), July (IDA grant and Government counterpart funds) and December




                                                      - 10-

(IDA grant and Government counterpart funds), of approximatelyK.Sh 500, K.Sh 350 andK.Sh 150per
pupilrespectively. Basedon the latest school enrollment figures and an exchange rate o fK.Sh 77 per US
dollar, the total cost o f the second and thirdphases o f the school grants would be $46.5 million, o f which
IDA would fund $41.8 million and the Government would fundthe balance.

B. Component 2 -Capacity Building($7.5 million).

The proposed capacity buildingcomponent would have four sub-components: (i)          school-based teacher
development and support; (ii)     school accounting system; (iii)education management information system;
and (iv) system design and program preparation.

(i) School-basedTeacher Development and Support ($1.9 million).

The overall purpose o f this sub-component i s to improve the quality o f teaching and learning inprimary
schools. Specific objectives are to ensure that: (i) classroom teachers are able to use textbooks and other
instructional materials effectively; (ii) classroom teachers are able to deal with the emerging challenges
o f free primary education and the special needs o f pupils; (iii)all head teachers are performing their
quality assurance role effectively at the school level; and (iv) schools are able to provide effective
guidance and counseling services to pupilswith special needs.

The program will target: (i)17,750 head teachers; (ii)    72,000 key resource teachers (KRTs) in English,
Mathematics, Science and Kiswahili; and (iii) nominated guidance and counseling teachers.
                                                 17,750
(DFIDwill also finance training for 1,000 Teacher Advisory Center (TAC) tutors and 500 Zonal
Inspectors (ZIs) to strengthen their advisory roles). A short in-house course will be designed for head
teachers and will be delivered at the zonal level. New distance learning modules will be developed for
KRTsand guidance and counseling teachers.

Inadditionto the plannedtrainingprogram, a review will be conducted to explore new approaches and
management structures for maintaining standards o f education and promoting school improvement. The
review i s motivatedby two principal factors: the need to rethink the roles o f school inspectors and TAC
tutors, and the associated needto reconsider the role o f headteachers, key resource teachers and subject
teachers, school management committees and parents in ensuring quality and accountability for all
services offered by schools. Both inspectors and TAC tutors are experiencing difficulties intheir
monitoring and classroom observation work. This has led to an increased demand for transport by the
School Inspectorate to cope with the greater workload created by free primary education. Although there
are a large number o f vacancies for ZIs, the expansion o f the inspectorate i s not sustainable, especially as
the number o f schools and teachers are likely to continue growing. Incontrast, teachers and local
communities are taking increased responsibility and accountability for all school services, and it i s
important to consider new approaches, roles and management structures for district and zonal level
inspectionand advisory services to complement the quality assurance roles o f other stakeholders at the
school level.

(ii) SchoolAccountingSystem ($1.0 million).

The objective o f this sub-component is to implement an improveduniform accounting system so that all
funds disbursed to primary schools are properly accounted for and usedfor their intendedpurpose. This
sub-component i s designed to build on the financial management training targeted towards headteachers
and school management committees inall schools. Under this sub-component, implementation support
will be provided to ensure that the system installed is fully implementedat the school level. The
approach adopted will be to buildcapacity within the MOEST, especially at the district and zonal level,


                                                     -11 -

to solve problems at the school level. ZIs will routinely monitor the operation o f the accounting system
at school level, focusing on budgeting, procurement, expenditure authorizationand the maintenance o f
financial records. The ZIs will be back-stopped by district teams which are beyond their capacity. An
expenditure tracking study will be conducted on a sample o f schools inall provinces to ascertain value
for money. Inaddition, to ensure that the improvements are sustained, provisions will be made to train
up to 3,000 replacement head teachers.

(iii)EducationManagementInformationSystem($2.5 million).

The ability o f the MOEST to analyze issues in the education sector and to develop appropriate policies,
strategies and programs to respond to these issues and further develop the system i s severely limited by
paucity o f data on the characteristics and operational efficiency o f the education system, especially with
respect to resource utilization. This deficiency i s becomingmore critical as Government moves towards
programmatic operations. The objective o f this sub-component is, therefore, to complete the design o f an
EMIS for the MOEST and initiate implementationo f a new system. To achieve these objectives the
project would revise and update the analysis and designthat was earlier prepared inorder to satisfy the
current operational and technological requirements o f the MOEST. Specifically, the project would: (i)
update the needs assessment o f MOEST to determine the key data requirements for the various unitsand
agencies needed for analysis o f sector issues, policy analysis and formulation, program development, and
monitoring and evaluation; (ii)  design an integrated system for data collection, analysis and management;
(iii)develop a phasedprogram for computerizing the EMIS starting with priority areas such as the
PlanningDivision, the Teachers Service Commission (TSC), and the Inspectorate; and (iv) initiate
implementation o f a new system. The system would be tested in an agreed number o f districts by 2004
before it i s expanded.

The project would finance: (a) technical assistance for preparingthe MIS needs assessment, for the
design and installation o f the network system, comprising the software and hardware requirements for the
proposed MIS system, and for training and support to staff inthe use o f the system; (b) operational costs
for training headquarters and district users, analysts and system maintenance staff; and (c) equipment and
furniture for upgradingthe ICT capacity inMOEST headquarters and districts, including training inthe
use o f the equipment and maintenance.

(iv) SystemDesignandProgramPreparation($2.1 million).

Followingthe implementation o f the emergency program for the provision o f FPE, the Government
proposes to complete an education sector review ($1.1 million) as a basis for developing and
implementingpolicies, strategies and programs for the further development o f the education system. The
objective o f this sub-component would be to support the Government in: (i)     deepening its understanding
o f selected technical issues inthe sector; (ii)
                                               developing appropriate strategies for increasing access and
improving quality; (iii)  strengthening its management capacity for the provision o f education and
training; and (iv) developingfuture sub-sector programs. The project would finance: (i)      technical
assistance and training; (ii) equipment; and (iii)operational costs for the preparation o f the studies,
designs and future programs. The cost o f the new system design work would be about $0.9 million, and
the sub-component would also include the refinancing o f the PPF usedso far ($0.2 million).

Inadditionto the studies andreview work, the sub-component would also support a variety o f special
programs and activities ($1.O million) relating to FPE for disadvantaged children, especially inthe
remote and urban slum areas. The achievement o f universal primary education i s constrained by special
conditions inthese areas which deny certain children from benefiting from the new FPE policy. In
Nairobi, for example, the GER was about 50 percent and in some ASAL areas it was less than 40 percent


                                                     - 1 2 -

before FPE was introduced. Even with FPE, however, the GERs inthese areas are still considerably less
than 100 percent. This i s partly related to extreme poverty, patterns o f life in nomadic areas, cultural
practices which allow premature withdrawal from school, and delinquency especially inurban areas.
The Government has, therefore, recognized that additional measures will need to be taken for the
children especially inthe urban slums and ASAL areas to ensure that they are able to benefit fully from
the program. While the details o f these programs have not yet been identified, the objective i s to
introduce strategies which address the specific issues inthese areas. The strategies will be based on
current programs being implementedby NGOs and local authorities, supplemented by two surveys to
establish the characteristics o f the student and school age populationinthese areas, to identifythe
educational and non-education factors that affect the access and completion o f quality education, and
make recommendations on the most appropriate modes for delivery o f education. The interventions will
form part o f the Government Is education program, but NGOs and CBOs will participate inthe delivery
as appropriate.

C. Component3 -Monitoringand Evaluation($1.0 million).

This component has three activities: (i)  monitoring; (ii) evaluation; and (iii) external audit. Monitoring
would focus on the key performance indicators at outcome and output level, as identified inthe logical
framework (Annex 1). Project monitoring will be the responsibility o f the Project Coordinator and the
componenthub-component managers. Project activities and expenditure would be reviewed through the
regular monthly meetings convened by the Project Coordinator, against the annual plan and budget
approved by the Project Steering Committee at the start o f each year. Monitoring data would be obtained
from a variety o f sources as follows: (i) standard tests o f pupil competencies; (ii) o f education
                                                                                      reports
managers, school inspectors and TAC tutors; (iii)    school census data; (iv) reports o f the Textbook
Management Unit and School Audit Unit; (v) surveys of School Management Committees and parents;
and (vi) routine management reports from componenthb-component managers. Particular attention
would be paid to student learning, pupil retention, teacher behavior and resource use at the school level.
At the start o fthe project there would be: (i)baseline survey o f student learning; and (ii)publicity
                                                a                                               a
campaign to inform communities about the new program. Inaddition, school committees, parents and
pupilswould be surveyed duringthe project to obtain their views about the quality o fteaching and
learning intheir respective schools.

An evaluation wouldbe undertaken at the end o fthe project to take monitoring a step further. The
evaluation exercise has three objectives. First, it would assess the extent to which the outcomes and
outputs o f the project have been achieved, examining differences inachievement betweenregions and
types o f school. Secondly, the evaluators would determine the reasons for project successes and failures.
Thirdly, the evaluation would be forward-looking, examining the prospects for sustainability and the
relevance of project inputs. The project would also finance a bi-annual external independent audit inthe
first year, and an annual audit in the second and third years o f the project. The audit would focus
particularly on the Textbook Management Unit and a sample o f primary school accounts.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The project would support and strengthen the Government's policy towards the provision o f instructional
materials which has the following characteristics: (i)    it supports school-based choice o f learning and
teaching materials from an approved list o f competing, alternative textbooks; (ii)   it is based on the
provision o f decentralized, demand-side purchasing power under the control o f the staff and the parents
o f each individual primary school; (iii) it aims to provide consistent annual financial allocations to every
primary school inthe country from a single national instructional materials fund; (iv) it aims to achieve a
single national management and administrationunit for the national instructional materials fund; (v) it
wishes that all contributing donors should provide support via the same national fund and usingthe same
national supply time-scale, although it recognizes the need for a variety o f channels for contributions to
reach the national instructional materials fund; (vi) it has already introduced a new, objective and
transparent system o f textbook evaluation and selection for the approved list; and (vii) it fully supports
competitive, private sector involvement inthe total system o f provision.

Under the proposed project, there would be support for the development and provision to all primary
schools o f a package o f minimumrequirements for instructional materials. The per pupilinstructional
materials budget has been carefully calculated to enable the minimumspecified standards to be achieved
during2003 and then sustained. This level o f fundingwould enable all schools to purchase the basic list
o f instructional materials (including stationery) by the end o f the year, up to the supply levels specified
by the MOEST. Under the new program, there would therefore be: (i)          improved access to a much wider
range of instructional materials across all curriculum subjects and standards than has beenprovided in
the past; (ii)essential support for the introduction o f the new curriculum; (iii) strengthening o f cost
                                                                                   the
reduction as an essential factor inthe achievement o f sustainability in instructional materials provision;
(iv) reforms inchargingby banks for school textbook bank accounts; (v) further support for the
strengthening and upgrading o f the local book trade; (vi) improvements in school management capacity
and accountability; and (vii) improvements in community participation inschool management and
decision making.

The project would also support the wider reform o f the education sector through strengthening education
management and policy development capacity, and improving the analytical base and information for
decision-making and education planning. Inthe past, the MOEST has produced a large number o f sector



                                                     - 14 -

reviews to inform policy and program development, buttheir utility has been limitedby inadequate
quantitative analysis o f issues o f efficiency and costhesource implications o f proposals. The
effectiveness o f the education system has also been limitedby a number o f factors including its structure,
which combines policy, technical support, and monitoring and evaluation with service delivery and an
over centralized systemo f administration. Centralized decision making constrains the development o f
specific interventions to address local issues because of inadequate information or proper understanding
o f the issues at stake. The impact o f this i s that schools do not operate at adequate levels o f operational
efficiency and they are not properly supervised. The activities proposed through the project would help
the Government to address such issues.

3. Benefits and target population:
The entire populationo f primary school children inKenya should benefit from the proposed project due
to the improved quality o f general education and the focus on all primary schools throughout the country.
Students should benefit from the project because of: (i)     enhancement intheir learning through the
availability o f improved textbooks; (ii)  support for the improved curricula, which would be more relevant
to the needs o f the country; and (iii)  improved teacher effectiveness as a result o f improved learning
conditions and in-service training.

Although not explicitly designed as a poverty-targeted intervention, the proposed project could
particularly help the poor through them having: (i)     an improved chance to continue to secondary
education, and (ii)  enhanced labor market outcomes as a result o f the improved quality inprimary
education. However, it needs to be noted that there i s some evidence from the existing textbook program
inKenya showing that the increasedavailability anduse oftextbooks due to the ongoingprogramraises
test scores mostly for those inthe top two quintals o f initial academic achievement. The associated
teacher support and development programplannedunder the project would, therefore, be particularly
important for ensuring that teachers are retrainedinthe particular challenges o f the implications o f the
FPEprogram and inassisting all children, including especially the poorer ones and those with lower
educational achievements initially. The competitive involvement o f publishers and booksellers would
help to ensure cost-effectiveness inthe selection o f textbooks and reduce the unit cost o f education
materials, thus making education more affordable to the poor. The rationalization o f the number o f
subjects offered inthe existing curriculum would also reduce the need for such a wide range of
educational materials. Regardingthe second component o f the project, education management staff
would also become more skilled inutilizing scarce resources and makingpolicy and planning decisions.
Finally, the project would assist the Government to follow through on its major electoral pledge o f FPE,
which i s a key element o f its commitment to reduce poverty throughout the country.

4. Institutionaland implementationarrangements:
(i)Implementationperiod. Theprojectwillbeimplementedduringaperiodofthree years. However,
the disbursement o f the funds will be front-loaded, as it i s expected that the instructional materials will
be procuredwithin 9 months o f project effectiveness (intwo phases, with the larger amount procured
duringthe first 3 months o fthe project). This fast rate o fdisbursement is critically important as the
books are urgently needed inthe primary schools.

would be the Senior DeputyDirector inthe Policy Formulation and Project Division, who has assigned a
senior officer to be the full time Project Coordinator. Individual components and sub-components would
be managed through the permanent structures o f the MOEST. Inthe Supplies Division, an Officer has
been identified to be responsible for procurement functions under the project. Similarly, an Accountant
will be identified to be responsible for the accounting function under the project. A Project Steering
Committee, chaired by the Permanent Secretary and comprising of: (i)     Directorate o f Education: (a)
Director o f Education, (b) Division o f Primary Education, (c) Division o f Policy and Formulation and
Projects, (d) Kenya Education Staff Institute, (e) School Audit Division, and (f) Inspectorate; (ii)  Heads
of: (a) Finance Division, (b) Planning Division, (c) Textbook Management Unit,(d) Kenya Instituteo f
Education, (e) Teachers Services Commission and (f) Kenya National Examinations Council; and (iii)
Director o f External Resources Division o f the Ministry o f Finance or his representative, would be
responsible for overseeing implementation, providingpolicy guidance, and deciding on any changes in
direction for the project. The Steering Committee would review progress on a quarterly basis duringthe
first year, and every six months duringthe second and third years.

The Project Coordinator, together with component and sub-component managers, would develop an
annual project plan at the start o f each year. The plan would specify key milestones and the activities to
achieve them. The Steering Committee would approve the annual work plan. At the same time,
individual staff workloads would be reviewedto ensure the project i s adequately staffed for all of the
activities to be carried out.

The Project Coordinator would review progress against activities with the component and sub-component
managers on a monthly basis. Inthe event o f shortfalls, reasons would be identified (including the
non-availability o f key personnel) and corrective action taken. The Project Coordinator would prepare
quarterly progress reports for the Steering Committee and other key stakeholders.

D. Project Rationale
1. Projectalternatives consideredand reasonsfor rejection:
(a) Choiceof LendingInstrument.

Inprinciple, itwould be idealto be able to provide the Government withbudgetary support for the
primary education sector through a quick sectoral adjustment operation (or even a hybridproject).
However, inview o f the country's at best mixedhistory o f adjustment lending, the needto update and
extend the Bank's sectoral understanding and analysis o f the key issues, and especially the lack o f a Fund
program in a difficult macro situation and the need for support to be provided quickly, it i s felt that an
adjustment operationwould be risky and difficult to justify. Instead it i s proposed that the project
support be inthe form o f a specific sector investment project.

(b) The Phasingof the PlannedProjects.

Another option would be to re-activate, accelerate and give initial priority to the postponed STEPS
project. The STEPS project has six components. All o f these are national inscope, except selected
aspects o f the teacher management and the education management information system components which
would be piloted ineight districts. They include: (i)  primary and secondary school curriculum; (ii)
teacher management; (iii) and assessment; (iv) educational materials; (v) HIViAIDS intervention;
                            testing
and (vi) school-based education management information system. The STEPS would have been
implemented over a four-year period. While an extremely important project, the idea o f moving ahead
with it (instead o fwith the Free Primary EducationSupport Project first) was rejected, as it would take



                                                    - 16-

several months to complete project preparation work, whereas the needs o f the primary education sector
especially for instructional materials are extremely urgent. It was also felt that having first a
tightly-focused project o f relatively short duration would enable the Bank to resume and further
strengthen its relationshipwith the Government and particularly MOEST in a phased way. However, it
will be essential that the appraisal ofthe STEPS project (or a renewed version o f it) follows soon after
the implementation o fthe FPESP.

(c) The Need for Additional Classrooms.

As notedearlier, the massive influx of children into school has created a wide range o f other problems
for the Government. Inaddition to instructionalmaterials, it i s estimated that may be $6 million could be
needed annually for new classrooms. However, this estimate i s far from being firm (better estimates will
be available after a school mapping exercise has been completed); short-term solutions are already being
found in some areas; there are also constraints on constructing classrooms inthe urban areas due to lack
o f land; and any support from the Bank for buildingswould be time-consuming due to the need for
careful analysis o f engineering and environmental issues inparticular.

The May 1998 OED Country Assistance Note concluded that World Bank assistance to Kenyahadnot
been effective inpromoting reforms. According to OED audits o f adjustment loans, overestimation by
the Bank o f what the Government was willing to do was a major issue; and the Bank's conditions for
tranche release were also faulted for being over ambitious and vague. Given weak compliance with Bank
conditionality, and the poor governance situation, the Note recommended limitinglending to small
poverty targeted interventions and shiftingthe focus towards non-lending activities. However, the
Bank's portfolio in Kenya has continuedto perform poorly. Since October 1997, OED has rated 14
projects, and o f these only one was rated as having a satisfactory outcome with likely sustainability and
substantial institutional development impact. An internal review o f the Kenyaportfolio conducted in
mid-1999 led to proactive management o f the portfolio. But systemic problems still remain relating to
overall public expenditure management and to the timely flow o f funds to projects in execution. To
mitigate the risks,the main OED recommendation i s to strengthen monitoring and evaluation activities.
It i s also recommendedthat at least one indicator shouldreflect beneficiary satisfaction and should
involve a wide range o f stakeholders. Inrecent months, there have been active discussions with the
Government about the existing portfolio, and steps are being taken to address the issues relating to the
ongoing projects.

(b) EducationSector Lessons.

Internationalexperience ineducational development, as well as the Bank's experience inKenya, suggest
a number o f important lessons for project design and implementation. These include:




                                                   - 18-

(i) criticalroleofstronglocalownershipandinclusiveparticipation. AccordingtoOED's
    The
Evaluation Memoranda o f the Sixth EducationProject inKenya, the failure to emphasize demand-side
needs ledto a lack o f efficiency, effectiveness, and beneficiary involvement. Inthe FPESP, local
communities will be heavily involved especially inthe instructionalmaterials component o f the project.

(ii) importanceofsectoralunderstanding,detailedanalyticalworkandawell-definedprogram.
    The
While the FPESP i s being designed on a fast-track basis, it i s grounded inconsiderable sector work
already undertaken (including the PER and the draft sector report o f the MOEST). The capacity building
component would also contribute to the design o f the planned follow-up project.

(iii) needtopaycloseattentiontosustainability. ThefinancialsustainabilityoftheFPEprogramhas
     The
been carefully considered; and as a result o f an examination o f options, the MOEST has chosen the least
expensive o f three possible packages o f instructionalmaterials and stationery in order that future costs
could be accommodated inthe education budget.

(iv) The need to address implementationissues early on to minimize future implementationbottlenecks.
Although being designed quickly, the FPESP has been able to buildupon the implementation
arrangements already inplace for the existingGovernment and DFID supported textbook program.

(v) The importance o f collaborationamong development partners to create synergies and avoid
duplication o f effort. Inparticular DFID and IDA will continue to work together very closely duringthe
implementation o f the plannedproject. However, other donors are also collaborating closely together
and with the Government to support the FPE program.

(iv) The possibilities for enhancing the impact o f expenditures through better management o f funds,
centrally and at the district and school levels. As seen from internationalbest practice, those close to the
school have a vested interest in seeing that their resources are managed transparently and efficiently and
allocated appropriately. The transfer of responsibility for teachers and other resources to the district and
school levels will strengthen accountability and improve monitoring and evaluation. At the central level,
MOEST's Ministerial MTEFwill further enhance the capacity to plan for and manage sector resources.

(c) SPRED 3 Lessons.

The instructional materials component o f the project (accounting for about 80 percent o f the costs) i s
built upon the ongoing Government/DFID textbook reformprogram, and the design o fthe component
would be built uponthe findings o f a series o f annual evaluations. The SPRED 3 project was evaluated
by an independent team inJune 2002. The overall conclusion o fthe evaluationwas that there was strong
evidence that the textbook procurement and distributionprogram was successful, and specifically that the
provision o f textbooks was leadingto: (i)  improved pupil access, attendance, and retention; (ii) improved
pupilperformance levels through more active learning; (iii)    improved teacher morale; (iv) improved
school -parent relationships; and (v) greater engagement by parents in school governance. It was also
concluded that: (i) the endingo ftextbook levies inschools was a major gain from the program; (ii)     the
Schools Audit Unit had been made operational; (iii)   the introduction of the new school curriculum would
reduce overall costs; (iv) the program had ledto improved donor coordination; (v) it was also having a
positive impact on the publishingindustryand book trade; and (vi) it was providing opportunities for
local commercial development. Inaddition however, the evaluation noted that: (i)     the reduction inthe
cost o f primary education to parents was less than the cost o f the textbooks; (ii)
                                                                                  there i s need for
efficiency within the education sector to be improved by increasingthe pupil-teacher ratios; (iii)  more
resources would need to be provided to ensure effective school inspection and teacher advisory support;


                                                    -19-

and (iv) the transfer o f funds directly to schools should later be extended to include not only funding for
textbooks, but for other purposes as well, on a per capita basis. The Government has already started to
follow up several of these issues.

4. Indicationsof recipientcommitment and ownership
Inthe case o fthe proposedproject, there is a massivecommitment within the new Government for the
successful implementation o f the new policy o f FPE, and indeededucation and addressing corruption are
among the very highest o f the priorities o f the Government. This was confirmed strongly to the Bank's
Regional Vice President when he visited Kenya inFebruary 2003.

5. Value added of Bank support inthis project:
IDA is uniquely positionedto sustain dialogue on complex policy and institutional changes inthe
education sector in Kenya. IDA has supported the education sector over many years, and is very familiar
with the sector (though some o fthe knowledgenow needs to be updated, especially due to the delay in
going forward with the STEPS project). The Bank will continue to have a special potential role in the
education sector inKenya because no other donor agency i s available to provide either the technical or
financial resources to support sector wide development and reform. The Bank also brings the experience
o f supporting education reforms in other countries inthe region. Despite the existence o f a limited
number o f donors supporting the education sector, the Bank will continue to assist the MOEST to
coordinate activities under the proposedproject with donors so that the effects o f investment are
sustainable. Inparticular, the Bank will work closely with DFID, as well as other bilateral and
multilateral agencies that have expressed interest inpossibly supporting the sector (such as UNICEF, the
European Union, the Aga Khan Foundation, and the Governments o f Sweden, Canada, Norway and the
USA). The World Bank task team i s also working with country team colleagues on the PER, the CAS
and the JSA o f the PRSP to ensure consistency o f message and complementarity o f analytical effort.

E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessmentsare inthe project file, see Annex 8)

,?
1. Economic (see Annex 4):
     Cost benefit       NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
0    Cost effectiveness
     Other (specify)

The FPE policy supported by the project would provide economic benefits intwo areas: (i)          through
providing the basis for poverty reduction, overall human capital development, and accelerated economic
growth; and (ii)   through the rationalizationo f public expenditures.

The analysis shows that the expenditures could be sustained over time. The number o f teachers
employed at the primary level drives the costs o f the primary system, which i s the most important part o f
the whole recurrent education budget. Although the overall efficiency o f teacher utilization seems to be
improving, the unevenness o f teacher distribution across schools and districts i s still an existing issue.
Other costs are directly dependent on enrollments, including the cost o f instructional materials, and costs
directly linked to school operation including registration, examinations, school-based teacher
development, as well as minor repairs and other school maintenance cost. Although economies o f scale
may vary the costs for these items, they are closely linked to the size o f each school.

It i s estimated that K.Sh 850 is neededfor each child inschool year 2003 to provide a minimumpackage
of instructional materials. As the average book life i s 4 years, it i s envisaged that the cost o f textbooks



                                                     - 20 -

will drop infuture years. However, there is still a need for continuous resources for yearly consumables
such as exercises books and other stationeries, and for the replacement o f textbooks, etc. Inaddition, it i s
expected that the flow o f funds to schools would cover extended areas including minor repairs and
maintenance, utility, administration, and other quality improvement activities at school level. It i s
estimated that K.Sh 370 i s neededper pupilper year to cover these items.

Using45 pupilsper classroom, the number o f existing classrooms seem to be adequate for the current
enrollment. However, the distribution of classrooms is uneven. Usingdistrict-level data, it i s estimated
that up to 7,000 extra classrooms may need to be built to cater for year 2003 enrollment. However, the
future cost-sharing relationship between communities and the state for buildingand rehabilitation
investments i s unclear, following the introductiono f FPE. The interim target number of additional
classrooms is, therefore, 1,400. Other development costs will cover many capacity buildingactivities,
including the school-based teacher training program, particularly for the implementation o f the new
curriculum. In addition, the capacities for financial management, education management information
system, etc, also need to be further strengthened.

It i s possible to compare the future costs o fthe program against resources likely to be available, using(i)
the current levelo f recurrent education expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and (ii) current recurrent
                                                                                        the
primary education expenditure as a percentage o f total education recurrent expenditure as benchmarks,
and assuming that GDP grows at close to 5.7 percent. The overall conclusion i s that the costs o f the
program could be sustained; and also that the recurrent financing gap o f over $81million in2003 would
be financed by IDA ($28 million to be disbursedin July) together with DFID/Swedish support ($24
million to be disbursed inApriUMay), and the Government's added resources ($29 million to be
disbursed inApril/May through Vote 31, Head 844 "Primary Education: Appropriation inAid").

The FPESP would also cover the recurrent financing gap in early 2004, with government additional
fundingfor "appropriation inaid" under primary education (Head 844). As for the development cost, the
FPESP would provide the Government with support amounting to about $9 million between year 2003
and 2006. Resources for rehabilitation andthe constructiono f classrooms would have to be further
mobilized to meet the needs.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)

Fiscal Impact:
The number o fteachers employed at the primary level is the maindeterminant o fthe costs o f the primary
system, which i s the most important element o f the whole recurrent educationbudget. International
experience indicates that a class o f about 50 i s the desirable maximum for one teacher to handle, and that
an average pupilteacher ratio (PTR) o f between about 1:40 and 1:45 is reasonable for maximum
efficiency in teacher use. A distinctive character o f primary education inKenya untilvery recently has
been a low PTR (35: 1in2002). The enrollment surge in2003 has pushed the PTR to 41:1. This ratio i s
currently used inthe projection model for teacher needs. Due to the efficiency gain inteacher utilization,
the total teacher salary bill can basically keep below K.Sh 29 billion over the 10-year period. The 1997
Teacher Salary award has been the subject o f much controversy. It has been estimated that an amount o f
K.Sh 2.4 billion annually may needto be budgeted to pay for salary increases. However, for the time
being, this is not built into the model, as discussion on this are continuing within the Government.

Certain costs are directly dependent on enrollments. These include the cost o f textbooks and other
learning materials, and also costs directly linked to school operation, including registration,



                                                      -21 -

 examinations, school-basedteacher development, as well as minor repairs and other school maintenance
 cost. Under the current project o f public textbooks provision, it i s estimated that K.Sh 850 i s needed for
 each child inschool to provide a minimumpackage o f textbooks and other learning materials in2003.
As the average book life is 4 years, the cost for textbooks will drop drastically. However, there is still
need for continuous resources for yearly consumables, such as exercises books and other stationeries, as
well as book replacement. Inaddition, it i s expected that there i s need for flow o f funds to schools to be
extended to cover areas o f minor repairs and other school maintenance cost, administration, and other
operating costs. With total pupil enrollment o f 7.2 million, the budgetary cost o f these payments would
be approximately K.Sh 9 billion for school year 2003, and K.Sh 6 billion for school year 2004 and 2005.

Using45 pupilsper classroom, the numbero f existing classrooms seemsto be adequate for the current
enrollment. However, the distribution o f classrooms i s uneven. Usingdistrict-level data, it i s estimated
that 7,000 extra classrooms needs to be built to cater year 2003 enrollment. Inthe projection model, it i s
assumed that these 7,000 classrooms are to be built duringthe 5 year period, together with rehabilitation
o f 2 percent o f existing classrooms each year. The development cost would also cover many capacity
buildingactivities, including settingup a systemo f school-based teacher training program, particularly
for the implementation of the new curriculum. Inaddition, the capacities for financial management,
education management information system, etc, also need to be further strengthened. The estimated cost
i s $9 million in total for a 3-year period.

The GDP i s expected to grow at close to 5.7 percent. The Central Bureau o f Statistics projection for the
primary age group i s 1.33 percent annually, declining to 0.80percent by 2006. The implications o f the
trend i s that Kenya will not be faced with rapidly growing school age populations inthe coming years.
Economic growth and the low primary school age populationprojection will be the major factors in
closing the projected education financing gap by 2007.

3. Technical:

According to the return o f school census inFebruary 2003, the total enrollment this year at the primary
level has increased to 7.2 million compared to last year's 6.3 million. The intake rate i s estimated at 130
percent. Projections o f enrollment following the FPE initiative depend greatly on the likely behavior o f
those who are new-comers to primary education in2003. Due to increased public investment inthe
primary sub-sector, particularly with improved educational inputs such as textbooks, it is envisaged that
there will be significant improvement inthe internal efficiency. Inthe projection model, it i s assumed
that the drop-out rate would decrease to one half o f the current level inthe period up to 2005, and that it
then decreases to zero afterwards. Inthe same vein, the repetition rates are assumed to drop to two-thirds
o f their current level up to 2005, and to one third o f the current level starting inyear 2006. However,
because so many o f the out-of-school children have enrolled in 2003, the intake rates in the following
years will not be as highas 130 percent. The projection assumes that the effect o f FPEwill still keep the
intake rate over 100percent duringthe following two years, but that it i s gradually reducedto a
steady-state level o f 96 percent. The enrollment projection model shows that the "FPE bulge'' will work
its way through the system, and that by 2012 the last cohort o f "FPE bulge" will have reached the last
grade o f primary cycle. The system reaches a steady-state in2013. The peak o f enrollment i s projected
to be reached inyear 2009, with 7.8 million pupils at primary level.

4.2 Project management:
The project would be managed with the existing institutional set-up. The project coordinating office will
oversee the implementationand enhance inter departmental coordination. The instructional materials


                                                 - 23 -

project component would be implemented by the Textbook Management Unit (TMU), inline with the
existing arrangements for the ongoing textbook program. At the school level, head teachers and their
school management committees (SMCs) would be responsible for school-based procurement o f
textbooks and accounting o f funds. The capacity buildingcomponent of the project would come under
the direct responsibility o f the Director o f Educationinthe MOEST. The Policy Formulation and
Planning Division (PF&P) has responsibilities for the monitoring and evaluation component.


4.3 Procurement issues:
About 80 percent o f the IDA grant to the project would finance the procurement o f instructional
materials. Procurement o f instructionalmaterials would be carried out through the existing school-based
procurement arrangement developed by the Govemmenb'DFID textbook program. The World Bank has
reviewed the school-based procurement arrangement, and finds it acceptable subject to minor
modifications which have been agreed.

Institutionally, a number o f MOEST divisions and units, and schools would play distinct but
complimentary roles inthe logistical arrangements and procurement process o f supplies o f instructional
materials. The PF&P would coordinate the implementationo f project activities. The TMU within the
PF&P Division would be responsible for allocating and transferring funds to schools for the procurement
o f textbooks and stationery on the agreed basis per capita. The Inspectorate Division, School Audit Unit,
and the district education officers (DEOs) would be incharge o f carrying out other downstream fiduciary
responsibilities inthe procurement cycle. Each school has a School Selection Instructional Materials
Committee (SIMSC) whose members are drawn from school teachers and members o f the SMC. Upon
receipt of MOEST's notification o f transfer o f funds into the school bank account, the SIMSC would
undertake the procurement process o f textbooks and stationery inthe following sequence: (i)          selection o f
textbooks from the list approved and published by MOEST; (ii)          solicitation o f quotations from local
and/or national booksellers; (iii)  selection o f a bookseller on the basis o f the discounts offered and terms
o f transportation o f the materials to school; (iv) issuance o f the local purchase order (LPO) to the
selectedbookseller; and (v) receipt o f deliveries and countersigning o f payment authorization infavor o f
the bookseller throughthe school bank account. With regardto the procurement o f consultancy and
technical assistance (TA) services, the relevant MOEST divisions or unitswould carry out the selection
process o f the consultancy or TA in line with the agreed terms o f reference (TOR) and in collaboration
with PF&P.


4.4 Financial management issues:
This program is basically a scaling up o f the ongoing GOWDFIDSPRED 3 project that supports primary
schools with textbooks. The key implementingagency for the project, MOEST, has previously
implementeddonor financed projects. The TMU o f MOEST i s the Unit responsible for the overall
coordination o f the instructional materials program at the national level. Other institutional support will
be provided by Finance and Accounting Units o f the Ministry, in conjunction with the School
Inspectorate and School Audit Units at various levels inthe country. District education offices will
continue to participate inthe program with regard to their oversight and monitoring role. It is envisaged
that all the 17,750 primary schools across the country will, in their own right, be the main implementing
entities o f the project, where the core project activities will take place. Inparticular, the school head
teachers and the school management committees will be responsible for managingthe funds made
available to their respective schools. They will, therefore, also be fully accountable for resources made
available to the school, regardless o f the source. Head teachers in schools will be expected to provide
basic financial reports based on receipt and expenditure principles, and also report on the operation o f the
school textbook account as well as other school operational account(s).

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.
N o separate social assessment was carried out for the proposed project, as one earlier carried out for the
DFID-fundedSPRED 3 project, and it was considered still to be relevant to the present situation inthe
country. The following i s a summary o f the main findings.

The SPRED 3 social assessment concluded that poverty, gender and geographical location are three main
differential factors which have an impact on educational opportunity in Kenya. Regardingpoverty,
nearly half o f the Kenyanpopulation are categorized as absolutely poor. While most poor Kenyans live
inrural areas, there is still a significant and growing number o fpoor urbanKenyans. InNairobi, for
example, there are more poor households than inany district inKenya. The available data indicate that
pupilcosts at urban schools are significantlyhigher than those inrural areas. Untilthe introductiono f
FPE, cost sharing inKenya's schools had clearly reduced the opportunities for poor children to go to
school. Reducingthe cost burden on the families o f poor children through provision o f textbooks i s
therefore an important part o f the Government's strategy. Some o f the most disadvantaged children
would also be helped through the special sub-component o f the project set aside for this purpose.

There i s also substantial gender disparity inall aspects o f education inKenya. These patterns are
complex and inconsistent, with considerable and significant regional and district variation. While Kenya
has largely achieved gender parity inprimary school enrollment and completion rates at a national level,
there continues to be significant regional gender disparities, with the ASAL districts recording the largest
gender disparities interms o f enrollment and completion rates. It is, therefore, particularly important for
the Government to take measures to raise girls' access to the new instructional materials, and to ensure
that female teachers have full access to training opportunities.

 6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participatinginthe project?
 The project will support the improvement o f overall educational management by expanding the roles o f
 school level stakeholders inthe procurement o f instructionalmaterials through school committees
 working with head teachers. By expanding the roles o f local stakeholders ineducational management,
 the project will strengthen accountability at the school level.
 6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaborationwith NGOs or other civil society
 organizations?
NGOsare already being usedby the external auditor to monitor and evaluate the delivery o f textbooks to
 schools.
6.4 What institutional arrangements have beenprovided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?
The project has been designed to ensure strong community and local involvement especially in the
instructional material program. The project officials will be monitoring all o f the indicators o f the
project, and will be incorporatingthe views o f the local communities. There will also be extensive
consultationwith a wide variety o f stakeholders concerning the reform and adjustment o f the education
sector inthe future.
6.5 H o w will the project monitor performance interms o f social development outcomes?
The monitoring o f the performance o f the social development outcomes has been built into the project
activities. The performance o f students will be periodically assessed, with the results analyzed by gender
and geographical area inparticular. Similarly, there will be a series o f client satisfaction surveys and
focal group discussions.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The sustainability o f the textbook program will ultimately depend upon the Government's commitment to
utilize its financial resources more efficiently and continue to meet the costs o f a textbook provision for
disadvantaged pupils. It i s hoped that over the coming years, the MOEST will continue to increase the
share o f financial resources to the primary sub-sector for the purchase o f textbooks. However, this will
require a review o f public spending on education, a process which i s being supported through the
ongoing PER. The project will also assist in strengtheningthe planning activities inthe MOEST,
including for donor inputsto education development. Even thoughthe Government has announced its
policy o f FPE, it i s recognized that communities will continue to provide some o f the non-salary
expenditures for primary education. However, the project activities are designed to reduce the amount o f
community spending on basic education resources, and this will impact positively especially for the poor.
The policy framework for the primary education sector will be described inthe Letter o f Education
Sector Policy.

InstructionalMaterials.

(a) Definition of the Instructional Materials Package.

The basic decentralized instructionalmaterials funding system on which the current FPESP instructional
materials procurement system i s based, was pioneered by a pilot project supported by the Dutch
Government, which was launched inLaikipia and Machakos Districts in 1996. Two evaluations reported
very positively on the benefits and efficiencies o f decentralized school-based textbook financing and
school-based selection and decision making from a list o f competing alternative textbooks. From 1999
untilthe present, the pilot project initiatives (which also resulted inthe current nationalprimary textbook
policy published in 1998) were further developed by the Government/DFID SPRED 3 project, which
extended the same basic principles to every district in Kenya. SPRED 3 also has receiveda very positive
financial audit conducted by PriceWaterhouseCoopers and a second positive review from the British
National Audit Office. Both evaluations/audits concluded that a highproportion o f schools (over 65
percent) were operatingthe systemand procedures effectively, that the dedicated instructional materials
fundingresulted insignificant improvements intextbooks and teachers' guide supply, and that the
enhanced supplies were having a measurable impact on student performance. The current FPESP i s
therefore the logical development o f a continuous and well tested set o f reforms intextbook financing,
provision, procurement, usage and management, which has been underway for the past seven years since
1996.

Inorder to support the decisionto provide FPE, the MOEST inconsultationwith its partners, has agreed
to a profile and package o f the minimumrequirements for instructional materials provision for all
primary schools and students throughout Kenya. This minimumprofile has been designed to provide the
essential support neededfor education o f an adequate quality and to be the foundation for the teaching
and learning needs o f the new curriculum. Future affordability and sustainability have been taken into
full account inthe designand costingof the minimumprofile. The per capita instructionalmaterials
budgets needed to provide the minimumprofile have been carefully calculated to enable the minimum
specified standards to be achieved for all students inall schools during2003. Fundingwill be provided
via school instructional materials bank accounts (previously school textbook bank accounts) to every
school.

For 2003, schools would receive per capita instructional materials budgets o f approximately K.Sh 1,000
(US$13). The funds would be released during2003 in three phases inApril (DFID, SIDA and GOK
funds), July (WB funds) andDecember (WB funds) o f approximately K.Sh 5001,K.Sh 350 andK.Sh 150
per capita respectively. Future capitation allocations for subsequent years will then be calculated in
order to achieve the following: (i) o f existing stocks inorder to replace lost or damaged items and
                                           top-up
thus to maintainor even enhance the basic supplyratios; (ii)               replacement o f old curriculum textbooks
and teachers' guide sets by new curriculum textbooks and teachers' guide sets as they become available;

I  The precise figure for the first phaseis K.Sh498 per pupil for instructional materials. Inaddition, the Govemment will
provide K.Sh 135 per pupil for school expenditureson other activities.

science comers/facilities, etc); (v) schools will have discretionover the exact use o f their instructional

provision o f the specified basic supplies o f stationery to every student inevery school; and (vii) the
achievement o f the basic supply targets for each o f the specified categories o f instructionalmaterials
described below.

Guidelines have been provided to all schools to help them establish their priorities, plan their expenditure
and achieve their targets. District and zonal inspectorate staff will be expected to advise, support and
supervise school expenditure to ensure the proper use o f the funds made available. However, districts
will not take decisions onbehalfo f the schools. The Guidelines specify different spendingpriorities for
each o f the three phases o f fund release so that suppliers can plan their production schedules efficiently
to meet the needs o f the schools (see below). Schools are required to fully involve parents and the local
community inspending decisions and specific measures have beenbuilt into a revisededition o fthe
Primary School Instructional Materials Management Handbook to ensure that there i s much greater
parental involvement than inthe past.

The minimumprofile o f instructionalmaterials that all Kenyan primary schools must achieve by the end
o f 2003 i s provided inthe Table below. Only titles and materials specified inthe Approved List o f
Instructional Materials for Use inKenyan Primary Schools (2003 Edition) may be purchased using

The basic textbook supply ratios o f 1:2 at upper primary and 1:3 at lower primary are good by the
standards o f many countries inAfrica and would be achieved in all subjects at all grades by
January/February 2004. There i s potential for further improvement inthese ratios ifbook life can be
improved by better conservation practices in schools. Component 2 will provide guidance and training
for all schools on the basic techniques o f textbook usage in schools. The combination o f greatly
improved textbook and teachers' guide supply combinedwith improvements inclassroom usage should
have a significant impact on student performance.

The projected levels of supply o f supplementary readingmaterials inKiswahili and Englishare excellent
incomparison withmost other Africancountries, andthey should provide base for the development of
well-stocked primary school libraries and classroom based readingcorners for all students. Component 2
will provide guidelines and training on the establishment o f simple and easily managed techniques for the
development and maintenance o f libraries and readingcorners. The impact o f regular reading and the
development o f the readinghabit i s well recognized inmany international studies. Regular reading
improves vocabulary development, basic comprehension and has a significant impact on writing skills as
well. These skills have a decisive impact on performance in all other curriculum areas, so that improved
reading and writing standards will automatically improve student performance in science, maths, social
studies, etc.

The targets for teaching support materials (atlases, dictionaries, chalk, wall maps, science kits, etc) would
provide teaching and learning resources that have not been widely available inmost Kenyan primary
schools for many years. These resources will provide essential teacher support and this should lead to
more diverse and thus more interestingand stimulating teaching and learning inKenyanprimary
classrooms.

The basic stationery packages for students o f all grades have been widely welcomed by parents. These
packages, when combinedwith the supply o f adequate quantities o f free textbooks and readingbooks,
remove a major cost burden for most parents and have already encouraged many students to return to
school. Interms of performance, the availability o f stationery, pens, pencils, rulers and maths sets will
encourage more children to work inclass and at home. Many children have been attending school
without the ability to perform either classwork or homework because o f the lack o f notebooks, pens and
pencils. The provision o f these packages will also have a knock-on impact on student performance.

(b) Phasingthe Releaseof Fundsand School Procurement.

There will be three phases o f fundingand procurement. The first phase will be based on DFID,the
Government o f Sweden and Government funding. The second (July 2003) and third (December 2003)

(c) Stationery.

MOEST has specified two basic standards o f stationery supply - one for lower primary students and one
for upper primary students. These supply standards are: (i)    Lower Primary Stationery Supply: 12 x 64
page exercise books each 162 x 203 mm, 3 x HB pencils; 1eraser; 1sharpener; 1ruler; and (ii)     Upper
Primary Stationery Supply: 12 x 120page exercise books each 162 x 203 mm, 3 biro type pens; 1 ruler
and a set o f Mathematical Instruments. The budgets have been calculated to take account o f price
variations for stationery indifferent parts o f Kenya. Prices for non-consumable items (books, wall maps,


                                                     - 37 -

 etc) are fixed inthe Approved List o f InstructionalMaterials for Use inKenyan Primary Schools (2003
 Edition) and these prices are mandatory for every supplier and school inthe country. Stationery prices
 are recommended prices only, but schools should not normally agree to pay more than the recommended
 price.

 Each enrolled primary student must be providedby the school with the minimumspecified supplies o f
 stationery every year. Schools may decide that the stationery should be provided intotal at the beginning
 o f the school year or that it should be provided inthree parts at the beginningo f each term. Students who
 lose all or any part o ftheir stationery allocation, or who require additional items o f stationery must pay
 the additional costs for themselves. Schools may, ifthey wish, provide stationery supplies inexcess o f
 the minimumstandards established by the MOEST, but they may not provide less. All students (parents
 for lower primary students) will be expected to sign for their stationery supplies, and all schools will be
expected to maintain records o f student and parent signatures, and receipts for audit purposes. Only if
stationery i s issued to students against student (or parent) signatures can stationery supplies be
effectively audited. A fully revised and updated Primary School InstructionalMaterials Management
Handbookwill provide all schools with clear procedures and pro formas for the management o f the
selection, procurement and supply processes. It will also provide guidance and procedures on storage,
conservation, repair and usage o f books, and on parental and community involvement.

(d) InstructionalMaterials Reforms.

The proposed program will support several key policy and institutional reforms. First, there will be
considerably improved access to a much wider range o f instructional materials across all curriculum
subjects and standards than has been provided inthe past. The minimuminstructionalmaterials profile,
described above, will provide adequate supplies o f textbooks and teachers' guides to all schools for all
subjects and grades for the first time since the introductiono f the cost sharing policy in 1988. Inthe past,
lack o f funding forced schools to concentrate their textbook purchases on only a few subjects (typically
English,Kiswahili and Maths) and a few standard levels (typically standards 1, 2, 7 and 8). Inaddition,
the calculated budgets for the minimuminstructionalmaterials profile will enable every primary school
inthe country to rapidly buildupgood collections of supplementary readingmaterials -bothfiction and
nonfiction inboth Englishand Kiswahili -which will simultaneously provide readingpractice and
access to curriculum extension materials. Every school will be enabled to develop a simple school
library or simple readingcorners, which will encourage regular reading for pleasure and the early
development o f a readinghabit. Improved fluency and comprehension inlanguage has a significant
impact on student performance inall other curriculum subjects. It i s also hoped that the provision o f
budgets for essential reference materials such as atlases and dictionaries and for basic classroom teaching
and learning materials, such as wall maps and charts will provide essential support for teachers and will
improve the delivery o f the curriculum, the interest levels o f classes and the involvement o f students and
thus the overall performance o fstudents. One o f the most important aspects o fthis component will be
the provision o f a basic minimumpackage o f stationery and writing materials to every student inevery
grade. This will provide significant encouragement for poor students to enter school and will remove one
o f the major barriers to learning, which i s the enforced inactivity o f children inclass who cannot afford
exercise books and writing materials and whom are therefore effectively excluded from participation in
many o f the key learning activities.

Second, there will also be essential support for the introduction o f the new curriculum. The impact o f the
new curriculum depends upon easy access to new curriculum textbooks, teachers' guides and other
teaching and learning support materials. The provision o f adequate school-based procurement budgets
and the establishment o f clear minimumstandards to guide school spending decisions will provide the
purchasing power for every school to equip with the new materials as they become available in every


                                                      - 38 -

subject and for every standard. Without these budgets it i s very unlikely that many students would have
had easy access to new curriculum materials and the delivery and impact o f the new curriculum would
have been seriously constrained.

The introduction o f new procedures for competitive textbook evaluation and approval, in support o f the
new curriculum, has provided an opportunity to establish new textbook and teachers' guide standards
covering conformity to curriculum, content relevance and level, the effective use o f language, exercises
and activities, the usefulness o f accompanying teachers' guides and presentational issues, gender
representation, HIV/AIDS coverage and environmental issues, etc. All o fthese issues were part of the
evaluation criteria applied to the new curriculum textbooks for Standards 1 and 5. The same criteria will
be applied also to the evaluation and approval o f Standard 2 and 6 textbooks and teachers' guides. The
recent independent report on the content and presentation evaluation o f standard 1and 5 textbooks
indicated that the new curriculum textbooks demonstrate substantial pedagogic improvements over
previous textbooks, particularly inthe creative use o f classroom exercises and activities, and a more
positive orientation towards more child centered learning approaches.

There will also be major cost advantages for the sustaining o f the instructionalmaterials provision. The
new curriculum reduces the number o f required textbooks from 10/11down to just 6, which also
significantly reduces the system cost and makes it more affordable and therefore potentially more
sustainable. The introductiono f the new curriculum coincided with the introduction o f a new textbook
and teachers' guide evaluation and approval system, which emphasizes price as a significant factor inthe
evaluation and approval process. The approved textbook list for each subject and grade i s limited to six
titles only and only the six highest scoring titles are accepted onto the official list o f approved materials.
Schools can only spend their procurement budgets on materials in the approved list (the Orange Book).
The inclusion o f price and the limitation on the number o fpermitted approved titles introduces positive
downward pressure on prices for the first time inKenya. The inclusion o f content, presentational and
pedagogic requirements ensures that the selected titles meet minimumcurriculum, content and pedagogic
requirements. The new approval system also requires that publishers should meet specifiedminimum
technical standards designed to guarantee long book life inthe classroom as a condition for approval.
Failure to meet these standards on delivery will result inpenalties. Research elsewhere inthe world
clearly demonstrates that the achievement o f long classroom book life allows maximum cost amortization
and the lowest annual recurrent costs for instructional materials provision. The achievement o f lower,
and thus more affordable, annual recurrent costs i s the basis for the longer-term goal o f sustainability.

Bank charges on school textbook bank accounts have been a major cost item for schools, which has
caused a significant reduction in the purchasingpower o f the funds provided by donors and government.
Ithas beenestimated by the MOEST and by the commercial banks that bank charges could have
amounted to around K.Sh 70 million (US$1million) per year. The MOEST has now negotiated an
agreement with 7 commercial banks (holding 98 percent o f all school instructional material bank
accounts) to radically reduce bank charges on school accounts to less than K.Sh 6 millionper year in
total.

Publishers of old curriculum textbooks and supplementary materials, which are still included in the
revised Approved List o f Instructional Materials were invited to submit sealed envelopes with proposals
for price amendments to the existingtitles. Bearing inmindthe substantial increase in annual turnover,
the extended print-runs, reduced unit costs and increased profit margins, the letter o f invitation to submit
price amendments required that beneficiarypublishers should consider price reductions as a contribution
to the FPESP. Most publishers submitted price reductions and it i s estimated that overall price
reductions of between 5-10% were achieved - sufficient to provide an extra US$5-10 millionof
purchasing power to schools.

There will also be support through the program for the strengthening and upgrading o f the local book
trade. The local book trade, comprisingpaper mills, paper merchants, printers, publishers, booksellers
and stationers, will all benefit greatly from the project inputs. The financing to be made available during
2003 will increase by at least eight times the normal school book turnover at primary level. All
origination, manufacturing and supply o f primary school materials i s via the local private sector book
trade and the increased turnover and profitability will significantly improve financial strength and
stability and will provide increased employment opportunities. The requirements o fthe new evaluation
and approval system will require publishers and printers to write, design, illustrate and manufacture to
much higher standards than inthe past and the good habits acquired inachieving the established
standards will not only improve basic professional skills but will also be o f assistance when participating
insimilar competitions inneighboringcountries. The trainingprograms offered to booksellers and
stationers inall parts of the country, the required Codes o f Conduct and the basic operational rules o f
decentralized procurement will all increase the professional skills o f booksellers inevery district o f
Kenya and will upgrade basic services to schools. The additional turnover will create work opportunities
inrural andremote locations where work opportunities are currently few and far between. The extension
o f the current emergency funding into regular annual support for instructional materials provision in
schools will provide predictability in school financing, which i s a critical issue for the development o f
both the school system and the local private sector book trade.

It is also expected that school management capacity and accountabilitywill be improved. The shift
towards a national system o f decentralized procurement and school financing will require a significant
upgrade inthe capacity of schools to manage their own affairs and to cope with the requirements o f
planning and prioritizing decisions. The new financial management requirements combined with
improved auditing via the Schools Audit Unit o f the MOEST should improve the accountability o f
schools. These are not short term issues, but the framework o f a new decentralized and accountable
financing system will be constructed as a result o f the project requirements.

Finally, community participation in school management and decision making will also be enhanced.
Decentralized financing will be easier to control ifall parents and students are fully aware o f the benefits
that FPE funding i s intended to provide. National publicity will ensure that all districts, zones, schools,
teachers, parents and students are aware o f the funds that will be made available and what they should be
used for. New management handbooks will stress the need for parent participation on management
committees and inthe decision-makingprocesses. Management committees will be required to inform
all parents about decisions on funding and to hold PTA meetings to explain the funds received and the
proposed usage o f funds. Insuch ways will parents and the wider community be more fully involved in
the decisions, work and accountability o f each school.

Project Component 2 US$7.50 million

Capacity Building.

The proposed capacity buildingcomponent would have four sub-components: (i)           school-based teacher
development and support; (ii)  school accounting system; (iii)  education management information system;
and (iv) system design and program preparation.

(i)School-basedTeacherDevelopmentandSupportProgram(US$1.9million).

Since the Government announced its new policy o f FPE at the beginning o f 2003, the demand for
primary schooling has increased dramatically. Primary schools have experienced significant increases in
pupilenrollments inall standards, but especially inthe lower grades. As a result, many classroom


                                                    - 40 -

 teachers now have to manage substantially larger classes and, at the same time, deal with the special
 needs o f new entrants, who include HIV/AIDS orphans, overage pupils, street urchins, children o f
 pastoralist families, etc. Special needs not only pose a significant challenge inthe classroom, but they
 will also necessitate the introduction o f effective counseling services inschools. Inaddition, many
 schools have been obliged to operate double shift systems especially inthe lower standards because o f
 the pressure o f increased enrollments on available classroom facilities. Some schools, which have more
 than adequate teachers, have been able to adapt readily to double shifting. Incontrast, others inremote
 rural areas, which have difficulties attracting sufficient teachers, are requiringtheir teachers to teach two
 or three classes concurrently, now with larger pupilnumbers.

 Currently, 98 per cent o f the MOEST's recurrent budget i s spent on teachers' salaries, so there i s limited
fiscal scope at present to engage more teachers to cope with the problems generated by increased
enrollments. The present teaching force will therefore need to be utilized more efficiently. This will
require substantial redeployment from schools in surplus to those indeficit. Because a major
geographical redistribution o f transfer o f teachers i s a highly sensitive issue both politically and socially,
it will be difficult to achieve any significant improvement inutilization overnight. The reality inthe
short-term i s that many teachers will continue to teach large classes and carry out multi-grade teaching.
And all teachers will have to adapt to a far more diverse student population.

The instructional materials component o f the project will ensure that pupils and teachers have access to
appropriate textbooks, teachers' guides, supplementary readers and stationery. This will provide an
opportunity for teachers to move towards more active and pupil-centredteaching methods away from the
teacher-centred methods which many teachers have been obliged to adopt because o f the dearth o f pupil
texts. The DFIDfinanced distance education course i s an excellent broad-based certificate program
which aims to strengthen the pedagogical skills o f key resource teachers (KRTs) inMathematics, English
and Science. To date, around 32,000 teachers have completed the 6 month program and more will be
enrolled under the extension o f the SPRED project. Significantly, however, the materials do not
explicitly cover the use o f textbooks and many o f the key issues facing teachers at present (such as
managing large classes and multi-grade teaching) are not adequately covered at present.

Clearly, there i s an immediate need to give classroom teachers skills both to use the new textbooks and
other instructional materials effectively and to handle the emerging challenges o f FPE. These skills will
needto be built through a combination o f off-job and on-job methods. Potentially, the most effective
learning will take place when teachers return to the classroom to practice their new skills. This will
require that the various teacher development and support systems at zonal, cluster and school level are
working well. Attention will therefore needto be given to reactivatingthe existing mechanisms, in
particular the school panel and cluster level meetings inthe core curriculum subjects, as well as focusing
on the key actors responsible for making these systems work. Inthis regard, headteachers have a critical
assurance role to play intheir schools, which should reinforce the teacher development efforts o f their
KRTs. They will needto be supported through effective advisory services (classroom observation,
feedback and mentoring) carried out by zonal T A C tutors and inspectors.

The overall purpose o fthis sub-component i s to improve the quality o f teaching and learning inprimary
schools. Specific objectives are to ensure that: (i)  all classroom teachers are able to use textbooks and
other instructional materials effectively, as a vehicle for adopting active and pupil-centered teaching
methods; (ii) all classroom teachers are able to deal with the emerging challenges o f free primary
education and the special needs o fpupils; (iii)  all head teachers are performing their quality assurance
role effectively at the school level; and (iv) schools are able to provide effective guidance and counseling
services to pupils with special needs.



                                                      -41 -

The development program will target: (i)    72,000 KRTs inEnglish,Mathematics, Science and Kiswahili;
(ii) nominatedguidanceandcounselingteachersineachschool;and(iii) headteachers.
    17,500                                                                           17,500
The training o f zonal T A C tutors and ZIs inclassroom observation and feedback skills will be financed
by DFID. New distance learningunitswill be developed for both the KRTsand the nominatedguidance
and counseling teachers which will be added to the core module o f the existing in-service program.
These unitswill cover: (i)   the use and management o f instructionalmaterials; (ii)  multi-grade teaching;
(iii)managing large classes; (iv) challenges o f FPE and special needs (including HIV/AIDS, druguse,
pastoralists, early marriage, overage pupils and other issues); and (iv) guidance and counseling. A
tailor-made course will be designed for head teachers focusing on their quality assurance role inthe
school. Two core teams, supported as appropriate by external consultants, will design the distance
learning unitsand the face-to-face training respectively. The core teams will include members selected
from the main target groups (KRTs and headteachers) on the basis o f their acknowledged competence.

A two-pronged strategy will be adopted. First,the new distance learningunitswill be made available for
all 72,000 KRTs and 17,500 nominated guidance and counseling teachers to study immediately at no
cost, The Ministrywill examine how the completion o f individual units can be properly accredited as an
incentive for teachers to study. At the same time, approximately 240 trainers selected on the basis o f
their competence and experience, not rank or position, will train 17,500 head teachers at the zonal or
cluster level. These trainers will have receivedprior training inadult learning techniques. The courses
will be located so that participants indisadvantaged areas, especially the NorthEast, have easy access to
them. Second, to ensure that the skills are applied inschools and classrooms, follow-up activities will
take place as follows: (i) tutors and ZIs will support improvedteaching practice through classroom
                            TAC
observation and feedback duringtheir regular school visits; (ii)   head teachers will observe and mentor
teachers to improve classroom practice intheir schools; (iii)    subject panels will be made active in all
schools as a vehicle for KRTs to pass on to other teachers knowledge and skills acquired through the new
distance education units; and (iv) cluster meetings of KRTswill take place 6 times a year (twice per
term) and will be used as an opportunity for T A C tutors to conduct face-to-face tutorials with KRTs on
the distance education unitsthey are studying.

Inadditionto the plannedtrainingprogram, a study willbe conductedto explore new approaches for
maintaining standards o f education and promoting school improvement. The study i s motivatedby two
principal factors: the need to rethink the role o f the school inspectors, and the associated needto
reconsider the role o f head teachers, subject teachers, school management committees and parents in
ensuring quality and accountability for all services offered by schools. The School Inspectorate i s a key
professional division inthe Education Directorate o f MOEST, and it includes with a structure that
includes the Chief Inspector o f Schools, senior inspectors inthe MOEST, subject inspectors based at the
provincial and district levels, and ZIs who provide support to primary schools. The role o f the
Inspectorate i s to maintain standards o f educationand quality assurance inteaching and learning
processes, and national examinations. However, the Inspectorate i s presently experiencingdifficulties in
its monitoring work, and it i s wanting more inspectors to be appointed and more transport vehicles to be
provided to enable it to cope with the increased load resulting from the growing numbers o f primary and
secondary schools and teachers. This trend o f expansion o f the Inspectorate i s not sustainable, especially
as the numbers o f schools and teachers are likely to continue growing. It i s important, therefore, to
consider new approaches and roles o f the Inspectorate and other stakeholders inthe maintenance o f
education standards and quality. Inparticular, with teachers and local communities taking increased
responsibility and accountability for all school services, it may be possible and appropriate for the
Inspectorate to support and facilitate the school supervision process even with rationalized resources.
However, such a paradigm shift would require a careful review and consideration o f the future role o f the
Inspectorate, its staff retraining needs and capacity building. It would also require a study o f measures
needingto be taken at the school level to strengthen the capacity o f schools intheir responsibility for


                                                      -42 -

 quality assurance and to enable them to tap available professional resources, including from the
 Inspectorate.

 (ii) SchoolAccounting System(USS1.0 million).

 The FPE policy has replaced the cost sharing policy under which parents contributed substantially to the
 runningcosts o fprimary schools. The Government is now committedto finance the costs of
 instructional materials and other inputs through per capita grants to individual schools. Inthe short-term,
 these grants will be disbursed through two school bank accounts, one for instructional materials and the
 other for general purposes. DFIDhas been providing substantial resources for textbooks under the
 SPRED 3 project, which will now be supplemented through the first component o f this project. In
 addition, the Government will disburse significant resources into the general purpose accounts o f primary
 schools inApril this year as soon as the supplementary estimates have been approved by Parliament.
 Headteachers, together with their school management committees, will be given some discretion over the
 spending o f these grants within the guidelines set by the MOEST.

Both the MOEST and donor agencies are concerned about the ability o fprimary schools to utilize these
resources effectively and to account properly for expenditure. An ongoing primary schools audit and
 inspectionexercise launched inMay 2002 has established that although schools had collected and spent
 large sums o f money, accountability was weak. The key findings were that: (i)    head teachers, who are
entrusted to maintainbooks o f account, had inadequate knowledge inbook keeping; (ii)       school
management committees, who are entrusted to manage school finances, had little or no knowledge o f
financial management; (iii)    there are no uniform accounting practices inuse at the school level; and (iv)
PRISM training for head teachers did not cover financial management adequately.

To address these issues, the MOEST has already initiated a nationwide programto roll out a uniform
accounting system inprimary schools, through which all headteachers and members o f school
management committees will be trained. A professional accountancy firm has been engaged to carry out
this exercisejointly with a MOEST Task Force. The programhas already beenlaunchedand will be
completed by July 2003. A comprehensive handbook of Financial Management Instructions for
Educational Institutions has been developed, as well as a Training Manual inFinancial Management.
Usingthese materials, the consultantsjointly with the Task Forcewill train zonal inspectors and other
personnel selected as trainers in 10 regional clusters. The zonal inspectors and district auditors will
subsequently be responsible for training headteachers and sensitizing SMC at over 450 training
locations. The consultants and the Task Force will monitor the quality o f training on a sample basis.
The purpose o f this initial training program i s to install the uniform accounting system in all schools, but
it will not be sufficient to implement the system fully. Therefore, implementationsupport will be
required over at least a 6-12 month period following the completion o f the training. The precise scope o f
this support shouldbe based onthe evidence o f follow-up tracking studies and monitoringvisits.

The objective o f this sub-component is, therefore, to implement an improved uniform accounting system
so that all funds disbursed to primary schools are properly accounted and used for their intendedpurpose.
This sub-component is designed to buildon the ongoing and initial financial management training
targeted towards head teachers and school management committees that i s designed to "install" the
financial management system in all schools. Under this sub-component, implementation support will be
provided to ensure that the system installed i s fully implemented at the school level. This support will be
designed to ensure not only that the correct procedures are being followed, but also that value for money
i s obtained for the resources allocated.

The approach adopted will be to buildcapacity within the MOEST, especially at the district and zonal


                                                      - 43 -

 level, to solve problems at the school level. ZIs will routinely monitor the operation o f the accounting
 system at school level, focusing on budgeting, procurement, expenditure authorizationand the
 maintenance o f financial records. The purpose o f monitoring will be to identify procedural problems
 faced by head teachers and SMCs and, where possible, to solve them on the spot. The zonal inspectors
 will be back-stopped by district teams comprisingthe DEO, the District Inspector, the District Auditor
 and other key personnel as appropriate. These teams will receive additional training to solve technical
problems which are beyond the capacity o f the ZIs. Over the two years o f the project, a number o f head
teachers will be replaced as a result o f natural wastage. Therefore, to ensure the improvements are
 sustained, provision will be made to train up to 2,000 new head teachers inthe school-based accounting
 system. The MOEST will develop succession plans that identifyand train deputy head teachers in
advance o f their appointment as head teachers. Inaddition, an expenditure tracking study will be
conducted on a sample o f schools inall Provinces to ascertain value for money.

A professional accountancy firmwill be engaged based on a competitive tendering process to provide
specialized training for key personnel, to develop appropriate monitoring and auditingprotocols, and to
advise on and supervise the expenditure tracking exercise. This assistance will be required for at least
six months.

(iii) EducationManagementInformationSystem(US$2.5 million).

The ability o f the MOEST to analyze issues inthe education sector, as a basis for developing appropriate
policies, strategies and programs inresponse to these issues, and to monitor program outcomes i s
severely limitedby paucity o f data on the characteristics and operational efficiency o f the education
system. Sharing o f the limited information available i s also adhoc and unreliable. Access to the
Intranethnternet i s piecemeal and very expensive. Networking the Ministrycomputers with internet
access up to the district level would facilitate collection and processing of data, and reduce the task and
speed o f dissemination. Eventually, the Ministryshould explore ways o f establishing a homepage on the
World Wide Web as part o f its information dissemination effort. Key education indicators and trends
can be postedon this site for access by the public, and the Ministrycan market itself on this site by
spelling out its vision and policies to development partners. Access to the internet can also open up the
Ministryto experiences, surveys andresearchwork on a global scale that can helpinformand enrich
programdevelopment, evaluation and research inKenya.

These deficiencies are becomingeven more critical as the Government moves towards programmatic
operations inthe context o f the PEWMTEF. Sectors will now be expected to base their demand for
resources on ajustification o f their strategic contribution to development, as well as the efficiency and
effectiveness with which resources are used to help alleviate poverty equitably.

One o f the key reasons for the limiteduse o f data i s partly related to the way the system was financed,
especially at the primary and secondary levels. With the introduction o f cost sharing in the late eighties,
public expenditures were limited to salary expenditures while non-salary recurrent and development
costs were borne by parents and communities. Data collection and analysis inthe public sector was
therefore largely limited to these areas. Consequently, the Teachers' Service Commission (TSC) and the
Department o f Personnel Management (DPM) have information o f staffing levels and movements
derived from basic school enrollment data. The limited collection and analysis o f data inother areas for
which other unitdagencies o f the MOEST, including the Planning Division, were responsible contributed
to an erosion o f their capacity inthis area.

This partial approach to the treatment o f education data has ledto deficiencies inthe arrangements for
the collection and analysis o f data. The MOEST uses three forms for collection and analysis o fprimary


                                                     - 44 -

 school census data. Form A which captures informationon school enrollments and teachers is processed
bythe TSC, while FormB for repeater and dropouts school registration, costs and financing as well as on
learning achievement, etc, and FormC which covers physical facilities, etc, are processedby the
Planning Division o f the MOEST. There i s little or no coordination between the two agencies inthe
collection and analysis o f the data, resultingininconsistencies and inaccuracies inthe results. Published
data i s also incomplete, as the TSC data i s often more current than that o f the PlanningDivisionbecause
o f limited demand for the kindo f data the PlanningDepartment analyzes and its limited capacity.

Over centralizationo f data collection and analysis i s also a constraint. Although responsibilities for
managingthe system, especially with regard to teacher employment, deployment, and supervision, i s
increasinglybeing delegated to the district level, there i s little or no capacity to analyze anduse the data
collected inmany o f the district offices. This i s a legacy o f the centralized management system through
which DEOs merely carried out instructions from headquarters. There was therefore no need to use data
intheir regular operations. This over centralization also affected the efficiency with which they collected
data. Without a direct interest inthe results, district offices did not properly supervise the schools and
the officers who collected the data renderingthe reliability o f the data passed on the TSC and MOEST
Headquarters questionable. With increased decentralization o f education management, which includes
transfer o f resources to the school level and management o f these resources under the supervision o f the
districts including accounting for outcomes, the incentives for collection and use o f data at the local
levels will change. Districts will now be requiredto undertake simple analysis o f crucial data such as
those related to enrollment, drop out and repetitionrates, teacher supply and demand, costs and
expenditures, etc, by gender, ruralhrban and education levels at the district level. The data from the
various regions would then be transmitted to the headquarters for further analysis. This would allow the
Planning Department time to carry out more indepth analysis o f issues.

A further constraint is that, untilabout two years ago, most o f the collection and analysis o f data in
MOEST headquarters and the districts was carried out manually or with very limited computer capacity,
except at the TSC which was networked around that date. The MOEST could, therefore, not benefit
from the trained staff posted to the planning department by the Treasury from where GOK's ICT
program i s managed. The TSC i s much more current with requirements because o f the need to better
understand issues related to teacher management. Inthe absence o f a strong demand for statistical
information and adequate computer technology, resources for collection and analysis o f data at all levels
declined.

The MOEST is aware o f these deficiencies and commissioned a study for establishing an efficient EMIS
for the MOEST that would serve the current and emergingneeds o f the MinistryHeadquarters, agencies
such as TSC, KNEC, KIE, and districts in 1999, as part o f the preparationo f the proposed STEPS
project. A limitednumber o f the recommendations o f this study were implementedat the TSC using
funds from the PPF.

The objectives o f this sub-component are to complete the design o f and EMIS for the MOEST and
initiate implementation o f the design. To achieve these objectives the project would revise and update
the analysis and designthat was prepared inMarch2000, to satisfy the current operational and
technological requirements o f the MOEST, including districts. Specifically, the project would help (i)
update the needs assessment o f MOEST to determine the key data requirements for the various
unitdagencies; (ii) design an integrated system for data collection, analysis and management; (iii)
develop a phased program for computerizing the EMIS startingwith priority areas such as the Planning
Division, TSC, and the Inspectorate; and (iv) initiate implementation o f the agreed designs. It i s
expected that the program to be developed will be a rolling plan that would be upgraded periodically to
adapt to changes in the needs o f the MOEST and technological developments. The system will be tested


                                                     -45  -

inan agreed number o fdistricts by2004before it is expanded.

The development and implementationo f the system will be coordinated by the PlanningDepartment
which reports to the Permanent Secretary. This i s consistent with the GOK policy o f centralizing
planning and ICT management inthe Ministrieso f Finance and Planning from which planning officials
are postedto PlanningDepartments inthe various Ministries. However, to ensure that the needs o f all
the stakeholders inMOEST are properly addressed, the PS will be assisted bya committee comprising a
cross-section o f the MOEST Departments and agencies. The design o f the system would aim at bringing
together different institutions inthe Ministryto work within a common strategic framework. Inessence
the system would establish linkages andnetworks betweenthese institutionsup to the district level
eventually through a Wide Area Network (WAN) with a common database to which all agencies will
have access. Indesigning the system special attention will be paid to establishing capability specialized
areas such GIS that would facilitate school mapping.

The project would finance: (a) technical assistance for preparing (i)    the MIS needs assessment; and (ii)
the design and installationo f the network systemcomprisingthe software and hardware requirements for
the proposed MIS system, training and support to staff inthe use o f the system; (b) operational costs for
training headquarters and district users, analysts and system maintenance staff; and (c) equipment and
furniture for upgrading the ICT capacity in MOEST headquarters and districts including training inthe
use o f the equipment and maintenance.

(iv) SystemDesignandProgramPreparation(US$2.1million).

StudiesandProjectPreparationWork (US$1.1million).

Following the implementation o f the emergency program for the provision o f FPE, the Government
proposes to complete an education sector review as a basis for developing and implementingpolicies,
strategies and programs for further development o f the education system. The provision o fFPE to all by
the Government will add the financing o f non-salary recurrent and development costs, including the
provision o f physical facilities, to its expenditures. This would be challenging given the relatively high
level o f public expenditures ineducation. The Government therefore needs to ensure that these programs
do not only lead to increasedproduction o f highquality graduates at all levels, but that they are
consistent with poverty reduction strategy, the public expenditure review and medium-term expenditure
framework, and the Millennium Development Goals, and that they include adequate accountability
mechanisms.

The MOEST has produced a large number o f sector reviews to inform policy and program development,
but their utility has been limited by inadequate quantitative analysis o f issues, especially those related to
efficiency and the costhesource implications o f proposals. With reference to the administration and
management o f the system, the MOEST currently produces adequate numbers o f qualified primary
school teachers, has the capacity for preparing good teaching programs and has a highquality
examinations system although this capacity i s now gradually eroding. A large network o f teacher
advisors and school inspectors to support teachers from locally based Teacher Advisory Centers and
District Offices i s available, but their effectiveness i s limitedby lack o f operational funds. There i s also
a strong community and parent involvement inthe management and support of educational development,
and a network o fNGOs inthe education sector, although links with themhave been rather tenuous.

Inspite o fthese strengths, the effectiveness o fthe system is limited by a number o ffactors including, an
over centralized structure which constrains the integration o f policy formulation, technical support,



                                                      - 46 -

monitoring and evaluation, and with service delivery ina coherent framework. The roles and functions
o f PDEs, DEOs, district inspectors, and TAC tutors are often unclear and contradictory, leadingto weak
teacher support and inadequate monitoring o f the system. Centralized decision making also constrains
the development o f specific interventions to address local issues because o f inadequate information or
proper understanding o f the issues at stake. This i s compounded by delays indecision making due to
communication difficulties. The impact o f this, i s that schools do not operate at adequate levels o f
operational efficiency as issues are not identified early and are infrequently supervised. GOK i s aware o f
these problems and has started to address them. For example some aspects o f teacher management have
been delegated to district offices which act as agents o f the TSC. Inaddition, the Government plans to
strengthen the system significantly to ensure an efficient management system for the provision o f FPE
and for further development of the system.

The objective o f this sub-component will be to support the Government in: (i)    deepening its
understanding o f selected issues in the sector; (ii)developingappropriate strategies for increasing access
and improving quality, especially inprimary and secondary education; (iii)     strengthening its management
capacity for the provision o f education and training; and (iv) developing future sub-sector programs
starting with primary and secondary education.

More specifically, the project would help to: (i) strengthen the capacity for the preparation o f annual
public expenditure reviews and the updating of the medium-term expenditure framework, as well as
preparing in-depth analysis o f issues in the sector; (ii)
                                                         design strategies for increasing access to
education, through school mapping, and through designing appropriate interventions for access to schools
inareas with unique difficulties (such as ASAL areas andurbanslums); (iii)       improve education quality,
through refining the strategies for professional development o f teachers, strengthening teacher support at
the school and cluster levels, including enhancing the ability o f head teachers to provide pedagogical
support to teachers, improving the designs o f public and school examinations, and introduction o f a
system for assessment o f student achievement, and improving the designs o f pre-service and in-service
teacher training programs; (iv) monitor and refine arrangements for the introduction o f the new
curriculum and textbooks; and (v) strengthen the institutional framework for delivery o f education
through supporting a review o f the regulatory framework for education provision to ensure that it i s
consistent with current approaches, and developinga management system for increased decentralized
provision o f education, including arrangements for the flow o f funds to the school level, the management
o f funds by schools/communities and districts. This would involve a review o f the linkages from the
MOEST headquarters through the provinces, districts, divisions, and zones to the schools leading to
recommendations on how management effectiveness can be improved.

Inorder to benefit from the knowledge and other resources inthe education sector and to buildconsensus
around the key directions, the Government plans to develop strong links with all stakeholders inthe
sector including communities, NGOs and donors. To help establish these links, the Government plans to
introduce a structure for regular collaboration among stakeholders and within the Government, so that
issues will be discussed, options evaluated, andjoint recommendations made to the Government for
decision making. The structure for collaboration will be ledand managed by the Permanent Secretary,
MOEST and will include other government ministries and agencies such as Ministries o f Finance,
Planning, Labor and DPM. Civil society and donors will be expected to participate at appropriate levels
within the structure. Implementation o f the component will be under the overall supervision o f the PS
and the senior management team o f the MOEST, but a coordinator will be appointedfor planning and
monitoring the various tasks. The project will finance: (i)  technical assistance and training; (ii)
equipment; and (iii) operational costs for the preparationo f the studies, designs and future programs. It
would also cover the refinancing o f the PPF used (US$0.2 million).

SpecialPrograms for DisadvantagedChildren(US%l.O million).

The achievement o f universal primary education i s constrained by special conditions especially inurban
areas and ASALs which deny certain children from benefiting from free primary education. InNairobi,
for example, the gross enrollment ratio was about 50 percent and in some ASALs less than 40 percent
before FPEwas introduced. Evenwith FPE,however, the GER inthese areas i s still far less than 100
percent. This i s partly related to extreme poverty which denies some children non-educational
requirements to complement facilities inschools, patterns o f life innomadic areas, cultural practices
which allows premature withdrawal from school, and delinquency especially inurban areas.

The Government has, therefore, recognized that additional measures will need to be taken for children in
urban slums and ASALs to ensure that are able to benefit fully from the program. The objective i s
therefore to introduce strategies and programs which address the specific issues inthese areas. The
programs will be based on current interventions beingimplementedby the Government and NGOs, based
on a survey o f the various areas to establish the characteristics o f the student and school age population
inthese areas, identifythe educational andnon-educational factors that affect access and completion o f
quality education, and make recommendations on the most appropriate modes of delivery for education.
The Government and stakeholders wouldjointly develop appropriate interventions to cover the diversity
o f disadvantaged areas inKenya. Implementationo f the interventions will be government led, but NGOs
and CBOs with experience and capacity inthe provision o f education inthese areas will be encouraged to
participate inthe implementation o f the programs, as well as inthe monitoring and evaluation o f results
and further refinement o f the designs. The project will provide about for US$1 million for agreed
interventions to be implementedby the Government, NGOs or CBOs.

MonitoringandEvaluation.

This component has three sub-components: (i)      monitoring; (ii) evaluation; and (iii) external audit.

Monitoring data will obtained from a variety o f sources as follows: (i)    standard tests of pupil
competencies; (ii)  reports o f education managers, school inspectors and T A C tutors; (iii) Census
                                                                                               School
data; (iv) reports o f the Textbook Management Unit and School Audit Unit; (v) surveys o f School
Management Committees and parents; and (vi) routine management reports o f component and
sub-component managers.

There will be a baseline survey carriedout at the beginningo f the project to provide information against
which the future impact o f the educational materials can be measured. It i s generally assumed that the
lack o f teaching materials such as textbooks i s a major constraint to any improvements inthe learning
achievements o f children inprimary school. It i s also often assumed that, due partly to lack of materials,
teachers are forced to rely very heavily on teacher center methods with muchuse o f the blackboardand
of children listeningor copying with little opportunity for interactive learning. It i s important to see
whether the provision o f a large amount o f instructionalmaterials will make a difference to learning, and
ifso inwhat ways learningoutcomes improve. Suchimprovements can only bemeasuredifabase line
exists against which future levels o f achievement can be compared. The following areas in which future
improvements can be expected as a result o f learning are: (i)  basic literacy and numeracy achieved; (ii)
the extent o f interactive learning that occurs; (iii) existence o f the materials inthe school and class
                                                     the
and the appropriacy o f their use; (iv) the extent to which children can apply knowledge learned; and (v)
the levels o f problem solving skills acquired.

There will also be client satisfaction surveys to measure the quality o f teaching and learning, and to
provide an alternative perspective to the assessments o f school inspectors. Two surveys will be
conducted, the first inMarch 2004, followed by a repeat survey two years later. The objective is to
assess how school management committees, parents and pupilsrate their primary schools in terms of
teaching and learning.

Inaddition, there will be a major publicity campaign. The initial phase o fpublicity campaign has already
started with the DFID funding. The details are shown inthe table below.

An evaluation will be undertaken at the end o f the project to take monitoring a step further. The
evaluation exercise has three objectives. Firstly, it will assess the extent to which the outcomes and
outputs o f the project have been achieved, examining differences inachievement betweenregions and
types of school. Secondly, the evaluators will determine the reasons for project successes and failures.

Thirdly, the evaluation will be forward-looking, examiningthe prospects for sustainability and the
relevance of project inputs.

The project will also finance a bi-annual external and independent audit inthe first year, and an annual
audit inthe second and thirdyears o f the project. The audit will focus on the Textbook Management
Unitand a sample ofprimary schools accounts.

                       KENYA: Free Primary Education Support Project

1. The Economic Rationale of Investingin PrimaryEducationinKenya.

The FPE policy supported by the project i s expected to provide economic benefits intwo areas: (a)
providing the basis for poverty reduction, overall human capital development, and accelerated economic
growth; and (b) rationalization o f public expenditures.

Providing the Basis for Poverty Reduction, Overall Human Capital Development, and Accelerated
Economic Growth.

Educationi s a key element o f the Government's strategy to reduce poverty. The highhousehold cost for
primary education, together with increased poverty incidence, has been one o f key factors responsible for
the deteriorationo f education sector performance, which i s further reflected indeclining enrollment
ratios and poor education quality.

To turn around sector performance, the new Government has started to implement the FPE policy since
2003. Primary schools fees are abolished. Total enrollment inprimary school has increased by about 1
million this year. The project will support the Government's FPE policy by expanding the coverage o f
publicly supplied textbooks through school based textbook grants. This i s an important measure to
improve and maintain education quality, while the financial burden o f education on households i s
alleviated.

Strengthening Kenya's education system i s also important from the perspective o f economic growth.
While duringthe past decade Kenya's economic performance has been poor, current reforms ineconomic
governance and policy should provide the basis for accelerated economic growth inthe future. Such
accelerated growth will only be achievable and sustainable, if an adequately educated workforce i s
available.

Rationalization of Public Expenditures.

The education sector accounts for 36 percent of voted recurrent expenditures in2001/02, which i s high
by internationalcomparison. This implies that further development o fthe education sector can only be
achieved if available resources are used more efficiently, and ifthe Government concentrates its
resources inkey areas o f public intervention.

At the primary level, almost 98 percent the total budget has gone to teachers' salaries and allowances
over the years, leaving only 2 percent for operations and maintenance. The relatively highexpenditures
on personal emoluments implythat little i s spent on other important recurrent inputs such as, learning
materials and textbooks which are critical for increasing educational quality. Inrecent years, the
Government has started to gradually increase resources to support teaching and leaming materials, with
the support o f DFID. The drastic expansion o f coverage o f textbook provision under the FPEpolicy will
be an important step to the improvement o f efficiency o f resource allocation within the sector. Although
donor support is essential at this stage, accelerated economic growth and increased government revenue
will ensure the sustainability o f the efficient public resource allocation.

2. FinancialSustainabilityAnalysis.

PrimarySchoolAge Populationand EnrollmentProjection.

The size o f school-age population i s affected by declining population growth. Central Bureau o f
Statistics projections for the primary age group i s at 1.33% p.a. declining to 0.80% p.a. by 2006. The
implications o f the trend i s that Kenya will not be faced with rapidly growing school age populations in
the coming years: indeed, it may find that inthe next decade school age populations will shrink, as has
happened to many countries. Preliminary population projections, together with enrollment projections,
are shown inTable 1.

According to the return o f school census inFebruary 2003, the total enrollment this year at primary level
has increased to 7.2 million from last year's 6.3 million. The intake rate i s estimated at 130 percent.
Projections of enrollment following the FPE initiative depend greatly on the likely behavior o f those who
are new-comers to primary education in2003. Table 2 shows the current systemefficiency indicators.
Due to increasedpublic investment in the primary sub-sector, particularly with improved educational
inputssuch as textbooks, it is envisaged that there will be significant improvement inthe internal
efficiency. Inthe projection model, we assume the drop-out rate would drop to 1/2 o f current level
betweenyear 2003 -2005, and further to zero afterwards. Inthe same vein, the repetition rates are
assumed to drop to 2/3 of current level between 2003-05, further to 1/3 o f current level starting inyear
2006.

                                                   Table 2. Internal Efficiency Indicators




However, because so many o f the out-of-school children have enrolled in2003, the intake rates inthe
following years will not be as highas 130 percent. The projection assumes that the effect o f FPE will
still keep the intake rate over 100 percent duringthe following two years, but gradually reduced to a
steady-state level of 96 percent. The model shows that as the "FPE bulge" works its way through the
system. By 2012 the last cohort o f "FPE bulge" will reach the last grade o fprimary cycle. The system
reaches a steady-state in2013.

(a) Teacher Employment,Deployment,and Costs.

The number o f teachers employed at primary level drives the costs o f the primary system, which i s the
most important part o f the whole recurrent education budget. Internationalexperience indicates that a
class o f about 50 i s the desirable maximum for one teacher to handle, and that an average PTR o f
betweenabout 1:40 and 1:45 is reasonable for maximum efficiency inteacher use. The low PTR before
2003 (35: 1in2002) has been a distinctive character o f primary education inKenya. The enrollment
surge in2003 has pushed the PTR to 41:1. This rate i s currently used inthe model to project teacher
needs.

Although the overall efficiency o f teacher utilization seems to be improving, the unevenness o f teacher
distribution across schools and districts i s a still an existing issue. Teacher deployment has been
proposed by the FPE task force to ensure the efficient utilization o f current teacher force.

The 1997 Teacher Salary award has beenthe subject o f much controversy, and has beenmuchdiscussed.
Ithas been estimated that an amount o f K.Sh 2.4 billion annually may have to be budgetedto pay for
salary increases. However, for the time being, this i s not built into the model, as discussions on the
policy are still ongoing.

(b) Capitation Cost.

Certain costs are directly dependent on enrollment, which include the cost o f textbooks and other
learning materials, and costs directly linkedto school operation including registration, examinations,
school-based teacher development, as well as minor repairs and other school maintenance cost. Although
economy o f scale may vary the cost for these items, they are closely linked to the size (total enrollment)
o f each school.

Underthe current project o fpublic textbooks provision, it is estimatedthat K.Sh 850 is needed for each
child in school to provide minimumpackage o f textbooks and other learning materials during school year
2003 (see Annex "The Kenyan Publishingand Printing Sector" for details). Duringthe following years

the unitcost is estimated as shown intable 3.b, usingbasic parameters summarized intable 3.a. The
variation from year to year i s mainly due to the new curriculum introduction as well as various lengthso f
lifetime for different components o f the package.

Inaddition, it is expectedthat the flow offunds to schools shallcover extendedareas includingminor
repairs and maintenance, utility, administration, and other quality improvement activities at school level.
Itis estimated that K.Sh 370 per pupilper year to cover these areas.

The capitationcost estimation also includes a baseline figure based on the 2002 Government budget. It
covers school feeding, grants to boarding school, etc. It i s currently at K.Sh 37 per pupil. As the primary
education development program i s evolving, there may also be increased resources needed for these
items. However, further analysis needs to be done before any further revamp o f the existing programs.

With total enrollment o f 7.2 million, the budgetary cost o f these payments will be approximatelyK.Sh 9
billion for school year 2003, and K.Sh 6 billion for school year 2004 and 2005. IDA grants will provide
over K.Sh 3 billion inFY04 for school year 2003. The Government has made commitment to provide
K.Sh 8 billion inFY04, to finance the remaining K.Sh 6 billion requirement for teaching and learning
materials, as well as increased operating cost at district level (including strengthening inspection) to
managed the system.

Overall, the allocation o f recurrent cost between salary and non-salary components has changed from
96:4 to 75:25 in year 2003 at primary level. Over the next ten years, the free primary education policy
will require that the proportion o f non-salary expenditure should keep at 20 to 25 percent of the total
recurrent expenditures.

Development Cost Projection.

Using45 pupilsper classroom, the number o f existing classrooms seem to be adequate for the current
enrollment. However, the distribution o f classrooms i s uneven. Usingdistrict-level data, it i s estimated


                                                                -56  -

that 7,000 extra classrooms may need to be built to cater for year 2003 enrollment. Inthe projection
 model, it i s assumed that these 7,000 classrooms are to be built during 5 year period, together with
rehabilitation of 2 percent o f existing classrooms each year.

The unit cost for classroom construction i s estimated at $4,000 per classroom, including sanitary
facilities and basic classroom furniture.

The future cost-sharing relationshipbetween communities and the state for buildingand rehabilitation
investments i s unclear, following the introductiono f FPE. The MOEST circular o f January 8, 2003,
stresses the importance o f making full use o f existing facilities, including double-shift use o f schools
(although it mentions only double shifts for classes 1-3 - where enrollment expansion will be greatest -
when surely the need is to be flexible inusingdouble shiftinginthe most effective way). So far as the
community role inproviding facilities i s concerned, it says "While the Government i s undertaking school
mapping, there i s need to expand the existing facilities". Inthis respect, communities and District
EducationBoards are therefore advised to put an embargo on emergence o f new schools. "The
Government initiative towards free education encourages community initiative as long as there i s
consensus by stakeholders".

The development cost will cover many capacity buildingactivities including setting up a system o f
school-based teacher training program, particularly for the implementation o f the new curriculum. In
addition, the capacities for financial management, education management information system, etc, also
needto be further strengthened. The estimated cost i s $9 million intotal for a 3-year period.

Resource Projection, Financing Gap, and Financial Sustainability.

Usingcurrent level o frecurrent education expenditure as percentage o f GDP, and current recurrent
primary education expenditure as percentage of total education recurrent expenditure as bench mark, the
recurrent resource for primary education i s presented inTable 5. The GDP i s expected to grow at close
to 6 percent according to Kenyan authorities, and Bank macro staff estimates and projections. Strong
economic growth inKenya i s a pre-requisite for the sustainability o f the overall education sector
development financing.

Table 6 summarizescosts andfinancingina IO-yeartime frame. The financinggap is estimatedto be
closed infiscal year 2008. However, it shouldbenotedthat the economic growthrate estimate is quite
optimistic.

For school year 2003, the recurrent financinggap of over US$81million wouldbe financedby the Bank
(28 millionUSD, to be disbursed inJuly) under the FPESP, together with DFID/Swedishsupport (24
millionUSD, to bedisbursedinApril/May), andthe Government's addedresources ($29 million, to be
disbursedinApril/May, Vote 31, underHead844 "PrimaryEducation: AppropriationinAid"). The IDA
grant will also disburse US$14millionto finance the recurrent gap in schoolyear 2004, together with
GOK's addedresources allocatedto "Appropriation inAid" for primaryeducation.

As for the development cost, the FPESPwill provide the Government support with US$9 million
between year 2003 and 2005 to strengthen the systemmanagement capacity at school, district, and
ministry level, and to support the development o f a sector-wide programwith special attention to
disadvantaged areas and demographic groups. Resources for rehabilitation and construction classrooms
will have to be further mobilizedto meet the needs.

                              Annex 6(A): Procurement Arrangements
                       KENYA: Free Primary Education Support Project

Procurement

The last Kenya Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was conducted in 1997. Following
the findingsandrecommendations ofthe CPAR, the Government appliedfor the Bank's support to
implement the recommendations o f the CPAR, and subsequently received from the Bank an IDF grant
which was approved in 1998. Usingthe proceeds o f the grant, the Government started a procurement
reform program. One o f the main outcomes o f the reform program was the establishment and
gazettement inMarch 2001 o f National Public Procurement Regulations, which govern all public
procuring entities including schools, and the production o f standard biddingdocuments for works and
goods. The Public Procurement Regulations allow the Bankprocedures to take precedence over any
contrary provisions inthe national regulations. Therefore there i s no need to specify exceptions in Credit
agreements.

Procurement o f goods and works for all IDA financed components will be carried out inaccordance with
the Bank's Guidelinesfor Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits (January 199.5and revised
in January andAugust 1996, September 1997and January 1999). Consulting services by firm or
individuals financed by IDA will be awarded in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised in September 1977and
January 1999, and May 2002). The appropriate World Bank standard biddingdocuments will be used
for any International Competitive Bidding(ICB), and the World Bank's standard Request for Proposals
(RFP) for the selection o f consultants.

ProcurementPlan.

A procurement plan covering services for the first year o fproject implementationas well as supply o f
instructional materials to schools under the first phase o f grant to schools have beenprepared. The plan
will include relevant information on the services required duringthe first year, as well as the timingo f
each milestone inthe procurement process. The procurement schedule will be updated once every six
months and reviewed by IDA duringsupervision missions.

Advertising.

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be publishedinthe UNDevelopmentBusiness and ina
national newspaper o f wide circulation as provided inthe Guidelines. Specific Procurement Notices
(SPN) will be required for goods and service contracts procured under ICB and NCB, for "Expression o f
Interest" for consultant services contracts exceeding US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000
equivalent for individuals.

To alert publishers and booksellers to prepare themselves for printingand supply o f adequate stocks o f
teaching and learning materials inadvance, the MOEST will publishtwo advertisements in the local
newspapers before the start o f procurement process inJuly 2003 and December 2003. The
advertisements will give information on the total allocated budget for materials, expected commencement
time o f procurement process, and procedure for submission o f quotations to schools by booksellers.

ProcurementImplementation.

Computers and related equipment, services and technical assistance will be procuredcentrally by
MOEST. However, the procurement o f teaching and learning materials will be carried out at school
level. Each school has a School InstructionalMaterials Selection Committee (SIMSC) whose members
are drawn from school teachers, members o fthe School Management Committee (SMC) and parents.
The SIMSC will undertake the procurement process o f textbooks and stationery inthe following
sequence: (i)  selection o f textbooks from the list approved and publishedby MOEST; (ii)        solicitation o f
quotations from localhational booksellers; (iii)   selection o f a bookseller on the basis o f the discount and
level o f service offered to the school, since the maximum prices are pre-set duringthe textbook
evaluation process; (iv) issuance o f an official Order Formto the selected bookseller; and (v) receipt o f
deliveries and cheque payment in favor o f the bookseller through the school bank account.

A new instructionalmaterials vetting and approval system has beenlaunched for new curriculum titles,
which i s designed to be open, transparent, objective and fair. Publishers for the textbooks for the new
curriculum subjects (initially standards 1and 5, now being followed by standards 2 and 6) have
submitted their titles for competitive evaluation and approval for use inKenyan schools on the basis o f
procedures and documentation, which are inline with basic World Bank procurement requirements. The
detailed criteria, methodology and management systems are available and were approved by the World
Bank as part o f the preparation for the STEPS Project. The current evaluation for titles for standards 1
and 5 has been checked by independent verifiers, and the process was givena clean bill o f health.
Minimumphysicalproduction standards, price, conformity to curriculum requirements, presentation,
content, language, tests and exercises are all included inthe evaluation criteria. Full details o f
successfully evaluated and approved titles will be published annually inthe MOEST Approved List o f
Primary Textbooks. This list also contains details o f the maximum permitted retail prices o f every listed
title. A maximum o f six titles will be approved for every subject and grade level. All schools will be
required to select and procure from the titles on this approved list.

For the textbooks relating to the old curriculum, the MOEST has recently contacted all o f the publishers
o f the textbooks inthe "Orange Book" o f approved titles for the old curriculum subjects, and has
requestedthat the maximum prices be reduced for the following reasons: (i)       since the prices for the last
"Orange" Book were agreed, inflation inKenya has been very modest and does not exceed more than 5
percent for the period inquestion; (ii) large increase ininstructional materials funding in2003 and
                                         the
subsequent years will greatly increase print runs, potentially for all titles inthe Orange Book, and this
will reduce unit costs and increasepublishers' margins and profitability; (iii) current Orange Book
                                                                                  the
titles are reprints and will provide immediate benefit to publishers inthe form o f increased margins from
extended print runs; and (iv) schools will be encouraged to form their orders as early as possible for old
curriculum titles for the second and third phases o f fund release during2003 (Le. inJuly and December
2003), so that publishers will have a very good idea o fpotential sales and will thus be able to form print
runs with less risk and uncertainty. Inresponse to the MOEST initiative, most o f the publishers have
reduced the maximum prices o f the textbooks inthe approved list for the old curriculum subjects. It i s
estimated that an average price reduction 5-10% has been achieved, which will significantly improve
school purchasingpower.

Operational guidelines have been sent to all primary schools inApril 2003 covering the following
subjects: (i)basic instructional materials to be provided inall primary schools; (ii)   Government funding
for instructional materials; (iii)purchasing priorities for each installment o f fundrelease; (iv) minimum
stationery supplies for pupils; (v) involvement o f parents and the local community; (vi) fund management
and accountability; (vii) bank accounts; and (viii) other MOEST funding for school runningcosts.

Inconclusion, the existingtextbook procurement system has price and quality competition at three
different levels. There i s competition among publishers to get their titles on the approved list, which
includes price and quality factors. There i s competitionbetween publishers to promote their titles to
schools and to gain school adoptions, which also includes price, quality and service factors. Finally,
there i s competition between booksellers to win supply contracts. Bookseller competition includes price
and service factors.

The Text Management Unit (TMU)within the Policy Formulation & PlanningDivision(PF&P) will be
responsible for allocating and transferring funds to schools for the procurement o f textbooks and
stationery on the basis o f per capita. The Inspectorate Division, School Audit Unit,and District
Education Officers will be incharge o f carrying out other downstream fiduciary responsibilities inthe
procurement cycle.

The Policy Formulation & Planning Division would coordinate the implementation o f the project
activities, including the selection o f consultants and other TA services. One o f the senior officers has
been assigned to be responsible for project administration, reporting and communications, and a
procurement officer who has past experience inBank procurement procedures for the procurement
functions under the project. Although the PF&P have not carried out any selection o f consultants
through the Bank procedures before, the TORSo f the consultancies have beenprepared and the PF&P
staff will be trained as necessary inthe procurement process and procedures.

Goods.

School Grantfor Instructional Materials,

The total cost o f school grant for goods (teaching and learningmaterials) is estimated at about US$41.40
million, which will be released intwo phases: about 70% inthe first phase inJuly 2003, and the balance
inthe second phase o fDecember 2003. Schools will use these funds to procure the teaching and learning
materials through solicitation o f quotations from at least three booksellers. Schools located in remote
areas, which may not be able to get quotations from more than one reputable bookseller may be allowed

Committees.
to procure directly from one bookseller, upon prior clearance o f their respective School Management


Other Goods.

Computer and related equipment estimated at more than $500,000 would be procuredthrough contracts
advertised internationally. The Grant will finance the cost of printingo f distance learningmaterials
through the N C B procedure.

Consultant Services.

IDA will finance capacity activities (consultancy services and training) at an estimated cost o f US$2.66
million. Except as detailed below, consulting services will be selectedthrough competition among
qualified short-listed firms based on Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS).

Consultants for financial audits and other repetitive services estimated to cost less than US$50,000
equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate o f US$200,000 equivalent, will be selected through Least
Cost Selection (LCS) method.




                                                     - 64 -

Inexceptional cases when selection ofconsultantsthrough competitive process is not practicable, the
borrower may, uponprior clearance with the Bank, hire consultants through the single-source selection
method stipulated inparagraphs 3.8-3.1 1of the Guidelines.

Consultants for services meeting the requirements o f Section V of the Consultant Guidelines will be
selected under the provisions for the Selection of Individual Consultants (IC) method. Individual
Consultants will be selected through comparison o fjob description requirements against the
qualifications o f those expressing interest in the assignment or those approached directly.

To ensure that priority i s given to the identification o f suitable and qualified national consultants,
short-list for contracts estimated under US$50,000 equivalent per contract may be comprised entirely o f
national consultants (inaccordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 o f the Consultant Guidelines),
provided that a sufficient number o f qualified firms (at least three) are available. However, if foreign
f i r m s have expressed interest, they will not be excluded from consideration. The Request For Proposals,
as developed by the Bank, will be used for requestingproposals, and for the selection and appointment o f
consultants. Simplified contracts will be usedfor short-term assignments        - simplemissions o f standard
nature (Le,, those not exceeding six months) carried out by individuals consultants or firms.

BankReviews.

Procurement o f IDA-financed consultingcontracts estimated to US$lOO,OOO equivalent or more for firms
and US$50,000 equivalent or more for individual consultants will be subject to prior review by IDA.
However, the first two consultancy contracts, irrespective o f their value will be subject to IDA prior
review. Post reviews of contracts awarded below the above threshold levels will be carriedout
selectively by IDA duringsupervision missions and/or by an independent procurement auditor. Terms o f
Reference (TOR) for all consultancy contracts as well as all single source selections, irrespective o f the
contract value, will be subject to prior review. Also subject to prior review will be the selection o f
publishers o f any additional instructionalmaterials to be included inthe "Approved List o f Primary
School Textbooks and Other Instructional Materials".

Procurement Situation and ProposedCourse of Action. A school-basedprocurement systempiloted
in 1996-1998 under a Governmentmetherlands textbookprogramwas replicatedina follow-up project
jointly supported by the Government and DFID from 2000 to 2002. For the implementation o f the
school-based procurement system, the SIMSC was created to be incharge o f the implementation o f
textbook procurement. The procedures for the school-basedprocurement system are set out in a
Handbook (the Primary School Textbook Management Handbook) published by MOEST in June 1999.
The Handbook i s beingrevisednow to enhance some aspects o f the procurement procedures. SIMSC
members have been trained inall schools inthe school-based procurement system including record
keepingo f procurement documentation.

In2000 and also inMarch 2003, the World Bank Country Office Procurement Specialist has reviewed
the school-based procurement arrangement, with regardto institutional arrangements andprocurement
procedures, and has found it acceptable, subject to minor modifications inthe procedures, which will be
incorporated inthe new edition o f the Primary School Textbook Management Handbook.

Kenya has a strong and active publishers' association (the KPA) with a current membership o f 121
companies. Many o f these companies are small, but there i s a current core o f around 16 educational
publishers with good experience o f textbook publishingfor primary and secondary schools inKenya and
inneighboringcountries. Kenya has also one o fthe best retail bookshop networks inAfrica, with 1,200
registered booksellers covering every district o f the country. Of these booksellers, around 500 are
regularly offered credit status by most textbook publishers. Many booksellers are large enough to be able
to cope with several districts simultaneously. The Kenya Booksellers and Stationers Association

(KBSA) and the Kenya Publishers Association (KPA) are both confident that they can cope with supply
to all schools via the local book trade. Booksellers compete fiercely with each other for school supply
contracts on the basis o f both discounts and standards o f service as prices o f textbooks are pre-set by the
publishers and constitute an element o f the evaluation criteria inthe prequalification o fpublishers.

The only aspects inthe procurement arrangement that need some strengthening are enhancement of the
procurement procedures inthe Primary School InstructionalMaterial Management Handbook. The main
weakness inthe current system i s that, insome schools, the head teachers personally contact and solicit
quotations from booksellers, instead o f having the SIMSCs send out Requests For Quotations to
booksellers. There i s therefore a concern that head teachers may selectively contact booksellers o f their
choice. The audit reports carried out by PriceWaterhouseCoopers under the DFIDprogram also reported
such cases. To eliminate this practice, the SIMSCs will invite quotations inwriting from as many
booksellers as possible and booksellers will be requiredto submit their quotations inwriting in sealed
envelopes. These practices are being included inthe Primary School Textbook Management Handbook
which i s currently under revision. The order form does not contain any terms o f delivery, acceptance o f
the deliveries, or provision for replacement o fmaterials that may get damagedbefore their acceptance by
the school or transport arrangements. However, all o f these issues are addressed inthe Primary School
Textbook Management Handbook and are also covered by the formal signed contract between school and
selected supplier. The order form i s therefore being revisedaccordingly. Regardingthat a consulting
services contract has beenapproved for project preparation under the Norwegian Education Trust Fund.
The consultant (PriceWaterhouseCoopers) i s now helping to manage the roll-out o f a uniform accounting
system for public primary schools, and i s also providing associated training. Inaddition, operational
guidelines have been distributedto all SIMSCs to help them intheir work. A major district, zone and
school training program will be launched inMay and completed in June. Every school inreceipt o f
funds will receive intensive training inthe new procedures and requirements.

MOEST has appointed a Project Coordinator and a procurement officer who has some practice
knowledge in Bank procurement procedures. The Government and IDA have agreed that the
procurement officer to work closely with the Country Office Procurement Specialist as additional
hands-on training. IDA has strongly recommended that the procurement officer be sent to the training
courses organized by the regional training institute, such as ESAMI and GIMPA, at the earliest possible
opportunity.

1. Summary ofthe FinancialManagement Assessment

Inrecent years, significant improvements inpublic sector accounting andreportinghave beenachieved,
particularly with regard to flow o f donor funds. However further reforms are necessary to improve on
efficiency and effectiveness inthe system and consolidate on the gains achieved so far. Most notably,
the annual Government Financial Statements (Accounts) have beenproducedwithin the statutory period
o f four months after the end o f the financial year and submitted to the Controller and Auditor General for
audit purposes. Nevertheless, recent assessmentsundertaken by Government jointly with development
partners, such as the Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) that was carried out by IDA
with support o fDFIDand incollaborationwith the Government, identified a number o f areas that needed
to be strengthened to enhance sound financial management practices, and ensure audit reports on the
accounts was prepared in a timely manner. Inadequate financial accounting and auditing systems both at
the central government and local government level, inthe districts pose a major challenge. Its gratifying
to note that some o f the reforms inthis area are already on track, especially inthe area o f legislation and
capacity buildinginitiatives to ensure that standard o f government accountingi s improved. The MOEST,
unlike other ministries, has in addition to having an Internal Audit outfit a specialized and unique School
Audit Unit,which looks into financial matters at school level at various administrative levels.

(a) Project Development Objective.

The project development objective is to help the Government respond to the needs and challenges
brought about by the policy decision o f FPEfor all. This operation is basically a scaling-up o f the
ongoing textbook project that has been supported by DFIDfor the last several years. It i s envisaged that
the project will assist Kenyanchildrento attendprimary school for quality education without having to
pay any school levies. This operation will enable many o f the school going aged children who were out
of the formal school system to return back to school. As a result, the enrollment rate inpublic primary
schools has substantially increased, thus outmatching the available facilities for learning inmost public
schools across the country. The development objective and the implementation objectives are clearly
articulated in the project appraisal document (Annex 1).
(b) Key Performance Indicators for the Financial Management System.

Progress inachievingthe objectives o f the financial management system under the project will be
measuredby: (i)   the timeliness o f obtaining AIE and actual donor funds cash flow from the Project
Special Account by the Treasury through the MOEST's Development Account with the Central Bank o f
Kenya for financing the textbooks and other instructional materials voted for inthe budget in July 2003
and later inthe subsequent releases from the exchequer; (ii) number o f days that the Textbook
                                                               the
Management Unit (TMU) inMOEST takes to meet its financial obligations to schools and the other third
parties doing business with the schools under the project; (iii) timeliness and compliance with
                                                                 the
statutory financial reporting to Government and IDA; and (iv) timely and effective follow up of audit
queries and issues raisedby the School Audit Unit and the Ministry's own auditor or IDA missions
following their review and verification o f financial records and transactions.

 The objectives o f the project's financial management system are: (i) ensure that funds are used only
                                                                        to

 recorded; (iii)to enable the project's senior management to monitor the efficient implementationo f
 policies as set by the Board; and (iv) to safeguard the project assets and resources.

 The following are necessary features o f a strong financial management system: (i)   the TMUshouldhave
 an adequate number and mix o f skilled and experienced staff, under the leadership and guidance o f a
 Project Coordinator; (ii)the internal control system should ensure the conduct o f an orderly and efficient
 payment and procurement process, and proper recording and safeguarding of assets and resources; (iii)
 the accounting system should support the project's requests for fundingand meet its reporting obligations
 to fundproviders including the Government, IDA, other donors, and private sector institutions that may
 provide support to the center; (iv) the system should be capable o f providing financial information and
 data to measure performance and link it to outputs; and (v) an independent, qualified auditor should be
 appointed to review the project's financial statements and internal controls.

after Grant effectiveness. The second phase o f IDA'scontribution amountingto U S 1 2 million i s
expected to be releasedinDecember 2003. The total o f U S 4 1 million equivalent amount in Kenya
Shillings should therefore be availed through the budgetary allocation in FY 2004 infor disbursement
and transmission to schools immediatelywhen the grant i s declared effective. Already, a mechanism o f
Electronic FundsTransfer (EFT) used inthe GOWDFID ongoing SPRED 3 project exists for this
purpose. The TMU has a form o f computerized schedule providing all the needed information to
facilitate EFT by the commercialbank to the individual school textbook accounts. The schedules are
based on the agreed norm for school enrollment and per capita allocation to ensure equity and fair play.
The down side o f this arrangement has been the highmaintenance cost o f the textbook accounts at
individual school level inform o f bank changes. This has had a negative impact to the extent that some
o f the accounts have ended upbeingclosed after consuming residue amounts inthe accounts, and
eventually being closed for being dormant for a long period. Dialogue with the commercial banks are
likely to be involved inthe program and has beenheld with the MOEST with a view to exempt the
school textbook accounts from normal rate o f bank charges. However, it will be important for this
understanding reached between the commercialbanks and MOEST to be formally signed:

Inaddition to these, eachpublic primary school will be expected to operate its existing individual
textbook account, or open an individual textbook account, with the commercial bank that i s nearest to the
school to keep operational costs as low as possible. Funds for instructional materials from IDA and the
Government (as its contribution for instructional materials) would be credited inthe textbook accounts
and safeguarded by the school head teacher and other administrative staff.

Separate school general operational bank accounts will have to be revived(ifclosed or dormant) for
expenditures relating to items other than instructional materials. These funds will be for the purposes o f
financing sanitation infrastructure rehabilitation and development, and the storage o f books, as well as
for other specified expenditures to be detailed inthe general guidelines from MOEST. Reports presented
by consultants to DFID indicate that these accounts have inthe past and untilnow have been less
controlled and satisfactory. The analysis indicate that MOEST did not provide guidance on how these
accounts should run,nor didthe ministryrequire any financial discipline to be observed intheir
management, perhaps because they were not meant to receive funding from government, but rather
fundingraised from levies collectedfrom parents. Due to weak governance on the part o f parents
through school committees, and low capacity and lack o f guidance from MOEST, the head teachers and
other officials as well as opinion leaders in the locality, often mismanaged the funds to the detriment o f
the school children who have had to do with substandard learning facilities and environment.

The schools will therefore maintain two accounts: one for instructional materials and another for other
school expenditures. Indue course, it is planned for these two accounts to be merged and for all the


                                                    - 74 -

  school funds to be maintained ina single school bank account and managed through a simplified ledger
  based book keeping system at school level. That would only be done, however, when there i s confidence
  that the general school accounts are managed as efficiently as the existing accounts for textbooks and
  instructional materials. Meanwhile, the MOEST's Inspectorate and School Audit Unit, incollaboration
  with PriceWaterhouseCoopers (consultant), are initiating training sessions that will help create and
  sustain an adequate capacity at all public primary schools. Participatingdonors have agreed to support
  this very ambitious programinthe next few weeks.

  2. Audit Arrangements

(a) ExternalAuditing.

MOEST will be responsible for the preparation o f the Project Financial Statements (accounts) and submit
to the contracted Auditor who shall report to the Office o f the Controller and Auditor General, in
accordance with the Law (Exchequer and Audit Act Cap. 412 o f the Laws o f Kenya). Duringthe first year
o f the project, there shall be semi-annual audits for period July to December 2003 for which the audit
report will be due inJanuary 2004 and for period January to June 2004 for which the audit will be due in
December 2004. Inview o f the regular audit by School Audit Unit o f MOEST, the Bank will heavily rely
on the Unit's reports which should also be made available to the external auditor. The due date for the
audited financial statements to the World Bank (and so other donors) shall be not later than December
3lth, each year, being six months after the end o f the financial year to which the statements relate.

(b) Internal Audits.

The Ministryo f Finance has a department o f Internal Auditors, who are assigned to ministries, departments
and districts. Inaddition, the MOEST has its own in-house specialized School Audit Unit,whose role i s to
visit and audit operations inpublic schools, both at primary and secondary levels (as well as inother
tertiary public institutions, except the universities). However, the internal auditors also add value inthe
audit o f the program at the MOEST level. This type o f audit has mainly been directedto the pre-payment
verification o f transactions and has not had any added value with regard to systems review and strategic
approach to ministries ina holistic perspective. Even where an attempt has been made to do this, it has
been a narrow focus on financial accounting and not financial management which i s a much broader
vision.

 3. DisbursementArrangements

  (a) Accountabilityand FinancialManagementArrangementat the SchoolLevel.

 Each registered primary school will have a text book dedicated bank account managed and operated by
 the school head and school management committee. Each school will receive a sum o f K.Sh 350.0 per
 pupilcomposed of IDA'S90% contribution (US$4.1) and GOK's 10% counterpart fundingo f K.Sh 35.0
 per child (US$0.45) for the Instructional material i.e. component 1 for the period July to September 2003.
 Subsequently, the same schools will receive another amount of funding comprising o f IDA'S 90% total o f
 US$12.3 million and GOK's 10% total o f US$1.36 million for the period October to December 2003.
 This is equivalent to a total amount o f K.Sh 150per pupil.

 As per the designo fthe project, instructional material will be procured from local book suppliers. The
 selection process o f the required instructional material will be made by the school parent and teacher
 committee (text book selection committee). The payment for the merchandise will be made through



                                                       -75 -

Banker's check based on instructions that the commercialbank holding the text book account will have
receivedfrom the school. Inessence, the schools will not handle any liquidcash directly.

Accountability will be evidenced by three documents which each school will submit through the District
Education Officers to the Ministry HQ. It i s the responsibility o f the MOEST HQmanagement to ensure
that all school heads and their respective District EducationOfficers comply with the reporting
requirements, which will also be especially emphasizedinthe guidelines that the MOEST (TMU) i s
issuingto the schools. This will also be particularly focused inthe training now taking place shortly for
the school heads and the school management committees as well as the District Education Officers. The
three documents are:

1. Delivery note duly signed by the school head or a representative signifyingreceipt o f the instructional
material inquantities and specification ordered;

2. Invoice issued by the merchant, i.e. local book supplier based on the order received from the school
and actually delivered; and

3. A copy o f the 'Request for Banker's Check' with name o f payee and amount, as well as purpose based
on instructions, issued by the school to its banker.

The school head will also submit a cover statement indicatingthe amount received, amount expended,
and any amount o f balance still held inthe bank account. A bank reconciliationand bank statements will
subsequently be submitted to the MOEST H Q at the end o f each quarter. Any adjustment for bank
charges and incidental deposits will form part o f the bank reconciliation and should be fully explained in
each case.

Subsequent FMRs will be expected to provide all the reported consolidated expenditures and indicate any
arising variances, which should be fully explained. FMRs should be submitted to the IDA within 45 days
following the end o f the quarter for which the expenditure relate. Agreement has been reached with the
Treasury and MOEST, that the authorized representatives for signingFMRs for the Recipient will be
officials of MOEST, and that FMRs will be submitted directly by MOEST to the IDA with a copy sent to
Treasury (External Resources Department) for the record. Similarly, the detailed formats o f the FMRs,
which should be as simple as possible, have been agreed at negotiations and accepted by LOA.

Monitoringo f the school operations will be executed by the School Audit Unit and the Inspectorate
Department o f the MOEST, which are being appropriately strengthened as detailed inthe Capacity
Buildingcomponent. The two Unitswill visit individual schools periodically to verify indetailhow the
schools processed the procurement o f instructional material and payment transaction, i.e. the compliance
aspect and also checking on governance inthe process. Their reports and findings will be shared with the
external independent private auditor, who on the basis o f these reports will identify and constitute an
audit sample for physical visit/verification o f the process, as well as verify the physical existence o f the
material.

The MOEST Finance Department will also receive the same reports and on the basis o f that, inits own
right,determine which schools to sample for its periodic visit from time to time. Any wanting
observations made will be fully documented and addressed by the MOEST in a reasonable manner.

(b) CounterpartFunds.

The Government will provide counterpart funds in the agreed percentage. Under the Government/DFID


                                                     - 76 -

supported SPRED 3, the original agreement requiredthe Government to make an equal contributionto
the textbook programto trigger DFID's funding. There has been an agreed migration from the
arrangement to a new approach whereby the Government's contribution will be at a much lower level (10
percent o f the cost o f the instructional materials and a similar proportion for other goods and incremental
operating costs). The initial deposit o f US$3.3 million by the Government into the Project Account will
be a condition o fproject effectiveness. Once these funds are at the TMU`s disposal, they will be subject
to the same transfer mechanismto individual schools inaccordance with the schedules issued by TMU
the total counterpart fund contribution from the Government i s US$5.O million.

(c) Assessment of FinancialPerformance of the Accounting Unit in MOEST.

The operations inthe Accounting Unit inMOEST has been found to meet the minimumrequirement o f
OP.BP 10.02 and can be expected to provide reliable and timely financial information and data on the
project, and also provide a basis for preparation o f financial reports in a reasonable and timely manner.
The accounting basis i s `cash based' which i s normal inmost government accounting systems. The
financial period i s from July through June, and annual financial statements (accounts) are by statute
required to be submitted to the Controller and Auditor General not later than October 30th, each year.
The accounting system i s substantially manual, and although its highly cumbersome and inefficient, it i s
nevertheless complete and provides a clear audit trail. The ledger accounting for all ministries are
incidentally centrally processed, on the basis o f the chart o f accounts and uniform coding designed by
Treasury and adopted across all the ministries and departments. The same codes are used inBudgetary
allocations and execution, for ease in and objective o f budgetary control. Vote books at the ministry
level are used as the key tool for budgetary control to help management monitor budget execution.
However, inview o f the fact that these systems are substantially manual, the risk o f error i s quite high,
and these may take a long time to be detected and resolved. Payment procedures are systematic and
adequate inthe circumstances. Internal control measures are physical and numerous. These are
employed in excess o f what would otherwise suffice inan modernizedsystem, thus renderingthe system
inefficient. Internal audit staff are basically directed and managed centrally from Treasury where the
department i s anchored. Untilrecently, the internal auditors were simply providing an additional control
comfort inthe pre-payment audit o f all transactions inthe ministryand all districts. Apparently, very
little emphasis i s given to the concept o f revenue or income, either inthe form o f subventions or income
from provisions o f services (Appropriation InAid). Project financial records are part and parcel o f
department's books o f accounts. However, the department has been advised to maintain the project
transactions separately from the rest o f the operations and ensure data and information i s also separately
kept safely for easy review and auditing.

The MOEST's Accounting Unithas an external funds (donor) section that has been designated to manage
the financial transactions o fdonor-assistedprojects. Staff at different levels o f seniorityhavebeen
assigned to the section. The Head o f the Accounting Unithas oversight function over the section, while
the Chief Finance Officer (financial controller) inthe Ministryi s responsible for the management o f the
entire finance and accountingdepartment inthe Ministry, and reports to the Accounting Officer
(Permanent Secretary) administratively and to Treasury for a technical and professional purposes (matrix
management). The Finance and Accounting Department will be responsible for the consolidationo f all
expenditure reports received from districts through the District Education Officers. The department will
also have responsibility o f preparingthe FMRs for submission to the World Bank directly from MOEST
as agreed with Treasury (Em). The capacity o f the department will also be enhanced through training
and exposure beingplanned for implementationby MOEST incollaboration with PWC under their
training consultancy.

The Finance and Accounting department inMOEST shall maintainthe following books o f accounts: (i)
Cash book; (ii)  Journal; (iii)General Ledger and subsidiary ledgers; (iv) Abstracts; (v) Asset registers;
and (vi) Vote Book.

At each individual public primary school level, subsidiary books o f accounts basedon simplified ledger
system will be maintainedfor budget heads as provided by MOEST guidance to schools. All funds
regardless o f the source o f fundingmust be appropriately accounted for and reported for audit. The
MOEST's School Audit Unit must play its watchdog role effectively to ensure all schools are visited at
least once inthe life o f the project and preferably annually where staff and resources permit.

(g) Reporting.

The Regulations require every department or ministryinthe Government to produce statements o f final
accounts within four months from the end o f each financial year and provides formats and schedules to
guide the preparation o f these accounts. The Accounting Officer i s accountable for this and i s required
to submit the accounts to the Controller and Auditor General not later than October 31th each year (in
this case the contracted Auditor). According to InternationalPublic Sector Accounting Standards, inthis
case the Accounting Officer in MOEST shall be responsible for the preparation o f the annual project
financial statements and submission o f the same to the Auditor. The MOEST i s advised to constitute an
Audit Committee to help it manage the audit process and beproactive inpreventingany delays inthe
audit.

 Special account:
Prior to the Grant becoming effective, the Special Account will be opened ina commercial bank o f the
Recipient`s choice, and which will be managedby the Treasury through Central Bank o f Kenya. The
size o f the Special Account has been agreed at US$29.0 million for the first three months, which i s
expected to be scaled down inthe later part o f the project life, since the amount required will be fairly
small (less than US$4.0 million). MOEST will trigger the flow o f Grant proceed to the Special Account
as soon as effectiveness has declared, by submittingto the Bank, through Treasury, a Withdrawal
Application (Form 1903B) requesting deposit o f US$29 million into the Special Account covering
expenditures for the first three months. The amount i s based on the first Financial MonitoringReport
(FMR)providinga cash forecast projectionfor the different activities to be undertaken duringthe first
three months o f the project.

The next release by the Bank for the second Phase activities amount to US$12.7 million and will be made
inNovembedDecember2003 when the Government second contributiono fUS$1.4 millioncovering its
share for the second Phase activities have been deposited into the Project Account. This release will be
based on the next FMR from MOEST covering October to December. The report will be preparedby
MOEST based on expenditure accounted for by the individual schools through the District Education
Officers (DEOs) for the period July to September 2003. MOEST will consolidate the expenditure returns
and reflect the aggregate inthe FMR. The accountability documents expected from the schools include:
suppliers' invoice, delivery notes as evidence o f receipt o f goods, and a copy o f a duly signed and
stamped payment instruction from the Head Teacher to the respective commercial bank requesting
issuance o f a banker's check (inthe name o f the supplier). Bank statements from the commercial banks
holding textbook accounts will also be obtained and made available to the World Bank (ifneed be). The
expenditure returns and accountability documents for the first three months should be submitted by
schools through the DEOsto MOEST by no later than October 15th. MOEST would then prepare the
next FMR together with Form 1903B and submit directly to the Bank as agreed with Treasury (ERD),
within the 45 days time limit following the end o fthe periodbeing covered inthe FMR.

MainSector Issues and Government Strategy
       The Government's main cancern has been the deterioration in the
education sector, which has witnessed the loss of gains and achievements of
the first tGV0 decades of independence. Primary educatian's Gross Enrolment
Rate (GER), which increased from 50% in 1963 to 105% in 1989, dropped
slgnlficantiy through the 1990s to 88% in 2000,
secondary education GER dropped from 29% to 23%. This situation was
                                                      During the same period,

largely attributed to increasingcosts of education,arising from a broad-based
school cuniculum and cost-sharing inthe provisionof ~            ~as weltuas the ~   a  ~
poor state of economy, with 56% of the population living &low the poverty
tine.

       In order to achieve optimal utffizatbn of fmources, specific poli~ies
geared towards mst containmentwill continue to be pursued. Inparticular,the
Govemmsntwill continue to deepen the medium term expendStrrre framework
and financial reforms already in place. At the sectoral level, the Government
has adopted policles and straitegiss that focus on resolving some of the cost
constraintsandfinancing Inorder tcr enhance internaleffjciency.

       The broadabased school curriculum that escalated %e cost of
educational facilitles, Instructional materials and teacher numbers has been
revised to reduce the number of taught and examinable subjects. The
curriculum content. has trlw been rationalized to focus on am skiiIs. The
revised curriculum is being implemented In four phases aver the next four
years starting frcom 2003. The introduction of free primary education has
relieved households of the direct cost burden of financing education. The
Govemment will besides meeting teacher casts, provide per capita grants
direct tu schools, to cater fur instructlanal matenaki, faclllties, maintenance,
improvement, ea-curricular activities and salaries for essential non-teaching
Staff"

       The Govemment will enhance tbe intsmal eiffideency of the system by
reducing thehe cast of providing education and Increasing public expenditures
on non-salary costs.This will be achievedthroughthe supply of textbooks and
other teaching! learning materials. Effartswill continue to be made to contain
the high percentage of public expenditurealiwated to the teacher wage bill at
the expense of aperations and maintenance with a view to releasing
resourcesto other critical areas,

       The inbodur;ticln of free primary education has already raised the
 teacher pupil ratio from f:32 to 1:40. The Government will endeavor to
 sustain this higher ratio and the recently introduced multi-shift and mutti-grade
 teaching approaches to improve teacher utilization, The Government is also

undertaking equitable deployment and r~~~~~~~~~~ of teachers in order to
reduce teacher demands, In addition, the Teachers Service Cammlssion
(TSG) has decentralized s ~ m eof its functions and will embark on further
decentralization of teacher managemant and deployment function to thf3

        The Government is aware of the Impact of the HIVIAIDS pandemic and
has adopted a multi-sectoral approach to control Its spread, In the aducaaon
S ~ G @ X .
          an AIDS Control Unit has been sstabliahed w'itfiin the Ministry of
Education to help hirild the capacity of bathstudents and staff to des1with this
national disaster. The thrust of the unit`s activities is change of attitude

towards HIVIAIDS and to help dewlop mping skills for tmth the infected and
the affected. The HIV/AlDS Education materials and curriculum being used in
schools are geared towards increasing awareness and inducing behaviour
changs, The Ministry has in addition embarked on the development of a
sector specific policyon HIVIAIRS.

      The New Free Primary Education initiative Is intended tu also enhance
squ'hy hence nota resource8 are being availed for affirmative action. For

children in the Arid and Semi Atid {ASAL) Districts, childrm with dfsabllities
Bxample, Kshs. 100 million has been set aside during this finandat year far

and those in other special circumstances, such as In non-formal schclols and

support for the School Feeding Programme$and re50urce allscation for Cow
Cost BoardingSG~CJQ~S   in ASAL I=ristricts.

      The Government will also ensure that the quantitative gfowth brought
about by the Free Primary Educationinitiatjvs does nut compromisequality. In
the current Fiscal year, therefore, Kshs. 400 million has been set aside
spedflcally for cqmcity building to strengthen moniturfng and evaluation by

      Additional Annex 13:The Kenyan Publishing, Bookselling and Printing Sector
                        KENYA: Free Primary Education Support Project

Despite the numerous problems faced by the Kenyan book trade over the past 35 years, it has been
traditionally one o f the strongest book trades inAfrica. In2003, Kenyaprobably ranks number two or
three inAfrica after the Republic o f South Africa (RSA) interms o f total book turnover. Recent trade
statistics suggest that Kenya i s also currently the second largest book exporter inAfrica, once again after
the RSA. Interms o f professional educational publishingskills and retail bookseller market coverage, it
probably rivals even the RSA book trade. Kenya also has a developed printing sector and is capable o f
good quality output, in line with the minimumstandards of production specified for new curriculum
textbooks.

1. Kenyan Educational Publishing.

Kenya has a strong and active publishers' association (the KPA), with a current membership o f around
120 companies. Many o f these companies are small, but there i s a current core o f educational publishers
with good experience o f textbook publishingfor primary and secondary schools inKenya and in
neighboring countries, often indifficult market conditions. The main educational publishers (all o f

At present, the Kenyanpublishingindustryprovides multiple locally published and competing titles inall
subjects and at all levels o f primary education, and increasingly at the junior and even senior secondary
levels as well. The `core' companies also have access to reasonable financial resources and are capable
of financing at least the development costs o f the new textbooks required by the new rationalized
curriculum. Many have close, traditional contacts with overseas textbook publishers (mostly inthe UK,
butmore recently with the RSA), which enable them to access professional(and sometimes financial)
support as and when required. There is, in addition, a group o f smaller publishers who are keen to break
into the key school textbook market and who could compete inat least one or two subjects at both
primary and secondary level.

The likely requirement for working capital created by the Free Primary Education Support Project
(FPESP) has been discussed with the KPA. Some companies probably have the necessary working
capital resources to handle the requirements without recourse to the banks. The commercial banks are
willing to discuss the working capitalneeds o fpublishers, and all o f the major publishers are convinced
that they can access the necessary short-term financial support from their banks or other sources. As an
indicator, an instructionalmaterials support budget o f US$65 million in2003 provided by donors and the
Government would require an approximate total o f about US$16 million inworking capital to support the
costs o f raw materials and printingspread over 16 publishers. Inaddition, there would be an additional
all-up extended credit cost o f around US$50 million to support credit facilities to local booksellers. This
US$50 million credit requirement for bookselling would be spread over the 16 major publishers and
perhaps 1,000 local booksellers. With the financial support to FPESP staggered into three separate
disbursements inApril 2003, July 2003 and December 2003, as proposed, the working capital
requirement would be reduced and thus the demands for local financing would be eased.

The main educational publishers vary from the state-owned (but no longer state subsidized or state
favored) Jomo Kenyatta Foundation(JKF) and the Kenya Literature Bureau (KLB), to 100 percent
owned local subsidiaries o f overseas companies such as Macmillan Kenya. Inbetween there are large
100 percent Kenyan-owned educational publishers (Longhorn, East African Educational Publishers, etc),
medium-sized Kenyan-ownedpublishers (Dhillons), to local branches o f overseas university publishing
houses (OUP). Some overseas publishers who previously sold out their Kenyan companies to local
ownership and left the Kenyan educational market (e.g. Longman) are now planning to re-enter the
Kenyan educational market. It should be noted that the private sector publishers no longer fear the
possibility o f distorted competition from JKF or KLB. Both o f the state-owned companies are now fill
members o f the KPA, and the K P A i s now the firmly established representative organizationfor all
significant Kenyanpublishers. It i s now accepted that JKF and KLB have to compete on equal terms
with private sector publishers, and that the market can no longer be riggedinfavor of the state owned
companies. It i s also accepted that the two parastatals are no longer inreceipt o f financial subsidies from
government, which might distort the market.

Insummary, the Kenyanpublishingindustryhas the capacity, professional expertise, marketing
knowledge, financial strength, corporate diversity and external contacts to handle the development of a
new generation o f instructionalmaterials to support a new curriculum at both primary and secondary
level. It i s competitive and can provide a range of good quality textbooks for the KIE to evaluate and
approve and from which schools can make their choices. However, the new minimumstandards for
textbooks established by the KIE/MOEST probably will requiresome adjustment time from the
publishers.

2. Kenvan Educational Book Selling.

There are over 1,200 registered and operational booksellers inKenya, providing market coverage for
almost the entire country. Of the registered booksellers, approximately 500 are reportedto enjoy active
credit facilities offered by publishers. Other booksellers can achieve effective credit by the use o f a
system o f post-dated cheques. Most o f the booksellers also handle stationery as well. Inaddition, there
are large `stationery only' suppliers inNairobi, Mombasa and the other main towns. The working capital
required in order to support the FPESP distribution and supply schedule i s large and inexcess o f any
previous book trade working capital requirement inKenya, but the requirement would be spread over a
large number o f retailers and wholesalers. The combination o f bookseller finds, bank support,
publishers' extended credit, post-dated cheques and staggered disbursements should enable the projected
financing requirements to be met.



                                                    - 95 -

The representative body o f local book selling is the Kenya Booksellers and Stationers Association
(KBSA). Relationships between the K P A and the KBSA are generally good and there i s active
cooperation between the two associations intheir approach to the market potential o f a unified, national,
textbook provision system. The KPA, for example, fully supports the principle o f supplyingall schools
only through booksellers, rather than supplyingschools direct from the publishers and incompetition
with the booksellers. 352 booksellers are currently inactive membership o f the KBSA, and they are
divided into 8 regional chapters covering the whole o f Kenya. The KBSA does not have a current list of
its members organized by district, but it i s planningto develop a comprehensive list o f both member and
non-member booksellers inthe near future. The 1,200 Kenyan booksellers provide virtually 100 percent
coverage o f the 72 school districts inKenya. The KBSA confirms that there active booksellers inevery
district inKenya with the exception o f Moyale, Turkana, Elgeyo Marakwet and Ijara. Schools inMoyale
District, for example, are supplied via booksellers from the neighboring district o f Marsabit, and schools
inElgeyo Marakwet are supplied from Kitale. Although few innumber, there are establishedbooksellers
indifficult and remote districts suchas Garissa, Wajir, Manderaandeven Hola, which is aparticularly
difficult district to supply because it i s a security area with a very highproportion o f nomads.

Almost every district has at least some level o f bookseller competition and most districts have
considerable numbers o f competingbooksellers. Over the past two years, Government and DFIDfunds
have been channeled to every one o f the 72 districts and the commercial book trade has managed to
supply every school inevery district -even inthe most remote areas. Some booksellers specialize in
remote and nomadic schools by agreeing in advance specific times and locations to collect orders, effect
deliveries and collect payment.

There i s active competition between districts, as well as within districts. Thus, schools inIsiolo, for
example, will be approached notjust by booksellers from Isiolo, but also by booksellers from Mero,
Nanyuki and even booksellers from as far away as Nakuru. Nairobi-based booksellers are particularly
active in other districts, and this tendency i s expected to increase with the additional funds coming on
stream from the FPE program. Inthe past, districts with few booksellers have sometimes runsupply
tenders. The KBSA does not believe that these tenders demonstrated any significant malpractice,
perhaps because o f the low commercial value o f the orders given the limited number o f schools inthe
difficult access districts. The KBSA thinks that past tenders have assisted inthe development o f viable
supply chains, and that commercial bookselling should be able to function inthe future without
tendering. The KBSA i s confident that local booksellers can provide the national coverage required by
the current Government primary textbook policy and the large-scale financial support to FPE. Perhaps
more importantly, the Kenyan publishers also believe that the booksellers can cope with the demands of
competitively supplyingthe book and stationery needs o f almost 18,000 primary schools every year.

There i s obviously a very wide variance inKenyanbookselling betweenvery large, well-established and
well-financed companies with very strong credit records (e.g. Text Book Centre inNairobi) and small
rural booksellers. Nevertheless, most well established publishersmaintain trading accounts with a
significant number o f district level booksellers, even inrural and remote locations. Regular customers
are supplied at 20-25 percent discounts o f f retail prices and are provided with 30 and occasionally 60
days o f credit facilities. New booksellers are usually only supplied on a cash basis untilthey have proved
themselves to be satisfactory credit risks. There are certainly credit risks in supplyingbooksellers in
Kenya, but most Kenyan publishers are confident that they can handle these risks. Kenyan publishers
reported a strong growth o f new accounts inthe areas covered by the Government/Dutch pilot project and
the more recent Govemment/DFID SPRED 3 project. Many o f the new booksellers that sprang up inthe
wake o f the initialpilot textbook project have now become established credit accounts with publishers.




                                                       - 96 -

The evaluations o f the Government/Dutch/ pilot project and the PriceWaterhouseCoopers evaluation o f
the SPRED 3 decentralized procurements bothnotedthe energy, competitiveness and efficiency of a
majority o f the book retailers inrural areas. The principles and practices o f `substitution' are well
established inKenya. Thus, if a school has ordered titles, which are out o f stock or not otherwise
available, booksellers will offer the schools alternative titles from the approved book list. This i s a
normal part o f free market supply inany liberalizedbook trade anywhere in the world. The Instructional
Materials Management Handbook contains specific guidelines to schools on substitutions. Schools are
advised to contact publishers by telephone to check on availability ifthey believe that they are being
deliberately guided towards alternative titles by booksellers.

At present, therefore, Kenyanbooksellers exist inlarge numbers andprovide very wide national
coverage. There are many book retailers with much practical experience o f primary and secondary
textbook supply and there is good evidence o f very strong competition between booksellers for existing
school supply contracts throughout the country. The larger Nairobi basedbooksellers provide effective
wholesaling services for smaller booksellers who may find it difficult to handle individual publisher
accounts. The 1998 Government National Textbook Policy and the advent o f a unified financing system
for textbooks and other instructional materials, &strong support from the KPA, provides a very
encouraging environment for the growth and development o f book wholesaling and retailing inKenya.
There i s good reason to believe, therefore, that there i s good and adequate book retailing capacity in
Kenya to support the proposed procurement methodology o f competitive national shopping.

3. Kenyan Book and Stationery Printinv.

Kenya has one o f the most highly developed print sectors in sub-Saharan Africa. Book printing, in
particular, has been well established inNairobi over the last 45 years, and acts as a graphics power-house
for the whole o f East Africa, including Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia, the Congo, Rwanda and beyond.
Book printingi s mainly based inNairobi with 11substantial book printers, plus one or two medium sized
companies inMombasa, and innumerable smaller general printers inboth centers. Due to difficult
trading conditions, many printershave had to lay o f f staff, but currently they still employ from 35 to 125
permanent staff inthe larger companies, with at least twice as many available on call. The main book
printers are the following:

e       Acme Press
e       Bizone
e       Colour Print
e       EnglishPress
e       Fotofom
e       Jomo Kenyatta Foundation
e       Kenya Literature Bureau
e       Kenya Litho
0       Printing Industries
e       Printpak
e       Sun Litho

Two o f these, the Jomo Kenyatta Foundation (JKF) and the Kenya Literature Bureau (KLB) are
parastatal publishedprinters, who specialize inprimary and secondary books respectively, but compete
on equal terms with the private publishingsector.

The last few years have been lean ones for the industryas a whole, reflected ina combined turnover last


                                                     - 97 -

year for the above printerso f less than $20 million. Their capacity would indicate a potential turnover
closer to ten times that figure. However, it has become a resilient industryand several companies have
diversified into the growing packaging sector, installing gravure, flexographic and other specialized
equipment for making and printingplastic containers, cartons and labels. Inaddition to a lack o f orders,
printershave to face: (i)    comparatively highenergy costs (approximately US$O.11cents per KWh
compared with US$0.025 cents per KWhin South Africa); (ii)          variable quality and inconsistent supplies
o f materials from Kenya's state-owned Pan African Paper Mills; (iii) percent import duty on all
                                                                           35
materials not destined for school books (VAT i s still payable on these, but may not be returnedby the
government for nine or more months); and (iv) highbank interest rates for loans o f up to 18 percent
annually.

The capacity o f individual printersto handle the production o f primary school textbooks varies greatly
according to the age and type o f equipment they have. Some are specifically equipped for highspeed
color work with modern sheet or web presses. Others have older machines and make greater use of
semi-automatic equipment with correspondingly lower output levels. Although currently runningsingle
shifts o f eight hours, five days a week, most are able to move quickly to two x 12 hour shifts, six days a
week when required.

The essential capacity o f a printer i s dependent, not so much on the printingpresses, which can runat
speeds o f up to 15,000 sheets per hour, but on the capacity and speed o f the bindingequipment. This i s
the bottleneck inthe book productionprocess, not only inKenya, but inmost printers around the world,
unless they have bindingmachinery dedicated to highspeed book production. The bindingprocesses are
particularly important in school book productionbecause effective bindingi s a critical factor inthe
durability and extended book life, and this, inturn, i s a critical cost reduction factor which i s directly
related to the costs o f a sustainable system o f materials provision. The calculation o f book production
capacity inKenya is, therefore, based on the ability to sew and wire saddle-stitch books to the required
level o f quality and durability. There are few high-speed bindinglines inNairobi, but allowing for
double shifts runningsix days per week, there i s sufficient capacity to handle the output o f primary
school textbooks and teacher's guides. W varnishing for the covers i s also almost universally available,
together with more limitedfacilities for cover lamination. It i s worth noting that the hightechnical
failure rate o f dummies (64 percent) inthe bids submitted for the new curriculum standard 1 and 5
pupils' books and teacher's guides, seems to have been caused mainly by dummies being requested from
some printers within the last day or two prior to submission of the bids. It i s clear that this resulted in
sub-standard gluingand saddle stitching, which many bidders failed to check inthe time available.
Given that the dummy i s the sole basis o f the technical evaluation, this was a problem. However, it i s
clear that most Kenyan printers are able to perform to the correct production standards given sufficient
lead-time. Previous quality standards in schoolbook production inKenya have been variable. Achieving
the minimumquality standards obviously i s related to raw materials and plant, but also has muchto do
with the attitude o fmindo f those responsible within boththe printingandpublishingsectors. Ifproper
quality control i s not exercised, the final productionruns will not meet the required quality levels and
book durability will bejeopardized.

Another concern i s the considerable tonnage o f paper and board o f the specified quality required to
handle the projectedvolume o f production. Publishers and printers have been aware for some months o f
the likely textbook requirements, and have already startedbuying-insubstantial stocks. Likewise, the
major paper merchants inNairobi have also placed orders with mills inthe RSA and Europe, so that there
should be no interruption in supply once productionbegins. Inpractical terms, the printers are likely to
start production in late April for completion inJune-early July. Allowing for dispatch to the remoter
parts o f the country, it i s possible that distribution inresponse to the first phase o f fund release will not
be fully complete untilAugust 2003. It i s currently estimated that some 35 million books (pupils',


                                                        - 98 -

teachers' reference books and readers) will be requiredfor productionby the end o f 2003. The
immediate needi s for 5.17 million new curriculumbooks for standard 1 and 5 to be printed and bound to
the quality specifications laid out in the MOEST Textbook BidDocuments. This represents
approximately 6 weeks work usingthe entire book-printingcapacity available inNairobi.

Kenyan publishers are free to place their work wherever they wish. Many already have established
commercial links with specialized book printers inthe RSA, Mauritius, Dubai, Egypt, and even
Singapore and China. These external printinglocations have a number o f advantages for Kenyan
publishers: (i)the presses and bindingequipment are often state-of-the-art, specialized, highspeed
machines designed for highvolume bookwork; (ii)      the presses have rapid access to a wide range o f good
quality paper and cover board; (iii) they are usedto working to tight deadlines while maintaining high
quality standards; and (iv) productionunit costs are often lower than in Kenya so that the finished
product ready delivered to Mombasa i s often cheaper than local production. While RSA, Mauritius and
Dubai can deliver within 5-6 weeks o f order, Singapore and Hong Kong require at least 9-10 weeks, more
than halfo f which i s shippingtime, and are for this reason less likely to be used where schedules are
tight. Inpractice, publishers are likely to spread their production, ifonly to allow for over 19 million
reprints which the Ministryrequires duringthe same period. Reprints are more likely to stay in Kenya,
bearing inmindthat imposedfilm and printingplates already exist here, and deliveries will probably be
scheduled for delivery intime for the third term.

Insummary, Kenyanprintershave the capacity to produce the new curriculum primary textbooks and
teacher's guides up to required specifications and within an acceptable time frame. This i s based on
printers' physical capacity and excludes all other work from the MOEST or from other sources. Infact, a
number o f publishers are planning to spread their risk by printingmany o f the new curriculum titles
outside Kenya on the basis o f speed, quality and price, while tending to leave reprintswith Kenyan
printers for the reasons outlined above. It i s hoped that the new quality standards will be accepted as the
norm inKenya, guaranteeing indue course a minimum4-year textbook life for all school books.

4. Stationery.

There are 3 main suppliers o f printed stationery items for schools: APS, Twiga and Karatasi. One
supplier alone, Twiga, has the capacity to produce (i)  27 million, 64 page exercise books per month, and
(ii)200,000 teachers' attendance/enrollment registers per month. Different grades o f paper are available
for exercise books:

(i)Newsprint 45gm2 - a soft, absorbent greyishpaper with a poor surface. Pen and ink cannot be used
since any ink will spread as it would on blotting paper. Ifpencil i s used and subsequently erased with a
rubber, the paper surface will not resist and may even result intearing o f the page. The newsprint i s
available from Pan African Paper Mills in Kenya.

(ii)Printing Paper 50gm2 - this i s whiter, has a better surface and accepts pencil, ink, and ball-point
equally well. This paper i s also available from Pan African inKenya, and from Egypt,the latter being
reported by the stationery printers as more consistent. This grade o f paper i s more useful for school use
than the cheaper paper described above but i s more expensive. The costing of the minimumprofile o f
instructionalmaterials assumes the more expensive paper but it should be noted that the more expensive
exercise books are not widely available outside the larger towns, and schools inrural areas may have to
purchase the lower quality exercise books.

Iflarger quantities ofstationery are requiredina shorter space oftime they canbeprocuredandimported
from the RSA, where far greater resources are available.

AdditionalAnnex 14: Textbook Requirementsand the Scaling-up of the Existing Program
                        KENYA: Free Primary EducationSupport Project

 1.Textbook Requirements.

 A textbook availability survey was conducted between 10thand 24th March2003, by a local Kenyan
 consultancy company, A D C L Ltd. The survey covered 263 schools (1.5% o f the schools) in30 districts
 with a total enrolled school population o f 175,025 (approximately 2.5% o fthe enrolled school
 population). The districts were selected from all Provinces inKenya and were also representative of
 each o f the 5 phases o f decentralized textbook fundingprovided by GOK and DFIDover the past 3 years.
 These phases are:

 GOK Phase 1- June 2000; This phase provided funding to 14 Districts at an average per capita
 allocation o f K.Sh 284. Within this average, there were considerable variations between Moyale
 (K.Sh 1,103 per student) to Nyandarua (K.Sh 130 per student).

 GOK Phase 2 - June 2001; This phase provided fundingto 18 Districts at an average per capita
 allocation o f KSh206. Within this average, there were considerable variations between Garissa
 (K.Sh 547 per student) to Nairobi (K.Sh 105 per student).

 GOK Phase 3 -May 2002; This phase provided fundingto 14 Districts at an average per capita
 allocation o f K.Sh 325. Within this average, there were minor variations between Suba (K.Sh 352 per
 student) and Laikipia (K.Sh 288 per student).

 DFIDPhase 1-April 2001; This phase providedfundingto 12 Districts at an average per capita
 allocation o f K.Sh 323. Within this average, there were considerable variations between Mandera
 (KSh 1,140 per student) to Murang'a (KSh216 per student).

 DFIDPhase 2 -September 2002; This phaseprovidedfundingto 14Districts at an average per capita
 allocation o f K.Sh 204. Within this average there were variations between Ijara (KSh543 per student)
 to Mombasa (KSh 115 per student).

 The Districts covered by the survey are listed inthe Table below. The surveyors collected information
 on textbook availability from school stock record books, from textbook counting inthe classrooms and
 from discussions with staff and students. Approximately 8 or 9 schools were surveyed in each district.
 Ofthe 263 schools surveyed, 83 were inurban locations and 162 inrural areas, o f which 5 were
 considered top be remote or difficult access schools. 249 schools were mixed, 8 were for boys only and
 6 were for girls only. At the de-briefing meetingwith the surveyors, detailed questioning suggested that
 there was a good degree o f accuracy inthe counting, althoughthe data can only be indicative, bearing in
 mindthat schools were randomly selectedand that inthe time available there was no possibility o f
 achieving a more representative cross-section o f Kenyan schools.




                                                    - 100-

Although there are clear anomalies, a number o f basic conclusions can be drawn from the data so far
analyzed. These are:

a      Ingeneral, schools with morerecent fundrelease tend to havebetter pupi1:book ratios, other
thingsbeing equal. It shouldbe notedthat schools inDFIDPhase 1and GOK Phase 3 generally have the


                                                 -101  -

best pupi1:book ratios, but that schools inGOK Phase 2 (the latest fundrelease for textbooks) do not
have better ratios than the previous two phases. This i s probably because the per capita allocations were
significantly lower inDFID Phase 2 than inthe previous 2 phases.


0        Schools with higher per capita allocations have better pupi1:book ratios. It i s quite noticeable
that ineach fundrelease phase the worst pupi1:book ratios occur with the lowest levels o f per capita
allocations.


0        Inalmost every district surveyedpupi1:book ratios improve with grade level. It seems clear that
most schools consciously choose to concentrate their purchases on upper primary and exam classes and
that inthe lowest classes schools often rely on a teachers' copy with few books available for student use.


0       N o district surveyed has managed to achieve the MOEST's target pupi1:book ratios o f 3 students
to one book for lower primary and 2 students to one book inupper primary. The average pupi1:book
ratios inmost o f the districts surveyed were very far from the target ratios.


0        Virtually every school concentrates purchasing on the three subjects o f English, Swahili and
Mathematics and Science textbooks are purchased inquantities, which are generally only a thirdo f those
for the perceived `core' subjects. Other subjects are hardly purchased at any grade level.

All o fthe above conclusions are predictable. What is not predictable is the scale o ftextbook deprivation
insome o fthe districts. Malindi, Lamu, Thika, Nairobi, MombasaandNyeriall havepoor ratios, despite
the fact that all are generally regarded as beingquite rich districts (although some o f the districts have
serious slums and Pockets o f Poverty which have distorted the surveying where schools from these areas
have been included). InNairobi, for example, there i s a strong tradition o f parent purchase and it i s
possible that student owned textbooks have not been includedinthe textbook count. On the other hand,
some o f the better ratios have been achieved in some o f the poorest and most remote districts,
presumably because the per capita allocations were muchhigher. Thus Wajir and Turkana both rate
quite highlydespite beingremote anddifficult districts. Other districts with better than average ratios are
Makueni, Laikipia, Bungoma, Migori, Machakos, Kericho, Kisumuand Meru South. There i s a
considerable amount o f data that still needs to be reviewed and analyzed, but the early results suggest
serious shortages o f textbooks inall subjects at all grade levels inmost o f the surveyed districts.


2. Guidelines to Schools for the Utilization of Funds for FPE.

(a) Basic Instructional Materials Provisionfor all Primary Schools.

As essential support to FPE, the MOEST has agreed on the minimumrequirements for the provision o f
instructionalmaterials for all primary schools and pupils throughout Kenya. By the end o f 2003, all
schools are expected to provide the items specified in the table below.

(d) Stationery

The MOEST has specified the following two basic standards o f stationery supply:

Lower Primary Stationery Supply (Standards 1-4):
12 x 64 page exercise books each 162 x 203";          3 x HB pencils (or a mixture o f pens and pencils); 1
eraser; 1 sharpener and a ruler (from standard 3 only) will be provided to each student.

Upper Primarv Stationery Supply
12 x 120 page exercise books each 162 x 203 mm; 3 BIC type pens; a ruler and a set o f Mathematical
Instruments will be provided to each student in Standard 5.

Each enrolled primary student must be providedby the school with the minimumspecified supplies of
stationery every year. Schools may decide that the stationery shouldbe provided intotal at the beginning
o f the school year or that it should be provided inthree parts at the beginningo f each term. Students who
lose all or any part o f their stationery allocation, or who require additional items o f stationery must pay
the additional costs for themselves. Schools may, ifthey wish, provide stationery supplies inexcess of
the minimumstandards established by the MOEST, but they may not provide less.

All students (parents for lower primary students) will be expected to signfor their stationery supplies and
all schools will be expected to maintain records o f student receipts for audit purposes. Only if stationery
i s issued to students against student (parent) signatures can stationery supplies be effectively audited.

(e) Involvement of Parents and the Local Community.

All schools are requiredto fully involve Parents and the Local Communities through Parents Teachers
Associations (PTAs) in all financial transactions and the overall management and effective use o f the
funds provided. The School Management Committee (SMC) must convene a parents meeting inorder to
inform parents o f the funding and their rights and to prioritize school needs. The School Instructional
Materials Selection Committee (SIMSC) must prepare a budget based on the available funding. The
School Management Committee should ensure that no items additional to those specified above are
introduced into the school budget.

(f)FundManagement and Accountability.

For reasons o f accountability and transparency all schools are expected to maintain proper records o f all
the items purchased and how they are used, in accordance with the procedures clearly set out inthe
Primary School Instructional Materials Management Handbook (2003). Schools should note that the
MOEST i s now institutinga system o f regular school audits to ensure that fundingprovided to schools i s
properly used.

Schools will be provided with copies o f the revised edition o f the Primary School Instructional Materials
Management Handbook (2003) and the latest edition o f the Approved List o f Instructional Materials for
Use inKenyan Primary Schools (2003). All SIMSCs and SMCs must be familiar with the contents of
these documents and with the National Policy on Textbooks Publication, Procurement and Supply for
Primary Schools (June 1998). Training inthe revisedprocedures will be provided to all Districts, Zones
and schools prior to the end o f May 2003.

(g) BankAccounts.

All schools musthave a special InstructionalMaterials SchoolBank Account (previously Textbook
Account). Ifa school does not have such an account it must take steps to open such an account
immediately. The MOEST has recently negotiated a common set o f reduced bank charges, which apply
to the special bank accounts. Details o f the agreed charges are provided below. Schools must ensure that
their local bank charges no more than these charges specified.

(h) Other MOEST Fundingfor SchoolRunningCosts.

All schools will also receive additional funds, which will be transferred directly into a separate school
General Purpose School Bank Account. Schools should also ensure that General Purpose Accounts are
opened intime for the receipt o f funding. These funds are expected to cover the costs o f support staff
wages, school activities, repairs, maintenance and improvements (RMI), electricity, water and
conservancy (EWC), postage, box rental, telephone and contingency. Parents will be expected to pay for
the costs o f uniforms, food, examination fees and transport to and from school.

                        Additional Annex 15: Monitoring and Evaluation
                        KENYA: Free Primary Education Support Project

Background

The procedures for the operation o f the primary school instructionalmaterials (previously textbook)
programhave been thoroughly pilot tested over many years from the original Government/Netherlands
pilot project in 1996 through to the more recent GovernmentlDFID SPRED 3 project, which operated a
decentralized and cash-based procurement for instructionalmaterials from 2000 to 2002 in all 72 districts
o f Kenya plus 3 municipakity education administrations. PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was
contracted by DFIDto monitor and audit the expenditure o f funds for the instructional materials
disbursed to schools under the SPRED 3 project. PWC have worked closely with the Schools Audit Unit
(SAU) o f the MOEST, which i s now ina position to continue the auditing o f primary school bank
accounts inaccordance with the audit system developed by PWC, after the completion o f the PWC
contract with DFIDinOctober 2003. The PWC audit i s based on extensive semi-random samplingo f
primary schools intarget districts. Local NGOsprovide information on potential problem schools so that
the audit i s more problem focused than ina simple random samplingmethodology.

The most recent audit report (2003), carriedout in25 districts shows considerable variation inthe
effectiveness o f the procurement procedures, with 14 out o f 25 districts demonstrating satisfactory
procurement procedures inmore than 50 percent o f schools audited. Muragua (92 percent), Muranga (84
percent), Meru South (83 percent) performed particularly well. Incontrast, Moyale (8 percent), Kilifi
(11percent) and Ijara (16 percent) were all problem areas, largely on account o f the difficulties o f
traveling, training and monitoring inthese remote districts. Overall, around 60 percent o f the audited
schools operated satisfactory procurement procedures and over 60 percent o f schools maintained
acceptable supporting documentation for expenditure. A further 25 percent maintained some, but
incomplete, documentation. 84 percent o f schools maintainedsome form o f cash book supported by
records, although there were considerable variations inpractice. These are encouraging results bearing in
mindthat the extension o f instructionalmaterials fundingto national coverage took place only from 2001
and that a highproportion o f the districts and schools audited were operating the system for the first time.
Bycontrast, school performance on general fundingwas muchless effective. The continuation of
primary school auditing by the S A U along the lines developed by PWC should continue the process o f
developing accountability in school spending. Regular audit reports will provide information on progress
towards acceptable standards o f accountability and the proper use o f funds.

The PWCaudit reportedalso on usage of textbooks inthe schools andprovided very encouraging results.
83 percent o f schools audited issuedtextbooks for use in every lesson and a further 14 percent issued
textbooks for use insome lessons. Only 3 percent o f the audited schools rarely or never issued textbooks
for use inlessons. Inaddition, 92 percent o f audited schools allowed textbooks to be taken home for
homework purposes. The S A U audit reports will continue with information collection on the effective
usage o f textbooks and other instructional materials inclass. There i s a dearth o f information currently
available inKenya on the link between satisfactory levels o f instructional materials provision and student
performance.

Project Activities.

This monitoring and evaluationcomponent o fthe project has three sub-components: (i)       monitoring; (ii)
evaluation; and (iii) external audit.

(i)Monitoring.

Project monitoring will be the responsibility o f the Project Coordinator and the component and
sub-component managers. Monitoring will focus on the key performance indicators at the outcome and
output level identified inthe logical framework (Annex 1). Particular attention will be paid to student
learning, pupil retention, teacher behavior and resource use at the school level. Inaddition, project
activities and expenditure will be reviewed through the regular monthly meetings convened by the
Project Coordinator, against the annual plan and budget approved by the Project Steering Committee at
the start o f each year.

Monitoringdata will obtained from a variety o f sources as follows: (i)  standard tests o f pupil
competencies; (ii) o f education managers, school inspectors and T A C tutors; (iii) census
                    reports                                                                  school
data; (iv) reports o fthe Textbook Management Unitand School Audit Unit; (v) surveys o f school
management committees and parents; and (vi) routine management reports o f component/sub-component
managers. Through the EMIS sub-component, steps will be taken duringthe project to improve the
collection, processing and reporting o f School Census data inorder to provide accurate and timely
information on pupilprogression. Reporting frequencies, data sources and responsibilities for data
collection are summarized for the key outcome and output indicators inthe Table below.

4 keymonitoring instrument will be standardtests o fcompetencies administered to a one percent sample
o fpupils in standards 2,4 and 6, drawn from a rural-urban sample o f primary schools across all
Provinces. Tests will be designed to measure pupil learning in Science, Mathematics, Englishand
Kiswahili ineach o fthese standards, buildingon the Kenyan tests that were conducted in 1998. To
supplement the pupiltesting, assessments o f teacher behavior and instructional materials use will be
carried out inthese same schools at the same time. Kenyan researchers (comprising T A C tutors and
other Ministrypersonnel) will conduct the tests and assessments. External consultants will be engaged to
lead the test design and to supervise the exercise.

A baseline survey (of pupil learning, teacher behavior and instructionalmaterials use) will be
administered inSeptember 2003. This will focus on student performance, against agreed o f indicators o f

key competencies and skills inliteracy, numeracy and science. Itwill cover approximately 250 schools
from all parts o f Kenya (covering urban, rural and remote locations) and one percent o f students selected
from standards 2,4 and 6. The profilingo f tested students could allow for the identification o f potential
correlations betweenperformance and a range of other factors. This baseline study would be concluded
inOctober 2003. When repeatedon an annual basis, the student performance assessmentscouldbe used
to measure progress student achievement and to linkthis to changes inteacher behavior and the
application o f resources at the school level. The assessment o f pupil learning teacher behavior and
instructional materials use would be repeated inthe same schools in September 2004 and September
2005.

(ii)Evaluation.

An evaluation will be undertakenat the endo fthe project to take monitoringa step further. The
evaluation will be contracted out to an independent evaluation team who will work collaboratively with
key personnel inthe MOEST and KIE. The evaluation exercise has three objectives. Firstly, it will
assess the extent to which the outcomes and outputs o f the project have been achieved, examining
differences inachievement between regions and types o f school. To accomplishthis, the evaluators will
assemble the information generated through continuous project monitoring over the lifetime o f the
project. This will include data on the application o f resources at the school level, as well as progress
against outcomes and outputs. Secondly, the evaluators will determine the reasons for project successes
and failures. Inso doing, they will examine whether project assumptions have held and whether risk
minimization strategies have been implementedas planned. Thirdly, the evaluation will be
forward-looking, examining the prospects for sustainability and the relevance o f project inputs. This
perspective i s essential because this project i s a short-term emergency intervention which i s designed to
buildthe foundation for a more comprehensive program of support for primary education and the sector
as a whole.

(iii) ExternalAudit.

The project will also finance a biannual external and independent audit inthe first year and an annual
audit inthe second and third years o f the project. The audit will focus on the Textbook Management
Unitand a sample ofprimary schools accounts. The Controller andAuditor General will contract the
services o f a professional accounting firm to undertake the audit. Systems implementation and value for
money issues will be addressed.
