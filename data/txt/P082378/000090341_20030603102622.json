           improve pupil performance and retention through ensuring an\n            adequate supply and better use of instructional materials.\n            The project would support the Government's new policy\n            of Free Primary Education (FPE), and it would also assist\n            the country to move towards the Millennium Development Goal\n            of having all children throughout Kenya able to complete a\n            full course of primary schooling by Year 2015. There are\n            three components to the project: 1) The bulk of project\n            funds would be used for the scaling-up of the recently\n            evaluated Government/DFID textbook program, using school\n            grants, the existing procurement system (which is considered\n            to be competitive), and the existing financial management\n            system (though with additional training of school staff and\n            local community representatives). 2) The proposed capacity\n            building component would have four sub-components: (i)\n            school-based teacher development and support; (ii) school\n            accounting system; (iii) education management information\n            system; and (iv) system design and program preparation. 3)\n            This component has three activities: (i) monitoring; (ii)\n            evaluation; and (iii) external audit. Monitoring would focus\n            on the key performance indicators at outcome and output\n            level. Project monitoring will be the responsibility of the\n            Project Coordinator and the component/sub-component\n            managers. Project activities and expenditure would be\n            reviewed through the regular monthly meetings convened by\n            the Project Coordinator, against the annual plan and budget\n            approved by the Project Steering Committee at the start of\n            each year."}, "docdt": "2003-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
