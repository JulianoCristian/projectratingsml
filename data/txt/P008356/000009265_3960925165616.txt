MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Cyprus
Khrysokhou Irrigation Project (Loan 2279-CYP)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Cyprus
Khrysokhou Irrigation Project (Loan 2279-CYP)" prepared jointly by the Europe and Central Asia
Regional Office and FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
Project formulation did not anticipate the impact of land tenure constraints or the
rapid increase in tourism and out-migration. Changes in technical design induced substantial delays
in the development of irrigated land and eventual exclusion of 30 percent of the project area. As
a result, the economic rate of return at completion, based only on agricultural benefits, is reestimated
to be about 7 percent. However, the economic analysis does not include significant indirect benefits
including the potential use of water for domestic and tourism purposes. On balance, the project is
considered marginally satisfactory.
the Project Completion Report (PCR) is informative and of satisfactory quality.
However, it does not lay out the follow up activities which ought to be taken to secure the full
benefits out of project investments. An audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS
KHRYSOKHOU IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2279-CYP)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Khrysokhou Irrigation
Project (KIP) in Cyprus, for which Loan 2279-CYP in the amount of US$16.0 million
equivalent was approved on May 20, 1983. The loan was closed on December 31,
1989 as planned. US$15.96 million equivalent was disbursed and the outstanding
balance of US$41,122 equivalent was cancelled. Final disbursement of the loan
was on March 9, 1990.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agricultural Operations Division
(ECIAG) of the Europe and Central Asia Regional Office and the FAO/CP (Preface,
Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was undertaken during several supervision missions
(the last being in March 1992), and is based on an FAO/CP mission completion
which visited Cyprus from May 4 to 15, 1992, the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan
Agreement, supervision reports and project summaries as available from project
files, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and other internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECTION COMPLETION REPORT
CYPRUS
KHRYSOKHOU IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2279-CYP)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    Cyprus has a mediterranean climate with favorable conditions for the growth
of early and off-season horticultural crops for export. Out of its total area
of 925,000 ha, 425,000 ha is suitable for dry farming, including a total area of
44,000 ha which is irrigated and cropped with mainly horticultural crops.
Unreliable rainfall and severe periodic droughts are the main factors in limiting
the use of natural streams for agriculture and other purposes without storage and
interconnection.    The government  of Cyprus  (GOC)  considered  agricultural
development as one of its major priority areas. In 1981, agriculture contributed
11% of GDP, provided 25% of total employment, and directly and indirectly
accounted for about 25% of commodity export.
Obiectives
2.    The main objectives of the Khrysokhou Irrigation Project (KIP) as described
in the SAR were to expand irrigated area, intensify agricultural production in
Khrysokhou region,  and increase agricultural exports and foreign exchange
earnings. In addition, the Government of Cyprus  (GOC) pursued a   regional
development and employment policy in a structurally disadvantaged area of the
country. The objectives of the project were to be achieved by developing surface
and ground water resources (through the construction of the Evretou dam, a river
diversion, a conveyance system, an irrigation water distribution scheme and
installation of tubewells); and on-farm investments in sprinkler and/or drip
irrigation systems on 2,000 ha initially as well as fruit tree plantations (on
75Z of the irrigated area). On-farm development was to be enhanced through
agricultural extension and credit services. Export marketing constraints were
identified as a potential risk and were to be dealt with in the context of the
planned Fruit and Vegetable Export Project (Loan 1988-CYP).
Implementation experience
3.    The Project (covering some 2,000 ha) was designed as the first stage of a
two phase irrigation and agricultural development program within the Khrysokhou
valley and Bay area (totalling some 3,100 ha). The second phase was intended to
be financed by GOC resources. During the implementation of the first phase
several changes in the original designs took place, including: a) postponement
of the groundwater development component, which was to provide water for some 200
ha, due to lack of demand for irrigation water; b) cancelling of the Khrysokhou
river diversion because considerable agricultural development had autonomously
taken place downstream of the planned diversion; and c) incorporating the



iv
Magounda river diversion in the scheme and hence extending the RIP area into part
of the original Phase II zone. This led to the expansion of the project area from
2,000 ha to 2,510 ha plus 210 ha additional area (2,200 ha mostly new and 520 ha
existing). The Bank financed part of the investment costs associated with the
Magounda river diversion and the extension of the conveyor into the Phase II
area.
4.    Due to staffing problems and modifications in design, impounding of Evretou
dam was delayed from September 1985 to September 1986 and the completion of the
conveyor and irrigation distribution system fell behind schedule by roughly two
years. However, in 1991 all infrastructural works were completed.
5.    As a result of the above delays, initial on-farm investments for irrigation
and orchards were delayed and subsequently they were slow due to the following
socio-economic factors which were not clearly discernable at the design stage:
(a) a tremendous expansion of the tourist sector and its absorption of young
agricultural labor; (b) tourism development and migration out of the project area
favored part-time farming and a demographic evolution which resulted in an aging
agricultural population unwilling to make long-term investments; and (c)   a
number of land tenure issues (land rental regulations; absentee land owners;
small farm size and fragmentation; and land use in light of tourism development).
6.    Also the severe drought of 1991 temporarily halted expansion of the
irrigated area and tree plantations. The limited farm credit required and
extension services were provided by concerned government agencies and marketing
did not prove to be a constraint.
Results
7.    Considerable  development took place  in water storage and irrigation
infrastructure (i.e. Evretou dam, Magounda river diversion, conveyors and
distribution system) which led to the increase of the irrigable area by some
2,000 ha in addition to bringing supplementary water to 520 ha of existing
irrigable area.
8.    The total net cropped area to be irrigated remained behind schedule by
about 60% and increased from 366 ha in 1988 when irrigation first started to 740
ha in 1991 when expansion of irrigation was temporarily halted due to the
drought.  The expected cropping pattern to devote 75% of the newly developed
areas to fruit trees did not materialize, as on average only 44% of the net
irrigated area (or 10% of total project area) was planted to trees.
9.    It is estimated that by 2002 some 90% of the originally planned 2,000 ha
irrigable land will be under irrigated agriculture.  This would result in an
estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of 6.6%, compared to 13.9% at appraisal.
However, the project infrastructure opens the possibility of providing at
relatively low incremental investment cost supplementary irrigation water to a
further 520 ha area along the Khrysokou bay (unfinished part of Phase II) where
agricultural development is more likely to take place. Considerable benefits may
also derive in the medium term from the conversion of irrigation water to
municipal water to satisfy the increasing demand of the tourism sector.   In
addition, Evretou dam can be considered, as demonstrated during the 1991 drought,



v
as an element of a national water security strategy aimed at meeting the
increasing demand for municipal water and minimizing the effects of droughts.
As demand for water increases, so will the importance of the water security
strategy in the future. The latter three possible indirect benefits have not,
however, been included in the above economic analysis because of lack of adequate
data on required investment.  In view of their magnitude and importance, the
inclusion of these benefits in the economic analysis would result in higher ERR.
Sustainability
10.   Initial problems with seepage and rock slides on the Evetrou Dam have been
rectified and, except during severe drought, no restrictions on the rate of water
use are expected which would affect operation of the irrigation system. No major
technical problems have been observed with respect to the dam, the irrigation
network or the irrigable lands which would threaten the sustainability of the
physical works in the project. Agricultural production and income benefits have
fallen short of earlier estimates in part because net cropped area (740 ha) is
well short of appraisal estimates (1,225 ha).  While there is little concern
about sustainability of benefits from the lands equipped with on-farm network by
farmers, the extent to which irrigation benefits can be derived from the
remaining area depends on measures to assure adequate labor, address unfavorable
land use issues and ensure access to export markets.   Nore suitable land
legislation and implementation of a labor immigration policy are under
consideration. On balance some continued expansion of the net irrigated area and
production benefits seems likely. Despite the above uncertainty with regard to
expansion of irrigation to the remaining area, considering the growing demand for
water (agricultural, domestic and industrial -- especially tourism), and
detrimental effects of droughts without such a project, there is little doubt
about sustainability of the project and its overall benefits (because of the lack
of data, non-agricultural benefits have not been included in the economic
analysis).
11.   No environmental study was undertaken before project implementation as this
was not required by the Bank. In retrospect, the environmental impact of the
project can be briefly summarized as follows. The Evretou Reservoir attracted
migratory fowl, and is becoming a fishing and recreation area. Probably the major
negative impact of the dam is the reduction of good quality water to the
Khrysokhou aquifer below the dam, which now receives water only from the
sulphate-rich Khrysokhou River.
Findings and lessons learned
12.   Despite delay in the completion of its various components, the project has
been generally implemented successfully with substantial cost saving, and the
water storage and irrigation infrastructure targets as envisaged at appraisal
have been fully achieved.  This infrastructure has the capability to provide
irrigation water to 2,000 ha of originally planned and 720 ha of additional area.
It has already contributed significantly to making better and integrated use of
scarce water resources through construction of Evretou storage dam and the water
conveyance system that connects most of water resources with irrigable lands and
the population centers.   However, progress on its agricultural development
objective has been slow due to shortage of farm labor, absentee land owners



vi
(Turkish - the original owners - and Greek immigrants), inexperienced farmers,
land tenure problems and inadequate extension, marketing, and credit services.
13.   Emerging tourism development should have been monitored and its potential
impact on the project assessed at appraisal and during implementation.
14.   Adjustments to project agricultural activities  (as was done with the
infrastructure component) should have been made once it became clear that
significant socio-economic parameters of the project had changed. This is
particularly true of land tenure issues and labor availability, which made the
employment creation objective obsolete at an early stage of implementation, and
hence affected the pace of agricultural development.
15.   A more multidisciplinary supervision approach by the Bank covering, in
particular agricultural aspects, would have helped in identifying and helping
resolve constraints related to agricultural development at an earlier stage.
16.   Several of the constraints affecting KIP (land tenure and labor) apply by
and large to the agricultural sector as a whole. To secure sustainable
agricultural development, solutions would need to be formulated at a sectoral
level. This may possibly include a labor immigration policy and changes in land
rental and land taxation regulations in order to allow for more efficient land
use.

KHRYSOKHOU IRRIGATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2279-CYP)
PART I
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1. Prosect Identity
Project Name:     Khrysokhou Irrigation Project
Loan No.:          2279-CYP
RVP Unit:         Europe & Central Asian Region (EClAG)
Country:          Cyprus
Sector:           Agriculture
Sub-sector:       Irrigation
2. Background
2.1.        Main Features of Agriculture.  Cyprus has a mediterranean climate
which provides favorable conditions for the production of high quality, early and
off-season horticultural crops for export. The total land area is 925,000 ha of
which 424,000 ha are suitable for agriculture. Dryland field crops (mainly
barley) occupied some 380,000 ha, and only 44,000 ha were cropped under
controlled irrigation to mostly horticultural crops, mainly citrus, vegetables,
potatoes, grapes, and deciduous fruits. Though irrigated crops occupy only 102
of the agricultural land area they generate some 802 of the crop production
value. Rainfall is generally unreliable and insufficient for intensive crop
production and most of the groundwater resources have already been developed.
Therefore, surface water has assumed increasing importance as the predominant
source of water, particularly for horticultural crop production. Private
ownership accounts for some 93% of agricultural land which is to a large extent
(80%) farmed by owners. Total number of holdings is about 44,500 with an average
farm size of 4.5 ha typically fragmented into several (4-6) parcels.  This poses
problems for mechanization and production.
2.2.        Policy and Economic Context.   The Government of Cyprus  (GOC)
considered agricultural development as one of its major priority areas. In 1981,
agriculture contributed 11S of GDP, provided 252 of total employment, and



2
directly and indirectly accounted for about 25Z of commodity exportsi/.
Agriculture continues to play a major role in the economy.   Government's
agricultural policies under its first three Emergency Economic Action Plans are
aimed primarily at the completion of ongoing agricultural projects and the
expansion of irrigated areas. In an effort to increase production, improve income
levels and balance regional growth, the Fourth Emergency Economic Action Plan
(FEEAP), was committed to: (i) expand irrigation; (ii) modernize the sector;
(iii) improve the marketing system; and (iv) reduce price intervention and
subsidies. To address the above, the FEEAP included steps to increase irrigation
water supply, continue efforts to halt further land fragmentation and develop
agricultural exports to markets in Europe and the Middle East.
2.3.        Linkafes Between Proiect. Sector, and Macro Policy Obiectives. The
harnessing of surface water resources and the extension of irrigated agriculture
are part of the Government strategy for increasing agricultural production and
promoting exports. The Bank lending to agriculture focused primarily on the
development of new water resources and on the more efficient use of those already
existing. Water resources are the sector's most limiting physical factor. The
Bank's involvement also aimed at promoting productive employment and achieving
a more equal distribution of economic growth (both intersector and regional
growth). Several other Bank-financed projects were implemented to develop water
resources, reduce shortages of potable water and foster increased agricultural
production and exports (see Part III table 1). The Paphos Irrigation Project,
started in 1974 and completed in 1982, provided essential irrigation
infrastructure for export-oriented agricultural productions and assisted in
financing on-farm investments. Water resource development and irrigation projects
were complemented by several other agricultural projects, amongst which the Fruit
and Vegetable Export Project of 1988 aimed at initiating a set of institutional
changes in the fruit and vegetable export trade and improving the utilization of
scarce water resources.
3.      Project Obiectives and Description
3.1.        Proiect Background.  The Khrysokhou Irrigation Project (KIP) area is
located in northwest Cyprus around the town of Polis. It was originally designed
to cover an initial 2,000 ha (mainly new area) which was seen by GOC as the first
stage (Phase I) of a two-phase irrigation and agricultural development program
within the low lands of the Khrysokhou Valley and Bay area totalling some 3,100
ha. Phase II (1,100 ha) was intended to be financed by GOC resources.
3.2.        Project preparation was initiated in April 1979 with UNDP assistance
and executed jointly by FAO and the Water Development Department (WDD).  It
included a total area of 4,300 ha located in the low and high lands of the
Khrysokhou Bay area. The feasibility study was prepared in 1982 with FAO/CP
assistance. Consultants engaged by the Government undertook the preparation of
engineering designs and tender documents in November-December 1982. The project
was appraised in December 1982 and the loan agreement was signed in May 1983.
1 In 1990 agriculture's share of GDP and employment dropped to 7S and 142, respectively. The
same figures for the tourist sector are 212 (up from 162 in 1981) and 10 (62 in 1981).



3
The project became effective in August 1983 and the "Notice to proceed" was
issued by GOC in January 1984 to commence construction work on the Evretou Dam.
3.3.        Proiect Obiectives.   The project was in line with the central
elements of the Government's agricultural policy. Its main objectives were to (i)
expand the irrigated area; (ii) intensify agricultural production; and
(iii) increase agricultural exports and foreign exchange earnings. In addition,
GOC pursued a regional development and employment policy in a structurally
disadvantaged area. Employment opportunities in the relatively isolated project
area were limited at the time and had been further compounded by the closing of
a sulfur and copper mine, and the anticipated in-migration of Greek Cypriot
refugees. Nearly half of the farming population needed to supplement their farm
income by engaging in employment elsewhere. The project would directly benefit
some 3,500 persons.
3.4.        Proiect Scone and Components.   KIP comprised the following:  (i)
construction of the Evretou dam with a live storage capacity of 23 Mm3; (ii) a
conveyor system comprising 16.5 km of pipelines; (iii) a diversion structure to
divert and regulate flows from the upper Khrysokhou River; and, (iv) an
irrigation distribution network designed to deliver 7,100 m3 per hectare per year
to a command area of 2,000 ha. In addition, eight tubewells with an average
capacity of 15 1/sec. were planned, as well as the installation of on-farm water
application systems, comprising sprinklers and drippers, giving an overall
irrigation efficiency of 72X. Credit was to be provided for on-farm irrigation
systems and investments into orchards.   The project also had provision for
extension services to farmers.
3.5.        The  project  provided  for  management  and  administration  and
recruitment of staff to implement the engineering and agricultural activities.
A monitoring and evaluation (M&E) unit, to be established at the MANR
headquarters, and the provision of facilities including vehicles and
rehabilitation of existing office buildings were also part of the project.
3.6.        The  total  project  cost  was  estimated  at  appraisal  to  be
US$ 46.28 million. This was to be financed by a loan of US$ 16.00 million from
the World Bank and the equivalent of about US$ 27.14 million from the Government
of Cyprus and US$3.14 million from beneficiaries, as investments in on-farm
irrigation equipment and plantations.
4.    Project Design and Oraanization
4.1.        Conceptual Foundation of Proiect Design.  The project concept of
bringing irrigation to a dry, fertile and remote area, as well as providing
employment possibilities, was clear, understood and shared by all parties
involved. The original scale of the project and hence the area to be equipped for
irrigation was reduced during appraisal from 3,100 ha to 2,000 ha to match WDD's
implementation capacity and likely availability of GOC finance. In spite of this
reduction in scale, the area planned for development under KIP still represented
nearly 5% of the total irrigated area of the country. This, coupled with the
special micro-climate of the project zone, which is suitable for the production



4
of high-value, early season crops, made the scope and scale of the project
compatible with it's objectives.
4.2.        The  project  was  well  prepared  and  allowed  for  significant
participation and contributions from WDD and DA staff. Responsibilities of the
main implementing agencies was clearly defined and their participation in the
implementation of the project took place largely as expected. The staff of WDD,
which carried out most of the engineering designs, was able to complete the
studies during implementation and took full advantage of opportunities to upgrade
and amend the designs in order to increase cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The
DA staff provided necessary research and extension support and sufficient fruit
tree seedlings.   Establishment of the Project Policy Coordination Committee
(PPCC) by the project designers proved instrumental in coordinating project
activities amongst the numerous institutions involved and helped in implementing
the project. However, it appears that the implementation schedule forecast at
appraisal was somewhat on the optimistic side for the scale of work to be
completed.
4.3.        The project design adequately emphasized the engineering aspects of
the project. It did not, however, cover the agricultural component in sufficient
detail to clearly indicate reference marks and make it easy for project
management to monitor the pace of development and take the necessary corrective
measures. Detailed design of the agricultural component and operationalizing the
M & E unit might have enabled project management to bring other areas under
irrigation command in lieu of those in Khrysokhou Valley, where development was
lagging.
5. Proiect Implementation
5.1.        Critical variances in vroiect implementation.   Variances in the
implementation of KIP occurred with respect to irrigation infrastructure, on-farm
agricultural development and project management. With regard to irrigation
infrastructure, changes included: (i) the substitution of about 150 ha reserved
for residential and touristic development in the Khrysokhou Valley, by an area
of about the same size near the Evretou dam; (ii) postponement of the groundwater
development activities (eight tubewells) due to lack of demand for irrigation
water; (iii) cancelling of the Khrysokhou river diversion, because considerable
agricultural development had autonomously taken place off that river downstream
of the planned diversion, and its substitution by (iv) the incorporation of the
Magounda river diversion in the scheme and construction of two additional ponds
(i.e. five instead of three ponds), and hence extending the KIP area into part
of the original Phase II zone. This led to an increase of the project area from
2,000 ha to 2,510 ha plus additional area of 210 ha (2,200 ha mainly new and 520
ha existing). The Bank financed part of the investment costs associated with the
extension of the conveyor system into the Phase II area.   In spite of the
extension of the project area, project cost as of December 31, 1991 was only US$
38.64 million compared to the originally planned US$ 46.85 million, and the
project total cost after completion of on-farm works and ground water development
is estimated to be US$ 43.04 million.

5.2.        Construction work started soon after loan effectiveness. Due to
staffing problems (both professional and general staff) and substantial
modification in technical designs, impounding of Evretou dam was delayed by some
12 months (September 1986 instead of September 1985). Completion of the conveyer
and irrigation distribution system fell behind schedule by roughly two years.
However, in 1991 (about one year after the loan closing date) all infrastructure
works were completed.
5.3.        In terms of agricultural development, variances between planned and
actual implementation of activities were significant. On-farm establishment of
irrigation systems to equip a net irrigated area of 1,225 ha by 1987 (according
to SAR detailed cost tables) did not materialize. In 1988 an area of less than
366 ha was irrigated. In 1991, the total area equipped with mini sprinklers and
drip irrigation systems reached 740 ha or 37Z (Appendix 1, Table 1 and 2) of the
originally planned area of 2,000 ha. Variances in agricultural development were
due to delays in completing the Evretou dam and conveyance systems, and
insufficient labor and land tenure/rental issues and regulations which increased
the number of absentee farmers. This was further compounded by the severe drought
of 1991 during which water allocations were reduced to 90% of the previous year
and expansion of the irrigated area and tree plantings were temporarily halted.
5.4.        Farm credit, for which little demand was apparent, was made available
through the Central Cooperative Bank. Research and extension support services
were provided by the Department of Agriculture. Marketing did not prove to be a
constraint. The Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit, which was to be set-up
at MANR, never became operational.
5.5.        Factors affecting proiect implementation.   Delays in completing
engineering works were to a large extent due to staffing problems arising out of
a long- standing dispute between the Ministry of Finance and the Trade Unions.
Completion of certain detailed designs and redesign of the Magounda diversion and
extension of the conveyor also contributed to the delays.
5.6.        Delays in on-farm irrigation and agricultural development were also
caused by a number of socio-economic factors: (i) a tremendous expansion of the
tourist sector, both in the project area and in Paphos district, which by
offering renumerative new employment opportunities has led to the absorption of
much of the young agricultural labor; (ii) the tourism development and migration
out of the project area favored a demographic evolution which has resulted in an
aging agricultural population active in farming only on a part-time basis; and
(iii) a number of land tenure issues, as described below.
5.7.        Land tenure issues have had a significant impact on agricultural
development in the project area. Land rental regulations, allowing only Greek
Cypriot refugees to lease Turkish Cypriot-owned land on an annual basis, did not
permit active private concerns to participate in the use of these lands. As only
a few Greek Cypriot refugees finally settled in the project area and access to
land was denied to non-refugees, roughly 30% of the project area was excluded
from long-term investments in irrigation equipment and tree plantations. There
are also a considerable number of absentee land owners (on 15 - 20% of the
project area). The project area is marked by small farm sizes and excessive plot
fragmentation which did not allow for mechanization to replace manual labor.



6
Demand for irrigation installation up to farm gate increased mainly for
speculative reasons, as land values in the area increased some ten-fold.
Irrigable land can now be parcelled into smaller fields for sale in smaller lots
to non-agricultural users. GOC presently has only limited means of recovering
this economic rent.
5.8.        The speed and extent of tourism development were difficult to foresee
at the design stage. The same holds true, albeit to a lesser extent, for the
agricultural labor constraint. Regarding some of the land tenure issues (rental
regulations, absentee land owners and farm size and fragmentation), there seems
to have been an underestimation of their potential negative impact during design
and implementation. These issues were flagged by the Project Policy Coordination
Committee early during project implementation (September 1984) and a brief study
was conducted without, however, leading to concrete follow-up actions. On the
side of the Bank, the slow pace of agricultural development was mentioned only
fairly late during supervision (December 1988).
5.9.        Risk Assessment. The SAR stated that the greatest risk would be the
absence of improvements in export marketing, a risk which was to be reduced
through the Bank-funded Fruit and Vegetable Export Project which was then under
preparation.    While  the  latter  project  was  only  partially  successful2/,
marketing did not prove to be a major constraint, partly because agricultural
development was slower than expected.
6. Haior Results of the Proiect
6.1.        Considerable surface water development and irrigation infrastructure
have been put into place (i.e. Evretou dam, Magounda river diversion, conveyors
and distribution systems). This created potential for irrigation of some 2,200
ha in addition to bringing supplementary water to 520 ha of existing irrigated
area.   These increases in irrigable area were made possible in part by the
considerable flexibility shown by the Water Development Department and the Bank
during implementation of the engineering component.
6.2.        On-farm irrigation and agricultural development have taken place at
a slow pace and are behind expectations in terms of incremental irrigated land,
cropping pattern and water demand. This has ultimately affected agricultural
production and project benefits. The total net cropped area under irrigation
increased from 366 ha in 1988 when irrigation first started to 740 ha in 1991
when expansion of irrigation and orchards establishment were temporarily halted
due to drought. The cropping pattern, which was expected to have 75Z of the
newly developed areas to fruit trees, did not materialize. On average only 44Z
of the net irrigated area was planted to trees (or 10% of total project area).
It is doubtful that the on-farm investments (including tree plantations) will,
in the medium term, take place as projected.

August 26, 1991.

6.3.        For purposes of this review, it is estimated that by the year 2002
some 90% of the irrigable land will be under irrigated agriculture. This would
lead to an estimated ERR of 6.6%, compared to 13.9% at appraisal. However, the
present irrigation infrastructure opens the possibility of providing at
relatively low incremental investment cost supplementary irrigation water to a
further 520 ha area along the Khrysokou bay (unfinished part of Phase II) where
agricultural development is more likely to take place. Considerable benefits may
also emerge in the medium term from the conversion of irrigation water to
municipal water to satisfy the increasing demand of the tourism sector.   In
addition, Evretou dam can be considered, as demonstrated during the 1991 drought,
as an element of a national water security strategy aimed at meeting the growing
demand for municipal water and minimizing the effects of droughts. As demand for
water increases, so will the importance of water security.   These possible
indirect benefits have not, however, been included in the above economic
analysis. In view of its successful implementation and the vital role it has in
providing required water for irrigation, domestic and industrial (including
tourism industry) uses, as a whole, the project is considered to be satisfactory.
6.4.        No environmental study was undertaken before project implementation
as this was not required by the Bank. In retrospect, the environmental impact of
the project can be briefly summarized as follows. The Evretou Reservoir attracted
migratory fowl, and is becoming a fishing and recreation area. Probably the major
negative impact of the dam, erected on a tributary of the Khrysokhou river, is
the reduction of good quality water to the Khrysokhou aquifer below the dam which
now receives water only from the sulphate rich Khrysokhou river.
7. Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.1.        Sustainability of Engineering Works.  During construction of the dam
and shortly afterwards, problems occurred with seepage and rock slides on the
slope over the intake. Considerable work was done in 1988-1989 to stabilize the
slope with advice and monitoring requirements provided by the consultants.
Except during severe drought, no restrictions on the rate of draw down are
expected which would affect operation of the irrigation system.  Because the
reservoir has not yet been filled to top water level, monitoring and supervision
of the embankment is continuing, with reports being submitted to the consultants
who have inspected the dam five times in recent years. Sedimentation of the
reservoir is presently not monitored by WDD as monitoring is judged premature,
considering the low sedimentation content of the river. No further seepage has
been reported to the mission. In summary, no major technical problems have been
observed with respect to the dam, the irrigation network or the irrigable lands
which would threaten the sustainability of the project works.
7.2.        Agricultural production and income benefits have fallen short of
earlier estimates in part because the actual net cropped area (740 ha) is well
short of appraisal estimates (1,225 ha).   This shortfall reflects delays in
completing some of the infrastructure, shortages of labor and unfavorable land
tenure/rental  regulations.    While  there  is  little  or  no  concern  about
sustainability of benefits from the lands that are equipped with on-farm
facilities, the extent to which these benefits can be derived from the remaining
area and their timing depends heavily upon the success of measures to address the



8
labor problem and the land tenure issues. Access to export markets vill also be
an important consideration. Proper land legislation and the implementation of
a labor immigration policy, both of which are presently under study, would
constitute significant incentives for farmers to make further investments in
agriculture and lay the basis for increased production. A political solution to
the country's division could also ease the labor and land tenure constraints in
the project area.  On the other hand, the expected further expansion of the
tourist industry, and associated employment opportunities, will continue to draw
younger workers from agriculture. On balance, some further expansion in the net
irrigated area in agricultural production is a reasonable assumption. Despite
the above uncertainty with regard to expansion of irrigation to the remaining
area, considering the growing demand for water (agricultural, domestic and
industrial--especially tourism), and detrimental effeets of droughts without such
a project, there is little doubt about sustainability of the project and its
overall benefits (because of the lack of data, non-agricultural benefits have not
been included in the economic analysis).
8. Bank Performance
8.1.        The  project  was  identified  and  prepared  with  limited  Bank
involvement. The Bank generally performed satisfactorily and the appraisal was
carried out efficiently. Supervision generally concentrated on the engineering
aspects to which it made a significant contribution. The Bank adopted a flexible
attitude to the project, agreeing to changes in infrastructure designs as needed.
However, agricultural development was largely ignored. No Bank agriculturalist
visited the project since appraisal. Had supervision been more comprehensive,
the performance of the project in terms of agricultural development may have
improved and might have been more successful in conveying to MANR the need to
establish and operate the planned M&E unit.
9. Borrower's Performance
9.1.        The borrower generally performed satisfactorily. The feasibility
study for the project by FAO/UNDP was conducted with the active participation of
the borrower's staff. The staff also arranged for the detailed designs to be
produced by foreign consultants with FAO assistance. During implementation there
were delays in appointing staff, which delayed completion of construction. Audit
reports were often late. Water rates, which initially were to cover 0 & M cost
and 50% of capital costs, were amended with the agreement of the Bank to cover
38% of total costs on a national basis. In the case of RIP presently about 14%
of costs are being recovered, however with increase in water utilization the
recovery will be closer to the agreed level of 38%.  The borrower provided
regular progress reports up to 1988, but was late in preparing the PCR.
10. Proiect Relationship
10.1.       Good relationships were maintained between the borrower and the Bank
through supervision missions. Coordination between agencies involved in project
implementation were also reported to be satisfactory.



9
11. Consulting Servie*s
11.1.       Foreign consultants, who had earlier been employed for the production
of detailed designs of the dam and were employed during the project for
supervision of construction, performed satisfactorily. Cypriot contractors
employed for the construction of civil works also performed according to
expectations.
12. Proiect Documentation and Data
12.1.       The SAR provided a useful framework for project implementation but
it was not sufficiently detailed, particularly with regard to agricultural
development. However, documents collected in the World Bank Project File were
detailed, and provided many clarifications. An important feature of. the loan
agreement was that it required (Section 4.06) the borrower to review marketing
of fruit and vegetables. Although provision for this was made in the Fruit and
Vegetable Export Project (1988-CY), the study was not carried out.
13. Lesson. Learned
13.0.1            Emerging tourism development should have been monitored
and its potential impact on the project assessed during
appraisal and implementation.
13.0.2            Adjustments to project agricultural activities (as was
done with the infrastructural component) should have
been made, once it became clear that significant socio-
economic parameters of the project had changed. Of
particular importance in this regard were land tenure
issues and labor availability, which made the employment
creation objective obsolete at an early stage of
implementation, and hence affected the pace of
agricultural development.
13.0.3            A more multidisciplinary supervision approach by the
Bank including, in particular, agriculturist would have
helped to identify and resolve constraints related to
agricultural development at an earlier stage.
13.0.4            Several of the constraints affecting KIP (land tenure
and labor) apply by and large to the agricultural sector
as whole. To sustain agricultural development, solutions
would need to be formulated at a sectoral level. This
might include a labor immigration policy and changes in
land rental and land taxation regulations in order to
allow for more efficient land use.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Part I
1.    Para.5.1  In the sentence before the last one it should be mentioned
that the area was increased from 2,000 ha to 2,720 ha ( 2,200 ha new and 520
ha existing), instead of 2,520 ha *'.
2.    Para 5.4.  I don't believe that what is stated in the 3rd sentence can
be correct for all agricultural products. Of course, because of the limited
agriculture production, the problem of marketing could not be appreciated
fully.
3.    Para 6.1.(i)  Again the area mentioned in the 2nd sentence should be
corrected to 2,200 ha instead of 2,000 ha. (ii) The figure for the actual
project costs given in the last sentence should be corrected to 18.1 million.
The latter is only the expenditure up to 31.12.91 whilst the former is the
expected total project costs at full completion of the project including all
on farm-works and ground water development as originally planned *'.
4.    Para 7.1.(i)  If possible would you please rephrase the first part of
the second sentence "The slope was reshaped in 1990" as follows: "Considerable
works were carried out in 1988-89 to stabilize the slope, with advise on the
works and the monitoring requirements being provided by the Consultants" 
(ii)  Would you also replace the 4th sentence "In recent years.......
consultants" with the following:
"Because the reservoir has not yet been filled to top water level monitoring
and supervision of the embankment is continuing at a high level with reports
being submitted to the Consultants who have in the recent years inspected the
dam five times". "
5.    Para 9.1.  As regards the matter of water rates mentioned in this
paragraph I would like to point out that the present water rate for KIP for
agriculture use is 6 cent per m2. With this rate it is possible to cover
about 402 of total cost provided of course that water demand is increased to
the originally anticipated level. Therefore I believe that the statement that
"only 142 of costs are presently being recovered" needs to be clarified *

(ii)  Irrigation network          2,720 ha (136%) instead of 251 ha -

column "Total Cost at full completion" as given in the table of page 9 of PCR-
Part II should be also given in this table *
