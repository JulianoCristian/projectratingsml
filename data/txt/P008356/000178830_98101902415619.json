irrigated area producing\n            high-quality high-value horticultural crops mostly for\n            export. It also hopes to resolve the area's\n            under-employment problem by creating stable and remunerative\n            employment opportunities for several hundred farm families.\n            The components of the project include: (a) a dam and\n            appurtenant structures; (b) a water conveyance system; (c)\n            an irrigation system; (d) on-farm systems including\n            pipelines, land smoothing, and vegetable and orchard\n            planting; (e) groundwater development; and (f) provisions\n            for project management and administration. The project would\n            directly benefit about 640 families in the project area by\n            generating additional on-farm and off-farm part-time\n            employment thereby increasing farm incomes."}, "docdt": "1983-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
