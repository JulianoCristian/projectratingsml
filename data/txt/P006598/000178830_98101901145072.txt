AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.       This report appraises an Agricultural Rehabilitation Project for
which a Bank loan of US$20 million equivalent is proposed. The loan would
support the 1975 lending program by the State Bank (Banco del Estado--BE),
the Development Corporation (Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion--CORFO),
the Small Farmer Development Institute (Instituto de Desarrollo Agropecuario--
INDAP), and commercial banks.  In addition, the loan would finance a study
regarding the role and possible reorganization and consolidation of the
numerous agencies providing public services to the agricultural sector. The
Republic of Chile would be the borrower and bear the-exchange risk. A
Project Commission under the chairmanship of the Central Bank (CB) would
administer the credit component of the Project.
ii.      Chile's agricultural sector employs about one-fourth of the country's
active labor force but contributes only about one-eighth to the GNP. Agri-
cultural imports have increased, particularly over the last 10 years, from
US$140 million to an estimated US$472 million (about 21% of all imports),
but agricultural exports have stagnated, remaining at about Us$25 million
in 1973.
iii.     The agrarian reform, under which land began to be expropriated in
1965, created a climate of uncertainty which gradually affected investments
adversely, although production continued to slowly increase. Its acceleration
during the 1970-1973 period further affected the sector adversely as far as
production was concerned. The value of major crop production dropped by 18%
in 1973 compared to 1970.
iv.      The Government's main objectives in the agricultural sector are to
consolidate land reform, restore production to the 1970 level and expand it
further thereafter. In regard to the short-run objectives, the Governmentt
(a) has declared its intention to grant title to 7.7 million ha,
which have been legally expropriated (equivalent to 780,000
basic ha), to about 60,000 farm workers;
(b) is in the process of liberalizing prices of inputs and farm
produce to create sufficient incentives to farmers; and
(c) is supporting the provision of agricultural credit and the
supply of inputs.
These measures are beginning to make an impact on major crop production,
which has increased in 1974 by about 12% over 1973.



- iI -
v.        Under the Project, some 22,000 small farmer families, who belong
to the lower 40% income group of the country, and some 1,000 medium-sized
farmers would benefit from the lending program. They would mainly receive
production credit (about 80% of Project costs) and investment credit for
the purchase of machinery (20%). The reason for such financing is that the
provision of production credit for annual crops (mainly grains) is thought
to be of the highest importance to increase production and reduce foodgrain
imports.
vi.       Aside from the urgently needed credit in the sector, the most
important aspect of the Bank loan would be the policy measures which would
be implemented in connection with it. These measures are to (a) accelerate
the Government's work in land titling, an essential step in improving the
living level of the rural underprivileged, and increase production; (b)
study the role and possible reorganization of public agencies dealing with
agriculture with a view to making the services provided to the agricultural
sector more efficient; and (c) continue to liberalize agricultural commodity
prices in line with supply and demand conditions.
vii.      The loan, by supporting grain production, would reduce agricultural
imports and thereby improve the balance of payments. Financial returns to
beneficiaries would be enhanced through price liberalization. Benefit/cost
rt+J4 o  are expect-d to be in the order of 3sl for varlous ei8ps, equivalent
to rates of return of about 200%. Farmers would pay a nominal interest rate
of 200% per annum (but such rate of interest would be reviewed on at least
a quarterly basis taking into account the prevailing and expected rates of
inflation) for production credit and 8%, adjusted on the basis of the Consumer
Price Index, for machinery credit. Economic benefits to the country would
be even higher than the financial benefits to the farmer since the domestic
price of agricultural produce would be kept in line with world prices while
the cost of inputs to farmers would be increased marginally on account of
import duties.
viii.     Total Project cost would be US$55.5 million equivalent.  The loan
of US$20 million equivalent would finance 36% of Project costs and the
balance would be contributed by Government (36%) and farmers (28%).
ix.       Procurement would be through normal commercial channels rather
than through International Competitive Bidding since the range of items to
be financed under the Project is diverse. However, the State Bank (BE),
which is the main importer for fertilizers and seeds (an important portion
of production credit), would continue to seek quotations (at least three)
from major suppliers from Bank member countries for all fertilizer and
seed imports.
x.        With the foregoing assurances, the proposed Project is suitable
for a Bank loan to the Republic of Chile of US$20 million for a term of
20 years, including four years of grace.



CHILE
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Bank reconnaissance mission that visited Chile in November 1973
concluded that, due to the drastic changes in the agricultural land owner-
ship, the lack of adequate inputs, and unfavorable price-cost relationships,
there was an urgent need for a Rehabilitation Program to restore production
of the agricultural sector to the 1970 level and expand it further thereafter.
In February/March 1974, two agricultural specialists participated in an economic
mission; they further analyzed Chile's agricultural sector and concluded that
in the short-term measures should be taken (a) to consolidate the benefits of
the land reform; (b) to change price policies; and (e) to make credit and
technical assistance available. In the medium and long tern, institutions
dealing with agriculture require adjustement to the new situation.
1.02      A Bank loan of US$20 million is proposed to provide agricultural
credit, mainly to finance short-term production inputs for land reform
beneficiaries and studies to reorganize public services dealing with the
agricultural sector. The loan would complement a program of agrarian
r.eform consolidation arnd price policy measures. The Project was appraised
in September 1974, and this report is based on the findings of the appraisal
mission consisting of Messrs. P.C. Gqffin, J, Andreu, K.W. Berg, D. Lecuona,
and E. McCarthy.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
Agriculture in the Economy
2.01      Chile's total agricultural land covers only about one-third, or
25 million ha, of the country (74 million ha). Only 1.3 million ha are
irrigated; 4.1 million ha are classified as dry land which is arable; and
19.8 million ha are dry land but not arable.
2.02      Its population is about 10.4 million (197h), of which aboat three-
fourths is urban. Some 90% of the population live in the central part
between the Aconcagua River and Puerto Montt. The country is divided into
five major ecological zones. From north to south, these are: desert, arid,
mediterranean, temperate, and humid (see Map in Annex 2).



2.03      Agriculture's contribution to national output is small and has
been steadily declining. According to national accounts, its share in 1973
was 6% of GNP, down from 19% in 1960.  However, it is estimated that,
presently, the sector's real contribution to GNP is about 50% higher than
indicated if measured at world market prices.  The share of employment in
agriculture, as compared to total employment, has also dropped, from 31% in
1960 to 26% in 1970 and to 23% in 1973. While the country's agricultural
land is relatively well endowed in relation to climate, soils, rainfall                 4
and irrigation facilities, its production has increased very slowly over
the last 10 years (Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2). The main problem has been
the inefficient use of available resources and the lack of continuity in
agricultural policy in general and price policy in particular. This has
resulted in unfavorable cost-price relationships for the sector.
2.04      The agrarian reform, which started to expropriate lands in 1965,
created a climate of uncertainty which gradually affected investments
adversely, although production continued to slowly increase. Its acceleration
during the 1970-1973 period had a further negative effect on production.
The value of major crop production was 18% lower in 1973 than in 1970 (Annex 1,
Table 3).
2.05      Food imports rose rapidly from about US$140 million in 1965 to
some US$600 million in 1973 but fell to US$472 million in 1974, which would
represent 21% of all imports (Annex 1, Table 1). Wheat, rice and feedgrains
are the most important agricultural imports (US$250 million estimated in
1974), accounting for more than half in value. Sugar is another important
import item, amounting to about US$109 million in 1974. Agricultural and
,.fishery exports have stagnated over the last 10 years, accounting for about
7 US$25 million in 1973 (about 2% of all exports).
I   2.06       The Government's main objectives in the agricultural sector are to
consolidate the land reform, restore production to the 1970 level, and expand
it further thereafter. In regard to the short-run objectives, the Government:
(a) has declared its intention to grant title to 7.7 million ha, which
have been legally expropriated (equivalent to 780,000 basic
irrigated ha), to about 60,000 farm workers;
\ (b) is in the process of liberalizing prices of inputs and farm
produce to create sufficient incentives to farmers; and
\(c)  is supporting the provision of agricultural credit and the
supply of inputs.
These measures are beginiiing to have an impact on major crop production, which
increased in 1974 by about 12% over 1973.



- 3 -
2.07      With regard to long-term objectives related to increased production,
some priority areas have already been identified. These include (a) the
expansion of irrigated areas by some 150,000 ha and the better use of existing
irrigation schemes (the presently irrigated area is about 1.3 million ha; (b)
more comprehensive exploitation of forest resources; and (c) the expansion
of production based on Chile's comparative advantage, such as for wine,
fruits and vegetables, or based on the production potential and internal
demand for such items as meat and dairy products.  On the social front,
solutions for the 80,000 subsistence families with less than 1 ha and for
some 200,000 rural families now underemployed as farm workers are required.
However, these individual priorities need to be handled in the context of
a comprehensive development plan. The public agencies scattered among five
ministries dealing with agriculture are not well adapted to serve present
and future needs of agriculture, particularly after the fundamental changes
in tenancy. The Government has started, as a first step, a review of the
Ministry of Agriculture (paras 2.20 and 3.06(c)) but a broader approach
analyzing all agencies servicing the agricultural sector is required. The
proposed Project would assist the Government in these objectives (para 1.02).
Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform
2.o8      In 1965, about 80% of all aricultural land was owned by some 11,000
farmers holding more than 80 basic ha /, representing less than 7% of total
farms.  Today, less than 200 farms are larger than 80 basic ha and about
40% of all agricultural land in the country has been expropriated since 1965.
The changes affecting the sector have been dramatic.
2.09      Action to start an agrarian reform program began in the early
1960s based on the widespread view that this was necessary in order to
improve agricultural production and national income distribution. The reform
has gone through three main phases. During the first one, 1962 to 1964, the
first agrarian reform law (Law No. 15,020) was promulgated and a Goverrment
Institution, the Agrarian Reform Institute (Corporacion de Reforma Agraria--
CORA), was created but no expropriations were carried out. During the
second phase, 1965 to November 1970, a second agrarian reform law (Law No.
16,640) was promulgated in 1967. A land distribution plan with economic
and social objectives was prepared. It was to be supported by credit and
technical assistance. A total of 1,406 properties, covering 3.6 million ha
on which about 21,000 farm families worked and lived, was expropriated.
During the third phase, from November 1970 to September 1973, an added
impetus was given to land expropriation and to social aspects of the landless
farm workers, but, during that period, little attention was given to actual
land distribution; expropriated farms were administered by the Government
1/ One basic ha equivalent is 1 irrigated ha of the best soils located in
the Maipo Valley; it is used as a common index to express productive
potential of the soils of other regions (see also Annex 2, Table 1).

and the land was not legally assigned to the farm workers. Also, little
attention was given to productive aspects, resulting in a decline in output.
During the third phase, 4,400 farms, covering some 6.3 million ha on which
about 38,700 farm families worked and lived, were expropriated.
2.10      Thus, a total of about 9.9 million ha has been expropriated,
representing about 40% of Chile's agricultural land. Of these, some 730,000
are irrigated, representing 60% of the countryts irrigated land (Annex 2,
Table 1). It is now estimated that about 60,000 to 70,Oooj farm worker
families will receive land, on average about 8 to 12 basic ha each. The
area is considered necessary to provide an adequate income for a family.
In addition, there are some 140,000 smallholders and/or minifundio farmers
potentially viable.  They cover about 2.7 mlllion ha, or 11% of the total
agricultural land. Thus, about half of the land is now occupied by the small
farming sector and the other half by some 40,000 medium-size farmers (up to
80 basic ha) on some 12 million ha. About 1/2% of this latter category, less
than 200 farmers, remain with farms larger than 80 basic ha. There are also
some 200,000 landless families, usually employed as farm laborers.
2.11      To date, only a small portion of the expropriated land has been
legally assigned to land reform beneficiaries. For the period 1965-1973
(September), 1.1 million expropriated ha were assigned to 10,035 families
under group ownership. The present Government is giving high priority to
accelerating this process and assigned a total of 3,750 titles between
September 1973 and August 1974. This covered 75,000 ha, of which 52,000
went into individual plots and 23,000 into group ownership. Under the law,
agrarian reform beneficiaries have the choice of whether to own assigned
land individually, collectively or a combination of the two forms. In the
majority of cases, they chose individual assignment of plots.
2.12      The Government has declared its intention to assign all expropriated
land within the 1975-1977 period. By the end of August 1974, a total of
some 1.1 million ha had been assigned, and about 1.1 million ha had been
returned to their rightful owners because they were expropriated without
legal basis or owners had been deprived of the 80 basic ha they were
entitled to retain, leaving about 7.7 million ha to be assigned. This is
expected to benefit about 57,000 landless families, who were cultivating the
land at the end of August 1974 without title. The reformed and minifundio
sub-sectors now require technical and financial assistance, while the remaining
medium-size sub-sector is expected to increase investment and consequently
intensify production.
2.13      According to Law No. 16,640, it was foreseen that before assigning
the land the Agrarian Reform Corporation (CORA)(Annex 3) would manage the
%/ The process of land distribution and titling requires detailed surveys
in each case. This is expected to take three years for the entire
country and the final number of beneficiaries will depend on the
analysis of land available.

expropriated farms for three to five years until the "asentados" (the farm
workers occupying the land) became proficient enough to administer the
properties on their own. This period, after CORA takes possession of the
farm and until land is assigned, is known as the "asentamiento period."
Within this period a farming society is to be established between CORA and
the asentados. This enterprise has full legal status and is generally known
as a Sociedad Agricola de la Reforma Agraria (SARA)l/. It is, in effect,
a contract between asentados and CORA establishing a partnership to operate
the farm. CORA provides land, technical assistance and credit; the asentados
provide labor. The Gvo%rnment now follows the wishes of the land reform
beneficiaries, who, in the majority of cases, have chosen to own the land
individually. With the legal assignment of the land, CORA's role ends. In
the past, CORA has not been very efficient. This has been due partly to
the fact that during 1970-1973 there was considerable uncertainty regarding
the form of final ownership of the expropriated land, and partly to the
lack of qualified and experienced staff in responsible positions. The
Government is now faced with the monumental tasks of assigning some 7.7
million ha and of consolidating the achievement of land reform measures.
This has to be done in the shortest possible time to restore stability
within the sector and develop production (para 3.06(a)).
2.14      The assignment of land requires in each case a soil survey, the
preparation of a cadastral map showing the lot-size to be assigned, the
selection of qualified beneficiaries, and finally the title issue process,
which in itself is lengthy and complex. There are presently five land titling
teams working in the field. Each team comprises a staff of 25--agronomists,
civil engineers, surveyors, lawyers, technicians and supporting staff--
(Annex 3, para 13). So far, each team has been able to prepare about 250
titles per month, but, in difficult cases, where, for instance, irrigation
facilities must be changed, the process is much slower. On this basis and
with most of the irrigated land remaiin4g to be distributed, the land titling
would take some five years, but the Government has decided to accelerate
land titling and reduce the time frame to three years. Therefore, the Govern-
ment is increasing CORA's capacity by making contracts for defined areas with
groups or firms to carry out the technical-economic components of the land
titling process such as soil surveys, land use, cropping patterns, water
rights and preparation of farm-size units; in addition, it will employ local
lawyers for the preparation of title deeds and their recording in the appropriate
land registry. CORA will supervise the technical teams and lawyers contracted
and select the beneficiaries for the granting of land titles. Implementation
measures are set forth in para 3.06(a).
1/ Other farming societies like Centro de Produccion (CEPRO) and Centro de
Reforma Agraria (CERAS) are also provided for in the Law, but SARA is
the most commonly applied.

B. The Banking System and Agricultural Credit
The Banking System
2.15      Institutional credit to the agricultural sector in Chile is con-
trolled by the Central Bank of Chile (Banco Central de Chile--CB) within the
terms of the General Banking Law. Banking institutions subject to the
General Banking Law are the state-owned State Bank (Banco del Estado--BE)
and 19 commeiial banks-with various degrees of state-owned capital.
Besides these banks, there are state institutions lending to agriculturet
the Development Corporation (Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion--CORFO);
and the Small Farmer Development Institute (Instituto de Desarrollo Agro-
pecuario--INDAP). The Agrarian Reform Institute (Corporacion de Reforma
Agraria--CORA) has ceased lending to agriculture, with loans to the reformed
sector now handled by BE. In addition, there are a Cooperative Institute
(Instituto de Financimiento Cooperativo--IFICOOP), providing financial and
technical assistance to cooperatives, and various agro-industrial and
marketing organizations such as Industria Azucarera Nacional (IANSA) for
sugar beets; Compania de Oleaginosas y Maravilla, S.A. (COMARSA) for oilseeds;
!upresa Nacional de Semillas (ENDS) for seed production in general; Carozzi
and Luchetti for hard wheat; CCU, Malterias Uhidas and Malteria Aconcagua
for barley and Compania Chilena de Tabacos for tobacco and the rice mills
for rice production.
Agricultural Lending
2.16      BE is by far the most important lending institution to the agri-
cultural sector. In 1973, 86% of the loan volume made to the sector was
from BE; the balance was handled by CORFO (3%), INDAP (6%), other specialized
institutions (1%), and commercial banks, together responsible for only 4%
of all agricultural lending.  However, the share of the commercial banks
has been considerably higher in the past. It was 49% in 1963 and has been
steadily declining since; it was still 18% in 1970. 
2.17      Practically all of BE's lending (totalling about us$40o million
equivalent, of which some US$170 million was for agriculture) has been short
term because of the nature of its resources. Medium- and long-term lending
depends on the Government funds but demand has been low in recent years due
to the structural changes the sector has undergone. However, the present
policies are conducive to investment, and demand for medium- and long-term
credit is gradually increasing as the situation stabilizes. BE will, in
the immediate future, remain the largest single institution lending to the
agricultural sector, covering about 90% of total lending.
2.18      INDAP, which has the primary responsibility for supporting small-
holders through credit and technical assistance, has only limited lending
resources, mostly coming from Government budget contributions. CORFO's
lending has been successfully applied to livestock, fruits and vineyards,
fields in which it has accumulated technical expertise. Together, these



two agencies are expected to take up most of the balance of lending to
agriculture in the near future.  The extent of lending to the agricultural
sector by commercial banks will depend largely on the margins they will be
allowed by the Government, but, because they have more expertise in financing
marketing operations than in productive operations, it is not expected that
their share of agricultural credit will change very much.  Further details
on BE, CORFO, INDAP and commercial banks are given in paragraph 3.14 and
in Annexes 4 to 6.
C. Services to Agriculture
organizational_Structure
2.19      There are about 30 public agencies deali   with agriculture; they
are scattered arou   in  ive  ifer   fm of over
~~~ This ovrSttifa
resulIted, not only in overlapping functions, but in ~an extremely centralized
(over 50% of staff are in office jobs) and uncoordinated set of bodies not
rebponbive anymore to present and future needs of the agricultural sector.
2.20      The Government has already started reviewing some departments of
the Ministry of Agriculture but the largest and most complex task has still
to be undertaken. This involves a critical review of responsibilities which
other ministries have concerning the agricultural sector and, most importantly,
how their work can best be coordinated. The Government has released guide-
lines indicating in which direction it wishes the reorganization to move.
They  are (a) the strengthening of the position of the Ministry of Agriculture
concerning definition and implementat;on of all matters related to agri-
cultural policy, including research, planning, extension services, training
of personnel, marketing and processing of agricultural production, livestock,
forestry, and inland fisheries; (b) decentralization of all public services,
including establishment of regi.onal development offices; and (c) the transfer,
to the extent practicable, of the marketing and processing of agricultural
inputs and outputs to the private and cooperative sector. But, before
making a final decision on the above, a study on the organization ol public
services for agriculture would be required.  The Government is giving the
hi.ghest priority to such a study and has requested Bank assistance in
undertaking it (para 3.06(c)).
Supply  f Agri             u    and Marketin
2.21      The supply o-f agricultural machinery and equipment and of insecti-
cides/pesticides/herbicides is handled by private firms, most of which act
as local representatives of manufacturers. BE purchases most of the fertilizer
and distributes it through its national system of warehouses. The National
Seed Enterprise (Empresa Nacional de Semillas), a public autonomous agency,



-8-
purchases a substantial amount of seeds from approved multiplication centers
and distributes them through its own facilities. The above marketing and
distribution arrangements work reasonably well and farmers have timely
access to inputs.
2.22      The Agricultural Marketing Enterprise (Empresa de Comercio Agricola),
an autonomous public agency, is the most important purchasing agent for grains
from producers and sells them to private wholesalers. Other enterprises,
such as I&NSA (sugar) and COMARSA (oilseed)(para 2.15), deal with the marketing
of agricultural produce.  Meat, dairy products, wool, wine, tubers and fruits
are marketed by individual producers and by cooperatives. The above are
workable arrangements, but they need improvement.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
3.01      The Project would be part of and would support the Government's 1975
agricultural lending program; it would help finance short-term production inputs
such as fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and other direct costs (contracting of
services), and medium-term investment costs such as those for machinery and
equipment, benefitting about 23,h00 small- and medium-size farmers through some
15,000 sub-loans. The Project would also support studies leading toward the
reorganization of public services for the agricultural sector. The Republic
of Chile would be the borrower and be responsible for the execution of the
latter part of the Project, while the Central Bank (CB) would be executing
agency for the credit component of the Project. BE, CORFO, INDAP and, possibly,
commercial banks, would participate in the lending program.
3.02      The following table shows the typical farm size, average cost per
beneficiary and the expected distribution of Project beneficiaries:

B. Detailed Features
3.03      It is estimated that the sector would require about US$277 million
equivalent for the four main input categories in 1975. These are fertilizers,
US$178 million- seeds, US$40 million; pesticides, US$10 million; and
m$t9 million_. ThSe  o5vernment plans to make aotea  -urS$200 million
equi r'±en avilable  oBE and other lending institutions for financing these
items. The balance is expected to be supplied by the farmers themselves,
partly in cash and partly out of stored seed reserves.
3.04      The agricultural credit demand, at this point in time, is strongly
short-term oriented. This is true partly because the Government's objective
is to increase productivity and production of annual crops, principally
wheat, through adequate price and credit policies, and more importantly,
because of the present ownership structure and status in the sector. About
40% of the arable land is now farmed by the "reformed sector." While 'the
status of this group has been clarified regarding final ownership (para 3.06),
practically all the land is still operated by groups of farmers who are not



- 10 -
prepare- to make medium/long-term investments until a definite title has
been granted. The sector classified as "private" is also primarily requesting
short-term credit, but, as it is gradually becoming more confident about
its future, it will also be interested in making more long-term investments.
Regarding the small farmer sector, its needs are also largely in short-
term credit.  Medium-term credit, particularly in the southern provinces
of Valdivia, Osorno, and Llanquihue where dairy farmers are located, is
needed to replace old equipment (milking equipment, hay-bailers , and tractors).
3.05      The portion of the Bank loan of US$19.7 million which would support
the lending program represents about 10% of the Government's total credit
program for 1975 and would supplement a US$22 million IDB loan to BE, made
in March 1974, principally for medium- and long-term investments in agri-
culture. Credit would be granted principally in the Central Valley between
and including the provinces of Aconcagua and Llanquihue, the area having
the best lands of the country and where about 90% of the agricultural and
livestock production originates. It is in these provinces that 90% of the
expropriated land is located. Because of the growing confidence of farmers
in the Government's new policy, there is an increasing demand for short-
term production credit and medium-term loans for the acquisition of farm
machinery and equipment. A total of 80% of Project funds is expected to be
used for short term and 20% for medium term.
3.06      The Project has been formulated, and will be implemented, within
the context of a series of measures on agrarian reform, agricultural commodity
price policies, and institutional reorganization.  These measures are con-
"idered, by both tuhe Bank and the Government, to be urgent and vital to
sound agricultural development. They are to:
(a)  provide beneficiaries of the land reform with land titles,
either to individuals or to cooperatives and other
associations according to the particular conditions and
wishes of the beneficiaries (para 2.13). To this effect,
the Government would implement a three-year program to
grant title to all expropriated land and provide CORA with
all necessary resources to achieve this. CORA would maintain
its five teams (para 2.14) until April 1, 1975, and not later
than 30 days after signing of the loan agreement, it will
organize and maintain, through contracts, at least 15 technical
teams and the appropriate number of lawyers to carry out the
granting of land titles. The composition, number of teams
and necessary resources for this would be reviewed as required
and not later than at the end of each year so as to enable
CORA to distribute not less than 15,000 titles during 1975, not
less than 20,000 titles during 1976 and the balance during
1977. Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations;



(b) continue to liberalize agricultural commodity prices in line
with supply and demand conditions. (Until September 1973, a
complex system of direct and indirect produce subsidies was
combined with an overvalued exchange rate, permitting the
import of food at low prices (in escudos).) In particular,
the Government would continue to allow imports and exports
of agricultural products so as to reduce local shortages
and surpluses, together with policy measures to avoid dis-
ruptive price fluctuations in a manner compatible with
incentives to farmers. To this end, the Government would
endeavor to assure farm-gate prices which would be in line
with world market prices. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations; and
(c)  undertake a study regarding the role and possible reorgani-
zation and consolidation of the numerous agencies providing
public services to the agricultural sector (para 2.20) and
formulate an implementation plan for reforms. The study
would be undertaken by consultants on behalf of the Govern-
ment. Terms of reference of the study have been prepared and
mutually agreed by the Bank and the Government during negoti-
ations. The terms and conditions of employment would be
submitted to the Bank for its approval within 45 days from the
the date of the Loan Agreement. The implementation plan and
its timing would be reviewed by the Government in consultation
with the Bank. Assurances to this effect were obtained during
negotiations.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Cost Estimates
3.07      Total Project cost is estimated at US$55.5 million equivalent,
of which 52%, or US$28.9 million, would be foreign exchange.  Cost estimates,
including foreign exchange requirements, are:

by a Bank loan of US$20 million equivalent (36% of Project cost). The
Government would contribute US$19.8 million equivalent (36%)and the remaining
US$15.7 million equivalent would come from the sub-borrowers' contribution
(28% of Project costs). The financing plan for individual components of
the Project is summarized in the following table:

The Republic of Chile would be the borrower of the Bank loan and carry the
exchange risk. The Bank loan of US$20 million would be for 20 years, including
four years of grace, at the standard rate of interest. The Government would
on-lend the proceeds of the loan through the Central Bank (CB) to partici-
pating banks and lending agencies.  CB would establish a Project Account
to which the Government would, as a condition of loan effectiveness, make avail-
able US$10 million equivalent to start lending operations and agree to maintain
sufficient amounts available therein until the equivalent of US$39.4 million
of sub-loans had been lent to Project beneficiaries. Sub-loan r.epaments
from the Project would accrue to the Project Account in CB and amounts not
required tC5-meet amortit.ation payments on the Bank loan would be used for
further lendihg-ftr1-h&-r dictui1 sector.  Assurances on the above were
obtained during negotiations.
3.09      The Government would on-lend under subsidiary loan agreements to
participating banks and lending agencies. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations. Such agreements would specify the types
of sub-loans eligible, the percentage to be financed, the rate of interest,
maturity dates, methods of repayment, procurement and audit. The signing of
such subsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to the Bank, between the Govern-
ment and BE, INDAP and CORFO would be conditions of effectiveness (para 3.01).



- 14 -
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
3.10      The main items to be financed under the Project would be fertilizers,
seeds, pesticides and machinery. BE is the main importer and distributor of
fertil;zers and seeds. For imported fertilizer procurement, BE seeks
quotations from several suppliers; for seed imports, BE buys on the basis
of quotations from countries in which adapted varieties are available.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that BE would continue the
above procedures and obtain at least three quotations of suppliers from Bank
member countries and Switzerland. Farmers would purchase machinery, equip-
ment and pesticides of their choice through existing commercial channels-
major suppliers of farm machinery from at least six Bank member countries
are represented in Chile and have reopened sales services. Similarly, for
pesticides, insecticides and herbicides.  there are at least five representatives
of international manufacturers with sales outlets in the country, assuring
effective competition.   Foreign exchange is made available to importers by CB.
Disbursement
3.11      The Bank would disburse to CB 50% of loan amounts disbursed by
participating banks and agencies to Project beneficiaries, which CB would
certify and document appropriately. Disbursement to sub-borrowers is expected
to take less than one year, and disbursement from the Bank would also be
expected to be completed within about one year. For the organizational study,
the Bank would disburse 100% of the foreign exchange expenditures.
E. Administration of the Credit Component
3.12      A Project Commission would be set up under the chairmanship of CB
and act as administering agency for the credit component of the Project. The
Commission would be composed of representatives of the Mini.stries of Finance,
Economy, and Agriculture and members of the participating banks and lending
agencies. The Commission would be responsible for supervision, coordination
and implementation of the credit component of the Project. The composition
of the Project Commission and its responsibilities were agreed with the Bank
during negotiations and its establishment would be a condition of effectiveness.
3.13      Sub-loans to Project beneficiaries would be made by participating
banks and lending agencies.  BE, the principal agricultural credit agency
in Chile, would be dealing with all types of farms except those below 5 basic
ha for which INDAP is specialized and would be responsible.  CORFO, according
to its specialization and experience, would extend credit mainly to dairy
and meat producing farmers. It is expected that these three organizations
together would carry out most, if not all, of the credit component of the
Project.



- 15 -
3.14      BE has some 206 offices throughout the country and INDAP 9h, while
CORFO is more concentrated in the southern provinces where dairy and meat
producing farmers are located. The three agencies have a large number of
agricultural technical staff: BE, 400 (about 300 in the field); INDAP, 600
(300 in the field); and CORFO, 170 (90 in the field). They are sufficiently
organized to execute the Project. Those commercial banks that would be
willing to participate under the Project but which do not have qualified
technicians available could contract such technicians from the extension
services of the Ministry of Agriculture, numbering about 1,500, and from
private sources.
Lending Policies and Procedures
3.15      Loan Appraisal and Supervision.  Participating banks and lending
--agencies       a  app_pve and finance only loans made on the basis of farm
plans for medium-term investments, and on the basis of farm plans using re-
gionally established cost/price relationships per crop for short-term costs,
in either case subject to the approval of qualified technicians so as to
ensure the possibility of increased production and the farmer's potential for
repaymentjb(b) finance up to 100% of fertilizerso, seeds and pesticides and
up to 40% of other direct production costs (i.e., ploughing, weeding) for
short-term loans and up to 80% of costs of medium-term investments for not
longer than six years; (c) disburse for fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and
machinery and equipment in cash against supplier's invoices or in kind; (d)
disburse against purchases of livestock which qualify as breeding stock (less
than four years old) with health certificates indicating vaccination against
aphtosa and immunization against brucellosis; and (e) have a Project Account
that identified loans made, repayments from farmers and reimbursements made
to CB. The above procedures would not be altered without the prior approval
of the Bank. Assurances to this effect were obtained.
3.16      Lending Terms and Conditions.  The CB, from the Project Account,
would finance loans granted by participating banks and lending agencies in
accordance with the following schedule:
Interest
Amount of         Rate to          Interest
Loans to              Loan Financed   Participating        Rate to
Beneficiaries             by CB (%)        Agencies       Beneficiaries
Short term (six
months to one year)        100%        190% nominal    200% nominal
Medium term
(one to six years)         100%          6% indexed      8% indexed



- 16 -
3.17      The proposed interest rate to Project beneficiaries for short-term
lending (200% nominal) is equal to the lending rate introduced in July 1974
by CB. Prior to that, the rate was 60% nominal. The present rate reflects
the Government's policy to charge, in principle, positive interest rates to
the agricultural sector and gradually reduce subsidies to credit agencies.
This also is expected to encourage commercial banks to lend more to the
sector.  The 200% rate is expected to cover inflation in 1975 but it would be
reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted at least on a quarterly basis, in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank, to take account of the prevailing and
expected rate of inflation.  For medium-term lending, an interest rate of
8%, adjusted on the basis of Chile's Consumer Price Index (CPI), would be
charged.  The present higher rates are within the farmers' capacity to repay
as shown in benefit/cost ratios of four principal crops which are in the
order of 3:1 (para 4.03 and Annex 7, Table 1). The high demand for credit
which was prevailing throughout the 1974 planting season until the end of
September indicates that farmers have not been discouraged to borrow at those
rates. Participating agencies would bear the financial risk. Assurances
on the above conditions were obtained during negotiations.
F. Accounting and Auditing
3.18      The General Controller's Office (GCO), which operates in an independent
manner, would continue to act as external auditor of the participating public
agencies and would be appointed also as external auditor of the Project
Accounts in CB and in the participating agencies and banks. Assurances were
obtained that GCO would submit to the Bank certified and audited accounts
of all Project operations not later than four months after the end of each
fiscal year.
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01      Direct beneficiaries of Project lending would be some 22,000 small
farmer families, belonging to Chile's lower 40% income group; the balance
would be about 1,000 medium-size farmers. The provision of credit and
technical assistance to these farmers would help increase their productivity
and their standard of living.
4.02      The Project would form part of a much larger Government agricultural
credit program, designed mainly to finance annual crop production costs. About
three-fourths is expected to be used to finance grains (wheat, maize, barley,
oats and rye), while the remaining portion would be used mostly for potatoes,
vegetable oils and pasture production. The Government strongly encourages
wheat production, which is the dominating agricultural import commodity
(about US$200 million, or two-fifths of all food imports in 1974), and the



- 17 -
immediate objective is to restore production to the 1970 level and expand
thereafter. This is particularly important since food imports have risen
drastically between 1965 and 1974 (from US$140 million to about US$472
million in 1974)(para 2.05).  Considering that wheat production in 1973 was
only 57% in comparison to 1970, substantial increases are feasible, provided
adequate inputs are available and that prices are attractive to producers.
In August 1974, the Government announced a minimum wheat price at the farm-
gate of EO 240,000 per ton, which was equal to US$200/ton. This has resulted
in strong demand for production credit. Planting of wheat in 1974 increased
over 1973 by 67,000 ha, or 13%; other cereals increased also by 82,000 ha,
or 33%, over the same period. Major agricultural crop production in 1974
increased by 12% as compared to 1973, but this was still below the 1970 level.
4.03      An analyu±s has been made of four major crops occupying together
some three-fourths of Chile's crop land. It is expected that the major part
of the Project-financed inputs would be used to produce these crops. The
analysis indicates that the use of fertilizer and other inputs to be financed
under the Project for intensive cultivation, particularly under irrigated
conditions, would be attractive to the farmer and fully justified econcically.
Financial benefit/cost ratios are expected to be in the order of 3:1 for
various crops (Annex 7, Table 1), equivalent to rates of return of about
200%. These high returns are to be expected in a project of this kind which
provides critical inputs into an existing farming system which includes
irrigated land and a high level of technical services. It is expected that
intensive production inputs will absorb most of the credit provided under
the Project. Even under rainfed conditions, the returns using fertilizer
are satisfactory. The economic benefits to the country would be close to
the financial returns to individual farmers, since domestic prices of both
agricultural inputs and produce would be maintained at approximately the
levels prevailing internationally. Economic benefits would, in fact, be
slightly higher than financial benefits, because import taxes on inputs,
which range between US$14 and US$29 per ha, depending on the crop (Annex 7)
are included in the financial calculations.  Returns on medium-term loans,
representing a small part of the Project, have not been calculated--these
investments are mostly for replacement of existing items of machinery in
ongoing enterprises, and the review procedures outlined in para 3.15 above
will ensure that financial and economic returns are satisfactory.
4.04      The credit program would also make an important contribution to
the country's balance of payments, by reducing the need for agricultural
imports. It is estimated that food imports in 1976 would be reduced by
over US$200 million equivalent less than the 1974 level.
4.05      The Project would also have substantial indirect benefits.  It has
been developed as an integral part of the Government's broader approach to
the agricultural sector, revolving around three policy measures in particular.
Firstly, the land titling program is an essential step in consolidating the
agrarian reform and so providing the security of tenure on which any future
long-term agricultural investments will be based. Secondly, assuring



- 18 -
appropriate price policies for agricultural inputs and outputs will lead to
a rapid restoration of agricultural production. And thirdly, the studies
to be financed under the Project will lead to a more efficient set of public
services for the agricultural sector.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOfMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal points that the Government would:
(a)  implement a three-year program to distribute all expropriated
land to land reform beneficiaries, issue not less than 15,000
titles during 1975, not less than 20,000 titles during 1976
and the remaining during 1977, and cause CORA to employ and
maintain at least 15 technical teams and the appropriate
number of lawyers to carry out the granting of land titles
(para 3.06(a));
(b)  implement a price policy for agricultural products to allow
market forces to bring about farm prices on the basis of
supply and demand conditions (para 3.06(b)); and
(c)  undertake a study and formulate an implementation plan
regarding the role and possible reorganization and consoli-
dation of the numerous agencies providing public services
to the agricultural sector (para 3.06(c)).
5.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a)  a Project Account had been established and the Government
had made available US$10 million equivalent to it (para 3.08);
(b)  the Government had entered into subsidiary loan agreements
with BE, INDAP and CORFO (para 3.09); and
(c)  the Project Cormission had been established (para 3.12).
5.03      With the foregoing assurances, the proposed Project is suitable
for a Bank loan to the Republic of Chile of US$20 million for a term of
20 years, including four years of grace.

The Land Reform Institute (CORA)
Organization and Management
1.        CORA (Corporacion de Reforma Agraria) was created under the
Agrarian Reform law of 1962 as a semi-autonomous public institution under
the general direction of the Minister of Agriculture, who is its president.
CORA's president ensures that the Government policies are implemented and
exercises the general supervision of the agency. The executive vice-
president is the highest authority on day-to-day decisions. CORA's main
departments are: land tenure, which is responsible for determining the
status of ownership of lands affected by the agrarian reform; legal, which
supports land tenure in processing claims and finalizing legal aspects of
land tenure and ownership; production, which is directly responsible for
managing lands which are either owned by CORA or cooperatives, workers'
committees, and others; and finance, which handles budget requests and fund
allocations. CORA fulfills its duties through 16 regional offices all over
Chile and 94 area offices.
Staffing
2.        CORA staff numbered just slightly below 3,500 employees at August 31,
1974. These are divided as follows:

During 1974 CORA has reduced its staff by releasing employees without
professional qualifications. This process will continue in 1975 in keeping
with CORA's needs.
Programs, Policies and Procedures
3.        CORA has two main ongoing activities:  (a) a program to distribute
about 60,000 land titles; and (b) management of the 3,500 asentamientos,
e.g., expropriated land not yet distributed. A by-product of (a) above is
the final settlement of claims of original owners of expropriated lands.
4.        It is the Government's policy to provide all "reformados" with
individual land titles unless this is technically or economically unfeasible,
or when reformados specifically wish to own lands under communal arrange-
ments. CORA plans to accelerate distribution of land titles as its top
priority and expects to finish this in no more than three years ending in
1977. In the meantime, it plans to pass over gradually to the Agricultural
and Livestock Service (SAG) and other public bodies the management of
asentamientos.
5.        Procedures for land titling:  the assignment of land requires in
each cases a soil survey, the preparation of a cadastral map showing the
lot-size to be assigned, the selection of qualified beneficiaries, and finally
the title issue process, which in itself is lengthy and complex. There
are presently five land titling teams working in the field. Each team com-
prises a staff of 25--agronomists, civil engineers, surveyors, lawyers,
technicians and supporting staff. So far, each team has been able to
prepare about 250 titles per month, but, in difficult cases, where, for
instance, irrigation facilities must be changed, the process is much slower.
Although 5,600 land titles were granted between September 1974 and January 16,
1975, each team is expected to average only some 200 titles per month in
future. On this basis, the land titling process would take some five years.
The Government has decided to accelerate the land titling and reduce the
time frame to three years. Therefore, the Government is increasing CORA's
capacity by making contracts for defined areas with groups and/or firms to
carry out the technical-economic components of the land titling process
such as soil surveys, land use, cropping pattern, water rights and pre-
paration of farm-size units; in addition, it will employ lawyers for the
preparation of title deeds and their recording in the appropriate land
registry. CORA will supervise the technical teams and lawyers contracted
and select the beneficiaries for the granting of land titles.  To this
effect, the Government would implement a three-year program to grant
title to all expropriated land and provide CORA with all necessary resources
to achieve this. CORA would maintain its five teams until April 1, 1975
after which it will organize and maintain at least 15 technical teams and
the appropriate number of lawyers to carry out the granting of land titles.
The composition, number of teams and necessary resources for this would
be reviewed as required and not later than at the end of each year so as
to enable CORA to distribute not less than 15,000 titles for 1975, not less
than 20,000 titles for 1976 and the balance during 1977.

7.        As can be seen fro- the above, CORA's income is derived mostly
from the Government tadget zLocations.  Of expenditures, one-third is for
current operations, and two-thirds for specific programs and capital
investments.  Within the latter more than one-half is being spent on land
titling and the balance (US$5.4 million only), on production in expro-
priated farms. This reflects clearly the Government's priorities.
8.        In the 1975 budget, efforts will be made to reduce the size of
the general staff and to allocate more funds to the hiring of outside
land titling teams. The production program (including farm infrastructure
activities) is to be transferred to other Government agencies, leaving
CORA with the exclusive responsibility of regularizing land tenure in
agrarian reform areas.
Accounting and Auditing
9.        CORA operates centralized accounting and internal auditing
mechanisms. These are deemed adequate. External auditing is performed
adequately by the Government's Controller's Office.

Banco del Estado (BE) and Commercial Banks
A. Banco del Estado (EE)
General
1.        BE is a government-owned autonomous public institution established
in 1953 under a decree with the authority of a law (D.F.L. 126). Its main
objectives are: (a) to engage in banking operations, emphasizing those which
are development-oriented; and (b) to supply agricultural inputs. BE accepts
both current and savings deposits from the general public and acts as the
banking and financial agent for the public sector.
Organization, Management and Staffing
2.        The general manager handles all day-to-day operations and is
assisted by the deputy general manager. BE's main operational departments
are:  foreign trade, savings, development, operations, agriculture, and
trust funds. Supporting departments include: general secretariat, con-
trollers, personnel, data processing, policies, inspection, auditing and
public relations.
3.        BE's management is generally competent.  Lines and levels of
responsibility are well defined and provide the staff with the necessary
authority at the main levels. BE is presently studying the possibility
of delegating more powers to its regional and local offices to improve
efficiency and speed-up operations.
4.        BE has 206 branches and agencies throughout Chile, as well as
a similar number of warehouses used for the distribution of agricultural
inputs to farmers. The staff numbers 8,000, of whom about 400 are pro-
fessional and technical, while the balance is mostly administrative.
Recruitment is based on merit and promotions are given on the basis of
performance (improved by training courses given on a regular basis) and
seniority. These have ensured a relatively high quality of staff.
Agricultural Lending Policies and Procedures
5.        Within agriculture BE has traditionally concentrated on lending
to medium-size and large farmers for short-term purposes based mostly on
the value of security offered. More recently, however, BE has increased
lending to the reformed sector which today accounts for about 36% of loan



ANNEX 4
Page 2
volume (para 13). Loan processing is rapid, and more than half of the loan
volume is given in kind in the form of inputs distributed by BE itself
(para 13). BE's future role in agriculture will be determined in the con-
text of the Government's plan to reorganize public agencies dealing with
agriculture.
Financial Structure and Condition
6.        BE's own resources (US$54 million at December 31, 1973) are small
in relation to its portfolio (US$474 million) and have been used to carry
out fixed investments. Therefore, BE depends on external resources, which
are mostly deposits and Central Bank advances (made at nominal interest
rates below 7% per annum) for lending, most of it on a short-term basis.
However, the availability of current deposits for lending is limited by the
freezing of deposits of State enterprises and agencies, which represented
about three-fourths of current deposits and almost 30% of liabilities at
the end of 1973 (by law these could not be used for any purposes whatsoever).
This had made it imperative for BE: (a) to obtain the Government transfers
to maintain and expand its volume of lending; and (b) to obtain these at
highly subsidized nominal interest rates (below 10%) to provide an adequate
interest spread to BE (10 to 50 percentage points under rates of inflation
which increased to more than 500% per annum in 1973) to cover operating
costs (Tables 1 and 2).
7.        The low volume of lending compared to total assets has been due
to heavy BE commitments to buy the Government paper, make provisions for
value readjustments of savings deposits, and purchases of foreign exchange
to defray the future costs mainly of foodstuff imports. These operations
reflect the importance of BE as financial agent for the Government.
8.        In summary, during the 1969-1973 period, BE's banking activities
were carried out under severe constraints dictated by the Government and,
therefore, it was appropriate for the Government to compensate BE to help
neutralize the effects of those constraints. In the process, however,
BE lost its financial independence and was forced to act more as a Govern-
ment agent and less as a banking/development institution.
9.        BE's commercial operations (purchase and distribution of agri-
cultural inputs) were carried out satisfactorily and roughly broke even
in terms of income and expensesi/.
10.       Since July 1974, the Government has allowed BE to increase its
short-term nominal lending rate to all customers from 60% to 200% per annum
(while medium- and long-term loans remain fully indexed and bear an 8% annual
interest rate).
1/ Therefore, they were netted out of the income and expense account.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
11.       The Government intends to encourage the supply of agricultural
inputs by private enterprise. This would introduce competition and provide
additional flexibility to such an important aspect of agricultural pro-
duction, as well as reduce the relative size of BE's non-banking functions.
12.       Loan Portfolio.  Loans to agriculture represented 45%, and to
industry and trade 47%, of the loan portfolio at December 31, 1973. Within
agriculture, 90% went to crop production, and 10% to livestock. Overdue and
delinquent loans represented only 2% of the loans outstanding at December 31,
1973. This must be viewed, however, in the context of lending terms existing
at that time which allowed borrowers to liquidate their debts with only par-
tial payments in real terms (since loan amounts were not indexed) plus con-
stant rollovers of short-term debts.
13.       BE's estimated lending to agriculture for 1974 was 90% of total
agricultural lending as follows:
US$ Million
Equivalent        %         %
BE Lending Volume                         400          100        -
Agricultural Lending                      170            43      100
of which:
a.  Short term                      150            38        88
Medium and long term             20             5        12
b.  Reformed sector                   61           15        36
Other                           109            28        64
c.  Lin cash                         75            19        44
In kind                          95            24       56
Close to 90% of all agricultural lending was short term to satisfy the
most pressing needs, e.g., fertilizers, seeds, insecticides/pesticides,
fuel and labor for increasing annual crop production.  Sightly more than
one-third (about 20% above the 1973 level) of agricultural lending was to
the reformed sector.  A very large percentage of credit was in kind because
of BE's paramount role in the purchase and distribution of inputs, especially
of fertilizer.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Accounting and Auditing
14.       BE has a reasonably good financial data gathering system and is
in the process of centralizing it further, and of improving its presenta-
tion for analytical purposes and management decisions. Internal auditing
is the responsibility of a specialized unit and external auditing is satis-
factorily carried out by the Government's Controller's Office.
Conclusion and Future Outlook
15.       BE is expected to continue playing the leading role in lending
to ultimate users (including reformados with individual land titles) and
an important role in the market4ing of agricultural inputs in the context
of the Government's plan to reorganize public agencies dealing with agriculture,
and given BE's large staff, country-wide organization, experience, and present
and estimated financial condition.
B. Comercial Banks
16.       During the 1970-73 period, the Government made a strong drive to
acquire control over private commercial banks, chiefly through the purchase
of a majority of their capital stock. However, there are now plans to re-
turn large portions of the stock acquired during the 1970-73 period to the
private sector. The Superintendency of Banks is also considering the feasi-
bility of merging several small banks into larger ones to improve solvency
and operational efficiency.
17.       At June 30, 1974, commercial banks held about one-half of total
bank deposits, and almost one-half of total loans outstanding.  These pro-
portions are expected to increase with the progressive return to private
hands of many enterprises taken over by Government during the 1970-73 period.
18.       Commercial banks' lending to agriculture was substantial in the past
but is now negligible.  In 1963 aocut 49% of total agricultural credit was
undertaken by commercial banks. 17his, however, has been declining since:
it was about 18% in 1970 and only 4% in 1973. The present Government is en-
couraging commercial banks to lend more to agriculture but no substantial
change in their share is expected during 1975. Thus, only a relatively minor
participation of commercial banks is expected under the Project.
19.       The future participation of commercial banks in the financing
of agriculture will depend to a large extent on the general lending terms
and conditions allowed by the Government, which should provide these banks with
adequate profit incentives, liquidity and security, as well as avoid dis-
criminatory practices which have favored public credit agencies in the past.

AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION PROJECT
The Development Corporation (CORFO)
General
1.        The Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO) is a
government-owned development corporation reporting to the Ministry of
Economy. It was formed in 1939 under Law No. 6,640 and granted autonomy
in 1952 under Law No. 10,343. It has handled many developing projects
aimed at increasing domestic production. In the agricultural field it
controls: all sugar refining, oilseed processing, public sector agricul-
tural machinery pools, grain storage, a substantial share of poultry
production and of freezing capacity for fruits and meats, and a less
important share of processing of wine and other agricultural commodities.
These activities are undertaken through autonomous corporations where
CORFO has majority ownership. Furthermore, CORFO provides technical
services, recommends investment priorities, stimulates applied research,
and carries out a wide range of agricultural and industrial development
projects. Two other important functions of CORFO involve a promotional
role in the creation of a capital market, and an advisory one in determining
the most efficient resource allocation of fiscal revenues. The corporation
is also authorized to negotiate external loans requiring Government
guarantees.
Organization, Management and Staffing
2.        The Executive Vice-President is the direct representative of the
Government with extensive powers to implement Government policy. He appoints
the General Manager and all other CORFO personnel. The General Manager and
his deputy handle all day-to-day affairs. Management is exercised primarily
through four departments: planning, financial operations, development and
business enterprises. Each of these major departments has deputy managers
and several divisional groups. Since 1960, CORFO has followed a policy of
administrative decentralization, and a series of regional offices has been
established throughout the country. The organizational structure and
administrative functions are subject to modifications upon the decision of
the Executive Vice-President.
3.        The size of CORFO's staff increased from 1,800 to 4,500 between
1970 and 1973 parallel to CORFO takeovers of private enterprises and
increased role in the economy of the country. Since September 1973 the
staff has been drastically reduced, but by September 197h, CORFO had a
professional and administrative staff sufficient to carry out the broad
range of development activities in which it is involved. Staff are clas-
sified as follows:

Professionals             649
Technicians               598
Administrative          1,175
Total Staff:          2.h22
4.         Agronomists number 123 and agricultural technicians 47 for a
total of 170. Of these, 90 are stationed in field offices.
Policies and Procedures
5.         Since September 1973 CORFO is:  (a) returning to their owners
expropriated enterprises which were expropriated in violation of the law;
(b) in the process of divesting itself through selling of most of its medium
size and small enterprises; (c) endeavoring to operate its major enter-
prises, e.g., power, steel, petroleum, telecommunications and sugar
processing efficiently; and (d) helping to develop new industries, but
transferring control to the private sector as soon as they become profitable.
CORFO's role in agriculture is to be determined in the context of the
proposed study of the responsibility and activities of public sector
agencies dealing with agriculture.
60         Investment decisions are taken by CORFO's executive committee
together with managers of the enterprises involved. Borrowing abroad was
formerly conducted by CORFO on its own, but the Government has now subjected
all external borrowing to stricter controls.
Financial Structure and Condition
70         CORFO's resources at December 31, 1973 were as follows:  capital
and reserves--US$902 million equivalent, or 51%; medium- and long-term
borrowings--US$538 million, or 30%; and short-term borrowings--US$331 million,
or 19%. CORFO had invested in fixed assets, participations and loans with
maturities of over 12 months about 91% of its resources. CORFO's liquidity,
therefore, has been seriously compromised by the channeling of short-term
borrowing into medium- and long-term use. Furthermore, there are serious
doubts as to the real value and collectability of medium-term loans and
investments made by CORFO during the 1970-1973 period (para l0)o
8.         CORFO was barely breaking even in 1971 (since net income was
barely larger than Government transfers for that year), but lost heavily
(US$199 million equivalent) in 1972 and less heavily, but still substantially
(US$86 million equivalent), in 1973.
Loan Portfolio
90         About 23% of the short-term loan portfolio, or US$33 million,
was in arrears at December 31, 1973. No comparable analysis of the medium-
and long-term portfolio is available, but arrears are likely to be substan-
tial also0 These are due also to the rapid deterioration of the country's
economy from 1971 to 1973 and to the difficulties of collecting loans.

Future Outlook
11.        CORFO's income is expected to improve with measures now being
taken (within a major rehabilitation program to be carried out through
the end of 1975) to put its major enterprises on a sound commercial footing
in the context of an overall improved economic situation.
12.        CORFO expects to sell property for about US$30 million in 1974
(of which US$10 million would be in cash) and for another US$20 million in
1975. This not only would represent a major increase in available funds
but would also reduce substantially a number of CORFO's money-losing operations.
Accounting and Auditing
130        CORFO's accounting was seriously disrupted by the disorganization
of management and administration prevailing in 1971 to 1973. Many of the
expropriated enterprises did not keep adequate records. Therefore, CORFO
needs to improve substantially its bookkeeping and to make a thorough
analysis of its assets and liabilitieso This requirement is supported by
Government's General Controller's Office, which is CORFO's external auditor.
Conclusion
140        CORFO's administrative and financial condition deteriorated
markedly up to the end of 1973. Government has taken measures to reorganize,
consolidate and improve CORFO's operations, and preliminary results look
promising. CORFO would be in a position to contribute limited financing
and technical assistance in the context of the proposed Project.

General
1.        INDAP was created in 1963 as an autonomous public entity under
the general supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture0 Its main objec-
tive is to help improve the economic condition of poor smallholders and
fis. ermen, mainly through the provision of credit and technical assistance.
Organization, Management and Staffing
2.        INDAP's Council establishes policies and priorities, and decides
on the most important matters. The Council comprises representatives of
the Ministry of Agriculture, INDAP, CORA, SAG, BE and smallholders.  INDAP's
executive vice-president, assisted by the general manager, handles day-to-
day affairs. There are ti:o main operating units: Technical Assistance
and Credit, and Social Development, as well as five support units: Finance,
Administration, Planning, Communications and Auditing.
3.        Staff number about 2,500 (down from 3,400 in 1973), distributed
among headquarters, 16 regional, and 94 area offices. Permanent staff are
classified as follows: professional, 600; administration and services,
1,680.
Agricultural Policies and Procedures
4.        INDAP only assists small farmers who are not creditworthy under
conventional banking criteria. Under present circumstances this includes
mostly farmers who own less than 5 basic ha (Annex 3).
This category comprises about 60,000 farmers who have an average 3.5
basic ha and 80,000 farmers with less than 1 basic ha. Credit is mainly
channeled through producers' cooperatives and other farmers' organizations.
Credit operations are subject to Central Bank regulations.
Financial Structure and Condition
5.        Government transfers are INDAP's most important source of revenue0
These are justified on social grounds, given the high cost of assistance
per beneficiary and the latter's scarce financial resources.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
6.        The financial statements contained in Tables 1 and 2 must be
viewed in this context. They show that Government has given substantial
subsidies to INDAP in the form of non-repayable transfers, which amounted
to almost US$16 million in 1973, or slightly more than 50% of expenses for
that year.
Accounting and Auditing
7.        Internal accounting and auditing has been poor in recent years.
The preliminary external auditors' report submitted by the Government's
Controller's Office for the year ending June 30, 1974 expressed the view
that INDAP needed a thorough overhaul of its accounting system and a re-
evaluation of each category of assets and liabilities before meaningful
accounts could be prepared.
Future Outlook
INDAP's objectives and operations are being reviewed within the
reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture, and Government plans to
improve INDAP's performance through more careful selection and organization
of staff. The Government also plans to make a greater effort to help the
60,000 families which own an average 3.5 basic ha, to make their farms
economically viable. Those who own on average 1 basic ha (80,000 families)
as well as the landless (200,000 families) would be helped through the
provision of new employment opportunities, mostly outside of agriculture.
