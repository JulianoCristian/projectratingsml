INTERNATIONAL BANK FMR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE FOR AN AGRICULTURAL
REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of $20.0
million to help finance an agricultural rehabilitation project. The
loan would have a term of 20 years, including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.       Apart from the technical assistance loan negotiated with
the Allende Government, the proposed loan would constitute the first
lending operation in Chile since 1970 and, in view of the special
circumstances surrounding this case, it has seemed to me desirable
to preface this President's Report with an account of our relations
with Chile in the intervening period.
3.       In recent years the public's view of the Bank's relations
with Chile has been deeply colored by political events in the country,
though the Bank's management, in accordance with the Articles of
Agreement, confined its attention to Chile's economic needs and
capabilities.
4.       The election of President Allende, on a Marxist ticket in
the fall of 1970, led to a number of rumors of a boycott of the regime
by some of our member states. We were anxious to indicate clearly and
immediately that the Bank could have no part in such political discrim-
ination. Therefore, within a few days of the Allende election I took
the opportunity of an interview with the Wall Street Journal to state
for publication that we expected to continue our lending to Chile. I
followed up with personal messages to President Allende, through
Senor Felipe Herrera, then President of the Inter-American Development
Bank, and Senor Galo Plaza, Secretary General of the Organization of
the American States, indicating the desire of the Bank to carry on
supporting the Chilean economic development program. This was
reconfirmed by the then Director of the South America Department to
President Allende and other Chilean officials during a visit to Chile
early in 1971 to clarify the Government's position on several project
issues which might cause problems. During a visit to Washington in
February 1971 the Minister of Economy, Mr. Vuskovic, was again told by
the Bank of its willingness to assist in Chile's development efforts.



-2-
5.       The Bank continued disbursing funds on its existing projects
in Chile, but in 1971 the negotiations for new projects ran into
difficulties and delays not of our making. At the same time we
received disturbing reports of the rapid deterioration of the Chilean
economy.
6.       We informed the Chilean authorities on several occasions
that this constituted a real threat to Chile's creditworthiness and
the Bank's ability to make loans to Chile.
7.       In the course of 1972 the Chilean authorities began a
campaign charging that the Bank was refusing to lend to them under
pressure from the United States, which was involved in a dispute over
the nationalization of the property of some of its nationals. This
charge was made by the Chilean Governor at the Annual Meeting in
September 1972. We replied forcefully but privately. The charge was
repeated by the Chilean Ambassador to the U.N. Economic and Social
Council when I addressed it in October 1972 and I was obliged to reply
oublicly by stating to the Council:
"The Ambassador stated the Bank was not lending to Chile
because the U.S. Government directed that there be no
loans to Chile following the nationalization of the
property of certain U.S. nationals. Such is not the case.
For a quarter of a century, the Bank has followed a policy
relating to nationalization of property which has been
determined by its member governments and which is founded
on accepted principles of international law. Whether or
not Chile has acted in accordance with such a policy has
not been determined. The question has not yet arisen
because the primary condition for Bank lending, a soundly
managed economy with a potential for utilizing effi-
ciently additional external funds has not been met. The
Chilean economy is in such a state of disorder that it
is impossible to conceive of how Bank funds could be
utilized productively to the benefit of the Chilean
people and with a reasonable probability of repayment."
8.       However, we did not despair of improving our relations with
President Allende's Government. In early 1973 the Government charged
that the Bank's project pipeline was empty and stated this indicated
to them that we had no intention of resuming lending even if the
economic weaknesses to which I referred to above were to be corrected.
We replied by proposing, in March 1973, a Technical Assistance loan
for pre-investment and project preparation studies as evidence of
the Bank's desire to assist Chile's future development as soon as
its economic situation showed signs of improvement. A mission went
to Chile in July 1973 to appraise this Technical Assistance loan;
the negotiations took place in the field in late July; the loan
documents were circulated to the Board on September 7.



-3
9.       A few days later the Allende regime was ousted.  During the
Annual Meeting (in Nairobi) later in September the new Chilean
Government delegation asked that the Bank continue to process the
loan.  It was approved by the Board February 5, 1974.
10.      The purpose of the project described in this President's
Report is to support the land reform program of the Allende and
previous regimes now being implemented by the present Government.
11.      A question could be raised as to whether the Bank should
proceed with the loan when the country is governed by a military
junta which is alleged to be practicing political oppression. The
present Government of Chile has been accused by several organizations
(including the International Commission of Jurists, the O.A.S. Human
Rights Commission and Amnesty International) of violating the human
and civil rights of its citizens.
12.      As concerned as we are by such charges, the Bank has not
sought to pass judgement on them because our Articles of Agreement
(Article IV, Section 10) prescribe that:
"The Bank and its officers shall not interfere in the
political affairs of any member; nor shall they be
influenced in their decisions by the political character
of the member or members concerned. Only economic
considerations shall be relevant to their decisions, and
these considerations shall be weighed impartially in
order to achieve the purposes stated in Article I."
13.      In accordance with our Articles, I recommend this loan to
you on the grounds that Chile is deemed creditworthy (see Part II
below), and that the project is fully justified on its merits. This
loan will bring substantial benefits to some 22,000 small and dis-
advantaged farmers and their families (130,000 people) and will make
an important contribution to Chile's agricultural production and
balance of payments.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
114.     An economic mission visited Chile in February/March 1974
and its economic report (551-CH) was distributed on October 29, 1974.
Annex I contains country data sheets. The following analysis is
based partly on the findings of the economic mission and partly on
subsequent information gathered on the occasion of an IMF mission
which visited Chile in late 1974 in which Bank staff participated.
The main changes since the economic report was prepared relate to



the world price of copper, which is Chile's principal export. The
official Bank price projections used in the economic report were
made when the seriousness of the world recession had not become
clear, and when copper prices were high. Since then, there has been
a major depression in two of the most important copper-using indus-
tries in the developed world: housing and automobiles. The recently
worked-out government program for 1975 summarized below is based on a
much lower copper price than had been foreseen in the economic report.
15.       The Chilean economy has pronounced structural strengths as
well as weaknesses. Among its assets are a fairly well-educated
labor force, a low rate of population growth, excellent natural
resources (mainly copper, other minerals, forestry, hydro-electric
potential, relatively good agricultural conditions) and comprehensive
social services (public health, education). On the other hand, Chile
relies heavily on copper exports and has become increasingly dependent
on imported oil. Its industrial sector has traditionally been highly
protected and "inward-looking"'; the domestic market is small. Develop-
ment policies have been hampered by the existence of a heavy bureaucratic
establishment, pro-urban policies discriminating against agriculture, a
very low propensity to save on the part of private households and low
public savings, and a long history of inflation.
16.       During the 1960's, the Chilean economy grew at about 4.5 per-
cent annually. The recent economic report examines economic trends
since 1970. After some growth in 1971, investment stagnated in 1972
and declined in 1973. Output fell in 1973, especially in agriculture
--a sector of vital importance for the balance of payments. The
escudo exchange rate adjustments fell behind Chilets relative
inflation rate, especially in 1973. Inflation fed by massive deficit
financing reached levels exceeded by few countries since World War II.
Acute shortages and high black market prices, most of all for food,
undermined the real gains achieved by labor in 1971 and 1972. The
artificial pricing system, the partial breakdown of the delivery
system for agricultural inputs, the uncertainty associated with a far-
reaching land reform, and the increase in world food prices all contri-
buted to a decline in agricultural output and to a food import bill of
about $600 million in 1973 (up from $170 million in 1970). In
addition, copper prices were low in 1971 and 1972; when they increased
early in 1973 Chile failed to step up production.  The fruits of
the massive copper investment of the late 1960's failed to be realized.
Late in 1971 the country ceased to make scheduled payments on most of
its external debt obligations; it then undertook their resumption
under a debt rescheduling agreement in the spring of 1972, but
subsequently stopped making payments on practically all obligations
when the economic situation continued to deteriorate. During 1973
international reserves dropped by some $230 million, despite an
increase in copper prices.



17.       The Government which took office in September 1973 set out
to return from a largely state-controlled to a mixed economy. At the
same time, the Government liberalized imports and devalued the escudo
roughly in line with domestic inflation. Prices, with the exception
of a few basic food items and of public services, have been freed.
Most industrial firms that had been expropriated have been returned to
their owners. A decision was made to consolidate the land reform
program and the Government is distributing titles to the farmers who
till the land and providing price incentives and credit to the new
owners to step up production. A monetary and fiscal program worked
out with the IMF in late 1973 involved a considerable fiscal and
monetary effort and tight restraint on external borrowing. In
support of this program the IM approved a stand-by agreement in
January 1974 authorizing purchases of currencies up to the equivalent
of 79 million SDMs. In addition, Chile obtained SDR 41t.5 million in
1974 and SDR 77.0 million in January 1975 under the IMF oil facility.
The international financial community reacted positively to the new
direction of economic policy. In early 1974 Chile's main creditors
agreed to reschedule a substantial portion of service due in 1973
and 1974 and subsequent bilateral agreements have been concluded on
favorable terms. Chile has resumed repayment service on its external
debt obligations.  Private financial institutions have resumed lending
to Chile. The IDB made two loans to Chile during 1974 consisting
of $75 million for hydroelectric power and $22 million for agricultural
rehabilitation. Chile had no difficulty obtaining the $180 million
medium-term credits allowed under the 1974 stand-by agreement.
External suppliers and banks increased their lending to Chile
during 197L, and several export credit agencies resumed insurihg credits
to Chile. Agreements have been reached with the copper companies
that had been expropriated without compensation in 1971 and with most
other foreign companies in a similar position. The Government also
issued an investment code designed to encourage foreign private
investment.
.   .   .   _ -  .........   ,   ,  .   .   ............................. ..... .. _.  
18.       Top priority has been given to increasing output of copper
and of food. Production in the large copper mines increased sharply in
the last quarter of 1973 and increased by 21 percent in 19714 compared
to 1973. Food output, stimulated by high producer prices, has risen
sharply. Imports of food dropped from $595 million during 1973 to $472
million during 1974. Manufacturing output on the other hand stagnated:
increases in some branches (durable consumer goods, intermediate goods
for industry) were offset by declines in output of non-durable consumer
goods. Overall, GDP is estimated to have grown by about 5.5 percent
during 1974. This compares to about 1.5 percent in 1972 and a 14 percent
decline in 1973. Most of the growth is attributable to mining and
agriculture. At the same time, open unemployment increased to over 10
percent in the Greater Santiago area, and inflation continued at a very
high rate, although less rapidly than in 1973. Real wages, which had
gone up during 1971 from their already high 1970 level--an increase made
possible mainly as a result of a compression of the investment volume--
stabilized during 1972. As inflation and the black market began to



-6-
erode the effective purchasing power of wage earners, real wages
dropped sharply between October 1972 and mid-1973, and then recovered
somewhat during the last quarter of 1973. It is very difficult to
estimate the real wage level during 1974 because of statistical
ambiguities, but real wages recovered further and were probably 5 to
10 percent below the 1970 level. The Government has recently instituted
automatic indexing of wages on a quarterly basis. Hence, the financial
program for 1975 is designed to maintain real wages at their 1974 level.
19.       There has been substantial improvement in public finance.
While before 197h increasing budget deficits financed by Central BAnk
credit had been the main source of inflation, the fiscal situation
showed improvement during 197h. Increased Government revenues
reflecting improved tax administration and new tax measures, as well as
an effort at containing expenditures, sharply reduced the fiscal
deficit in real terms. As a result of price and tariff increases,
the decentralized agencies as a group significantly increased their
savings and the 12 major public enterprises moved from a large current
deficit in 1973 to a moderate surplus in 1974.
20.       The balance of trade improved during 197h (from a deficit of
$286 million in 1973 to a deficit of $194 million in 1974) as a result
of successful export policies, a reduction in food import requirements
and high world prices for copper during the first half of the year.
Furthermore, the Government made a significant effort to meet its
external debt obligations. While in 1973 external debt service
amounted to $212 million (out of $561 million, or 38 percent of
scheduled payments), debt service payments during 1974 amounted to
$439 million (including compensation payments to expropriated foreign
firms) and in addition $424 million were rescheduled after a meeting of
the Paris Club. On balance, net international reserves fell by
$110 million (before IMF support) during 197h. Liquid gross reserves,
which had fallen from the equivalent of four months' imports in
December 1970 to a low of 0.1 months' imports in September 1973, rose
to the equivalent of 0.7 months' imports at the end of 197h, then
totalling $135 million.
21.       Despite the substantial improvement in public finances,
strong inflation persisted during 1974, although slowing down somewhat.
Consumer prices rose by 375 percent in 1974 compared with about 500
percent during 1973 on the basis of the official index; they rose by
31() percent in 1974 compared with 405 percent during 1973 on the
basis of Bank staff estimates. The main reasons for continued
inflation are: (a) the still large fiscal deficit, reflecting concern
on the-part of the Government that a drastic stabilization might
increase unemployment; (b) corrective price adjustments to catch up
with past cost/price distortions; (c) a delay of a few months in the
enforcement of the restrictive credit policies in early 1974;



-7-
(d) large nominal minimum wage increases during the first nine months
of 1974, followed in October 1974 by full wage indexing on a
quarterly basis; and (e) continuing inflationary expectations among
businessmen.
22.       A new economic team headed by a Coordination Minister was
appointed in mid-1974. The 1975 budget and financial program
reflect the determination on the part of this team to decelerate
inflation at a faster rate than last year. This program has been
endorsed by the management of the IMF, which is recommending to the
Fund Board a stand-by agreement of the equivalent of 79 million SDRs
in support of the program. The program places strong emphasis on
concerted efforts to further increase domestic output, raise the level
of public sector savings and promote exports. Balance of payments
prospects for 1975 depend largely on success in adjusting to import
levels consistent with expected low copper prices. The Government's
fiscal program includes strict limitation of public expenditure and
revenue measures to increase public savings and thus finance a
higher share of public investment than in 197h. The main features
of the program to be supported by the IMF (some of which have been
mentioned above) are as follows:
(a) adjustments in public prices and food prices that will
obviate the need for Government transfers or credit, with
limited exceptions in the cases of ENAMI (small-scale
copper mining and processing) and transport agencies;
(b) continued adjustment of the exchange rate in line
with inflation to adjust imports to the country's
import capacity;
(c) a reduction of the Central Government deficit from
29-percent of expenditure (197h) to 14 percent (1975);
(d) an increase in the portion of income of the publicly-
owned copper companies which is turned over to the
Government;
(e) a reduction in the overall expansion of net banking
system credit from 100 percent (197h) to 55 percent
(1975);
(f) limiting the decline in the net international reserve
position before IMF support to not more than $240
million; and
(g) external borrowing of one to 15 years maturity will
be limited to $300 million ($180 million in 197h).



- 8 -
Prior to the presentation to the IMF Board of Directors of the
proposed stand-by agreement, the following action has already been
taken by the Chilean authorities:
(a)  the exchange rate has been adjusted by 48 percent
between November 30, 1974 and January 31, 1975, when
the cost-of-living index went up by 22.5 percent;
(b)  a major tax reform has been enacted; the tax reform
includes a value-added tax of 20 percent (an effective
2 percent increase over the former production taxes);
simplification of the income tax scale with higher
basic rates and more progressivity; making undistri-
buted profits subject to taxation; and adjustment of
property tax (urban and rural) to catch up with past
inflation; and
(c)  prices for public goods and services have been
increased sharply, particularly gasoline and highwvay
tolls.
23.       This year and 1976 will be particularly difficult for Chile
because of the prospective low world copper price and the heavy
external debt obligations becoming due. A meeting of creditors is
being planned for March 24-25 to work out an agreement on debt service
due during 1975. Heavy external debt obligations will continue in
subsequent years, including amounts due on rescheduled debt, and
external capital requirements will remain very large. On the other
hand, a rising physical volume of copper exports from Chile is in
prospect under the Government's program for expanding the output of
existing mines and increasing their efficiency. Chile's prospects
are also favorable for increasing production and exports of other
commodities, mainly in the minerals, pulp and paper, agricultural
and fisheries sectors. Three aspects of the new economic policies
are promising in this connection. First, the consolidation of land
reform, in combination with the much improved economic environment,
is stimulating the expansion of agricultural production, as summarized
in Parts IV and V below. Second, the private sector now has a
clearer understanding of the role it is expected to play than during
the past few years. The new "outward-looking" incentives, which have
already been reflected in an increase in rnon-traditional exports
from $2h6 million in 1n73 to $48o million in 197h, should encourage
entrepreneurs to undertake new activities that will further contribute
to a balance of payments improvement. Third, private foreign capital
and accompanying knowhow will play a more important role than in
the recent past, especially in mining; this augurs well for fuller
realization of Chile's comparative advantage.   The policy of the



-9-
Chilean Government is to welcome foreign investors in mining
(including copper) in new ventures, with the five large nationalized
mines remaining under public ownership. There has been active
interest on the part of Japanese and Canadian investors in Chilean
mines since the change in Government.
2h.       Even if the recession in the industrialized countries
continues into 1976 (the conservative assumption underlying the
economic projections in Annex I) and the copper price remains below
the long-term real historical trend for several years, Chile should
be able gradually to reduce its resource gap with the rest of the
world under a policy of continued severe financial austerity.   Should
growth in the developed countries pick up (especially in energy-
related investment, construction and the automobile industry),
Chile's prospects will improve significantly with the stronger demand
and resulting higher copper prices.   Provided the ongoing incentive
policies continue, Chile's export earnings should increase from about
$2.0 billion in 1974 to over $h.0 billion by the end of this decade.
As a result, the external debt outstanding, which amounted to the
equivalent of more than two years' exports in 1973, can be expected
to become equivalent to one year's exports in 1980. The debt
service ratio is expected to stabilize at about 24 percent after
1976, on the basis of rescheduling of payments due in the years 1974
through 1976 and possibly 1977.
25.       In conclusion, there is no doubt that Chile faces a dif-
ficult period ahead. The major tasks ahead will be a reduction in
the rate of inflation, the encouragement of exports and of agricul-
tural production--two areas where considerable progress has already
been achieved--and the attainment of high levels of investment
directed at the priority sectors: copper, other mining, export
industry, agriculture and energy. The Government will also have to
try to mitigate the hardship of the stabilization program on the
lower-income groups. As a first step to this end the Government has
announced that it will create a fund for the relief of the unemployed
in the near future. Chile has excellent human and physical resources
which can, once the present financial difficulties--exacerbated by
the world recession--are overcome, ensure long-term sustained growth.
The 1975 fiscal and financial program endorsed by the I1MF will go a
long way in improving Chile's financial outlook and will assist the
Government in continuing to lay the basis for long-term growth. In
the current situation I consider Chile creditworthy for limited amounts
of Ban,k lending.

PART III - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHILE
26.       Starting with its first development   loan in 1948, the Bank
has made 19 loans to Chile for a total, net of cancellations, of $246
million; IDA made one credit for $19 million. Of this total 50 per-
cent has been for power, 19 percent for roads, 8 percent for agricul-
ture, 4 percent for education, and the remainder for industry and
technical assistance. Historically, the volume of Bank lending to
Chile has fluctuated substantially responding to variations in Chilean
economic performance and the availability of suitable projects. In
FY1971-73 the Bank did not lend to Chile because of the acute deteriora-
tion in economic and financial management, as summarized above. In
FY1974 the Bank increased the amount of two existing loans to finance
up to $8.3 million of interest and other charges and also made a
$5.25 million technical assistance loan. Execution of Bank-financed
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory. However, in the case
of our most recent highway and education loans, a high rate of inflation
and deteriorating conditions in the local construction industry made
normal bidding extremely difficult. Delays in the implementation of
project works also resulted from a shortage of local funds.   These dif-
ficulties are now gradually being overcome.
27.       IFC commitments to date have been $21.2 million -- of which
$15 million were in copper mining and the remainder in industry -- and
$9.6 million are now held by the Corporation. A statement on Bank loans
and IFC investments as at February 28, 1975 and notes on ongoing projects
are attached as Annex II. Bank Group loans to, or guaranteed by, the
Republic of Chile constituted about 4.3 percent of Chile's total out-
standing debt, including undisbursed, and accounted for about 4.7 per-
cent of the country's debt service obligations in 1974 (after re-
scheduling).
28.       In addition to the proposed agricultural rehabilitation
project, the Bank currently has under appraisal a $30 million loan for
a copper mining project, aimed at resolving urgent production bottle-
necks, and another $30 million loan to help in rehabilitating the power
system. In addition, IFC has nearly completed its review of an $0.8
million equity investment in a new development finance company.   All
four operations are designed to strengthen Chile's balance of payments
position by helping to expand output rapidly and to improve the
effectiveness of institutions in major sectors of the economy.
Preparatory work is going forward on other projects with the aid of the
Bank's technical assistance loan and the FAO Cooperative Program. In
the agricultural sector the projects under study would help to reduce
current problems of rural poverty by generating additional incomes and
employment. The presentation of any or all of these projects to the
Board will depend, in part, on continued progress toward long-term
sustained growth equitably distributed.



PART IV - THE AGRICULTURA L SECTOR
29.       Agriculture's contribution to Chile's national output is
small and has been steadily declining, dropping from 19 percent in 1960
to 6 percent in 1973 according to national accounts; however, if
measured at world market prices the sector's real contribution to GNP
is presently about 50 percent higher than indicated. The agricultural
share in total employment has also dropped from 31 percent in 1960 and
26 percent in 1970 to about 23 percent in 1973. While the country's
agricultural sector is relatively well endowed with soils, climate,
rainfall and irrigation facilities, production has increased relatively
slow. The main problems have been the inefficient use of available
resources and the lack of continuity in agricultural policy in general
and price policy in particular. This has resulted in unfavorable
cost-price relationships for the sector. At the same time, successive
programs of agrarian reform (see paragraphs 32-34 below) have created
a climate of uncertainty with adverse effects on agricultural invest-
ment and production.
30.       The Government's main objectives in the agricultural sector
in the short run are to reintroduce stability of tenure, to restore
production to the 1970 level, and to lay the foundations for further
expansion in the future. Accordingly, the Government:
(a) has declared its intention to grant title on legally
expropriated land to farm workers;
(b) has liberalized agricultural prices to create suf-
ficient incentives to farmers. Market forces will
generally determine prices on the basis of supply and
demand conditions. Access to international markets,
for both imports and exports, will reduce domestic
shortages and/or surplus situations and diminish wide
price fluctuations; and
(c) is supporting the provisicn of agricultural credit and
the supply of inputs.                           -
Production of major crops increased 12 percent in 1974 over 1973 and is
expected to increase a further 14 percent in 1975 over 1974.
31.       With regard to long-term objectives, some promising areas for
increasing production have already been identified. They include (a)
the expansion of irrigated areas by some 150,000 ha, and the better use
of existing irrigation schemes; (b) more comprehensive exploitation of
forest resources; and (c) the expansion of production based on Chile's
comparative advantage, such as for wine, fruits and vegetables, or on
the production potential and internal demand for such items as meat and
dairy products. On the social front, solutions for the 80,000 subsistence



- 12 -
families with less than one hectare and for some 200,000 rural families
now under-employed as farm workers are required. However, the various
objectives need to be handled in the context of a comprehensive develop-
ment plan. The public agencies scattered among five ministries
dealing with agriculture are not well adapted to serve present and
future needs of agriculture, particularly after the fundamental changes
in tenancy. The Government has started, as a first step, a review of
the Ministry of Agriculture; a broader approach designed to aid in
reorganizing and consolidating the numerous agencies servicing the
agricultural sector would be carried forward under the agricultural re-
habilitation project as explained below (in paragraph 36(b)).
Land Tenure and Agrarian Reform
32.       Agrarian reform has dramatically changed the structure of land
tenure in Chile. Prior to the beginning of expropriations about 80 per-
cent of all agricultural land was owned by some 11,000 farmers holding
more than 80 basic hal1, representing less than 7 percent of total farms.
About 1X0 percent of aLl agricultural land has been expropriated since
1965 and today less than 200 farms are larger than 80 basic ha.
33.       Action on agrarian reform started in the early 1960's based
on the widespread view that this was necessary in order to improve
agricultural production and national income distribution. The reform
has gone through three main phases.  During the first one, 1962 to 1964,
the first agrarian reform law was promulgated and a Government institu-
tion, the Agrarian Reform Corporation (Corporacion de Refonna Agraria--
CORA), was created but no expropriations were carried out. During the
second phase, 1965 to November 1970, a second agrarian reform law was
promulgated, a land distribution plan with economic and social objectives
was prepared and a total of 1,406 properties, covering 3.6 million ha on
which about 21,000 farm families worked and lived, were expropriated.
During the third phase, from November 1970 to September 1973, an added
impetus was given to land expropriation and 4,400 farms, covering some
6.3 million ha on which about 38,700 farm families worked and lived,
were expropriated. During this third period, little attention was given
to actual land distribution; expropriated farms were administered by
the Government and only rarely was the land legally assigned to the farm
workers.
34.       In summary, a total of about 9.9 million ha has been expro-
priated, representing about 40 percent of Chile's total agricultural
land and the remaining land is predominantly medium-sized farms. The
j/ One basic ha is equivalent to one irrigated ha of the best soils
located in the Maipo Valley; it is used as a common index to
express productive potential of the soils of other regions.



- 13 -
Government has declared its intention to complete the assignment of
all expropriated land within the 1975-77 period. From 1965 through
1974, a total of some 1.1 million ha has been assigned, and another
1.1 million ha have been returned to their previous owners during 1974
because they were expropriated without legal basis or deprived of the
80 basic ha they were entitled to retain. The remaining 7.7 million
physical hectares (equivalent to 780,000 basic hectares) are expected
to benefit about 57-67,000 families, who were cultivating the land at
the end of August 1974 without title. The reformed and minifundio
sectors and the remaining medium-size sector, which comprzises some
40,ooo farms, now require technical and financial assistance to inten-
sify production. As explained below, the project will aid in providing
this assistance.
PART V - THE PROJECT
35.      The project would be the fourth Bank Group operation in the
agricultural sector. It was appraised in September 1974 and negotia-
tions were held in Washington from January 16 to 21, 1975. The delega-
tion of the Republic of Chile was led by Mr. Renato Gazmuri, Under
Secretary of Agriculture, and included representatives of that Ministry
and of the Central Bank. An appraisal report on the project (573a-CH)
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A summary
statement of the proposal is given in Annex III.
36.       The project would include:
(a) provision of short- and medium-term credit to some
22,000 small farmers who belong to the lower 40 percent
income group of the country (about 13,000 of which would
be agrarian reform beneficiaries) and some 1,000 medium-
size farmers. Currently, the demand is largely for
short-term credit because of the incentives the Govern-
ment has established to increase rapidly the production
of annual crops and the reluctance of farmers to make
medium/long-term investments, both in the "reformed
sector" pending the granting of land titles,and in the
"private sector" pending the growth of confidence that
the existing agricultural policies will be continued.
In view of the existing situation, $16 million of the
Bank loan is expected to be used for short-term credit
to finance fertilizer, seeds, pesticides and other
production costs and $3.7 million for medium-term
credit for agricultural equipment, spare parts and other
on-farm investments; and
(b) a study to be prepared by consultants regarding the role
and possible reorganization and consolidation of the
numerous agencies providing public services to the



- 14 -
agricultural sector, and the formulation, by the end of
1975, of an implementation plan to carry out the reforms.
The terms of reference of the study were agreed with
the Bank during negotiations and terms and conditions for the
employment of consultants would be submitted to the Bqnk
within 45 days after the signature of the Loan Agreement.
The implementation plan and its timing would be reviewed
by the Government in consultation with the Bank.
(Sections 3.02 and 3.03 of the Loan Agreement).
$300,000 of the Bank loan would be used to
help finance this study.
37.       The project has been formulated, and will be implemented,
within the context of a series of measures on agrarian reform, agricul-
tural commodity price policies and institutional reorganization. These
neasu,!; are considered, by both the Bank and the Government, to be
urgen; and vital to sound agricultural development. They are to:
(a)  provide land titles to beneficiaries of the land reform,
either to individuals or to cooperatives and other
associations according to the particular conditions and
wishes of the beneficiaries.    Security of tenure is
needed as a basis for farmers to make the investments
required to achieve sustained growth in production. To
this effect, the Government would implement a three-year
program to grant title to about 7.7 million ha of
expropriated land and provide CORA with all necessary
resources to achieve this. CORA's present staff would be
insufficient for a task of this magnitude; consequently,
CORA would maintain its five existing land titling teams
until April 1, 1975 after which it would contract for a
sufficient number of (i)private technicians to organize
and maintain at least 15 teams to cover technical and
economic aspects of land distribution and (ii) lawyers
to cover deed preparation and recording. The composition
and number of teams and lawyers, and the necessary
resources would be reviewed as required and not later than
at the end of each year so as to enable CORA to distri-
bute not less than 15,000 titles during 1975, not less
than 20,000 titles during 1976 and the balance during
1977 (Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement); and
(b)  continue policies to liberalize agricultural commodity
prices in line with supply and demand conditions. This
price policy was a major factor in obtaining a 12 per-
cent increase in production of major crops in 1974. In
carrying out this policy the Government would continue



- 15 -
to allow imports and exports of agricultural products so
as to reduce shortages and surplus situations,
while avoiding disruptive fluctuations in internal prices
to a degree compatible with production incentives
(Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement).
38.       The total project cost is estimated at $55.5 million equiva-
lent of which $29 million is in foreign exchange. Financing would be
provided by the proposed Bank loan (36 percent), a Government contribu-
tion (36 percent) and project beneficiaries (28 percent). The Republic
of Chile would be the borrower and cover the foreign exchange risk.
A term of 20 years, including 4 years of grace, is recommende(d for the
proposed Bank loan in view of Chile's difficult current balance of
payments situation and prospects, as summarized above. It would
complement an IDB loan of $22 million equivalent made in March 1974 to
the Banco del Estado, principally for medium- and long-term investments
in agriculture and a recent $10 million USAID loan to assist agricultural
cooperatives.
Organization and Management
39.       A Project Commission, under the chairmanship of the Central
Bank and composed of representatives from the Ministries of Agriculture,
Finance and Economy and from the participating lending institutions,
would be responsible for the supervision, coordination and implementation
of the project's credit component. The Project Commission's composition
and responsibilities have been agreed upon during negotiations and its
establishment would be a condition of effectiveness (Sections 3.05 and
6.01(c) of the Loan Agreement).
40.       The Government's Banco del Estado (BE), by far the largest
lender to the agricultural sector (86 percent in 1973), is expected to
carry out most of the lending program. The Institute for Agricultural
Development (INDAP), an autonomous agency within the Ministry of
Agriculture, would make loans to fanmers with five basic ha or
less, in which INDAP specializes. The Development Corporation (CORFO)
would make loans to beef and dairy producers, mostly in the south, a
field where it gained experience under two previous Bank projects.
These three agencies have more than 300 field offices and nearly 1,200
technical staff and are capable of carrying out the project's credit
component. Commercial banks, whose share of agricultural lending has
declined from 49 percent in 1963 to 4 percent in 1973, will be eligible
but their participation in the project is not likely to be substantial.
Participating lending institutions not having their own technical staff
would avail themselves of staff from the Ministry of Agriculture and
from private firms.

Lending Policies and Procedures
41.       In order to start lending operations, the Government would,
as a condition of effectiveness, make an advance contribution equivalent
to $10 million, which would be deposited in a separate project account
in the Central Bank. Thereafter, -the Government would maintain suffi-
cient funds in this account to carry out the lending program until at
least the equivalent of $39.4 million has been lent to participating
farmers. The Central Bank would lend, under subsidiary loan agreements,
to participating lending institutions the amounts to be lent to project
beneficiaries.Payments of interest and principal on the subsidiary loans
would revert to the Central Bank's project account.  The balance in such
account, after servicing the proposed Bank loan and covering Central
Bank's direct project costs, would be used for further lending to the
agricultural sector. (Sections 3.04 and 6.01(a) of the Loan Agreement).
42.       Participating lending institutions would consider loan
proposals prepared by qualified technicians demonstrating the capacity
for increased production and the farmer's potential for repayment.
Short-term loans would have a maximum 12-month maturity and would
initially carry an interest rate of 200 percent, the prevailing interest
rate on this type of credit. The rate will be reviewed by Chile and
*the Bank, at least quarterly, taking into account the prevailing and
expected rates of inflation (paragraph D(c)1 of Annex to Schedule 4 to
the Loan Agreement). The demand for short-term credit has been strong
at 200 percent, the rate charged by banks since July 1974; the periodic
review will assure that adjustments are made as needed to maintain the
demand without large subsidies.  Medium-term loans would not exceed six
years and would bear interest at 8 percent per annum on the outstanding
balance, adjusted according to the Consumer Price Index; these are
the prevailing terms in Chile for this type of loan (paragraphs D(a)4
and D(c)2 of Annex to Schedule 4 to the Loan Agreement). While the
demand for medium-term credit has been weak, as indicated in paragraph
36(a) above, it is expected to increase because of the measures taken
by the Government.
43.       Participating lending institutions would borrow at 190 per-
cent for short-term credit, subject to quarterly review, and at 6 per-
cent, adjusted by the Consumer Price Index, for medium-term credit
(paragraph 3 of Schedule L to the Loan Agremnt).    The resulting spreads
are deemed adequate to cover their costs of administering the credits.
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       BE, the major importer of fertilizer and of seed varieties
adapted to Chilean conditions, would procure both inputs after solicit-
ing the quotations of at least three suppliers from Bank member countries



- 17 -
and Switzerland. BE would distribute these two inputs on a nation-wide
basis, as it has done traditionally. Equipment, spare parts and
pesticides would be procured by farmers through commercial channels in
Chile, where representatives of manufacturers from several Bank member
countries have sales and service outlets.
45.       Disbursements, expected to be completed within about 12 months,
would be made in amounts equivalent to (a) 50 percent of amounts dis-
bursed by participating lending institutions to project beneficiaries
and (b) the foreign exchange expenditures for the study on agricultural
services.
Economic Benefits and Justification
46.       The provision of crop credit will enable farmers to acquire
inputs essential to achieve substantial production gains. The financial
benefit/cost ratios are expected to be in the order of 3:1 for the major
crops, equivalent to rates of return of about 200 percent. Considerable
cash surpluses can therefore be expected by producers, who include many
low-income farmers. Economic benefits to the country would be slightly
higher than the financial benefits to the farmers because duties on
imported inputs, ranging between $14 and $29 per ha, depending on the
crop, must be included in the calculations for the latter. Returns on
medium-term loans, representing a small part of the project, have not
been calculated. These investments are mostly for replacement of vital
items of machinery in on-going enterprises and the technicians' review
referred to in paragraph 42 above will ensure that financial and economic
returns are satisfactory. The increased agricultural production result-
ing under the credit program and other actions being taken by the
Government are expected to permit reductions of food imports of more than
$200 million from 1974 to 1976, while simultaneously enabling dome-stic
food consumption to increase. On the institutional side, the study for
the reorganization of agricultural agencies is expected to lead to
improved public services to agriculture and increasing land productivity,
particularly among beneficiaries of the agrarian reform.
47.       The policies agreed with the Government, in the context of
which the project has been formulated, would also have substantial
continuing benefits in improving Chile's agricultural sector. The land
titling program is a major step in consolidating the agrarian reform,
since it will permit security of land tenure, an essential precondition
for any substantial investment effort on the part of farmers. An
adequate relationship-between inputst costs and farm-gate prices will
maintain the financial environment necessary to induce farmers to
produce more.

PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Chile and
the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Besides the specific features
mentioned elsewhere in this Report, the draft Loan Agreement conforms
to the pattern usual in loans for agricultural projects.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
50.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /
Loan No. 558-CH - Second Highway Maintenance Project: $11.6 million Loan
of September 19, 1968, and $1.fi million Agreement
amending Loan Agreement of April 22, 1974. Closing
Date:  December 31, 1975.
Project execution started satisfactorily and contracts amounting to $6.5
million were awarded for a major portion of the equipment list. This equip-
ment was put into operation immediately and contributed significantly to the
improvement of highway maintenance. The purchase of additional maintenance
equipment and spare parts has been substantially delayed because of cumber-
some administrative procedures and a shortage of experienced personnel
in the Government's Highways Department since 1971. Implementation of the
project has been further hindered by severe budgetary cuts in the allocations
to highway maintenance programs since June 1974 as well as by restrictions
in hiring personnel for the public sector. It is expected, however, that
purchases will be completed by late 1975, over three years behind schedule.
Loan No. 666-CH - Second Vocational Training Project: $1.5 million Loan
of April 23, 1970. Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Considerable time was lost initially due mainly to lack of local funds and
changes in the location of some training centers. Project implementation is
now 18 months behind appraisal schedule. Lack of counterpart funds in the
budget has prevented initiation of the remaining civil works for agricul-
tural training centers. Uncertainty with regard to the cost of materials
and labor has delayed shipbuilding contractors from signing a contract for
the construction of a fishing training vessel in 1974. The project
is proceeding satisfactorily, however, and is still expected to be completed
by mid-1975.
Loan No. 668-CH - Third Education Project: $7.0 million Loan of May 7,
1970. Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Project implementation has been hindered since the outset by a combination
of frequent changes in project unit directors and unstable conditions in
the construction industry since late 1971. Rapid price escalation increased
construction costs and competitive bidding for construction works became
impracticable. The Bank agreed to accept a system of cost -plus fixed- fee
contracts as an emergency measure. In March 1974 the new Government issued
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

a decree which transferred all teacher-training to the universities.
Since no new construction of primary teacher-training colleges or
modernization of existing ones would be undertaken, the Government
requested that resulting savings in the loan be used to finance cost over-
runs elsewhere in the project. The corresponding amendment was signed in
October 197a. Disbursements increased substantially during the later part
of 1574 and the project is expected to be completed by mid-1977.
Loan No. 688-CH - Second Highway Construction Project: $10.8 million
Loan of June 10, 1970. Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
Substantial slippage occurred in starting construction of the project works.
This resulted initially because of delays in the prequalification of
contractors and in the preparation of specifications, and later because of
numerous changes of ministerial officials and technicians. Competitive bid-
ding became difficult in an environment of rapidly rising inflation after
1971 and the Bank agreed to proceed with a portion of the road construction
on the basis of negotiated contracts and works subdivided into small bidding
sections. It was also necessary to reduce the scope of the project and an
amendment to the Loan Agreement was signed in August 1974. Project works
are now proceeding more smoothly. Contracts have been awarded for the
majority of the pending works and the project as a whole is expected to be
completed early in 1977, or about two and half years behind schedule.
Loan No. 978-CH - Technical Assistance Project: $5.25 million Loan of
April 22, 1974. Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
After a slow start, due primarily to ineffective coordination of study
preparation among the various public sector agencies, project implementation
is proceeding more evenly. CORFO has worked out a program of about 15
high-priority pre-investment studies in the fields of copper and coal mining,
forestry resources, industrial manufacturing, nutrition, water resources,
regional development and agriculture. This program covers the full amount
of the loan. Six of these preinvestment studies are presently underway
and a further six studies are close to starting. Approximately ( percent of
the loan funds had been disbursed by the end of February and it is expected
that these disbursements will increase considerably in the next few months
as more studies get underway.   Nevertheless, it is unlikely that the loan
will be fully disbursed before June 30, 1975, which will require an extension
of the present Closing Date.
