Infrastructure Project aims at improving the environmental\n            conditions in the coastal region of Montenegro, as well as\n            the quality of water supply in, and around the capital city\n            of Podgorica. The project components will: 1) finance the\n            rehabilitation of the multi-municipal Kotor landfill site,\n            to meet sanitary standards. Such rehabilitation will\n            comprise, other than a new fence, and gate, a groundwater\n            monitoring system, leakage treatment, and a gas collecting\n            system. A new compactor and bulldozer will be provided, to\n            allow an adequate landfill operation, while drainage systems\n            will be installed to control degassing, and drainage. In\n            addition solid waste equipment will be financed to institute\n            long-term environmental monitoring, maintain, and manage the\n            landfill site; 2) finance the completion of the water supply\n            pipeline construction, thus replacing contaminated water\n            sources in the Zeta Valley, with water from the Podgorica\n            municipal water supply system; and, 3) support project\n            implementation, through the provision of funds for the\n            completion of engineering services, and for auditing of\n            project accounts."}, "docdt": "2001-11-27T00:00:00Z"}
