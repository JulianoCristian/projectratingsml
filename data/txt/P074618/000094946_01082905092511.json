Environmental Infrastructure Project, namely in the areas of\n            waste disposal, health and safety issues, and emission\n            control. Mitigation measures call for a working plan to deal\n            with key health, safety, and environmental issues, including\n            enforcement of monitoring criteria on quality assurance\n            procedures, compliant with health and safety regulations, in\n            accordance with prevailing environmental legislation.\n            Facilities will be designed to contain wastes, subject to\n            waste inspection, and clearance, thereby undertaking sample\n            testing for final disposal, or processing. Traffic will\n            undergo, as appropriate, a one-way system to avoid\n            congestion. Shredding, and waste conveying will be conducted\n            to ensure dust emissions are controlled, either by spraying,\n            or covering top layers, in addition to contingency plans on\n            alternative arrangements for the transfer of waste to the\n            energy cell. Upon excavation of energy cells, decomposed\n            material should be disposed of at distant selected sites, in\n            accordance with standard environmental procedures. Emission\n            standards are recommended to be applied for surface, and\n            groundwater quality, landfill gas explosives, and\n            occupational exposure limits, as well as for noise\n            disturbances, following monitoring requirements. Vegetative\n            propagation will be ensured to provide visual screening, and\n            control air pollution."}, "docdt": "2001-08-10T00:25:00Z"}
