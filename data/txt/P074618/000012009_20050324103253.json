Lessons\n            of experience are conveyed as follows. The Bank should\n            actively promote the regional landfill model, i.e., multiple\n            municipalities disposing their solid waste in a regional\n            sanitary landfill, managed by companies owned by the\n            municipalities and national government, for replication\n            throughout Montenegro. However, agreeing to a landfill\n            location is a complicated and prolonged process, for which\n            the Bank can be instrumental in helping stakeholders reach a\n            solution that maximizes the benefits. Throughout the\n            process, the Bank should offer its services as an honest\n            broker, but avoid being drawn into the fight that will\n            inevitably occur during the process. Notably, all\n            stakeholders should be involved and consulted extensively,\n            particularly the local communities that will bear most of\n            the costs. The Bank can help reach solutions in its capacity\n            to draw on international independent experts that offer\n            non-biased technical opinions. A consultant credible to all\n            parties, must complete all technical aspects and\n            environmental and social impact assessment."}, "docdt": "2005-03-11T00:00:00Z"}
