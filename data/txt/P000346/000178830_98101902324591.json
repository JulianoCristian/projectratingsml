to\n            provide adequate locomotive and rolling stock maintenance\n            facilities; (iii) to improve the efficiency of the\n            administrative and technical departments; (iv) to assist the\n            railway in buying locomotive spare parts and railway\n            equipment; and (v) to improve and expand training facilities\n            and programs. The project has five main components: the new\n            Douala marshalling yard; the provision of railway equipment;\n            the expansion of the workshops and the construction of new\n            maintenance facilities; technical assistance for\n            improvements in operations and management and consulting\n            services for feasibility and engineering studies and\n            supervision; and training."}, "docdt": "1979-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
