"The ratings for the First Programmatic\n            Environment Structural Adjustment Loan for Mexico were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The findings and implications indicate that on\n            one hand, the experience from Programmatic Environment\n            Structural Adjustment Loan (EnvSAL I) shows that\n            inter-institutional coordination is a complex process which\n            requires substantial efforts and sustainable commitments on\n            the part of participating entities. Reaching such\n            commitments is both difficult and time consuming. On the\n            other hand, this same experience shows that where\n            inter-institutional coordination was successful, it led to\n            enhancements in the quality of outputs. The problems\n            experienced with inter-institutional coordination as\n            described in earlier sections of this report, stemmed\n            broadly from institutions going through a process of\n            learning on how best to conduct and gain from such a process\n            of coordination linked to the EnvSAL program."}, "docdt": "2004-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
