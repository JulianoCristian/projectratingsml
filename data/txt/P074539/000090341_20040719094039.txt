3. Program Description


1.     The Programmatic Environment Structural Adjustment Program (EnvSAL) consists of
three operations to support the Government of Mexico's (GOM) efforts to balance
socioeconomic development with environmental protection and improvement. The first
operation was approved in August 2002 and the loan was formally closed in January 2004.
The program design responds to the key environmental issues identified in the GOM's
Environment and Natural Resources Program (ENRP) 2001-2006, which establishes the
Government's medium-term, outcome-based approach to promote sustainable development.
The EnvSAL focuses on (i) mainstreaming of environmental concerns in key sectoral
development agendas, as prioritized by the GOM; and (ii) improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of local environmental management processes in Mexico. A programmatic approach
was adopted given the complexity of the reforms and the need for flexibility in
implementation.


2.     The key sectors supported by the EnvSAL include the water, energy, forestry, and
tourism sectors, based on the following criteria jointly defined with the GOM: (i) the urgency
of the issue based on the linkage with growth and investment, either in terms of potential
impact or as a growth constraint, as is clearly the case for water; (ii) urgency of the issue based
on the level of degradation; (iii) linkage with poverty alleviation, particularly in cases where
the natural resource is essential to sustainable livelihoods, such as in the forestry sector; (iv)
opportunity based on cross sectoral consensus; and (v) financial constraints and the need to use
limited financial resources to achieve as great an impact as possible. In each of the priority
sectors, a logical, stepwise progression has been defined in terms of key building blocks to
achieve preselected goals including the definition of policies and regulatory framework,
formulation of plans and strategies, ensuring appropriate institutional set-up, putting in place
administrative requirements, and finally development and use of appropriate fiscal instruments.
Table 1 in the annex presents an overview of the Program.



                                                              5

3.     The first operation, EnvSAL I, consisted of two tranches of $101.01 million each,
disbursed in December 2002 and December 2003 respectively. EnvSAL I supported the
achievements of the GOM with regard to mainstreaming of environmental issues in key sectors
through (a) the establishment of high-level interinstitutional coordination mechanisms between
energy, forestry, water, tourism and environment sectors, through which medium-term targets
had been set to promote mainstreaming of environment in sectoral policy; and (b) supporting
the approval and implementation of fiscal instruments to promote the payment of municipal
water fees and investment in municipal hydraulic works and for revenue generation from the
use of national marine protected areas and corresponding reinvestment in the environmental
management of these areas. EnvSAL I supported the achievements of the GOM with regard to
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of local environmental management processes in
Mexico through (a) the creation of an enabling environment to decentralize federal
environmental management functions to the State level via changes to key laws; (b) the
preparation and implementation of a stepwise decentralization strategy, which includes the use
of third party certification to ensure that the quality of decentralized processes is maintained;
(c) the preparation and publication of decentralization plans on the part of over 20 states; (d)
the assignment of a federal grant program (PDIA) to finance capacity building in States with
plans to assume new environmental management functions; and (e) the development and
implementation of a strategy to improve public access to information on Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) and permit applications based on the passage of a national law on the
transparency of information.


4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

Achievement of goals, current status of program, status of next planned operation

4.     GOM met all the goals for the disbursement of the first tranche ($101.01 million) of
EnvSAL I prior to Board presentation. The achievements of the first tranche covered the
setting of targets across different sectors, preparation of a multisectoral program and the
passage of some critical laws on both use of fiscal instruments and on decentralization.
Dialogue between the Bank and GOM on the adjustment loan including modifications to the
laws took place over a period of about a year prior to Board approval of EnvSAL I in August
2002. Significant achievements under the first tranche with respect to mainstreaming
environmental concerns are as follows:


(i)    Environmental fiscal instruments were developed for the first time in the history of
       environmental management in Mexico. Some of the results of the development of these
       instruments included:
       a. Increase in the revenues from amount of water fees collected at the municipal level,
           and increased incentives so that municipalities could invest in water resource
           management programs. Specifically, the Law of Rights on water (Ley Federal de
           Derechos) was modified in January 2002 to incorporate the provision that up to
           100% of municipal water fees collected may be returned to municipalities
           respectively, in accordance with an incentive scheme under which municipalities
           need to invest an equal amount of funds in water resource development programs.
           In addition, a Presidential decree was issued in December 2001 to permit
           exoneration of water fee-related debt by federal government for municipalities,



                                                    6

           which agree to pay water fees in the future and to forego federal funding for water
           supply and sanitation in the event that fees are not paid;
       b. Decrease of overexploitation and improvement of operation of and investments in
           national tourism resources. In particular, this included the approval by Congress of
           the articles on tourism in the Law of Rights, which allowed user fees for maritime
           activities, protected areas, and whale watching respectively, with provision for
           earmarking of revenue generated for reinvestment in the particular tourism resource
           generating the revenue.
(ii)   Approvals of amendments by Congress in December 2001 of four laws (Ley General
       del Equilibrio Ecologico y la Proteccion al Ambiente; Ley General de Vida Silvestre;
       and Ley de Bienes Nacionales) aimed to create an enabling environment to decentralize
       environmental management from the federal to state governments;

(iii)  Development of monitorable, medium-term targets to guide and monitor the
       incorporation of environmental concerns in key development sectors namely water,
       energy, tourism and forestry sectors; and

(iv)   Development of a strategy to improve public access to information on environmental
       management functions. The provision for public access to information on EIA and
       permits was made through the following pieces of legislation: Ley Federal de
       Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública Gubernamental, Ley General del
       Equilibrio Ecológico y Protección al Ambiente and Reglamento de Impacto Ambiental.


5.     Building on this successful start, GOM's achievements met and in fact exceeded all but
three of the conditions of the second tranche ($101.01 million) of EnvSAL I. As will be
discussed in the following paragraph, the partial success achieved with these three conditions
were due to reasons outside the control of SEMARNAT. Achievements under the second
tranche reflect important advances in inter-institutional coordination, aimed at facilitating
mainstreaming of environmental concerns in key sectors; and with respect to decentralization
of environmental management functions to states. Noteworthy among these achievements
were:


(i)    Establishment of interinstitutional coordination mechanisms between SEMARNAT and
       energy, forestry, water and tourism sectors. Through these mechanisms, four
       Intersectoral Technical Working Groups (ITWGs) for each of these sectors were
       established and played a key role in defining sectoral environmental agendas and
       priorities with input from different sectors.
(ii)   Implementation of fiscal instruments for both municipal water fees and protected areas
       where funds are channeled back to the sector to improve environmental management.
       Specific results included increased revenues and increased investment in water resource
       management as illustrated below:
       a. Return of over 95% (480.7 million Mexican Pesos) of water fees to the National
           Water Commission by the Finance Ministry for use by municipalities for better
           water management; and
       b. In the tourism sector, a 200-fold increase in marine park revenues (compared with
           2001) was achieved in 2002 as a result of charging user fees and earmarking these
           for management of protected areas.



                                                    7

        c. In addition, by October 1, 2003, municipalities had paid water fees corresponding to
            58% (approximately 3.2 million cubic meters) of the concessioned water use by
            volume (compared with baseline of 24% the previous year).

(iii)   Improved public participation and transparency in environmental management. Public
        disclosure of processing information on some environmental management functions
        helped to minimize discretionary and inconsistent administration of procedures and
        enhance efficiency of environmental management. In SEMARNAT, public disclosure
        of information on some EIA review and approval and permitting was achieved on a
        pilot basis through a website.


6.      As mentioned above, partial waivers were requested for the following conditions:
    (i)     condition 1: the establishment of Intersectorial Technical Working Groups (ITWGs)
            in water, energy, tourism, and forestry composed of members with designated titles.
            In discussing this waiver it is important to note first that the ITWGs were
            established and are fully functional. The need and request for a partial waiver were
            purely circumstantial owing to the fact that a few of the titles for the members of
            the ITWGs as described in the EnvSAL changed during implementation. These
            changes, in some cases, were to ensure more appropriate representation in the
            ITWG than was originally envisaged during the preparation stage of the loan; in
            other cases, the agency in question underwent reorganization resulting in changes in
            the title of the post. Nevertheless, in all cases, the positions are at the same
            organizational level as envisaged in the EnvSAL, continue to be with the same
            agencies specified in the EnvSAL, and perform the appropriate substantive
            functions. In some sectors, namely forestry and water, in addition, there has been
            institutionalization of intersectoral coordination through changes in laws.
    (ii)    condition 8: ISO-9001-2000 certification of EIA review and approval, forest fire
            detection and control and permit-issuance functions (INE-05-002, INE-06-002,
            INE-04-002, INE-04-003, INE-02-004, INE-02-005, INE-02-009, SEMARNAT-
            03-005, SEMARNAT-02-001 and SEMARNAT-01-002-A) of the Ministry of
            Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) that are to be decentralized to
            the state governments from SEMARNAT. The request for the partial waiver was
            necessitated by changes in institutional roles as a result of changes in legislation in
            the country, and staff changes in SEMARNAT. In this context, the majority of
            functions related to EIA review and approval and permits described in the EnvSAL
            are certified. The exceptions related to (a) forest fire detection and control as this
            was transferred out of SEMARNAT to the Forestry Commission (CONAFOR)
            following approval of a new Forestry Law; and (b) non-timber reporting
            (SEMARNAT-03-005).           This   was    delayed    since  the   newly    appointed
            Undersecretary of Environmental Management (following recent Cabinet level
            changes) was conducting a complete review of permitting procedures, that aim at
            combining some permits and hence changing the way that these permits are issued.
            Therefore it was sensible to await completion of this review prior to embarking on
            certification of these permitting procedures. This review has now been completed
            and a decision has been taken to merge some permits and to eliminate others. In
            terms of certification, the Government has decided to de-link certification from the
            decentralization process.      Certification is considered important to promote



                                                      8

           "continuous improvement" but is currently seen as less important in the process of
           assuring the quality of decentralization to the States, based on internal evaluations
           conducted by SEMARNAT. The timing for certification will also depend on the
           timetable for consolidating permitting procedures.
   (iii)   condition 11: public disclosure of processing information on EIA review and
           issuance of certain permits (INE-05-002, INE-06-002, INE-04-002, INE-04-003,
           INE-02-004, INE-02-005, INE-02-009, SEMARNAT-03-005, SEMARNAT-02-
           001 and SEMARNAT-01-002-A) by SEMARNAT. A partial waiver was requested
           for this condition for the same reasons as for condition 8. The majority of
           processing information of permits is disclosed on public websites. The exceptions
           related to (a) forest fire detection and control as this was transferred out of
           SEMARNAT to the Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) following approval of a
           new Forestry Law; and (b) non-timber reporting (SEMARNAT-03-005). This was
           delayed since an ongoing review is underway of permitting procedures, aimed at
           combining some permits and hence changing the way that these permits are issued
           and therefore it was sensible to await completion of this review prior to embarking
           on setting up a system to publicly disclose these permitting procedures. Recent
           discussions with GOM indicated that the processing status of forest fire detection
           and control permits are already available to the public through the CONAFOR
           webpage. In the case of non-timber reporting, the public disclosure system is
           currently expected to be operational by July 2004.


A more detailed summary of the achievements of the EnvSAL I against the stated objectives is
presented in Table 2 in the annex. A summary of first and second tranche conditions is
presented in Table 3 in the annex. Table 4 in the annex summarizes the scope of the permit
issuance functions referred to herein.


7.      The next operation has been scheduled in the CAS for fiscal year 2005. However,
contracting and implementation of the studies that will be financed under the PHRD grant for
the next operation have been delayed due to changes in senior posts and hence a reassessment
of strategic priorities for the remainder of the administration (i.e., Undersecretaries and
Director Generals) at SEMARNAT and SENER. The new administration is in the process of
selecting priority activities to be undertaken with PHRD funding.


8.      Given the strong economic situation of Mexico, the country is considering whether or
not it should take a second loan. Consequently, progress on the second operation will depend
on how rapidly the GOM reaches a decision on this, since most of the triggers for the second
operation have already been met.


5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome


9.      Loan effectiveness was delayed due to the fact that GOM decided to sign a contract for
the loan directly with the Bank i.e. without BANOBRAS as borrower. Consequently, a new
template for the contract, Contrato de Mandato y Ejecución between the United Mexican


                                                    9

States, SEMARNAT and BANOBRAS had to be developed to reflect the new role of
BANOBRAS as financial intermediary. The Loan became effective on December 17, 2002.


10.    Interinstitutional coordination, a valuable and essential element of the EnvSAL
Program, was also a source of delay as institutions went through a process of learning how
best to coordinate for the EnvSAL program and how to fully benefit from the process of
coordination. This, together with scarce human resources and financial resources, in a budget-
constrained environment, assigned to the adequate functioning of the ITWGs, as well as
changes in ITWG participants resulted in delays in the initial inadequate functioning of the
ITWGs. In addition, once the ITWGs were established for the four sectors, there was a delay in
getting high-level staff to participate in meetings with each of the four groups, as required in
the loan conditionality. Some of the actual procedures established by the legal agreement that
required high level participation were also considered excessively cumbersome by the GOM
during implementation, and that the transaction cost of complying with this condition was high.


11.    The process of interinstitutional coordination and the extensive nature and content of
the discussion involved required more time than initially envisaged and led to an extension of
the closing date of EnvSAL I from October 31 to December 31, 2003. By the new closing dates
all requirements were successfully met and only minor waivers were sought as explained in
paragraph 6 above.


6. Bank and Borrower Performance


Borrower


12.    The political will provided by the GOM was crucial for the fulfillment of the conditions
specified for the first operation. As an illustration, the GOM's continued commitment to
sustainable development was demonstrated with the changes made to the Ley Federal de
Derechos, approved by Congress in December 2002. Furthermore, a change in the Project
Coordinator in February 2003 enhanced the pace of project implementation.


13.    The GOM has also complied with all relevant legal covenants, with the exception of
one covenant. This requires that the GOM provide a progress report on the program, prior to
any exchange of views between the Bank and GOM.              While there have been informal
exchanges about different aspects of the program, no formal report on the program, as a whole,
has been furnished to the Bank prior to supervision missions. Typically, information was
provided individually during supervision missions.


14.    Initially, the implementing agencies did not take advantage of the Bank's early offers of
technical assistance (such as technical workshops for ITWG members on particular topics,
including Strategic Environmental Assessment, public expenditure reviews and financing
sectoral strategies), following Board approval of EnvSAL I.        This may have resulted in


                                                   10

significantly reducing the time that it took to meet with certain conditions, including those
related to establishing the high-level ITWGs. More recently, there is a strong demand from the
GOM for technical assistance from the Bank linked with the EnvSAL program.


Bank


15.     EnvSAL I was prepared and supervised by a large multidisciplinary Bank team as
required by the intersectoral nature of the operation. Two preparation missions were conducted
by a total of nine specialists in environment, environmental engineering, economics,
environmental economics, water resources management, energy, financial management, urban
planning and operations. Intensive supervision was provided by the Bank. Five supervision
missions were conducted involving staff with specializations in water resources management,
environment, environmental engineering, environmental economics, law and energy.


16.     One area in which the Bank could have improved was its own internal process of
intersectoral coordination in certain sectors, such as water sector projects and Global
Environment Facility, GEF-funded renewable energy projects, particularly in the choice of
activities in the Bank's portfolio and pipeline linked to the EnvSAL program. These could
have been made in a more strategic manner thus resulting in a greater impact in achieving key
objectives defined in the program matrix.


7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series


17.     On one hand, the experience from EnvSAL I shows that interinstitutional coordination
is a complex process which requires substantial efforts and sustainable commitments on the
part of participating entities. Reaching such commitments is both difficult and time consuming.
On the other hand, this same experience shows that where interinstitutional coordination was
successful, it led to enhancements in the quality of outputs. The problems experienced with
interinstitutional coordination as described in earlier sections of this report, stemmed broadly
from institutions going through a process of learning on how best to conduct and gain from
such a process of coordination linked to the EnvSAL program. This is not specific to Mexico,
but would have applied to all developed and developing countries.


18.     The preceding paragraph points to the need for continuous budgetary support and
adequate human resources for successful interinstitutional coordination and for the design of a
different mechanism than that used in EnvSAL, i.e the ITWGs. In other countries, the inclusion
of a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL) to directly support the implementation of reforms
proposed by the SAL could represent an important option to overcome some of the constraints
mentioned above and indeed to deepen the effects of reforms and ensure mainstreaming and
sustainability. However, in Mexico, Bank loans are not as allowed to become additional
funding to existing sectoral budgetary allocations, but in fact have the effect of displacing
existing funding. Consequently, there is a need to develop positive institutional incentives to
reward behavior that promotes interinstitutional coordination; and to identify how best to


                                                   11

institutionalize processes of intersectoral coordination within the Mexican context. The use of
technical assistance from the Bank and grants from GEF and other sources managed by the
Bank could provide such incentives to promote mainstreaming.


19.     The number of conditionalities in EnvSAL I was high and the triggers covered a broad
range of developmental areas. Consequently, implementation and supervision covered an
enormous range of topics, presenting challenges in terms of sufficient human and budgetary
resources and the constant and intense nature of the dialogue between the GOM and the Bank
throughout the period of implementation.           For future operations, fewer number of
conditionalities should be selected, in such a way that they are strategically important, will
address the sectoral priorities of the country, and therefore will still have significant
development impact.


20.     The experience from EnvSAL I provided an opportunity for several lessons to be
learned and shared through the various steps of design and implementation. It is important that
interinstitutional coordination incorporate a learning mechanism whereby lessons learned are
captured, distilled and fed back into the process in a step-wise manner in order to promote
continuous improvements of outputs in future operations.
