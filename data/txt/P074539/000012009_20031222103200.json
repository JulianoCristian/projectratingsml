outcome-based program to promote\n            sustainable development, and to mainstream environmental\n            concerns in water, forestry, energy and tourism sectors.\n            Mexico has met all the conditions of this operation, with\n            the exception of three conditions, which have been met for\n            the most part. Partial waivers are sought for these\n            conditions: a) condition 1: the establishment of\n            Inter-sectoral Technical Working Groups (ITWGs) in water,\n            energy, tourism, and forestry; b) condition 8: ISO-9001-2000\n            certification of certain environmental impact assessment\n            (EIA) review and approval, forest fire detection and\n            control, and permit-issuance functions of the Ministry of\n            Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) that are to be\n            decentralized to the state governments from SEMARNAT; and,\n            c) condition 11: public disclosure of processing information\n            of certain permits. Condition 1: the ITWGs have all been\n            established and are functional. However, technically, a\n            partial waiver is needed and warranted, given changes, in\n            some cases, to ensure more appropriate representation in the\n            ITWG than was originally envisaged during project\n            preparation were needed, and also, because the agency in\n            question underwent reorganization changes. Conditions 8 and\n            11: the majority of functions related to EIA review,\n            approval and permits, have been certified, and processing\n            information of related permits is disclosed on public\n            websites. The exceptions relate to forest fire detection and\n            control (which was transferred out of SEMARNAT to the\n            Forestry Commission (CONAFOR) following approval of a new\n            Forestry Law) and, non-timber reporting (Permit No.\n            SEMARNAT-03-005). The latter is likely to be delayed, since\n            a complete review of permitting procedures is being\n            conducted, and seemingly, some permits will be combined.\n            Therefore it makes more sense to await completion of this\n            review, prior to embarking on certification, and/or\n            disclosure of permitting procedures. Based on the assessment\n            that the objectives of the program have been met in\n            substance, and that all conditions have been met with the\n            exception of three conditions requiring minor partial\n            waivers, it is proposed that the Second Tranche be made available."}, "docdt": "2003-12-04T00:00:00Z"}
