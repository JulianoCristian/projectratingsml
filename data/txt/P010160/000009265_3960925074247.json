The physical\n            targets were achieved, sustainability is likely under\n            certain conditions, the impact of the project has been\n            substantial on the farming industry, and both the Bank and\n            the Borrower performed satisfactorily. There is one central\n            lesson learned from this project. It provided the\n            opportunity to consolidate the gains achieved under earlier\n            projects and to make necessary changes in the program to\n            efficiently translate water savings into increased\n            agricultural production, improve maintenance of renovated\n            watercourses, and emphasize a broader range of OFWM\n            practices. New changes to be introduced because of the\n            project are: 1) implementation of a pilot program; 2)\n            provision of specialized staff training and improved\n            coordination between Water Management and Extension; 3)\n            provision of an additional Water Management officer and two\n            assistants per field team; 4) better project monitoring and\n            evaluation; and 5) measures to partially recover the cost of\n            construction materials along with rate increases."}, "docdt": "1988-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
