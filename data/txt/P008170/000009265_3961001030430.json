plan, and describes and\n            evaluates the debt and debt service reduction (DDSR)\n            agreement. The DDSR agreement was reached in late 1990\n            between Uruguay and its commercial bank creditors and was\n            implemented in February 1991. The report : 1) reviews the\n            background to recent economic developments, the severity of\n            the debt burden, and the adjustment policies pursued in 1990\n            and 1991; 2) evaluates the DDSR agreement in terms of a\n            financial analysis of its instruments and the impact of the\n            agreement on Uruguay's external financing and\n            development prospects; and 3) contains a summary of country\n            assistance strategy and Bank operations."}, "docdt": "1991-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
