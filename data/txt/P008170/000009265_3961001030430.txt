standard variable interest rate
obiectivest              The proposed loan is intended to support the Debt
and Debt Service Reduction (DDSR) Agreement reached
between Uruguay and its commercial bank creditors in
)late 1990 and implemented in February 1991. This
Agreement covered Uruguay's total medium- and long-
term rescheduled (MYRA) commercial bank debt of
US$1.6 billion. Of this amount, US$628 million was
bought back at a discount, US$535 million converted
to collateralized Par bonds at a below-market
interest rate, US$447 million rescheduled;
furthermore, US$89 million in new money was raised.
In support of this Agreement, it is proposed that
the Bank provide a stand-alone loan of US$65 million
consisting of two componentst (i) US$32 million to
reimburse Uruguay for a portion of the costs of the
cash buyback and (ii) US$33 million to reimburse
Uruguay for a portion of the cost of the purchase of
the interest collateral associated with the par
bond. The Bank agreed to a limited waiver of the
negative pledge restriction in the Bank's loan and
guarantee agreements with Uruguay in support of the
Agreement on February 14, 1991 (R91-13).
Benefits and Risks:      The proposed loan would support a reduction in debt
and debt service to commercial banks equivalent,
in net present value terms, to US$503 million or
31 percent of the face value of MYRA debt. The DDSR
agreement will lead to savings in net interest
payments equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP, and will
help limit fiscal expenditures thereby assisting in
the reduction of the fiscal deficit. Lower
inflation and lower interest rates are expected to
result. The conversion of a large proportion of
commercial bank debt into fixed interest rate debt
will provide protection against interest rate
fluctuations. Together with supporting adjustment

policies, DD8R will make possible higher private
investment and accelerated growth without the
economy experiencing external financing gaps.
Foreign investment would be promoted and
creditworthiness improved.
The chief sources of risk are adverse external
developments and possible slippages in the
implementation of medium-term adjustment policies.
In the face of external shocks, some combination of
policy tightening (involving a sacrifice in short
run growth) and additional financing would be
pursued--Uruguay's robust post-DDSR external
position provides a cushion. The present Governmant
has pursued corrective policies with steadfastness
and has adopted a strong medium-term program. Given
the high priority placed by the Government on
servicing debt to the Bank and Uruguay's excellent
record in this area as well as the intensity of the
dialogue with the Bank on the formulation of
economic policies, the risks to the Bank are judged
to be small.
The proposed loan would be disbursed in one tranche
upon loan effectiveness in order to reimburse
Uruguay for a portion of the costs of the cash
buyback and the Interest collateral of the par bond.
Rate of Seturns          The Internal rate of return on the cash buyback is
37 percent and on the par bonds 34 percent.

1.        I submit the following report and recommendation concerning a
proposed loan to the Republic of Uruguay for the equivalent of US$65 million
to support a debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) program. The loan would
be extended for a period of 15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.

2.        In early November 1990, Uruguay issued a term sheet outlining the
elements of a debt and debt service reduction (DDSR) agreementl/ reached
between the country and its commercial bank creditors covering debt totalling
US$1.6 billion. The agreement supplanted the multi-year rescheduling
arrangement (MYRA) of 1988. By end-1990, virtually all comercial banks had
made known their elections of the instruments offered by the agreement. A
description and a preliminary evaluation of the DDSR agreement was provided to
Ext.cutive Directors on January 29, 1991 in a Briefing Note, together with a
request for a limited waiver of the negative pledge provisions in the Bank's
loan and guarantee agreements with Uruguay in order to enable Uruguay to
pledge collateral for one of the instruments (the par bond) of the DDSR
agreement. The Board discussed the DDSR agreement and granted the request
for the limited waiver on February 14, 1991. The DDSR agreement was
implemented on February 19, 1991.
3.        This Report presents an asessment of Uruguay's economic adjustment
efforts, appraises its medium-term economic. program and external financing
plan, descrLbes and evaluates the DOSR agreement and recommends Bank support
for the DDSR operation. In Chapter TI, the background to recent economic
developments, the severity of the debt burden, and the adjustment policies
pursued in 1990 and 1991 can be found. chapter III details the conditionality
behind the proposed loans it outlines and appraises the medium-term economic
program and external financing plan of the Uruguayan authorities. Chapter IV
describes the DDSR agreement. Chapter V evaluates the DDaR agreement in terms
of a financial analysis of its instruments and the impact of DDSR on Uruguay's
external financing and development prospects. The proposed Bank loan,
JJ  Details of this agreement are presented in Chapter IV.  The agreement
consists of both debt and debt service reduction instruments as well as
a debt conversion/new money commitment instrument. In this Report, it is
referred to as the DDSR agreement.

strategy and of Bank operations. Chapter VIII contains the recommendation.
II. ECoNoMIC AD1USUMNT
ackaround to Economic DOvOlocuents
4.        After a decade of economic growth averaging 3 percent a year with
moderate rates of inflation and balance of payments equilibrium, the Uruguayan
economy experienced a deterioration in the early 1980. (Chart 1). Real output
fell 4.1 percent a year on the average between 1981 and 1985. It recovered
thereafter, growing 4.1 percent a year through 1989. However, in 1989 real
GDP was 1 percent lower and in per capita terms 6 percent lower than in 1981.
Gross fixed capital formation grew in real terms over the 1970s at an annual
average rate of 10.1 percent, but declined precipitously over the 1982-1985
recession (Chart 2): as a share of GDP in 1985 it amounted to less than half
of its 1981 value. At 12 percent of GDP in 1989, Uruguay's gross capital
formation remains inadequate to sustain growth; it represents small net
addition to capital after accounting for depreciation.
5.        The disappointing economic performance in the 1980s reflected
several external factorss the onset of the debt crisis, the curtailment of
private capital flows to Uruguay, and the adverse impact of mounting
instability in it. large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil, but also such
internal factors as the emergence of large fiscal imbalances and the weakening
in productivity gains, which led to a sharp acceleration in inflation.
Furthermore, the pronounced real appreciation of the peso after 1978 distorted
incentives to adjustment. Its eventual correction through a massive
devaluation at end-1982 (Chart 3) led to insolvency of heavily exposed private
sector borrowers, which contributed to failures within the banking system.
6.        Attempts in 1983 and 1984 (made in the context of a standby program
with the Fund) to address growing economic imbalances proved unsuccessful
largely owing to continued laxity in fiscal policy (Table 1), and substantial
Central Bank losses associated with a portfolio purchase scheme intended to
provide liquidity to the banking system. In contrast, policies between I18
and 1(87 (supported by a Fund standby and subsequent enhanced surveillance,
and in 1987 by SAL-I) were broadly consistent with the needs of economic
adjustment and were associated with a sharp recovery in domestic output.
Continued strong growth in exports moved the external current account to
surplus in 1986. In particular, the fiscal deficit fell significantly as the
public revenue effort intensified and the quasi-fiscal deficit declined.
Inflation, however, remained high (Table 1 and Chart 4) as wage policies
remained loose and monetary policy was accommodating. Policy measures
intended to promote investment and export-led growth centered on
liberalization of current and capital external transactions, maintenance of a

range. fLially, the authorities obtained a MYRA with commercial banks in
1986--subsequently renewed in 1988--that provided relief on over two-thirds of
medium and lcng-term debt and permitted Uruguay to service external debt
obligations without recourse to new money requests (except for a US$45 million
new oney dLsbursement associated with the Bank B-loan in 1986), although with
relLance on significant dollar denominated borrowing in the local market.
7.        The fabric of macroeconomic adjustment and structural reform began
to fray in late 1987 and serious policy deviations emerged in 198  and 1989.
At the outeet of these difficulties, the authorities took appropriate
corrective action, particularly to dampen domestic demand, consistent with
their overall record of timely responses to problems. The balance of payments
position remained satisfactory. These gave grounds for confidence that the
Government would undertake the necessary economic measures to reverse further
slippage, and on the basis of such undertakings and a financial sector reform
program, SAL-II was approved in mid-1989. However, the combined public sector
deficit grew and reached the equivalent of 7 percent of GDP in 1989 as
compared to 4.8 percent of GDP in 1988. Central government and quasi-fiscal
expenditures rose markedly, public enterprise finances and central government
revenues registered a deterioration, partly owing to a severe drought that
afflicted the country in the second half of 1989.  Inflationary impulses were
exacerbated by accelerating credit expansion, declining real interest rates
and intensification of wage indexation. As a result, in 1988 and 1989,
inflation surged to a range of 70-90 percent and output stagnated. The
external current account improved to register a surplus averaging more than
1 percent of GDP.
S.        The key impediments to a recovery in investment and a return to
sustained growth can be identified as inflation and external indebtedness.
As noted, inflation surged to 70 percent in 1987-89 compared with 50 percent
in 1983-84. To some extent, inflation has been "imported" from Uruguay's much
larger neighbors, Argentina and Brazil, both of which suffered profound
macroeconomic instabilities in the 1980s. The monetary authority and the
Treasury issued substantial debt, in part to sterilize capital flows from
these countries. In addition, in both the private and public sectors, real
wage growth outpaced labox productivity between 1985 and 1989. Rising real
wages contributed to the high public sector borrowing requirement and rising
public sector debt. The high costs of dealing with the financial system
crisis that erupted in 1982 (including the cost of managing the bankrupt
private banks that fell into public sector hands in 1985 and 1987), together
with the accumulating borrowing requirement created by the social security
system, contributed further to mounting public sector indebtedness. Rates of
interest on this debt--including external debt, dollar-denominated Treasury
bonds and bills, and Central Bank Monetary Regulation Bills--remain highl the
public sector interest bill is an increasingly large component of the public
expenditure, and tends to crowd out both public and private investment.

Severity of the Debt Burden
9.        Floating-rate external indebtedness increased markedly in the late
1970s. Medium- and long-term debt amounted to US$790 million (22.2 percent of
CDP) at end-1975 but by 1983, i.e., just after the onset of the debt crisis,
rose to US$2.7 billion (54.3 percent of GDP). Debt since then has fallen in
relation to GDP: at end-1989, debt amounted US$3.3 billion (38.9 percent of
GDP, Table 2). The rapid build up of debt in the late 1970e was associated
with a sharp rise in the resource transfer to Uruguay. Resource transfers
reached 4.8 percent of GDP on average in 1979-1981, which explains in large
part the rapid rise in capital formation at that time (Chart 5). From 1981,
however, rising world interest rates combined with a sharp decrease in the
availability of external financing forced a sharp reversal in resource
transfers. Net outward resource transfers peaked at 7.7 percent of GDP in
1983, and have remained in the range of 3 percent to 6 percent between then
and 1990. Interest payments as a share of GDP rose sharply following the
build up of debt and the spike in international interest rates in the first
half of the 1980s, peaking at 7.0 percent of GDP in 1985 but falling to
4.0 percent in 1990.

Source: World Debt Tables and staff calculations.
Even so, the debt service burden remains severe: in 1990, although there was
no amortization of debt to commercial banks, the debt service ratio amounted
to 28.4 percent. Uruguay's limited access to international credit markets
implies a continuing high net resource transfer abroad, thus depressing
domestic investment. For these reasons, Uruguay has been classified as a
highly indebted middle-income country and one eligible for DDSR.

a; Including short-term.
10.       Uruguay's debt and debt service burden is comparable to those of
other countries that have been assisted by Bank loans or waivers of the
negative pledge clause in support of DDSR operations (Table 3). In 1989,
Uruguay's debt in relation to GNP was lower than those of the other countries,
but within 5 percentage points of that of Mexico. (The discussion in this
paragraph is in terms of GNP as data in the World Debt Tables are presented as
ratios of GNP.) Interest payments in relation to GNP were similar to those of
Costa Rica, Mexico or the Philippines. The debt service ratio on medium- and
long-term debt was also comparable to those of the other countries. Uruguay
has fully serviced its interest payment obligations punctually. The
uninterrupted payment of full interest payments on time implies, of course,
that the cash savings realized from DDSR represent actual savings on payments
and not just on accruals. With the refinancing and reduction of its external
debt under the DDSR agreement, Uruguay will realize substantial cash flow
saving (including saving on interest payments), and, with appropriate economic
policies, should be able to direct thio saving to generate new capital
formation. Moreover, the fact that the debt has been reduced in an orderly
market-based fashion through negotiation should permit Uruguay to secure
additional voluntary financial flows.
Economic Policies and Performance in 1990
11.       The present Government came into office in March 1990 facing a large
fiscal deficit (equivalent of 6-1/2 percent of GDP in the first quarter of
1990), loose monetary policies and accelerating inflation, which soared to
three digit annualized rates. Net official reserves had fallen by
US$30 million in the first quarter. The authorities quickly adopted a
stabilization package consisting of forceful fiscal measures, substantial
increases in public utility tariffs to strengthen financial balance within the



- 10 -
public enterprises, and tightened monetary policy. Higher revenues--
equivalent to about 4 percentage points of annualized GDP--resulted from
increased rates of corporate taxes on public enterprises, increases in the
agricultural income tax, increases in various excise taxes, the institution of
a real estate transfer tax, a rise in VAT by one percentage point for a year,
and a temporary surcharge of 5 percentage points on imports subject to low
tariff brackets. Restraint on expenditures was exercised through a firm
public sector wage policy (implying a steep fall in real wages), cuts in
outlays on public investment and goods and services, and a temporary reduction
in transfers to the social security system. Public sector wages fell by
10.1 percent in real terms in 1990. Public utility tariffs were raised in
several steps in 1990, particularly prices of petroleum products, and these
increases, together with expenditure restraint, are projected to improve the
financial balance of public enterprises by about 1.5 percentage points of GDP.
The authorities liberalized the conduct of monetary policy by introducing an
auction system for the determination of the interest rate on Central Bank
bills and have encouraged the banking system to set interest rates according
to market conditions. They have also exercised greater discipline over the
state-owned but highly autonomous commercial bank, the Bank of the Republic
(BROU).
12.       The tightening in financial policies has been reflected in a
stabilization of the economy. The overall fiscal deficit is estimated to have
narrowed from the equivalent of 7 percent of GDP in 1989 to 2.9 percent of GDP
in 1990.1' The effect of fiscal tightening and greater restraint in monetary
policy on inflation was, however, overwhelmed by external inflationary
impulses: the sharp rise in the price of oil from August 1990 and the
pronounced, sustained real appreciation in the currencies of Argentina and
Brazil. Inflation accelerated in 1990 to reach 129 percent by year-end.
However, the underlying rate of inflation has moderated since the final
quarter of the year (abstracting from the one-time effect of public utility
adjustments and of a mid-year drought) and external factors have now turned
favorable. The economy is estimated to have grown by 0.6 percent in 1990.
Subdued imports resulting from the slow pace of domestic activity (domestic
demand fell by 1 percent in 1990) together with a robust export performance
(export volume rose by 5 percent in 1990) led to a rise in the external
current account surplus to the equivalent of 2.5 percent of GDP. In
particular, the current account bonefitted greatly from increased net earnings
from tourism (US$65 million) of a windfall nature that resulted largely from
the severe appreciation in real terms of the austral and the cruzeiro.   Net
international reserves rose by US$80 million in 1990.
EconoMic Policies in 1991
13.         The major objectives of the economic program for 1991 are an
increase of growth to 2 percent (based on a recovery in the share of
investment to output to 13 percent), a reduction of inflation from
129 percent during 1990 to 50 percent during 1991, and limiting the fall in
net external reserves to US$30 million after making payments from reserves for
financing DDSR. The authorities also intend to promote an efficient supply
response within the economy by carrying out a program of structural reforms,
particularly in the financial sector, public employment, privatization and
I/        The figures for 1990 are preliminary outturns.



- 11 -
trade. The 1991 program will be supported by condLtionality developed under
the proposed DDSR loan (described in Chapter SIS) as well as a Fund standby
program.
14.       In support of these objectives, the authorities intend to maintain a
tight  f-uAltaWA by limiting the overall public sector deficit to no more
than the equivalent of 2.5 percent of ODP,W to keep monetarv oolicies
restrictive, to ensure public sector waoe awarda consistent with steady
deceleration in inflation and to maintain external competitiveness. The
revenue measures of a temporary character in the 1990 budget (the temporary
increase in VAT and in import tariffs) are to bo partially replaced by
permanent new taxes on financial and insurance companies and holding
companies, a modification of taxes on bank assets to increase yields,
extension of corporate tax to public enterprises, and modifications in the
payment of wealth and corporate income taxes. In addition, the coverage of
the VAT may be broadened. Various measures affecting both the revenues and
entitlements of the social security system are being modified to reverse the
adverse financial impact of increases in expenditures mandated by a national
referendum in late 1989. The authorities have decided that public sector
wages would be adjusted every four months in line with the target (declining)
rate of inflation; an 11 percent award consistent with this policy was granted
in January 1991. However, the tota'. wage rise amounted to 22.5 percent in
January 1991, taking account of an element granted as a retroactive
adjustment. Even so, public sector salaries were 5.5 percent lower in real
terms in the first quarter of 1991 as compared to the corresponding quarter of
1990. The authorities intend to limit the May 1991 award to a purely forward-
looking adjustment.  Although private sector wage determination is to be left
to market forces, given the highly unionized nature of the labor force,
broadly similar guidelines would apply to private sector wages.
15.       In 1991, the authorities intend to intensify structural rgforms in
various sectors of the economy. The financial sector is to be exposed to
greater market competition, and supervision and regulation of the banking
system will be strengthened, particularly to cover BROU more fully. Besides
consolidating the market-based setting of interest rates, the authorities
intend to rationalize and simplify the system of monetary control. The quasi-
fiscal losses of the Central Bank associated with the nationalization of three
local banks in liquidity difficulties are to be transferred to the Treasury
and, following the sale of the first bank, will be progressively eliminated
with the reprivatization of the remaining two banks. In March 1991, the
Central Bank issued a resolution imposing on BROU 100 percent reserve
requirements on general government deposits, and on other deposits similar
reserve requirements (with phased implementation) to those applied to
commercial banks. BROU also raised the differential on all its loan to
deposit interest rates to substantial positive levels. The authorities will
reduce import tariffs by 10 percentage points for the highest band and by
5 percentage points for two of the three intermediate bands to attain a
4/    The overall public sector deficit is projected to fall from the
equivalent of 2.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to 2.5 percent of GDP in
1991. The non-financial public sector surplus would fall by about
0.3 percentage point (Table 1) owing to the expiry of certain one-time
revenue measures in 1990 as well as the transfer of certain quasi-fiscal
losses to the Treasury.

10 percent to 30 percent schedule in September 1991. The major non-tariff
restriction at present--the use of reference or minimum export prices--will be
modLfied in the course of 1991 to incorporate a more stringent test of injury
to local production. All applications for protection under this regime will
have to made afresh by end-April 1991 and over the following two months the
decision of the authorities as to successful applications will be made known.
The authorities have indicated strong support for proposals for regional trade
integration. Steps will be taken in 1991 (details in Chapter 11I) to reduce
the scope of the namlig negta both in size and in its role in the economy, as
well as the fiscal burden of welfare expenditures. They have indicated
intentions to remove state monopoly powers and to expand private participation
in productive and service areas. Complementary measures are intended to trim
the size of the civil service, simplify regulatory requirements and reduce
waste in public procurement.
16.       Inflation has fallen thus far in 1991s  in the first quarter of the
year prices rose by 16.3 percent as compared to 27.9 percent in the third
quarter and 18.2 percent in the final quarter of 1990. Thus, policies of
restraint are yielding results but it should be noted that the inflation rate
is in part a hostage to developments in terms of trade (especially the price
of oil) and to stabilization policies pursued in neighboring countries,
particularly to the evolution of the real exchange rates of the austral and
the cruzeiro. The 1991 program will significantly boost the beneficial
effects of the DDSR agreement on the fiscal balance, public and private
investment and balance of payment savings and constitute a material
improvement in Uruguay's medium term growth prospects.
Ill.  THE UCONOMIC PROGRAM
Medium-Term Economic Prouram
17.       Uruguay's medium-term strategy is directed towards attaining a
potential, sustainable real growth rate--in the range of 2-1/2 to 3 percent
per annum--consistent with internal and external balance, as manifested by low
inflation, stability in the public sector debt ratios and viability in
external payments. The DDSR agreement together with supporting adjustment
policies makes feasible the realization of this rate of growth without
encountering external financing gaps. The elimination of the debt overhang,
policies intended to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and market-
oriented structural reforms are projected to lead to the necessary higher
private investment. In order to support growth of 2-1/2 to 3 percent per
annum, the share of investment in GDP would have to rise by about 4 percentage
points on the average in 1992-95 as compared to 1991. This increase in the
investment ratio would be financed by a reduction in public sector dissaving,
of which savings stemming from DDSR are a part, a rise in private saving in
conditions of more assured macroeconomic stability, and some greater inflows
from foreign direct investment and other external financing.
18.         Macroeconomic management will be directed to securing the target
rate of growth, while limiting inflation to a range of 15-25 percent and
maintaining the external current account deficit to the equivalent of
3/4 percent of GDP consistent with the expected external financing
availabilities (Table 4). Foreign exchange reserves (gross) would be held at



- 13 -
not les than the equivalent of 3-1/2 months of imports of goods and nonfactor
services. In support of these objectives, Uruguay's overall public sector
deficit will b set not to exceed the equivalent 2.0 to 2.5 percent of GDP
in 1991-95 (in contrast to 7.5 percent of GDP on average in 1983-89 and
2.9 percent of GDP in 1990). The fiscal target adopted is consistent with
annual inflation of about 20 percent and would permit adequate resources to be
channelled to the private sector in support of investment, while permitting
sufficient growth in private consumption.

&l Outturn for 1990 is preliminary.
19.       strengthened fiscal restraint would encompass both revenues and
expenditures (Table 5). Emphasis is planned to be placed on restraint on
expenditures. Over the medium term, the authorities propose to enact a tax
reform with the aim of broadening the coverage of value added tax, simplifying
the system of direct taxes with the objective of removing distortions,
improving tax neutrality and encouraging investment activities. In addition,
prompt adjustment in public utility tariffs will continue to be made, and the
surplus of public enterprises is targetted to rise over the medium term in
order to enable them to finance a higher share of investment. Revenues of the
nonfinancial public sector are projected at 27.6 percent of GDP over the



- 14 -
medium term. In keeping with the official objective of reducing the role of
the public sector in the economy, the ratio of current expenditures to GDP
will fall from 2S.S percent in 1991 to 23.0 percent in 1995, averaging
24.2 percent over the medium term. Despite some upturn in public investment,
the ratio of total expenditures (current and capital) to GDP is targetted to
fall from 28.6 percent in 1991 to 26.5 percent in 1995, l.e, to average
27.6 percent over the medium term. The public sector wage bill will be held
constant in real terms. The authorities intend to reduce employment in the
public aector, partly via redundancies and partly through privatization of
activities. The medium-term budget also provides for a cut in real terms in a
broad category of expenditures on goods and services and for a further
reduction in non-social security transfers.

20.       The stance of monetary and exchange rate policies is intended to
exert pressures on inflation and create the room for a reallocation of
resources to the investment and export sectors. Monetary and exchange rate
instruments are to be managed flexibly with the aim of attaining the medium-
term inflation and balance of payments objectives. The monetary implications
of the newly instituted debt-equity scheme will be closely monitored to ensure
consistency of monetary and inflation targets. The reduced public sector
deficit is to be financed by bond sales and strictly limited recourse to
domestic credits firm limits will be applied to credit expansion by the
banking system (including BROU) through active interest rate policy
management. The rate of the depreciation of the peso in the foreign exchange
markets within the existing system of crawling peg will be managed so as to
secure an adequate degree of competitiveness.



- 15 -
21.        8tructural reforms.  The medium-term economic program adopted by
Uruguay envisages structural reforms in the key sectors of the economy with
the fundamental purpose of promoting efficiency gains and higher investment
through sharpened incentives for greater private sector--both domestic and
foreign--participation in the economy. Efficiency in the pattern of
development will be ensured by greater reliance on market forcea, particularly
in the financial sector, and by further trade liberalization.
22.       The role of the state in industrial and commercial activities is
intended to be reduced, with the purpose of releasing resources to the private
sector. (As noted, the counterpart to this policy action is a fall in the
share of both public expenditures and revenue to GDP over the medium term.)
The authorities have presented legislation for the elimination of state
monopolies in the areas of insurance, alcohol production, natural gas
distribution, port services and telecommunication services; Congress has
already passed legislation demonopolising insurance. The authorities intend
to privatize public enterprises in aviation, natural gas and
telecommunications over the medium term; studies have been initiated to this
end with the assistance of international consultants. Opinion in Parliament
on both demonopolisation and privatization continues to be divided, but there
is growing acceptance of the need for a diminished role for public
enterprises.
23.       Within the Government sector, steps will be taken to enhance
productivity. A scheme for early retirement of public servants is being
implemented that is estimated to result in a cut of about 7 percent in the
public sector payroll in 1991. Employment reduction in some central
government activities that are amenable to private sector participation (e.g.,
customs, certain Agriculture Ministry activities) is being pursued.
Procurement practices of public bodies are being reformed to reduce domestic
preference. Finally, an important medium-term objective is reform of the
social security system so that actuarial soundness is attained and reliance on
transfers from the central budget greatly reduced. The authorities will press
for passage of legislation to delay the retirement age, reduce rewards for
early retirement, make restrictive the definition of base salary on which
pension benefits are calculated, and relate such benefits more closely to the
workers' lifetime contribution. Changes of such a fundamental kind will be
phased in over the medium term and the assistance of the Bank is being
provided in the design of the reform.
24.       In accordance with the objective of maximizing incentives for
private investment, the authorities intend to limit the role envisaged for
public investment outside the social sectors, to providing essential
infrastructure services and to complementing the needs of private investment.
Emphasis is also being placed on obtaining efficiency improvements in project
design and execution. The Government is now formulating a new medium-term
investment program designed mainly to provide essential infrastructure support
for productive activity and more adequate social services. It would be
limited in size so as to hold public capital formation to 3.5 percent of GDP.
The content of the program similarly would be fashioned to increase



- 16 -
opportunities for private sector participation in capital formation. The
authorities have also set guidelines for phasing out unjustifiable subsides
related to publlc investment and for realizing efficiency improvements in the
execution and management of such expenditures. Over half the envisioned
investments will be concentrated on ensuring adequate electricity, fuel and
water for producers and commerce, more effective transport facilities and
expanded telecommunications. Somewhat over a quarter will focus on improving
the quality of (rather than expanding) education, health and housing systems.
Many of these investments entail the continued implementation of Bank--as well
as IDBE-supported projects. A Bank mission in March 1991 examined the
composition of the program.
25.       The authorities also seek to strengthen the public investment
process in order to upgrade the quality of these expenditures. With the help
of past Bank and IDB technical assistance, the Planning Office's (OPP)
programming has been strengthened to improve project screening and selection,
establish follow-up mechanisms and introduce ex-post evaluations.
Simultaneously, performance contracts have been introduced between the
Government and public enterprises. These developments will be advanced over
the medium term by such measures as stricter oversight of project execution
and fortifying OPP's capacity to better relate investment to available
resources.
26.       The supply responsiveness of the Uruguayan economy has been hindered
by rigid union-fostered labor nractices and by weaknesses in the system of
oroyertv rights. A reduction in the degree of wage indexation is expected to
contribute to labor market flexibility, but basic reforms concerning
entrenched rights to employment are necessary. Democratic reforms in union
election practices are being sought. Similarly, a simplification of legal
processes is considered necessary if incentives to private investment are to
be strengthened. A modification to the legal code speeding up legal
proceedings was approved in November 1990.
27.       Inefficiencies within the financial sector have entailed a large
fiscal burden (associated with the need to shoulder the losses of several
insolvent commercial banks) and have led to a misallocation of savings within
the economy and to misdirected investment. Over the medium term, the banking
system will be made competitive by permitting a greater role to market forces,
and by subjecting BROU to the full disciplines of monetary control and
supervision. Thus, monetary control exercised by the Central Bank would be
sharpened and standards of supervision tightened. These reforms represent a
continuation of those fostered by SAL-II and would also be supported by a
proposed sector adjustment loan from the IDS. Monetary control would be made
more efficient by rationalizing reserve requirements imposed on banks and by
greater recourse to market-oriented methods of liquidity control. Banking
regulation and supervision tests have been made more stringent, with



- 17 -
firmer surveillance over asset quality, more modern standards of accounting
and with prompt remedies to capital deficiencies being required.
28.       The BROU will conform to the accounting and supervision standards
required of all banks and will be required to maintain Identical reserve
requirements. Reserve requirements against deposits placed by the central
government and the social security system will remain at 100 percent; this
will eliminate on loans the quasi-central bank status of BROU. Interest rates
paid and charged by BROU on loans are to be market related. Finally, a
thorough risk classification of BROU assets will take place, with non-
performing loans clearly identified and provisioned. The capital adequacy of
BROU will then be examined and, if necessary, a plan for recapitalization
developed. The Mortgage 8ank (BHU) makes operating losses and suffers from
weak cash flow as mortgage repayments are adjusted too infrequently for
inflation. Corrective steps are ..ow underway to strengthen RaU.
29.       The medium-term program envisages trade liberalization in the
context of regional integration involving the economies of Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay. The authorities will eliminate the temporary import
surcharge of 5 percentage points in September 1991 and reduce the highest
tariff band by 10 percentage points to 30 percent and have announced their
intention to seek a further reduction in tariff rates in the context of
progress with regional integration. The major non-tariff restriction at
present--the use of reference or minimum export prices--will be modified in
1991 to incorporate a more stringent test of injury to local production, but
its protection effects will still remain significant and the authorities are
aware of the need for further reform. The authorities have indicated strong
support to proposals for regional trade integration believing that Uruguay
would greatly profit from the common lowering of trade barriers. Uruguay will
press for low rates of protection in the negotiations with its neighbors and
for speedy progress towards integration.
Bxternal Pinacinea Plan
30.        At end-1989, Uruguay's total medium- and long-term external debt
amounted to US$3.3 billion (38.9 percent of GDP), of which US$1.7 billion
(54.2 percent) was owed to commercial banks (Table 6). This debt burden gave
rise to interest payments of US$350 million, and to total debt service
payments of US$600 million (30.1 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor
services) in 1989. The DDSR agreement covers the totality of commercial bank
debt, except for a small portion that has not been subject to rescheduling in
the past, being associated with a cofinancing agreement (B loan) with the
Bank. In addition, Uruguay has US$1.9 billion of foreign currency debt
outstanding to residentss total foreign currency debt (both external and
internal) at end-1989 stood at the equivalent of 61.0 percent of GDP.

31.       in the absence of DDSR, Uruguay's external financing requirements
associated with the official medium-term target for growth of
2-1/2 to 3 percent per annum, would amount to US$2.6 billion in 1991-95
(Table 7). After identifLcation of likely capital sources, an external
financing gap of US$0.5 billion would have remained. This estimate is based
on the assumption that commercial bank disbursements would equal amortization
(L.e., the equivalent of a MYRA in 1991) and that the authorities would be
able to obtain access to bond financing and significant increase in bilateral
and multilateral exposure would occur. Clearly, an external financing gap of
this magnitude would be inconsistent with proposed growth. Under such a
scenario, Uruguay would have been able to grow at about 1.9 percent per annum
over the medium term consistent with viability in external payments. (For
details, se Annex II-.)

Sources Bank projections.
32.       With the DDSR agreement, the projected current account deficit over
1991-95 falls to Us$240 million largely because of savings in net interest
payments. Some reduction in autonomous capital outflows (capital flight) can
be expected to occur. However, the burden of net amortisation of commercLal
bank debt rises sharply--by US$352 million--on account of the debt bought back
for cash. The DDSR agreement can be expected to lead to an improved climate
for foreign investment, and capital inflows could also be expected to
strengthen in reflection of improved prospects for investment and greater
creditworthiness. Some larger participation in external financing by
bilaterals and multilaterals may also be assumed. Projections (Table 8) are
based on cautious estimates of additional access to bond financing, to other
credits, higher foro4gn investment and dampening of capital flight.  They show
that the external financing gap associated with growth at 2.6 percent over the
medium term would be eliminated in the wake of the DDSR agreement, provided
that medium-term economic reform policies as announced are successfully
implemented by the authorities.
1/    Foreign investment would be facilitated by debt-equity swaps permitted
by DDSR. The estimated impact of DDSR on external financing flows is
discussed in detail in Chapter V.

IV. TMM DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION AOREEMENT
overview of the Aaroment
33.       Uruguay's negotLations with lts commercial bank creditors regarding
the DDSR agreement were concluded in November 1990. The entire US$1.6 billion
of commercial bank debt covered by the 1988 MYRA was eligible for the DDSR
operation. The Eligible Debt amounts to half of Uruguay's US$3.2 billion
outstanding medium and long-term publlc and publicly guaranteed external debt
(Table 4). A term sheet with the following menu of options was made available
on November 5, 1990, and presented to all creditors on November 15 and 16,
1990s
(i)   cash buyback
(li)   30 year collateralized fixed rate notes (also referred to as the
par bond); and
(iii)   debt conversLon notes with a new money provisLon for debt that is
not tendered under options (i) and (ii). This option was
equivalent to rescheduling tled to new money.



- 21 -
Details are provided in Table 9. Early participation fees were avaLlable to
credltore prepared to make commitments by December 7, 1990. Uruguay and ite
creditors signed the agreement on January 31, 1991, and lmplemented the
traneactLon on February 19, 1991.
Desr-iatio  of the !ustruments
34.       The Cash Buyback was offered to creditors at a rate of
US$0.56 per US$1.00 of Eligible Debt--a rate somewhat hlgher than the
secondary market price of Uruguayan debt at the tlme that the term sheet was
finalized, in order to increase the attractiveness of this option to
participating banks. Under this instrument, Uruguay repurchased the
outstanding claim. tendered, and thus all future obligations related to
serviciag those claims were canceled.
35.       The Collateralized Fixed Rate Notes were issued in registered form
by the Central Bank of Uruguay. Under thls instrument, creditors will receive
the full amount of their outstanding principal claims on Uruguay in a single
payment In the year 2021. Since the par value of the loan is maintained, thie
instrument ie interchangeably referred to as a par bond. The principal amount
of the notes is fully collateralized by the pledge of zero coupon securities
having a matching value and maturity date. Interest payments are based on a
fixed rate of 6.75 percent for the 30 year life of the instrument. These
payments are partly collateralized, on a roll-over basis, by the pledge of
cash or permitted securitLes in an amount equal to 18 months of payments.
Earnings on the interest collateral account will accrue to Uruguay. The fixed
rate notes contain a value recovery provisLon which entitles holders to
supplementary semi-annual payments beglnning in 1996 should Uruguay's terms of
trade (as defined) exceed a certain value. These supplementary payments would
accrue to holders of the fixed rate notes should the commodity terms of trade
index consisting of the price of beef, rice, wool (three principal exports)
divLded by the price of oil (a prlncipal import) exceed 110, with the average
June 1988 - June 1990 value of this index being equal to 100.o
36.       Finally, banks could simply reschedule their existing obligations,
provided that they agreed to purchase New Money Notes amounting to 20 percent
of the exposure submitted for rescheduling. Rescheduling of existing
obligations was carried out by means of Debt Conversion Notes. which  are
issued in two seriess Series A having a maturity of 17 years and Series 8
having a maturity of 16 years, both with 7 year grace periods and bearing an
interest rate of LIBOR plus 7/8 percent. The corresponding new money notes
have a maturity of 15 years with 7 years of grace and the interest rato is
LIBOR+1 percent. Both the new money notes and the debt convereion notes are
uncollateralized instruments.
fi/ In the event of the index rising above 110, the value of the fixed rate
note would be increased by a proportionate amount. Thus a rise to 120
(9.1 percent) would lead to a similar rise in the value of the Notes.
The index was constructed using an oil price of US$15/barrel.

Other Provisions of the Aareeomnt
37.         Frontloading of New Money Disbursement:  New money was to be
disbursed in two tranches during 1991. Seventy percent of new money notes was
to be purchased at closing, and the remaining 30 percent six months after the
closing date. The substantial frontloading of new money commitments in the
Agreement was remarkablel even so, at the closing of the transaction on
February 19, 1991 all banks agreed to disburse the entire amount of the new
money in one tranche on that date. Other Peatures of the Pro2o2al: All notes
were iosued in registered form and all options were available in US dollara
only. Non-dollar obligations constituted approximately 15 percent of
Uruguay's outstanding debt, and all creditors accepted the dollar as the
designated currency for this operation. The use of a single currency greatly
simplified the provision of collateral for the fixed rate par bonds.
38.       Tax and Reaulatory Considerations:  The Fixed Rate Note was issued
in two series. Series A was tradeable immediately after the closing date,
while Series B closed thirty days after Series A and was tradeable sixty days
after the initial closing. Banks which were well-reserved against their
Uruguayan exposure and had their assets marked to market preferred series A
notes which could be traded upon issuance. For banks not able to afford to
build reserves and which did not wish to mark to market, the Series B allowed
a two month delay in which to prepare for portfolio restructuring.  The pegt
Conversion Note was also issued in two series. Series A was a note of one
year longer maturity than series B, but tradeable immediately after closing,
while series B was tradeable 30 days later. Early Participation Fees There
was an early participation fee of 1/8 percent of eligible debt tendered before
December 7, 1990 for the cash buyback and the fixed rate note. In the case of
new money the fee was 5/8 percent of the amount tendered.
39.       Exit Instruments:  The term sheet established that all instrumernts
in the Plan would be exempt from future requests for new money and would not
be subject to rescheduling. All new debt issued through the financing program
(including the debt conversion notes) is eligible to participate in Uruguay's
debt conversion program (i.e., debt equity swaps), and may be used for
investment in all sectors of the economy. In addition, a maximum of
30 percent of the total of new money notes would be convertible at par over
three years if the proceeds were used for debt equity swaps or the
privatization program. This protects investors from decline in the secondary
market value of notes as long as they elect to participate in the government's
program. Furthermore, all instruments may be repurchased by Uruguay at any
time with no restrictions as to price provided Uruguay was not in payments
default on the instruments.
Res22nses of Commsrcial Bank Creditors
40.       Creditors holding Eligible Debt responded favorably to the Plan.
By December 17, 1990, the cutoff date for the buyback offer, all creditors
had committed to one or more options offered to them, and the entire
US$1.6 billion of eligible debt had been submitted. The choices of the
creditors (Table 10) revealed a notable preference for maintaining claims on
Uruguay. Of the US$1.6 billion submitted, US$982 million (61 percent) was
exchanged for instruments involving no reduction of principal value.
Furthermore, US$447 million (28 percent) was exchanged for instruments that



- 24 -
were not collateralized and that also called for additional uncollateralized
exposure (new money) in the amount of US$89 million. This confidence on the
part of creditors would appear to be based on Uruguay's sound debt servicing
record, taking account of MYRAs, in the 1980s.

Cost of Collateral and Sources of Financial Susport for the Agreement
41.       Based on the above distribution, the total cost of collateral
required for the plan was US$463 million (Table 11). Uruguay obtained an
average yield of 8.01 percent on 30 year US dollar zero coupon bonds, the
security pledged for principal repayment; the cost of principal collateral was
US$57 million. The cost of 18 months of interest payments as interest
collateral was US$54 million. Set-aside funds from the Bank in the amount of
US$32 million are proposed to be used to support the cash buyback, and the
balance of funds required for the buyback is provided from other multilateral
sources and by Uruguay's own reserves. A standby arrangement with the Fund in
the amount of SDR 94.8 million (approximately US$135 million), of which 25
percent (approximately US$34 million) was "set aside" for financing the cash
buyback and would be made available in a single tranche, was agreed in
December 1990. The remainder of the standby (approximately US$101 million)
will bolster Uruguay's reserves against the background of DDSR operations.
International reserves targets under the performance criteria of the standby
will be adjusted, subject to consultation with the Fund, to reflect use of
reserves for DDSR operations. The IDB is expected to provide US$37.5 million
for DDSR support around June 1991 without any specific earmarking for
principal collateral or interest collateral.

Interim Fiaancina
42.       The agreement closed on February 19, 1991.  Uruguay was responsible
for (pro-rated) payment of contractual interest on the Eligible Debt until the
date of exchange. As the financial support from the Bank, the Fund and the
1DB was expected to become available some months after the closing date of the
DDSR agreement, the authorities financed the transaction by selling gold
outright in the amount of US$58 million, by further selling gold in the amount
of US$219 million with the option to repurchase at a pre-determined price, and
by drawing down US$97 million of foreign exchange reserves. The repurchasa
operations involving gold would be unwound substantially by the proceeds of
drawings from the Bank, the Fund and the IDB, but none of these parties is a
participant in any formal bridging arrangement. A one-year loan in the amount
of US$40 million is expected to be disbursed shortly by Mexico and the
drawdown in foreign exchar;e reserves would then be limited to US$57 million.
The Mexlcan loan will be repaid by disbursements from the IDB in a year's time
under a sector adjustment loan expected to be committed shortly.

V. EVALUATION OF TUE DEBT AND DEBT SERVICE REDUCTION AGREEMENT
43.       The DDSR agreement and the associated Financing Plan constitute a
comprehensive restructuring of over half of Uruguay's public medium and
long-term external debt (Table 4). The major impact of the Financing Plan on
Uruguay's external debt obligations is:
(i) Restructured Principal Payments: Uruguay faced obligations
to repay US$322 million of principal in 1991-1996. Under the plan,
US$628 million of debt was retired in 1991 and the entire issue of Fixed Rate
Notes (US$535 million) will effectively be pre-paid through the purchase of
zero coupon bonds. Principal payments on the balance of US$447 million will
not fall due until 1998 and will be amortized over the following ten years.
Uruguay is relieved from making any principal payments on its external
commercial debt until 1998, which proviaes a substantial period for a
strengthening of its capacity to repay these amounts.
(ii)   Reduced Interest Payments:  Interest payments on Eligible
Debt will be reduced by nearly half in the period 1991-1996, with the precise
size of future savings depending cn the evolution of LIBOR. The DDSR
agreement has led to an additional significant benefit: reduced vulnerability
to fluctuations in interest rates. Only 28 percent of the Eligible Debt,
namely the amount tendered under the Debt Conversion option, will have a
fluctuating interest rate subject to a margin over LIBOR, in contrast to
100 percent of debt earlier.
(iii) New Money: The Agreement provided "net" new money to Uruguay
for the first time since 1985. All previous disbursements of so-called new
money were strictly for the purpose of meeting existing debt service
obligations.
Financial Analvsis of Instruments in the Aereement
44.      Table 12 presents the "equivalent buyback price" and the internal
rate of return on resources invested in each instrument. The "equivalent
buyback price" provides a relative measure of the efficiency of use of
collateral funds to support instruments other than the cash buyback. This
measure addresses the following question: given that a certain cash flow
saving is generated from the use of collateral to support a particular option,
if a country wishes to achieve identical cash flow savings by means of a
buvback instead, using the same amount of funds as are pledged for collateral,
at what price would the buyback have to take place? It then makes possible a
comparison of this price to the actual price of the cash buyback. In
Uruguay's DDSR agreement, the sole instrument for which the equivalent buyback
price can be calculated is the fixed rate note, the only collateralized
option. The results show that the equivalent buyback price for the fixed rate
note is broadly in line with the cash buyback price, and that the two

instruments are, therefore, broadly comparable in terms of competitiveness.
Equivalent buyback price calculations are sensitive to the assumed price of
collaterals (rate of interest on US zeros), projected LIBOR and the assumed
discount rate. The usefulness of this technique lies mainly in providing an
order of magnitude of the relative efficiency of use of collateral resources.
In this case that test is clearly satisfied, and is confirmed by the near
identical, high internal rates of return on each instrument.
45.       The above calculations assume as zero the estimated supplementary
interest payments that Uruguay may have to make to its holders of fixed rate
notes based on the Value Recovery Provision which becomes effective in 1996
(see para 35). As noted, this provision could reduce cash flow savings
realized by Uruguay under DDSR should the necessary degree of improvement in
terms-of-trade occur. It is noteworthy, however, that the provision has been
structured so as to afford an element of protection to Uruguay. This has been
achieved by including the price of oil, a major import, in the weighted
commodity index. Previous value recovery provisions in similar financing
plans (Mexico, Venezuela) agreed with commercial creditors have been based
only on the price of the principal export (oil in both cases), and have,
therefore, been shorn of any offsetting influences arising from higher import
prices.
Impact on Cash Flow
46.       Three measures of the effect of the DDSR agreement on Uruguay's net
external payments flows are presented in this Report. The first is a measure
of net cash flow savings assuming that Uruguay would have continued to honor
its MYRA commitments on schedule, i.e., would have begun repayment of
principal from 1991. The second is a measure of net cash flow savings
assuming that Uruguay would have obtained a further MYRA in 1991 with debt
being rescheduled over 17 years with 7 years of grace. Finally, a calculation
of net interest savings assuming an identical MYRA in 1991 is presented. (The
second and third measures differ in that the cash flow calculation (i) takes
account of the contribution to financing made by the new money bond and debt
servicing related to it and (ii) ignores interest foregone on reserves used
for the cash buyback. In contrast, net interest savings takes account of
interest foregone on reserves used and treats new money as "additional" debt.)
The macroeconomic evaluation of the deal--the materiality impact--is conducted
in terms of net interest mavings only. Tables 13 and 14 summarize the direct

impact of the DDSR agreement on cash flows. (See also Annex V, Tables and
Charts). On the assumption that Uruguay would have continued to honor its
existing NYMA commitments in full and punctually, total cash flgo sav nog
amount to an average of US$104 million per annum during 1992-1997 (Table 13).
Thi net reduction in external payments is significant, being the equivalent
of 5 percent of exports of goods and nonfactor services and 25 percent of
total public sector (including public enterprises) capital expenditures. The
negative cash flow savings in the first year (US$273 million) result from the
costs of the cash buyback and the collaterals for the par note, all of which
must be paid in 1991. The cash requirements are partially alleviated by the
disbursement of the entire amount of new money also in 1991. Positive cash
flows begin from 1992 and continue for the entire life of the MYRA, i.e to
2004. Cash flow savings then turn modestly negative because Uruguay will
continue to service its fixed rate notes through 2021, and the remaining
amortization and interest on its new money notes (to 2005) and its debt
conversion notes (to 2006 or 2007 depending on the series).
47.       The internal rate of r-etun from the direct debt service savings
is 28 percent, taking account of all 1991 costs of DDSR as well as the
stream of future benefits. An evaluation of the stream of payments which
Uruguay must make to its creditors with and without DDSR, shows that the
nresent value of the savings is US$510 million (evaluated at a discount rate
of LIBOR+13/16 percent), or 32 percent of the face value of MYRA debt.
48.       Cash flow savings under DDSR have also been calculated on the
assumption that Uruguay would have obtained a further MYRA in 1991 on
rescheduling terms similar to the debt conversion notes, i.e., would have
rolled over amortization obligations (Table 14). On average, in the period
1992-97, annual savings amount to US$63 million. The cash outflow in the
first year, 1991, amounts to US$309 million. Total cash flow savings
correspond to an internal rate of return of 24 percent. The 2resent value of
savings is calculated at US$503 million or 31 percent of the face value of
xYRA debt.

Not Interest Saviu@s
49.       Table 15 presents calculations of net interest savings associated
with DDSR. These calculations take no account of cash flow relief realized on
repayments of principal at a discount that result from the extinguishing of
debt through the cash buyback. They also do not capture the beneficial effect
of the lengthening of maturities through the par bond. Thus, they understate
the true benefits to the economy of the DDSR agreement that emanate from the
realization of the discount on early repayment of the buyback amounts as well
as deferral of principal repayments made possible by the par bond. Generally
deferrals of repayments of principal are obtainable only via repeated
rescheduling arrangements, which are not costless to arrange. Furthermore,
the DDSR agreement permits a lengthening of maturities to 30 years in the case
of the par bond (with the bond grace period also being 30 years as it is a
bullet maturity)--such bond maturities and grace periods are, of course, not
asen in conventional reschedulings. Net interest savings amount to
US$43.7 million (0.5 percent of GDP) between 1991 and 1997. This calculation
is, of course, sensitive to LISOR. A 1 percent higher LIBOR than assumed
would raise net interest savings to US$52.0 million; a 1 percent fall would
reduce net interest savings to US$34.9 million.

Imoact of  p_SR on 1xternal Financing Flows
50.      Chapter III contained a discussion of the estimated effect on net
external financing over the medium term of the DDSR agreement. Net external
financing flows are projected to strengthen as a result of (i) interest
savings realized from DDSR; (ii) some deferral of amortization;
(iii) projected higher inflows of direct foreign investment resulting from the
pick up in investment and improved growth prospects; (iv) interest savings
resulting from future debt reduction operations; and (v) some greater access
to international capital markets as a consequence of improved creditworthiness
of the economy. As noted, net interest savinag are calculated at
US$43.7 million per year after 1991. The chief sources of the deferral of
amortization as compared to a hypothetical further MYRA in 1991 is given by
the lengthening of the maturity to 30 years and the bullet payment feature of
the par bond.
51.       The DDSR agreement is expected to promote a rise in foreian
Javestment within the economy. On the demand side, the improved prospects for
growth, greater fiscal, price and interest rate stability are expected to lead
to an upturn in investment. On the supply side, domestic investible resources
would be released by the reduction in the size of the public sector, and
foreign direct investment would be stimulated by trade liberalization and the
institution of debt-equity schemes. Direct foreign investment could be
expected to be boosted once Uruguay ratifies the MIGA convention, which it has
already signed.
52.       In March 1991, the authorities issued a decree that envisaged the
conversion of up to US$40 million in external debt to domestic equity in 1991;
similar schemes will be put into effect in future years as well. Applications
by investors outlining the nature and size of the proposed investment and the
debt instruments to be tendered have been invited. The authorities plan to
review the applications in May and to announce the selection of successful
bids shortly thereafter. In the process of selection, the criteria used will
be whether the investment was likely to be truly "additional," the discount
applied on the debt instrument, and the long-term interest of the investor in
Uruguay, besides the rate of return on the investment itself. Portfolio
investment would not be eligible. No limitations would be placed on the
repatriation of earnings. In this program, all instruments issued under DDSR
would qualify for conversion. As a first step, external debt bought back at a
discount in the secondary market by the investor would be exchanged for
promissory notes issued by the Central Bank or for Treasury notes at a
negotiated exchange price. These notes would be eligible for conversion into
domestic equity in line with an agreed program. The authorities envisage
that, once their program of privatization gets under way, debt equity schemes
in future years would permit the purchase of public sector assets through the
proceeds of debt conversion. It is estimated that over the medium term,
assuming some "leakages" from genuine additionality in net investment, foreign
direct investment would be higher on account of the debt-equity scheme above
by US$25 million per year and would be higher in total by US$33 million per
year (Annex III).
S3.      The DDSR agreement permits the purchase at a discount of all the
instruments issued, i.e., par bonds, debt conversion notes and new money
notes, in the secondary market by Uruguay, apart from purchases by private
investors under debt-equity schemes. The authorities intend to reduce



- 33 -
external debt further by undertaking canh buybak operations provided the
price (and, hence, the rate of return) is attractive, and provided the
operation makes the best use of foreign exchange reserves at the margin. In
this way, the future debt servicing burden will be reduced and net external
financing available to the economy will be strengthened, but at an upfront
cost in cash flow terms. However, given the uncertainties associated with
future buyback operations, external projections (Annex IIS) reflect no
further debt reduction effects of this kind.
54.      By putting Uruguay's relationship with commercial banks on an
improved, sustainable basis--through the elimination of future rescheduling or
concerted new money requests and by the reduction in the debt and debt service
burden and, hence, improved creditworthiness--the DDSR agreement is expected
to lead to greater trade and project financing and to some restoration of
Uruguay's access to aeneral ouroose financina. Subsequent to DDSR deals,
Mexico and Venezuela have been able to raise new bond financing. Uruguay
stands in the category of the most creditworthy of borrowers that have
rescheduled their debt. Indications have been obtained from both the market
in private placements and the Eurobond market that Uruguay would have little
difficulty in obtaining additional access now that DDSR has led to an
improvement in creditworthiness. The medium-term projections (Annex III) are
based on an estimate of new money financing of about US$25 million per year in
additional bond financing, and increased access to private unguaranteed
financing by US$15 million per year.
Mau.aQewent of International Reserves
55.      The preceding paragraphs have shown that the DDSR agreement greatly
facilitates the external debt management tasks of the authorities.
Furthermore, confidence in the adequacy of international reserve holdinQs of
Uruguay would be strengthened by the reduced debt service payments made
possible by the DDSR agreement. Central Bank reserve holdings are required to
be higher than those of countries with comparable imports mainly for two
reasons. First, the Uruguayan authorities are responsible for the smooth
functioning and supervision of the Montcvideo offshore banking market and
large liquid reserve holdings are necessary in order to underpin confidence in
that market. Secondly, Uruguay's internal, public sector, dollar-denominated
debt at short maturities amounts to US$1.9 billion; about US$900 million has
to be rolled over every six months. The internal debt market considers large
liquid reserve holdin<in to be a form of backing for such debt. At end-1990,
foreign exchange rese, s stood at US$544 million (the equivalent of 4 months
of imports of goods and nonfactor services); total reserve holdings (including
gold valued at market prices) amounted to US$1.4 billion. As noted in para.
42, part of reserve holdings were mobilized in February 1991 in order to
finance the DOSR transaction. Reserves will be replenished by drawings upon
the Bank, the Fund and the IDB. The medium-term objective calls for holdings
of foreign exchange reserve equivalent to not less than 3-1/2 months of
imports of goods and nonfactor services.
External Payvents in Face of Adverse Shocks
56.      As indicated in Table 8, total gross external financing required in
1992-95 amounts to an annual average of US$435 million per year, consistent
with average GDP growth of 2.6 percent per year. This amount is projected to



- 34 -
be met by some increase in net foreign direct investment and improved access
to international capital markets. The projections, detailed in Annex III,
Table 3, are based on Bank-wide (PAC) assumptions regarding interest rates,
terms of trade, international inflation, and world growth. A projection of
Uruguay's balance of payments prospects in the face of an adverse external
shock has been made using the PAC "downside" assumptions. Oil prices are
assumed to be 10 percent higher between 1991 and 1995 and the price of
manufacturing imports higher by 1 percent between those years. Furthermore,
the interest rate on external debt is projected to be 0.9 percentage point
higher on the average between 1991 and 1995. Adverse external developments of
this size would cause the current account to deteriorate to a deficit
equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP in 1992 to 1995 on the average and external
financing gaps of US$90 million per year would be experienced were Uruguay to
attempt to grow at an unchanged 2.6 percent per year. The rate of growth
would have to fall to 2.0 percent (or roughly equal to the economy's feasible
rate of growth in the absence of DDSR) for external financing gaps to be
avoided. External debt would amount to the equivalent of 32.6 percent of GDP
at end-1995 as compared to 28 percent of GDP in the non-shock case. This debt
burden is still quite manageable. These projections in the face of downside
shocks illustrate the beneficial impact of DDSR in cutting debt stocks and
debt service in 1991 that results in a strengthening of the capacity of the
economy to withstand external shocks.
limact of DDSR on Investment and Growth
57.      As explained in earlier sections of this Report, the abrupt
cessation of commercial bank lending to Uruguay in the early 1980w, together
with the continued, punctual servicing of external debt (albeit with the aid
of rescheduling arrangements) by the country, entailed a large reversal in the
net resource transfer flow. In consequence, investment fell markedly and
investment has been foreign exchange-constrained ever since. The level of
investment in the 19809 has been hardly sufficient to cover capital
consumption, and domestic output has not grown on average in the decade. By
relaxing the foreign exchange constraint, the DDSR agreement permits the
financing of a higher share of investment in GDP and lays the foundations for
higher sustained growth.
58.      The estimated impact of DDSR on investment and growth can best be
seen by comparing three cases that are summarized in Table 16 and discussed in
detail in the projections (Annex III). in case , with no DDSR, Uruguay would
be restricted to running a current account deficit no higher than 0.2 percent
of GDP on the average in 1992-95 consistent with available external financing,
assumed to involve no new money from commercial sources but rollover of
maturing principal, some rise in bilateral lending and in direct foreign
investment but a significant rise in multilateral lending. Economic policies
are assumed to be stabilizing but, in face of the external debt burden, fiscal
adjustment would remain limited. Nevertheless, some room for improvement in
the investment ratio (to 14.7 percent on average in 1992-95) is projected and
growth in output of 1.9 percent on the average in 1992-95 could be realized.
ca&VS_--still no DDSR--simulates an attempt to grow at 2.6 percent or at a
rate close to the estimated potential rate of growth of the economy. A rise
in the investment ratio to 16.9 percent on the average in 1992-95 would be
necessary. Such a rise cannot be projected to materialize as external
financing gaps averaging US$109 million per year on the average in 1992-95
would be experienced and the attempt at faster growth would be aborted.

59.         Case C is based on projections of growth and balance of payment
developments on the assumption of the DDSR agreement struck in early 1991. It
is further assumed that the authorities adhere broadly to the medium-term
adjustment program as outlined in their Letter of Development Policy: in
particular, that fiscal imbalances are further reduced to the benefit of
inflation and interest rates and structural reforms take hold that lead to the
reallocation of resources from the public sector to private investment. With
the agreed DDSR two additional sources of financing for investment and growth
become available. First, the direct effect of net interest savings
(approximately 0.5 percent of GDP), which permits the economy to raise imports
by an equivalent amount consistent with an unchanged current account deficit.
Secondly, additional external inflows over 1992-95 (as discussed in the
previous section of this chapter) stemming from some upturn in net foreign
investment (projected at an additional US$33 million annually)--in part
related to the significant debt-equity scheme just instituted--some further
rise in multilateral lending (projected at an additional US$14 million
annually) and a greater degree of restored access to international capital
markets (projected at an additional US$l5 million per year). On cautious



- 36 -
assumptions, lt li projected that Uruguay could finance a current account
deficit equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP on the average ln 1992-95.
60.         ComparLng cases A and C, the projections imply that the economy li
able to finance additional Lmports of 1-1/2 percentage points of GDP in 1991-
9S that are necessary for GDP growth of 2.6 percent consistent wlth no
external fLnancLng gaps. On the important assumptlon that the prlvate
lnvestment-promoting effects of the medium-term program remain in place, about
one-third of the additLonal lmports at the margln are assumed to be capital
goods, equivalent to about 1/2 percent of GDP. This relaxatlon of the
external constraint ls consistent with a rise in the ratio of gross investment
to GDP between 1991 and 1995 by about 2-1/4 percentage points (comparing case
A with case C), wlth 1-3/4 polnts beLag supplled domestically and 1/2
percentage poLnt from imports. The counterpart to the increased domestic
Lnvestment effort is a 0.4 percentage point improvement in public sector
savLang (the targetted Lmprovement in the fiscal balance) and a rise of 1.3
percentage points in private savings. Table 17 presents the evolution of
savLngs-Lnvestment balances that underlies the economic program.

61.         Addltional investment of thls magnitude is projected to boost
average annual growth to 2.6 percent--l.e., a rise of 0.7 percentage points
compared wlth case A--in 1992-95. The implied gross ICOR is a conservative 6.
This analysis suggests that DDSR, together with supporting adjustment
policies, is eseential for the economy to grow close to its potential rate of
growth consistent with available external financing. Growth in the post-DDSR
world is projected to be accompanied by improved creditworthiness: total
medium- and long-term debt is projected at 32.5 percent of GDP in 1995 under



- 37 -
case A but at 28.0 percent of GDP under case C} with the debt service ratios
in 1995 amounting to 27.8 percent and 23.9 percent, respectively.
62.         The above calculations should be considered to be illustrative:
they are based on essentially plausible estimates of the use of incremental
lmports for capital goods, the extent of higher direct foreign investment, a
gross ITOR of 6, and the like. It should be emphasized that the role of
supporting adjustment policies in ensuring that the benefits of DDSR are
channelled into investment and growth is crucial. In particular, fiscal
adjustments will have to be sustained over the medium term. Even with DDSR,
which permits relief of about 0.5 percent of GDP to expenditures (equivalent
to net interest savingse, the fiscal accounts will continue to be tightly
constrained. The medium term public deficit target of 2 to 2-1/2 percent of
CDP cannot be exceeded if resources are to be channelled to private investment
and if inflation and interest rates are to be reduced as planned. The
shrinking of the fiscal deficit in 1990 and 1991 and the low level of interest
rates in real terms have created the conditions for fiscal and monetary
stability. The DDSR relief and additional attempts to reduce the fiscal
deficit will add to the prospects of interest rate and price stability.
63.         To evaluate the fiscal consequences of DDSR, projections of the
public sector accounts have been examined. In this exercise, the external
interest bill (which is a function of the evolution of public sector external
debt and the assumed interest rates on that debt and which is affected by
DDSR), becomes a determinant of changes in the fiscal accounts. In case A,
the projected 1991 overall public deficit is 3.1 percent of GDP, with external
interest payments amounting to 3.5 percent of GDP (Annex III). The deficit is
projected to decline to 2.7 percent of GDP by 1995, and average 2.9 percent of
ODP over the period 1992-1995. The interest bill would reach 2.8 percent of
GDP in 1995, averaging 3.1 percent of GDP over the period. In case C the
projected 1991 overall public deficit is 2.5 percent of GDP, with external
interest payments amounting to 2.9 percent of GDP. This projection has the
deficit declining to 2.1 percent of GDP by 1995, and averaging 2.3 percent of
GDP over the period 1992-1995. The interest bill would reach 2.5 percent of
GDP in 1995, averaging 2.7 percent of GDP over the period.
64.         Real interest rates on peso-denominated deposits have declined
significantly in real terms since mid-1990, but this reflects a variety of
interrelated factors, including an inflation surge in mid-1990, the magnitude
of which was in part unanticipated. During 1990, the reduction in Uruguay's
fiscal deficit and macroeconomic developments in Argentina and Brazil reduced
the pressure on domestic interest rates. In principle, by reducing the public
sector borrowing requirement in domestic financial markets and relieving the
uncertainty generated by the external debt servicing burden, the DDSR
operation would reduce domestic interest rates. The isolation of the effects
of DDSR on real interest rates from the effects of macroeconomic turbulance in
Uruguay's major trading and capital account partners is not easy. It is too
early to determine whether the DDSR operation per se has as yet had these real
interest rate reducing effects.

VI. PROPOS3D fAM  OP3RATON
Elialbilit, for Bank 8upport
65.         The stabilization and structural reform efforts pursued since 1985
have provided a framework for Bank adjustment support, which, it was
recognized from the outset, would need to be sustained over the medium term.
The Bank strategy has called for SALe and increased project assistance
designed to promote adjustment, achieve greater export-led growth and restore
Uruguay's creditworthiness. The firm adjustment measures taken in 1990, which
have been reaffirmed for 1991, together with the already initiated program of
structural reforms, demonstrate the commitment of the Uruguayan authorities to
reinitiate private sector led growth. The guidelines adopted by the Board
indicate that Bank support for debt and debt service reduction would be
contingent upon the strength of the country's medium-term economic program for
adjustment, the severity of the debt burden, the scope for voluntary market
based operations, the medium-term financing plan and the potential benefits
from Bank support, particularly for investment and growth. Special operations
devoted to DDSR are required to carry appropriate policy conditionality.21
The conditionality agreed with the Uruguayan authorities in support of the
proposed loan is given in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex I) and the
accompanying Policy Matrix (Annex 11).
66.          The medium-term economic program, presented in support of the
request for this loan, together with the external financing plan and the near-
term policy actions, is strong in its macro adjustment efforts, wide ranging
in its planned structural reforms, and offers a sound basis for extending a
loan in support of DDSR. It satisfies the test of appropriate conditionality
for free standing DDSR operations. The DDSR agreement in conjunction with the
pursuit of supporting adjustment policies (as shown above) will significantly
boost Uruguay's development prospects: the economy is projected to expand at
close to its potential rate of growth with internal and external balances and
with marked improvements in the shares of investment and exports to GDP. The
DDSR agreement makes such a pattern of growth possible without external
financing gaps emerging and with creditworthiness being strengthened. Uruguay
will continue its efforts at voluntary debt reduction through the adoption of
liberal debt-equity schemes and by possible further cash buyback operations.
Uruguay should be considered to have satisfied the general conditions of Bank
support for its DDSR operation.
Loan structure
67.         A quick disbursing loan in an amount of US$65 million is proposed
under the Bank's policies for supporting DDSR operations. This loan, provided
through a self-standing operation, consists of two elements: US$32 million
towards financing of the cash buyback and US$33 million towards the financing
of the interest collateral associated with the par bond. The "seJt asjde
11    See Chairman's Summing Up (Revised), "Operational Guidelines and
Procedures for Use of IBRD Resources to Support Debt and Debt Service
Reductions: Executive Board Meeting of May 31, 1989" (Sec M89-692/1),
in particular paragraphs 5 and 10.



- 39 -
portion of the proposed loan (US$32 million) is not being allocated from the
undisbursed amount under SAL II as those funds have been fully committed by
the Government for financing the restructuring of the Lnsolvent banks and are
shown as external financing items for the budget under the standby arrangement
with the Fund. The amount earmarked for the cash buyback (10 percent of the
lending program) will be allocated from Uruguay's three-year lending program--
FY92 to FY94--that amounts to US$320 million. A corresponding reduction will
be made in future loans. As the "set aside" amount is being allocated from
the lending program that begins in FY92, the three-year period used for
calculating eligible amounts spans FY92 to FY94. (In comparison, the FY91-93
lending program amounts to US$315 million.) During that period one adjustment
operation--a public sector reform loan in the amount of US$125 million--is
planned. The size of that loan would be accordingly reduced by US$32 million.
The portion of the loan dedicated to interest suuDort--US$33 million
(10.3 percent of the three-year lending program or less than the maximum,
15 percent, permissible under the guidelines)--would represent an increment to
the three-year lending program. Thus, Board approved guidelines for financing
DDSR operations are observed.
68.         The DDSR agreement was structured as a single transaction with one
fixed closing date, and has been so carried out. Uruguay has made payments
for the cash buyback and the purchase of the interest collateral. A one-
tranche disbursement is proposed on the grounds that phased Bank disbursements
would be incompatible with the needs of the market-based operation.
Furthermore, Uruguay's adjustment policies in 1990 and 1991 have been
demonstrably strong and the medium-term program is sound. Thus, Bank
guidelines for accelerated disbursements are observed. This recommendation is
in line with those in other DDSR operations approved by the Board. The loan
agreement includes provisions entitling the Bank to request pre-payment of the
loan in case the proceeds are used for purposes other than intended or when
the interest collateral shall have been released to the borrower or shall have
ceased to be a valid security interest. The closing date of the loan is
proposed to be December 31, 1991.
Conditions of Loan Effectiveness (Annexes M and V).
69.         The fiscal correction implemented in 1990 and the continuing
restraint on public expenditures in 1991 have created the conditions for the
realization of the medium-term economic program. The authorities have already
begun to implement structural reforms in the key areas of public employment,
greater efficiency in public investment, demonopolisation and privatization as
well as financial sector reforms and trade reforms. These policies are
important for the gains from DDSR to be translated into higher private
investment and, hence, to an efficient supply response from the economy.
70.         As noted, macroeconomic policies remain sound.  As announced,
changes in the monetary control regime with a view to remcring distortions and
strengthening the efficacy of Central Bank control and stricter supervision
over the banking system are being implemented. The system of reserve
requirements on BROU and BROU lending rate regime are also being implemented
as planned. The authorities will reopen debt-equity conversions on a
liberalized basis.



- 40 -
71.         The authorities are refining their medium-term public investment
program along the lines outlined earlier and will remain in active dialogue
with Bank staff. it is envisaged that proposals for the restructuring and/or
privatization of certain state enterprises will continue to be devaloped under
Bank supervision. In the area of trade, the authorities are expected to
adhere to reductions in tariffs in September 1991 as announced and to
implement fully the new decree on minimum export prices and reference prices.
A program for studies on regional integration will be established. These
measures will ensure that the wide ranging reform program is further pursued
in the first half of 1991, with particularly significant reform being
undertaken in the financial sector, thereby setting the stage for the eventual
implementation of the medium-term economic program.
72.           Specific conditions of effectiveness are (i) the maintenance of
a satisfactory macroeconomic framework; (ii) the completion of the DDSR
external financing package; (iii) the presentation of adequate documentation
concerning DDSR to the Bank; and (iv) the provision of audit reports relating
to SAL I and SAL II (Annex VI). The judgment as to whether the macroeconomic
framework remains satisfactory would be made on the basis of the traditional
criteria as well as continued implementation of reforms relating to BROU. The
DDSR external financing package will not be considered to be complete until
Uruguay has made a purchase from the Fund; in this manner, parallelism in
disbursements between the Bank and the Fund would be upheld.
73.         Disbursement.  Loan proceeds, upon effectiveness, would be made
available to the borrower against evidence of payments made in US dollars for
the cash buyback and the interest collateral (Annex VI).
74.         Burdensharinx.  As noted in Chapter IV, 60 percent of commercial
bank exposure will be maintained following DDSRI furthermore, new money of
US$89 million (an additional 5.5 percent of exposure) has been pro7ided.
Thus, commercial bank choices point to continued involvement by banks in
Uruguay. This factor is encouraging and helps achieve fair burdensharing.
The contribution of the various creditors to the proposed operation was
discussed in Chapter IV (see Table 11) and the financing of Uruguay's capital
needs over the medium term was discussed in Chapter III (Table 8). The
financing requirement of the DDSR operation indicates a well distributed
sharing of the burden:

met from multilateral sources, predominantly the Bank and the IDS. The
assumption of no further standby arrangements with the Fund beyond 1992 is a
cautious one. Within private financing, bond issues are expected to be

Japan as well as Eurobond issues some of which are expected to be purchased by
banks.
Benefits and Risks
77.         The benefits of the operation have been discussed in Chapter V.
The major risks to the operation are posed by (i) adverse external shocks and
(it) weaknesses in policy implementation. The former could consist of a
further sharp increase in the price of oil, increasee in international
interest rates, prolonged world recession or continued failure to address
international trade distortions in agricultural products under current GATT-
sponsored negotiations. Two factors mitigate external riskss Uruguay's
external reserve position and the savings made possible by the DDSR agreement,
in particular also the sizable reduction in the proportion of floating rate
debt effected by the DDSR agreement. Risks associated with policy
implementation could arise if Parliament failed to pass reform measures. The
Uruguayan tradition of consensus and the commitment to reform of the present
authorities make this risk manageable, as does the Government's record of
pursuing corrective policies with steadfastness.
78.         The risks to the Bank e3sociated with its support for the DDSR
operation are minimal. Uruguay he always honored its Bank debt servicing
obligations punctually. Debt to nie Bank is less than 10 percent of Uruguay's
total medium- and long-term public external debt and this ratio is projected
to increase only marginally to 1995.
VII. COUlNTRYFAISTANCE STRIMGY
79.         After intermittent project izndlng to Uruguay since 1950, the Bank
entered into a substantial program in 1985 to support the Government's
stabilization and structural reform efforts designed to obtain sustained
economic growth (Annex VII). The Bank strategy has supported policy reforms
through adjustment lending and the Bank has also progressively increased
investment assistance. The SAL-Il Board presentation indicated the
possibility of future support for DDSR in view of the consequences of external
debt service on savings and investment as well as indications of interest on
the part of Uruguay's commercial bank creditors.
80.         Past Lending. As of March 31, 1991, Bank lending to Uruguay
totalled US$976 million (net of cancellations), of which US$623 million had
been disbursed. Ten loans remain under execution with US$353 million
undisbursed. Apart from SAL II and the related technical assistance, project
loans include support for agricultural development, energy (electric and
hydrocarbon-based), transport and water supply. Overall, Government execution
has been satisfactory, notwithstanding some slippage in performance during
FY90 in the availability of counterpart finance and slow decision-making
during the transition to the newly elected Government.



- 43 -
81.         PerfovMane under  l-cH.  As reported to the Board earlier
(See M90-1618, December 21, 1990), the Government has made substantial
progrese towards accomplishing the targets of SAL-11. This loan consists of
two segments, the first of which is the macropolicy program, divided in two
tranches. The second segment consists of Government's program for
restructuring, reprivatizing or liquidating three insolvent banks, for which
thre separate loan proceeds were allocated without any target date for
completion.
82.         On the macropolicy segment, the Government has in 1990 and 1991
maintained the overall economic framework, particularly in respect of fiscal
stabilization. It has likewise advanced previous accomplishments in improving
public enterprise management, modernizing Uruguay'"s legal and judicial
framework governing commercial activities, and public sector reforms.  Major
new accomplishments have been registered in the financial sector with the
tightening of prudential regulations and Central Bank supervision norms.
Release of the second tranche, however, awaits the fulfillment of two
institutional conditionst the streamlining and computerization of Social
Security Bank revenue collections, and the separation of BROU's accounts for
banking and non-banking functions. There has been progress on these items,
but full compliance ie still awaited.
83.         on the banks-specific SAL component, the Government successfully
sold the Banco Comercial, one of the three insolvent banks, to a consortium of
foreign purchasers on October 3, 1990. This surpassed the condition
stipulated in the Loan Agreement and the proceeds of the loan corresponding to
this action--US$19.8 million--were disbursed on December 28, 1990. A
satisfactory action plan for restructuring Banco Caja Obrera, the second
insolvent institution is scheduled to be completed by end-June 1991. Its
possible sale is currently the subject of discussions between the Government
and interested parties. The restructuring plan of the Banco Pan de Azucar,
however, continues to lag.
84.         Future Lendin.  The Bank's future strategy is designed further to
promote adjustment, achieve greater export-led development and restore
Uruguay's creditworthiness. The attendant lending goals are to: (i) support
further reforms that would help to reinvigorate and sustain the momentum of
the adjustment program, and to strengthen the country's balance of payments;
and (ii) stimulate increased investment, additional export promotion and
overcome key bottlenecks. The Government's difficulties in maintaining the
adjustment effort in 1988-89 demonstrated the need to strengthen policies and
their execution so as to enable Uruguay to resume growth. It also confirmed
the earlier judgment that substantial Bank support, especially of an
adjustment character, would be needed for some time. In addition, the
Government's success in carrying out its firm adjustment program in 1990 and
thus far in 1991 and the adoption of a sound medium-term plan provide good
grounds for maintaining the Bank's approach.
85.         The main policy focus of present Bank operations is financial
sector reform. In particular, sAL/TAL II provides substantial assistance for



- 44 -
correcting deficienoies in Uruguay's financial liberalization program of the
late 1970s, and for restructuring the insolvent commercial bank to facilitate
their reprivatization. The Government program which the proposed loan would
support calls for broadening policy and Institutional reforms in this sector
so as to further reduce quasi-fiscal deficito resulting from losses within the
intervened banks and strengthen market forces in financial intermediation.
86.         The major new policy thrust and the focal point of proposed
FY92-94 lending concern public sector reforms. These reforms are designed to
expand the scope for private firms, participation and investment in the
economy and to realize public finance improvements. The Government is
developing measures, and has requested Bank assistance for, redefining the
public sector's role, reducing its size, privatizing parastatals, and curbing
monopoly rights. This will likely include changes in the state
telecommunications, gas, aviation and power companies, rationalizing the
Agriculture Ministry and streamlining Government information and regulatory
requirements. It would also pursue structural changes in the social security
system to promote its long-term financial viability.
87.         Other future Bank assistance is focussed on project lending
encompassing the principal productive sectors plus the associated
infrastructure and ancillary Government service activities. The recently
concluded telecommunication project and the current power and water supply
operations need future supplementation for ensuring adequate service and
reliability in these fields. The Bank will consider loans for these purposes
in FY92-94 depending, to a large extent, on progress in advancing present
institutional development efforts and privatization initiatives. Other
project preparations address equity issues in housing, upgrading fiscal
management in the Montevideo Municipality and rationalizing private health
care service. The Bank is also working with the Government on possible
deregulation of the petroleum sector and related measures to expand natural
gas consumption. In addition, Bank lending may be required in the future to
improving the banking system's mobilizing of savings and channeling of credit,
and rationalizing its role vis a vis the foreign banks comprising the regional
financial center. Further help is forecast for expanding non-traditional
agricultural activity and for a reduction in the Government's role in such
services as seed distribution and crop spraying. There appears to be good
scope for irrigation development too. Based on these, there is planned a
follow-up activity to the Agriculture Development Project now in full
implementation later in the program period.
88.         IPC Operations. With Uruguay's present strong emphases on a free
market economy and diminished state intervention, IFC is the most appropriate
instrument for Bank Group involvement in the development of manufacturing.
Its efforts are expected remain concentrated in the near term, because of the
small size of the Uruguayan market, on export activities related to the
production, industrialization and selling of agricultural commodities, forest
products and seafood, pending developments on posaxble greater economic
integration with Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.



- 45 -
89.         Collaboration with th  IM. Between mid-1987 and end-1989, the
Fund approved for Uruguay the procedures of enhanced surveillance under
Article IV. In December 1990, the Fund approved a standby arrangement in the
amount of SDR 94.8 million (about US$135 million) for fifteen months, with a
set-aside of 25 percent of the amount for DDSR. The Bank and the Fund have
worked closely, particularly in the context of SAL-11. The two institutions
have also worked together on other matters; in particular, the Fund has looked
to the Bank to assist Uruguay in devising and implementing reforms in the
social security system, and in providing advice on reprivatization of
insolvent banks and public enterpriaes. Collaboration on external debt
management has been close and has contributed to the development of the
proposed loan.
VIS. RECOOEEMDATION
90.         I am satisfied that the proposed Loan of US$65 million complies
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and is consistent with the approved
guidelines for Bank support of DDSR programs. I therefore recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan on the terms and conditions
proposed.

Letter of DeveloDmeut Poli¢v
Mr. Barber B. Conable
President
The World Bank
Washington, D. C. 20433
Dear Mr. Conables
1.        Since March 1990, Uruguay has steadfastly implemented an economic
program designed to attain macroeconomic stability and thereby to set a firm
basis for medium-term growth. The central objectives of this program are a
reduction of inflation, strengthening of the balance of payments and stability
in the public sector domestic and external debt ratios. By improving the flow
of saving available to the economy and by setting a stable macroeconomic
environment, our program aims to ensure not only that resources are made
available for capital formation but that the private sector will respond
appropriately to price incentives and carry out efficient investment. The
program is built upon structural reforms designed to strengthen competition
and remove impediments to saving and capital formation.
2.        Over the past decade, investment ha. remained below the depreciation
of capital stock. As a consequence, domestic production has stagnated, with
inevitable consequences for living standards. The flow of domestic savings
and net external financing necessary to sustain investment diminished as the
amounts required to service Uruguay's external debt rose sharply. Public
saving declined as the Government financed real increases in public
consumption, transfers and debt servicel external financing dried up in the
wake of the debt crisis, and Uruguay was compelled to make large net resource
transfers abroad.
Economic Performance in 1990
3.        Upon assuming office in March 1990, the present Government faced a
deficit in the combined public sector accounts that was dangerously high,
running at the equivalent of nearly 7 percent of GDP in the first quarter of
the year. Monetary policies were accommodating and, as a result, inflation
was escalating sharply. It was clear that if the deficit persisted, both the
domestic indebtedness of the public sector and the inflation rate would surge
to perilous levels. Therefore, the Government judged the reversal of this
deficit to be it. central and urgent policy priority. An emergency program of
temporary tax increases was enacted, and vigorous administrative measures were
taken to contain spending, including a significant compression of public
sector wages. Public sector wage policy provides for adjustments in line with
the programmed decline in inflation. These actions formed the basis for a
standby program agreed with the International Monetary Fund in November 1990.
As a corsequence of these measures, the overall deficit narrowed to the
equivalent of 2.9 percent of GDP for 1990. For a number of reasons, however,
fiscal correction was not immediately reflected in a reduction in inflation.



ANN)EX I
Page 2 of 11
- 48 -
The surge in mid-1990 in oil prices, the simultaneous severe appreciation of
the Argentine and Brazilian currencies, and the effects of persiqting
ir*lationary expectations all sustained inflationary pressure. Nevertheless,
the considerable improvement in public finances, in combination with the
reversal that is now occurring in the external factors noted, should permit a
considerable fall in inflation. Notwithstanding the contractionary effect of
the fiscal adjustment and external shocks, the economy is estimated to have
grown by about 1/2 percent in 1990. The external current account was in
surplus to the tune of 2-1/2 percent of GDP and net international reserves
rose by US$80 million. Uruguay remained fully current on its external debt
service payments to all creditors.
Medium-term Strategy
4.        over the medium term, the remainder of the Government's term in
office, the Government aims to put Uruguay firmly back on the path of recovery
from the economic crises it has faced in recent years, and to sustain that
position. This will necessitate in the first instance consolidating
macroeconomic stabilization so as to attain low rates of inflation and
viability in external payments. In order to obtain higher investment-led and
export-led growth, the present Administration is also committed to
consolidating and extending structural reforms so as to achievet (i) further
progress in eliminating the sources of recurrent macroeconomic imbalances;
(ii) substantial improvements in public sector finances; and (iii) the
incentivee for more efficient, dynamic, public and private sectors. Private
sector wages would be determined through free negotiations, with changes in
real wages reflecting developments in productivity. In support of these
objectives, the Government intends to reduce the share of resources preempted
by the public sector to permit a corresponding rise in the role of the private
sector and market mechanisms. The reduction in the size of the public sector
and continuing efforts to further trim external debt and attract foreign
investment would help finance a higher rate of capital formation. Overall
efficiency would be enhanced by our determination to open the economy further.
We will vigorously pursue economic and trade integration with Argentina,
Brazil and Paraguay so that Uruguay can fruitfully share in the benefits of
measures which exploit the inherent economies of scale and comparative
advantage.
Macroeconomic Obiectives
5.        The central objectives of our medium-term program (see Table) are to
attain a rate of growth of 2.5 to 3 percent per annum, while keeping inflation
down to a rate of 15 to 25 percent and limiting the external current account
deficit to the equivalent of 3/4 percent of GDP, i.e., an amount that can be
financed through foreign investment and other Inflows. Foreign exchange
reserves will be maintained at the equivalent of not less than 3-1/2 months of
imports of goods and non-factor services. These targets would not have been
attainable in the absence of the debt and debt service reduction agreement
concluded with commercial banks in early 1991, which made possible significant
savings to the economy and to the budget. We intend to channel these savings
to support recovery of private investment. Capital formation as a proportion
of GDP on the average is estimated to rise to nearly 17 percent over 1992-95

(from a projected 12.5 percent of GDP in 1990), with the public sector share
amounting to 3.5 percent of GDP. Emphasis would be placed on obtaining
efficiency improvements in public investment. These developments are
consistent with improved creditworthinesst the medium- and long-term debt to
GDP ratio is projected to average 29.2 percent in 1992-95 (in contrast to
36.1 percent in 1990), and the debt service ratio 23.0 percent in 1992-95 (in
contrast to 28.4 percent in 1990).

Public Finances
6.        Under our medium-term fiscal program, Uruguay's overall public
sector deficit is targeted to fall to the equivalent of 2.5 percent of GDP in
1991 and to be held in the range of 2 to 2.5 percent of GDP in succeeding
years. Attainment of these targets will require expenditure containment,
structural reforms, revenue measures to substitute for the temporary increases
that end in 1991, improvements in tax administration, and limitation of the
public investment program to 3.5 percent of GDP. If the deficit could be
reduced further to within the range that could be financed exclusively through
net external borrowing (just under 1 percent of GDP), the resulting
elimination of domestic financing would further alleviate inflationary
pressures and expand the scope for private investment.



ANNEX I
Page 4 of 11
- 50 -
7.        The medium-term budget presented to Parliament provides for a
reduction in the spending of the nonfinancial public sector in real terms
such that the ratio of expenditures to GDP will fall from 30 percent in 1990
to 27-1/2 percent on average in 1992-95. This compression in spending will be
achieved by permitting no growth in real terms in the public sector wage bill$
thus, real wage increases will be possible only to the extent reductions in
public employment and, hence, efficiency gains can be realized. In early
1991, the Government operated an early retirement scheme, which is estimated
to result in a cut of around 7 percent in the public sector payroll. This
will significantly reduce overmanning, though at the cost of up-front
redundancy payments. Employment restructuring in customs and the agricultural
ministry will be carried out and further employment reduction schemes will be
considered. The budget also provides for a fall in real terms of 10 percent in
spending on a broad category of goods and services over the medium-term and
limits the rise in public investment outlays, as noted, to the rate of growth
of the economy. Subsidies and transfers (apart from the social security
system) were squeezed in 1990, and will be further cut over the medium term
especially as the state withdraws from commercial activities. Moreover, the
Government is taking steps to reduce subsidies and transfers to the Housing
Bank (discussed below). Over time, the Government intends to reduce subsidies
to the productive sector, particularly the meatpacking and fisheries
enterprises.
8.        Revenues of the non-financial public sector, boosted by temporary
increases in certain taxes and trade tariffs reached a peak of 30 percent of
GDP in 1990, but will stabilize at 27-1/2 percent in the medium term. The
Government will shortly embark upon a tax reform intended to simplify the
system of direct taxes, promote equity and remove the bias in favor of debt
financing (as opposed to equity financing) by companies. Taxes on capital, on
corporate incomes and on assets of banks will be rationalized with a
broadening of the base and reduction in marginal rates. This action will
improve tax neutrality, improve resource allocation and strengthen incentives
for investment. The highly complicated system of land and income taxation
levied on the agricultural sector will be simplified with the purpose of
reducing distortions. We intend to broaden the incidence of the value added
tax principa,ly to include certain foods and utility charges as well as
certain agricultural and fishing activities. This may permit a modest
reduction in VAT from the current high rate of 22 percent. Reliance on
taxation of fuels will continue to be heavy, perhaps excessively so, even if
the beneficial effects on conservation are taken into account. The Government
will continue to be prompt in adjusting the tariffs of public utilities in
line with inflation and, indeed, intends to raise the surplus of public
enterprises gradually over the medium-term. The overall medium-term revenue
objective remains one of limiting the tax burden--consistent with the
attainment of low fiscal deficits--and minimizing distortions in the interests
of efficiency.
Monetary and Exchance Rate Policies
9.        Over the medium term, the overall public sector deficit will be
financed through a combination of medium- and long-term external credit, a
small net sale of dollar-denominated Treasury bills and bonds, and a strictly



ANNEX I
Page 5 of 11
- 51 -
limited amount of domestic bank credit. Central Bank quasi-fiscal losses will
decline steadily in line with the fall in inflation and privatization of loss-
making banks. Credit and monetary policy is intended to be consistent with
the overall thrust of counter-inflation and balance of payments policies.
Firm limits will be maintained on credit expansion by the banking system
through active monetary policies in the context of free interest rates. In
particular, the state-owned commercial bank, Banco Republica (BROU), will now
be subjected to market interest rates and deposits placed by the central
government and by the social security system will be fully sterilized through
reserve requirements. As the public sector gradually reduces its net
borrowing from the financial system, and as the program of structural reforms
for the financial system takes hold, remonetization will occur in line with
reintermediation in local currency. The Central Bank will continue to use
short-term bills and notes issued at market interest rates as its principal
instrument of short-term liquidity regulation. Since June 1990 the Central
Bank has auctioned these instruments.
10.       In the foreign exchange markets, the peso will continue to be
managed under a crawling peg regime. The rate of depreciation will be set so
as to offset the differential between the expected international rate of
inflation and the target domestic inflation. Thus, international
competitiveness will be safeguarded, but the Government is aware that this
objective can be combined with a low rate of inflation only if domestic costs,
particularly wage costs, are firmly controlled. In this context, it should be
noted that the impact on Uruguay's inflation and on stability in exchange rate
management of developments in the economies of Argentina and Brazil is
profound. The sharp appreciation of the austral and the cruzeiro generated
powerful inflationary pressures in 1990; conversely, the depreciation of these
currencies now under way will moderate inflation but is likely to cause
difficulty for our exporters. The Central Bank will use its short-term
instruments as well as its means of controlling BROU operations to ensure
orderly liquidity conditions in domestic financial markets. Ini.ervention in
the foreign exchange markets would serve the objectives of smoothing
fluctuations while implementing the crawling peg.
External Debt Management
11.       The Government considers the debt and debt service agreement
recently concluded with its commercial bank creditors to be an essential
precondition for achieving the targets under its medium-term economic program.
Uruguay has faithfully honored its debt service obligations. The real resource
transfer effected has markedly reduced capital formation, and hence long-term
growth. The reduced debt service burden will free resources amounting to as
much as 0.5 percent of GDP that potentially could be used for investment. The
enhanced prospects of macroeconomic stability, increased competition and
market orientation of reforms, and widened scope for private activity will
encourage the private sector to expand investment. The debt and debt service
reduction agreement will strengthen Uruguay's creditworthiness, and, together
with the improved investment climate stemming from structural reforms, lead to
greater inflows of foreign equity capital and permit a degree of renewed
access to international capital markets. Taking the interest savings and the
increase in foreign financing made possible by the debt and debt reduction



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 11
- 52 -
agreement into account, the economy is estimated to achieve additional annual
growth on the order of 3/4 of a percentage point over the medium term.
12.       The Government intends further to reduce its outstanding external
debt over the medium term. To this end, the Government may engage in further
buyback operations in the secondary market of its notes issued under the debt
and debt service reduction agreement, provided prices reflect an attractive
rate of return to resources used. Under the policies recently announced, the
Government will re-open a liberal, market orlented, debt-equity conversion
scheme and has invited proposals by end-April 1991 for new investment projects
totalling up to US$40 million. Similar schemes are envisaged ln future years.
Medium-Term Stgguctural Reforms
13.       Over the medlum term the Government intends to carry out a wide
ranging program of structural reforms intended to reduce the role of the state
in the economy. The scope for private sector activity will be broadened while
efficiency gains in public sector activities will be sought. The role of
market forces in the functioning of the financial system will be strengthened,
and the economy will be further opened to international trade.
Public Sector Reforms
14.       Public sector reforms are intended to increase private enterprise
participation in industrial and commercial activities, as well as to reduce
the pressure on budgetary resources. We seek to make Government leaner and
more efficient, thereby better able to meet the infrastructure and other
service needs of market oriented producers.
15.       The Government recognizes that the historic justificatlon for
establishing and maintaining the publlc enterprises has lost much of lts
validity, and needs to be updated. Much of their activity in production and
services needs to be opened to competition. The state's role also needs to be
cut back in regulatory functions. Therefore, the Government has submitted,
and intends to press for early passage of legislatlon to eliminate state
monopolies in the areas of insurance, alcohol production, natural gas
distribution, port and telecommunications services. It has also requested
authorizatlon to permlt reforms in the public enterprises' legal status,
clearing the way for their privatization, along with complementary measures
for restructuring and other steps to improve their lnternal efficlency.
Simultaneously, the Government has begun analyses of several public
enterprlses--aviation, natural gas and telecommunLcations--all of which should
be concluded by July 1991. These examine requlrements for improved management
as well as redefinition of thelr functlons, together with the optlons for far
ranging changes. Additional studies are to be undertaken shortly which will
address electricity and port servlces.
16.       These actions are complemented by the program for early retirement
of public servants designed to reduce the civil servlce. We recognlze,
however, the parallel needs to improve productivity, partly by improving
compensation levels for higher level staff, for whlch we will pursue remedlal
measures.



ANNEX I
Page 7 of 11
- 53 -
17.       We also recognize the need to break away from obsolete Government
operating rules and procedures and eliminate outmoded public sector
activities. A do-bureaucratization program is taking place which has already
succeeded in changing Government purchasing methods so as to permit greater
competition. We have begun an examination of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Livestock and Fisheries to determine which of its functions could be better
met by the private sector and how the Ministry can discharge its
responsibilities more efficiently. Other Central Government institutions will
subsequently be assessed in this manner. Also, a commission is examining ways
and means of reducing superfluous reporting requirements, simplifying trade
procedures, etc., to help reduce producers' operating costs. Similarly, we
intend to study the present system of regulating petroleum pricing and
marketing with a view to making changes that would ensure greater competition.
Social Securitv
18.       Although the November 1989 national referendum has necessitated
increased budget transfers to meet benefit requirements, the Government is
determined to work towards self-sustaining financial viability of the system.
The new taxes introduced in 1990 to cover the increased outlays will need to
be supplemented this year but additional remedial measures are required in
order to contain the burden of the system vL"-j-vlo the economy's capacity to
finance it. The Government recognizes that, in the main, financing needs have
been swollen by permissive policies allowing unduly early retirement and an
extensive array of benefits covering special situations. Therefore, the
Government intends to continue pressing the Congress for passage of remedial
legislation. Initially, this called for a reduction of benefits to
individuals retiring before 65 years of age, incentives to induce retirement
until later in life, and a change in the base salary on which pensions are
calculated. These and other measures will be further pursued so that the
system is steadily placed on a sounder footing. External technical assistance
from the World Bank will continue to be important for this demanding task.
Public Investment
19.       The Government intends to maintain a vigorous public sector capital
formation program in the context of its overall medium-term program. Although
the Government intends to hold public sector capital formation to 3.5 percent
of GDP, in keeping with the objective of limiting public borrowing and also in
keeping with the objective of increasing the private sector's scope for
capital formation, the program will be designed to provide essential
infrastructure support for private productive activity and improved social
services. We intend to maintain, thus, three governing principles. Public
investment will continue to be secondary to private investment in productive
and commercial activity and will be oriented to meeting their needs rather
than expanding the Government's role in the economy. Every effort will be
made to secure improvements in efficiency in public investment programs.
Finally, unjustifiable subsidies and comparable discriminatory benefits will
not be extended.
20.       By mid-1991, we will complete the design of the medium-term
investment program in line with these criteria. Its composition will also



ANNEX I
Page 8 of 11
- 54 -
depend to a considerable extent on the Government's success in obtainLng
further legislative authorization of public sector reforms, which rank high on
the parliamentary agenda for 1991. In addition, the investment program will
be kept attuned to progress in negotiating agreements with neighboring
countries on further regLonal integration, which has important implications
for upgrading and possibly expanding transportation and other infrastructure
facilities.
21.       Over half of Government investment will be concentrated on providing
producers and commerce with more adequate inputs (electricity, fuels and
water), ensuring more effective transport facilities, and expanding
telecommunications networks. The second major focus of public investment will
be on meeting pressing social needs, notably with more emphasis being placed
on improved rather than expanded education, health and housing systems.
22.       We aim to replace or bring to more modern standards the facilities
that have become obsolete or otherwise lagged in meeting the needs of the
economy. This goal is paramount in the enerav sector. Consequently, a
considerable portion of new investment will be allocated to rehabilitation and
modernization of the Gabriel Terra hydropower plant in conjunction with
increasing thermal power capacity. Later in the period, new commitments will
be undertaken for further power generation expansion, to cover demand through
the beginning of the next century. For this purpose, we intend to promote to
the greatest extent possible private sector participation and use of natural
gas to reduce dependence on oil. Similarly, we will complete the upgrading of
the La Teja oil refinery with the installation of advanced technology that
will provide assorted refined products more effectively.
23.       In transportation, emphasis will be placed on upgrading of a number
of primary, trunk, and access roads while stepping up maintenance
significantly, in line with criteria agreed upon under the IERD-assisted
Transport Sector project. Equivalent weight will be given to improving design
standards on the highways, particularly those in the tourism network.
Similarly, port investments will be concentrated on eliminating distortions
that impede efficient cargo shipments at Montevideo Port. However, although
costly physical improvements are needed there, the investment program requires
decisions on public sector reform legislation and on the initiation of
management improvements in the administration of the Port. Railroad
investments will be confined to rebuilding the railway company's rolling stock
in accordance with AFE's redimensioning and rationalized activity,
concentrated on the system's most profitable lines. Special weight will be
given to "Atlantic Corridor" international connections. PLUNA investments
will be limited to conserving the airline infrastructure at minimum economic
standards pending realization of its revised status.
24.       Help will be provided to facilitate private enterprise ownership and
direction of forestry development, which has already been shown to be
commercially attractive, but by market-oriented means, e.g., without reliance
on new subsidies. A new thrust in Government development policy will center
on exploring the potential for private investment in irrigated farming,
complementing recent improvements in laws facilitating the use of streams,
dams and reservoirs.
25.       Future allocations of Government finance for development in the
social sectors will be directed at better targeting of expenditures in these

- 55 -
fields and making these programs financially more sustainable. In housina,
the Government has introduced legislation, discussed below, designed to reform
the Housing Bank (BHU) so as to re-establish its financial integrity.  These
reforms will be accompanied by the reformulation of housing assistance
programs, which would also focus more sharply on the needs of lower income
families than at present. Comparable efforts will be made in the equcation and
health fields where current expenditures, while high, are in part wasteful to
the detriment of quality.
26.       Another innovation in public investment will be significantly
increased attention to environmental problems. The Government, besides
completing the Montevideo water pollution safeguards, will launch new
initiatives resulting from its recently completed national diagnostic study.
Development activity will address deforestation difficulties, industrial waste
discharges and Uruguay's role, given its strategic geographic location, in
monitoring global environmental problems.
The Financial System
27.       Financial reform is a fundamental aspect of the medium-term program.
The immediate and urgent task is to resuscitate several insolvent commercial.
banks that were taken over by the state in order to stem severe losses within
the overall system. The ultimate objectives of reform are to increase
mobilization of financial resources and to allocate them by priority to the
most profitable applications. More precisely, the reform aims to strengthen
monetary control exercised by the Central Bank, to tighten prudential
regulation and supervision, to subject the publicly-owned Bank of the Republic
(BROU) to closer prudential and policy control and to rules similar to those
applied to other commercial banks; and to improve the operating efficiency of
both BROU and the Mortgage Bank (B3U).
28.       The program will deepen financial sector reforms supported by the
Second Structural Adjustment Loan of the World Bank (SAL-11). Conditionality
developed under the World Bank's support for debt and debt service reduction
will also support the subsequent phase of this reform process. The medium-
term program is being developed with assistance from the Inter-American
Development Bank, which intends to provide a quick-disbursing loan as co-
financing for the SAL-II. An important aspect of the reform supported by the
SAL-11 was the restructuring of failed private banks taken over by BROU for
subsequent reprivatization. one of these banks was sold in 1990. The
Government hopes to sell the remaining two banks as soon as possible. This
will restore a significant measure of competltLon among private banks
operating in the domestic financial system.
29.       In the area of monetary reouLation, the Central Bank will
rationalize reserve requirements, reducing or eliminatLng them on longer-term
deposits, ending differentials among reserve requirements that favored dollar
over peso deposits, and extending reserve requirements to bank repurchase
operations. Under a decision taken in January, the Central Bank will permlt
banks to meet reserve ratios as an average over each month, rather than
requirLng them to comply with the ratios over all but three days of each
month. The BROU will be required to maintain reserves agaLnst lts public
sector deposits (see below). The Central Bank will also ratlonallze the
structure of reserve remuneratLon, linklng such remuneratlon by way of
establLshed formulae to rates on deposLts.



ANNEX I
Page 10 of 11
- 56 -
30.       in the area of bankina reoulation and surervision, the
Superintendency will perform more frequent monitoring and exercise closer
control over banking solvency. All banks, in particular the BROU, will be
required to evaluate their asset portfolios more realistically, to make
provisions aa appropriate, and carry out recapitalization as necessary. Over
the course of the year the banks--including the BROU and the BRU--wll3 be
required to conform with the Central Bank's new standard accounting system.
(The accounting system will be adapted as necessary to conform to the special
needs of the BROU and the SHU.)
32.       The Government plans to improve the efficiency of the BROU in
various ways, although at the same time it will end important aspects of its
privileged position in the financial system. First, as noted above, the
Central Bank will require the BROU to maintain non-remunerated reserve
requirements of 100 percent against central government and social security
deposits.  Reserves against the balances of other public sector entities will
conform with the reserve requirements imposed on private sector entities
generally. (These adjustments will be phased in gradually.) During 1991 the
BROU will be required to implement a program to classify its assets according
to risk and to calculate the requisite provisions. The program is to begin
with the 200 largest debtors, who account for about 80 percent of the loan
portfolio. Simultaneously, the Government will commission a study to
determine the capitalization level appropriate for BROU. Capitalization will
then be carried out to the extent necessary, and the BROU's balance sheet will
be published with all adjustments.
33.       The BROU will also revise its interest rate structure for assets,
with the objectives of relating its interest charges to Its marginal cost of
funds and of reducing the differences among the rates charged under different
credit programs (to within six percentage points per year for peso-denominated
credit and 1.5 percentage points per year for dollar-denominated credit).
Differentiation among rates will henceforth be based on criteria of liquidity,
security and yield rather than on criteria of subsidization for particular
sectors.
34.       Finally, the Government plans various measures both to improve the
immediate problems of BHU and to develop a more fundamental housing finance
reform program. The BHU has recently taken or soon will take several steps to
strengthen its cash flow, to improve asset recovery, and to limit the growth
of its costly deposit base. The Government plans various studies to determine
whether the BHU should be converted into a commercial bank, or should provide
mortgage finance in areas other than houslng. Once these studies are
concluded, a plan of action to restructure the BHU as deemed most appropriate
will be formulated and implemented.
Trade Reform
35.       The favorable impact of the additional resources made available by
the Debt and Debt Service Reduction Agreesent would not result in sustained
higher growth over the meldium term if greater efforts to expose the economy to
the forces of international competition were not made. In this context, the
prospects of the formation of a common trade area between Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay and Uruguay offer a challenging opportunity to our economy. Regional
integration will bring with it the rewards of the large markets of our
neighbors, which dwarf ours, and the economies of scale that will be permitted



ANNEX I
Page 11 of 11
to our producers. it will strengthen our position as a supplier of traded
services, of light manufactures and of agricultural products. In the
negotiations towards regional integration, we have pressed for far reaching
reduction in the common tariffs that will be applied, for short periods in
transitional arrangements, and have pointed out that the gains from
integration can be maximized only if stability in currency values is attained.
Continued instability in exchange rates will impede the process of
integration.
36.       Recognizing that efficient private investment is a precondition for
realizing the benefits of integration, we intend to reduce tariffs with effect
from September 1991. The highest tariff band--40 percent--will be reduced by
10 percentage points and reductions of 5 percentage points will be made in two
of the three intermediate bands to attain a 10 to 30 percent tariff structure.
Further reduction will be made in the context of progress under regional
integration negotiations. Our objective is to have a unified external tariff
at 15 percent over the medium term. We believe, furthermore, that the system
of minimum export prices and reference prices that was instituted as an anti-
dumping measure has had unduly protectionist effects.  A new regime will be
placed into effect in May 1991 tptat will use a more stringent and transparent
test of injury to local production and will, therefore, imply a significantly
reduced protectionist effect.
conclusion
37.       The medium-term economic program and the policies outlined in this
letter will, taking account of the benefits conferred by the debt and debt
service reduction agreement, improve Uruguay's growth prospects; and will
ensure that higher sustained growth can be achieved in a setting of low
inflation and equilibrium in external payments. The program outlined in all
its parts--macroeconomic management and profound structural reform efforts--
is strong and ambitious but necessary to lay the foundations for sound growth
over the medium term. As in the past, the Government will maintain a close
dialogue with the World Bank on all aspects of its development policies, and
the Bank will be consulted particularly on the design and implementation of
the policy measures outlined In this letter.

A Note on ExterAal Financing Projections and Impact
on Investment and Growth
1.        The model used for the macroeconomic consistency projection is a
standard forecasting model of the kind used since the late 1970's by analysts
of indebted developing nations' balance of payments and external debt.
Although considerably simpler, the model's approach is braodly similar to that
of the R1SM  and the RMS-X.  The basic purpose of the exercise is to determine
whether the forecast real growth rates are feasible given the balance-of-
payments and domestic financing constraints. The analysis is not intended as
a forecasting exercise, but rather as a consistency check. The objective is
to determine whether a given real GDP growth trajectory and associated capital
formation are consistent with the constraints likely to be imposed by the
balance of payments. The exercise should not be taken as a forecast that the
growth rates projected will actually occur, but rather as a determination that
the growth rates would be consistent vith the balance of payments constraints.
The first section of this note describes the projection technique. The second
section discusses the approach taken for the Uruguay analysis.
The Methodology of the Model
2.        The model's projections are built from base-year estimates of the
external, national-income, and public-sector accounts, in combination with
assumptions regarding world and domestic economic conditions. The relevant
world conditions are (i) growth rates of dollar prices of exports and Imports
of goods and non-factor services, considered in principal categories, and
(11) international interest rates applicable to the principal types of
external debt and assets. The domestic-economy assumptions are (i) the
projected real GDP growth rates and (i1) the investment-GDP ratio -- more
exactly, the depreciation rate of existing capital and the net incremental
capital-output ratio (ICOR), which are used to link the forecast investment
ratios with projected GDP growth. Additional assumptions are made regarding
particular lines of the balance of payments, such as net transfer payments,
direct foreign investment, and other non-debt capital flows. Assumptions are
also made regarding disbursement of and amortization of the principal debt
categories, and also regarding reserve accumulation. Projected disbursements
give rise to projected amortization flows, on the basis of assumed tenors and
grace periods. Further assumptions are made regarding the public-sector
accounts apart from those that depend directly on balance-of-payments accounts
(such as Interest on and net flows of public-sector external debt).
3.        The model's projection procedure works year by year.  The procedure
for each year may be saumarized as follows:
(i)    Dollar values of exports and imports of goods and non-factor
services are calculated from the previous year's dollar values by
applying the respective growth rates of prices and real volumes.
For particular lines of exports and imports, the real volume growth
rates may be related via elasticities to such variables as the



ANNEX IV
- 74 -                      Page 2 of 4
forecast real GDP growth rate, the forecast growth rate of the real
effective exchange rate, and so on.
(ii)    Capital import-volume growth rates are estimated on the basis of
assumed elasticities of demand with respect to real capital
formation. Real capital formation is estimated in turn on the
basis of the projected real GDP growth rates for the subsequent
year, the assumed net ICOR, and the assumed depreciation rate.
(iii)    Interest due is determined by applyuing the assumed interest rates
to the sum of (a) the preceding year's year-end debt stocks and
(ii) half the difference between the projected disbursement and
amortization flows during the year (which are thus assumed to be
effected on June 30 of the year).
(iv)    These projections of exports, imports, interst, and other external
accounts such as earnings on direct foreign investment and
unrequited transfers together give the projected current-account
surplus. The projections of direct foreign investment, loan
disbursements, amortization payments, end other non-debt capital
flows (including short-term financing) together give the
capital-account surplus. The disbursment and amortization flows
are used to project new year-end debt-stock values. Together, the
current- and capital-account projections sum to the
balance-of-payments projection.
(v)    Simultaneously, however, the model projects reserve accumulation in
each period. This is done, in general, by assuming that the
authorities will maintain a foreign-exchange reserve position equal
to some number of months of imports of goods and non-factor
services. In general, of course, the balance-of-payments and
reserve-accumulation projections vill not coincide. Reconciliation
is carried out as follows. If the reserve-accumulation projection
is less than the balance-of-payments projection, the difference is
added to the reserve-accumulation projection. If the reserve-
accumulation projection exceeds the balance-of-payments projection,
the difference is added to a "financing-gap" disbursement account
under the capital account..These disbursements are implicitly
assumed to be made with commercial-bank terms and interest rates.
Amortization flow. and year-end stocks of accumulated financing gap
are calculated on the basis of assumed tenors and grace periods.
4.        The model works from an independent projection of the domestic
account of the public sector borrowing requirement, with the principal account
lines projected as percentages of GDP. Overall public sector consumption and
capital formation are necessary for the national accounts forecast. Public
sector accounts related to the external accounts, such as external interest
flows, loan disbursements and amortization, and so on are calculated from the
balance of payments. Revenue flows deriving from external trade may be
estimated from the relevant forecast trade flows.
5.        The national accounts may be projected on the basis of projections
made thus far. The projected resource gap and investment are subtracted from
total GDP to give total consumption. Subtraction of public consumption from



ANNEX IV
- 75 ~                Page 3 of 4
this figure gives private consumption.  The implied behavior of real per
capita consumption over time (which requires a forecast of population growth)
Is one indicator of the feasibility of the forecast. Total national saving
roughly equals total investment less the current account deficit. Adding
public capital formation to the negative of the overall public sector
borrowing requirement gives a measure of total public sector saving on a
national saving basis.  Subtracting this value from total national saving
gives total private saving on a national saving basis.  Total domestic saving
roughly equals total investment less the resource gap deficit. Adding net
ext.rnal factor payments (including interest) to the public part of national
saving gives a measure of total public sector saving (on a domestic saving
basis). Subtracting this value from total domestic saving gives total private
saving on a domestic saving basis.
The UruMUv Proecttog_.
6.        Projections for Uruguay are constructed on the basis of estimated
external accounts, national accounts, and public sector accounts for 1989 and
1990. Projections for 1991 are calibrated to be broadly in line with the
forecasts for the IMP program; these include real GDP growth of 2 percent.
The net ICOR is assumed to be 4.5 and the depreciation rate is assumed to be
e percent of GDP. For the years following 1991, the real growth rate is set
for the base case without debt reduction such that medium- and long-term debt
reaches a benchmark value of approximately 32.5 percent of GDP by 1995, given
the PAC assumptions for export and import prices, interest rates applicable to
Uruguay's external debt, and various assumptions concerning financial capital
flows. A particularly important assumption regarding the capital flows is
that commercial banks will provide credit each year equal to the amortization
due on the schedule as it stood in 1990, before the debt reduction agreement
was concluded. This assumption is virtually equivalent to supposing that
Uruguay would receive a multi-year rescheduling agreement; the cash flow
Implications are virtually equivalent.
7.        The appropriate value for the base-case, no-debt-reduction real GDP
growth turns out to be 1.9 percent per year over the period 1992-1995. The
exercise then consists of determining the average annual growth rate that
would bring the ratio of term debt to 28 percent (roughly 85 percent of that
bencbmark debt-GDP ratio) by 1995 with the debt-reduction accord taking effect
in 1991. This high-case growth rate turns out to be 2.6 percent, or about
0.7 percentage points higher than the base-case, no-debt-reduction growth
rate.
8.        The analysis considers three alternative scenarios:  (i) a base-
case real growth scenario with no debt and debt service reduction (DDSR)
agreement; (ii) a high-case real growth scenario with no DDSR; and (iii) a
high-case real growth scenario with the DDSR and support from the multilateral
agencies. Besides the real GDP growth rate, the base asd high case scenarios
make different assumptions regarding manufacturing exports: in each case,
manufacturing exports are assumed to grow at a real annual rate equal to the
GDP growth rate plus
0.73 percent.
9.        The analysis also considers three additional scenarios, the same as
the previous three but with a shock to Uruguay's external environment. The



ANNEX IV

"sbock" compises (i) LIBOR higher by 0.9 percentage points than forecast in
the preceding scenarioo. (ii) the price of oil 10 percent higher beginning in
1992 than forecast in the preceding scenarios; and (Lit) the prices of beef,
and rice) all lower by 5 percentage points beginning in 1992 than forecast in
the preceding scenarios. By retreating to its base-case growth rate, Urugusy
could weather this shock with current-account deficits no worse than
0.5 percent of GDP given its DDSR.
