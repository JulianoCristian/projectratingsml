The closing date for the project, both in\n            respect of the International Development Association (IDA)\n            financing and Policy and Human Resources Development Grant\n            (PHRD) provided financing, is to be extended from November\n            30, 2012 until March 31, 2013. The project has assisted 42\n            agro-processing enterprises with improvement of\n            technological processes, marketing, sales, and financial\n            management and accounting. Some 68 new products were\n            introduced in client enterprises contributing to increase in\n            sales and profits. The reason for this extension is the\n            delays experienced during the procurement of equipment for\n            the Food Technology Training Center (FTTC). It was necessary\n            to re-tender equipment for the dairy, cereals and fruits and\n            vegetables processing lines for an approximate value of US$\n            0.5 million. The initial tender resulted in limited number\n            of offers far exceeding the available budget. The revised\n            composition of lots has resulted in successful selection of\n            a supplier for the dairy and cereals processing lines. Only\n            more time is required for contracting, delivery and\n            installation. This extension will equip the FTTC to train\n            university students and private companies from the\n            agriculture processing sector on modern technologies in food\n            processing and food safety. Non-extension of the project\n            closing date will leave the FTTC incomplete, after about US$\n            360,000 of project funds spent on civil works for the\n            reconstruction of the building."}, "docdt": "2012-11-19T00:00:00Z"}
