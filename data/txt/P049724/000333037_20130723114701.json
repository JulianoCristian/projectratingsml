Project for Kyrgyz Republic were as follows:\n            outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome\n            was moderate, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: a\n            high level of commitment is required both from the World\n            Bank team and from the client to implement complex projects\n            successfully. The project design allowed for trial and error\n            in piloting ideas and activities, which was another factor\n            in success of the project. A rigorous process of early\n            selection, with tough key questions (including whether\n            management of the company is fully committed, whether the\n            decision-making process is streamlined, and whether the\n            company is able to secure a loan or other funding, if\n            needed) allowed the project to pick future winners for\n            participation in the technical assistance packages. While\n            some companies were adversely affected by the political or\n            external economic events, the majority of companies\n            participating under the project achieved very good results.\n            The individual design of each service package, according to\n            the needs of the client, was crucial for the good results of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2013-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
