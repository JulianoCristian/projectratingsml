                         The project has achieved good results on the ground, in particular:

                         Market Development Component. This component provided technical assistance, advice and training to the agribusiness sector companies, impacts of which are expected to be long-
                         term, in support of improved competitiveness and sustainability of the sector. The Agribusiness Competitiveness Center (ABCC) supported 42 agri-businesses, which received
                         technical assistance and advice on a variety of aspects of running their companies, resulting in the development of 68 new products, improvements in the technological processes,

                         improvement in the financial management in the companies, entering of new markets, and increased sales and profits in the client companies. The ABCC's Market Development
                         Service (MDS) successfully facilitated trading and promotion of Kyrgyz agricultural products both domestically and abroad. Since its inception in 2006, the MDS facilitated 1,971 client
                         contacts on various matters, including 142 trade deals for almost 54,000 tons of agricultural products for a total value of US$17.5 million (of which 89% were sold to export markets).
                         The project also supported establishment of an Information and Marketing Service Platform, which provides information on buyers and sellers, new equipment and other relevant

                         issues to its users for a fee. The project also strengthened the country's cooperative movement, as more than 250 cooperatives were trained in various aspects of cooperative
                         management principles, business planning and financial management (and many cooperatives were subsequently able to meet the requirements of the participating lenders and
                         benefit from loans and/or grants under Component 2 of the project). Under the public sector capacity building program, awareness of the public sector - relevant ministries and
                         agencies - on a number of key issues faced by the private agribusiness sector was raised through an extensive training program, which included such subjects as illegal payments
                         faced by exporters, export requirements of the neighboring countries, etc. On the public investment side, the project supported setting up of the Food Technology Training Center
                         (FTTC) under the Kyrgyz State Technical University (KSTU). The establishment of the center is in the final stages and is expected to be opened by the President of the Kyrgyz
                         Republic on March 20, 2013. Awareness of the public sector - relevant ministries and agencies - on a number of key issues faced by the private agribusiness sector was raised
                         through an extensive training program, which included such subjects as illegal payments faced by exporters, export requirements of the neighboring countries, etc. The project
                         financed the complete reconstruction and remodeling of an old industrial type building into a training center with processing lines, laboratories, training classes and a conference
                         room. It is equipped with processing lines for meat, dairy and cereals, as well as with chemical and microbiology laboratories. The FTTC will be used to train both university students
                         and practitioners from the food processing industry.

                         Under the Access to Credit Component, the credit line was fully disbursed, and the commercial bank training activities were completed very cost-effectively and far exceeding the
                         original targets. A total of 108 sub-loans were financed under the project directly from the Credit Line (including 11 sub-loans to cooperatives) and from reflows, amounting to almost
                         US$6.76 million equivalent. The total investments mobilized into the agribusiness sector amount to about US$14.8 million equivalent, including the required co-financing by
                         Participating Financial Institutions and beneficiaries. Fifty-eight matching grants totaling US$0.8 million were granted to cooperatives towards co-financing of their investments. An
                         extensive training program for loan officers of commercial banks was also provided under the project, with 883 loan officers and branch managers trained in various subjects,
                         including Investment Lending and Leasing in Agriculture, Agricultural Structure Finance Products and Environmental Aspects of Lending. As a result of these trainings, the skills of
                         the staff of the participating commercial banks in appraisal of long-term agricultural projects were improved, and awareness raised on a number of innovative financial products to
                         help unlock the potential of the agricultural sector.

                         Under the Project Monitoring and Advisory Office Component, the Market Conditions Analysis Unit (MCAU) collected and provided the Ministry of Agriculture with market price
                         information and market analysis on key food items. These reports provided the necessary information for the Ministry in support of key policy decision-making. Some of the
                         information was provided to ABCC, to be posted regularly on the ABCC website for the use by the private sector.

                         Overall, it is estimated that, towards achievement of the project's development objective, the project's beneficiaries attained nominal increases in their sales between 15% and 169%,
                         and nominal increases in their profits between 25% and 91% (depending on the company).
