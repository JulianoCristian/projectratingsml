                         under the Enterprise Development Subcomponent and the Market Development Services trade facilitation deserve high praise. The Agribusiness Competitiveness Center (ABCC)

                         as well as provide technical assistance and advice to the agribusiness companies, which was highly demanded. The Market Development Service (MDS) continued to successfully
                         facilitate the trading and promotion of Kyrgyz agricultural products both domestically and abroad. Since its inception in 2006, the MDS has facilitated 1,971 client contacts on various
                         matters, including 142 trade deals for almost 54,000 tons of agricultural products for a total value of US$17.5 million (of which 89% were sold to export markets). Under the Access to
                         Credit Component, the credit line was fully disbursed, and the commercial bank training activities have been done very cost-effectively
                         and far exceeding the original targets. A total of 108 sub-loans have been financed under the project directly from the Credit Line (including 11 sub-loans to cooperatives) and from
                         the reflows in the total amount of almost US$6.76 million equivalent. Total investments mobilized into the agribusiness sector amount to about US$14.8 million equivalent, including
                         the required co-financing by Participating Financial Institutions and beneficiaries. 58 matching grants in the total amount of US$0.8 million have been granted to cooperatives towards
                         co-financing their investments in An extensive training program of loan officers of commercial banks has also been provided under the project, with almost 900 loan officers and
                         branch managers trained in various subjects. The Market Conditions Analysis Unit (MCAU) continued to collect and provide the Ministry of Agriculture with the current price
                         information and market analysis on key food items. These were posted regularly on the ABCC website.
