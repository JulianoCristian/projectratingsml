and the institutional\n            development impact high. A number of lessons drawn from the\n            project are conveyed as follows. The painful circumstances\n            prevailing in the country for fundamental social sector\n            reforms, were conducive to a difficult, costly, and slow\n            process. However, the option chosen in light of the frequent\n            political changes (which could have hampered reforms),\n            provided the opportunity, to the different leaders, to\n            advance the part of the reform closest to their political\n            platform. This was possible due to realistic assumptions,\n            and implementation arrangements, in line with the situation\n            in the country. Moreover, while stakeholder involvement, or\n            participatory processes were not an option at preparation,\n            the perceived power distance between the Government, and\n            individual citizens changed in time, so that by project\n            restructuring, participation was included in the pilot\n            component on rural education successfully. It is fair to\n            point out that despite frequent leadership changes, the\n            sustained political commitment was strong, enhanced by a\n            broad project design, suitable for each educational vision,\n            and strategy. However, the project missed the opportunity of\n            using convincingly, the power of good monitoring and\n            evaluation, though at final implementation, monitoring\n            criteria was used. While disputed arguments over taxation of\n            technical assistance (TA) contracts affected sub-components,\n            the focused work of TA in educational assessment, achieved\n            in a very limited time, was largely successful. Finally, the\n            sustained public information campaigns, though only\n            implemented at the Mid-Term Review, prominently supported\n            changes, directly reaching interested audiences, teachers\n            and parents."}, "docdt": "2002-08-22T00:00:00Z"}
