Institutional development is rated high, and\n            sustainability as likely.

Borrower\n            performance for both projects is rated satisfactory.\n            Experience with the projects confirms a number of OED\n            lessons from education projects: 1) When ministries\n            collaborate effectively and borrower staff are committed to\n            the reform process, projects that involve multiple\n            ministries may be effectively implemented. 2) Comprehensive,\n            complex and demanding reforms can work well if initiated\n            through respected national institutions, particularly if the\n            goals o f the reform are clearly explained to the public. 3)\n            Rigid procurement and disbursement requirements imposed on\n            smaller institutions (such as schools) or individuals who\n            receive grant funds may adversely impact their ability to\n            implement their projects. Special efforts may be required to\n            limit the paperwork and deadline obligations that grant\n            recipients face. 4) Small grants (e.g., for stipends or for\n            research) often have a portion contributed by the\n            government, since the Bank finances only a percentage.\n            Government delays in paying counterpart funds disrupt\n            important educational activities o f individuals. Broader\n            procurement planning may be needed to ascertain that a\n            shortfall or delay will not disrupt crucial activities."}, "docdt": "2003-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
