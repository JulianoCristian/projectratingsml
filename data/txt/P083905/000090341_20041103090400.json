The experience with\n            Fiscal and Institutional Adjustment Loans (FIAL II) shows a\n            high degree of collaboration between the Government and the\n            Bank, and this should remain a central characteristic of the\n            preparation of the upcoming loans of the program. Colombia\n            is a middle-income country with a fairly sophisticated\n            public sector and an explicit reform agenda, so this\n            collaboration has to also be complemented with flexibility\n            in terms of specific conditions while retaining a good\n            overall vision and monitoring of the objectives. Taking from\n            the recommendations described throughout this document, the\n            main areas where particular attention needs to be taken for\n            the preparation of the upcoming loans are the following:\n            Bring the tax administration and legal defense components up\n            to speed. Ensure that the government's medium-term\n            vision of tax reform is adequately captured. Ensure that\n            budgetary reform achieves a reduction in revenue earmarking.\n            Be sensitive to the political environment."}, "docdt": "2004-09-28T00:00:00Z"}
