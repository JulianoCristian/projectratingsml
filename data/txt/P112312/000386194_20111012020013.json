"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the First and Second\n            Programmatic Fiscal and Institutional Development Policy\n            Loan (DPL) Project for Guatemala were as follows outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory; risk to development outcome\n            was Substantial; Bank performance was satisfactory and\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned include: the implementation challenges\n            relating to the fiscal reform component of the first and\n            second DPLs illustrate the difficulties of achieving program\n            objectives that depend on legislative approval, particularly\n            in the area of tax reform. Repeated attempts to increase\n            revenue collections through raising tax rates and expanding\n            the tax base have failed in the past, and continue to face\n            stiff opposition. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge\n            the intrinsic difficulty of implementing redistributive tax\n            reform in a highly unequal society and within a short time\n            horizon. The experience of the first and second DPLs implies\n            that the Bank could be more modest in its expectations, and\n            could foster support for reform by identifying and helping\n            build constituencies with shared interests or who stand to\n            gain from reform. Another related lesson that can be drawn\n            from the DPLs is that although the planned fiscal reforms\n            would have generated significant revenues, measures to\n            improve tax administration can also generate large revenue\n            gains, and are politically more palatable. In Guatemala,\n            introducing tax controls and modernizing tax systems not\n            only increased efficiency but had a big pay-off through\n            reducing evasion. Another lesson that can be derived from\n            the operation relates to the policy measures on increasing\n            the transparency of public trust funds. The stated objective\n            was to increase transparency in the hope that eventually\n            this would create pressure to increase oversight and efficiency."}, "docdt": "2010-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
