                       stronger recovery. The Government's reform program aims to
                       strengthen social safety nets with a particular emphasis on scaling up
                       better-targeted social assistance programs.          The program also
                       encourages resource reallocation in the economy by reducing the cost

                 be constrained by several factors, including perceived political and
                 governance risks in the country. Credit risks associated with the

                        BELARUS DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

                    1. INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY CONTEXT

1.     A window of opportunity has opened to engage with the Belarusian authorities on
deepened structural reforms in the wake o f the international financial crisis and the
urgency to revisit the country's growth model. Against the backdrop o f a worsening external
environment, the phasing-out o f underpriced energy supplies, and the consequent strains on the
domestic economy, the authorities have launched a macroeconomic stabilization program and
deepened structural reform efforts. To deal with the balance o f payments pressures the
authorities requested an IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) (approved in January 2009), which
i s currently on track. They also sought bi-lateral financing support for this purpose, particularly
from Russia. It has become apparent that the model o f economic growth pursued by country over
the last years has run out o f steam. With the aim o f achieving a sustainable recovery, the
authorities sought World Bank assistance to support and accelerate the structural reform agenda
they initiated in 2008. The authorities envisage structural reforms to run in parallel to the
macroeconomic stabilization efforts, given their strong inter-linkages, particularly in the case of
Belarus.

2.      This document describes the Development Policy Loan @PL) for $200 million that
supports the Government's program aimed at addressing the social impact of the crisis,
while advancing the structural reforms to foster economic recovery. The reforms supported
by this operation aim at strengthening social assistance programs to function better as a cushion
to protect the poorest and those vulnerable to fall into poverty due to the economic slowdown
and future reforms. Moreover, this operation supports a significant structural reform agenda
aimed at unlocking new sources o f recovery and medium term growth, particularly through
further price liberalization, reducing the costs o f entry for new businesses, reducing regulatory
and administrative costs o f operation for the private sector, reducing subsidies, and eliminating
inefficient taxes. At the same time, it supports initial steps in setting the legal and institutional
basis for an adequate and transparent privatization process.

3.      This operation comes at a time when the Belarusian authorities revisit their
international political relations. The authorities undertook several positive steps toward the
improvement o f relations with the European Union (EU). The EU responded by lifting sanctions
imposed o n the travel o f Belarusian officials to the EU, reestablishing closer political contact,
and including Belarus in the EU Eastern Partnership initiative. The government has stated i t s
intention to pursue a multi-vector foreign economic policy aimed at developing closer ties with
Russia, revitalizing cooperation with the EU and the United States, and seeking new markets in
Latin America and Asia. Political change in Belarus is nonetheless likely to be very gradual.
Presidential elections are planned for early 20 11.

4.      Belarus i s a middle income country with a good track record o f service delivery, but
ranks low on governance and accountability indicators. The authorities have placed
significant emphasis on redistribution and performed well in human development indicators, as



                                                  1
measured by international ranking indices.' Moreover, Belarus has been a regional top performer
in terms o f energy efficiency improvements and containment o f the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
According to Business Enterprise Environment Survey (BEEPS)2, the level o f administrative
corruption i s lower compared to other CIS countries,, but higher to that in comparable middle
income economies in the world. Moreover, the country continues to rank at the bottom on voice,
participation, and accountability indicator^.^ (see also CAS progress report). This context
provides for significant implementation risks for this operation.

5.      Between 2003 and 2008 real GDP grew at an average o f 9 percent'per annum,
delivering one o f the highest poverty rate reductions in the region. A high level of
investments, subsidies in the form o f underpriced energy supplies, and the price boom
benefitting Belarus's major exports (e.g., o i l products and fertilizers), supported economic
growth. The gains were redistributed through socially-oriented public spending whilst tight
controls on employment were implemented. The government's extensive system o f social
transfers ensured that the benefits o f high growth were broadly redistributed. The social
insurance programs redistribute a large amount o f public resources (close to 11.5 percent of
GDP) and their coverage i s almost universal. The social assistance programs are also well-
endowed in terms o f budget resources at more than 1.5 percent o f GDP (this is discussed in detail

almost 47 percent in 1999 to just above 6 percent in 2008, while inequality remained relatively
stable and l o w by international standards (see Figure 1.1). Using the U S D 5 a day international
poverty line in purchasing power parity (PPP), Belarus's poverty rate f e l l from 29.5 percent in
2003 to 3.5 percent in 2007. The share o f the population below the USD 5 threshold in Belarus is
lower than in Russia and Ukraine, and closer to that in Estonia, Latvia and Bulgaria.

6.      Belarus has followed its own economic model, mainly driven by investments and
support to its State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Belarus i s a small open economy, with a trade
openness ratio comparable to other countries in the ECA region, but with slow progress in
structural reform (see Section 3) and a small private sector. The private sector i s roughly 30
percent of the e ~ o n o m yThe banking sector i s dominated by state banks, which hold 80 percent
                            .~
of the assets in the system. I t s growth model has relied heavily on high and sustained levels o f
public investment and significant support (through subsidies as well as directed and
"recommended" banking loans) to i t s flagship state owned enterprises (see Section 3). The
external environment, particularly higher prices for Belarusian exports and underpriced energy
supplies helped to maintain the level o f investments in the state owned sector (Sections 2C and
3). At the same time, the country has kept tight controls over product and factor markets,
introducing market principles only gradually. Several SOEs have shown to be highly productive
and well-managed over the last 8 years, although there are also many that rely heavily on
subsidies for their survival. There are forward and backward linkages within the enterprise sector
that were rebuilt (although not entirely) following the collapse o f the Soviet Union and the
fracture o f the production chains across i t s republics.

7.      I n recent years the government has been revisiting the sustainability o f its economic
growth model, an effort that has accelerated with the phasing out o f under-priced energy
supplies and the international economic crisis. Faced with significant external imbalances, the
phasing-out o f underpriced energy supplies, and higher international costs o f capital for the state
owned sector, the government sees liberalization as a way to expand the private sector and
support economic recovery. The government plans envisage a gradual but decisive move to
increase the role o f the private sector. It has started the process o f reducing subsidies and cross-
subsidies in the energy sector to face the challenge o f import prices converging to market prices
over the next years. It has intensified the dialogue on liberalization reforms with the World Bank,
the IMF, and the European Commission. This has happened in the context o f interaction and
consultations o f the government (particularly the Presidential Administration) with the business
community.

8.      The proposed DPL i s a high risk operation. The external environment remains
challenging and there i s the risk that the macroeconomic program supported by the IMF program
may not be fully implemented or the required adjustment may be greater than anticipated,
leading to additional financing needs. External bilateral financing may also be constrained by
different factors, including perceived political and governance risks. Given that all the measures
and reforms supported by this operation were achieved prior to its approval, the main risks are
related to the continued implementation and medium term commitment o f the authorities to
sustain them. Political decision-making remains centralized and policy reversal risks are high. A
backsliding in the reform agenda would increase the probability o f a more protracted contraction
in the near-term and reduce the potential for sustained economic recovery over the medium-term.


          ~   ~~




  According the EBRD, the share of private sector in Belarus's GDP i s 30 percent (that is, income generated by
enterprisedactivities that are privately owned or where private shareholders own more than 50 percent; these figures
include estimations o f informal activities). This may be overestimated, however, given the degree of the presence o f
the state in economic activities and the possibility to execute heavy controls at enterprises where i t does not have a
majority stake.

                                                           3
9.    Notwithstanding these risks, the current situation represents an important
opportunity to engage the authorities in a sustained dialogue on structural reforms. This
engagement would also help to partially mitigate those risks highlighted. The macroeconomic
program anchored under the IMF's SBA, the engagement o f the Bank in structural reform
through policy lending, the engagement o f the European Commission (EC), and the engagement
o f other IFIs and donors also help to mitigate the risks. Moreover, Belarus's external economic
conditions are likely to remain sufficiently tight to help mitigate against the risk o f a full-scale
reversal o f reforms in the near to medium term. But risks remain large even after mitigation. This
DPL was designed as a one-shot operation to establish a reform track record but with the view to
later evaluate the possibility o f a medium term engagement through policy lending. This
operation provided the Bank with the opportunity to engage in a medium term reform dialogue
with the authorities.

 2.   RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK

A.      RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

10.    Economic growth in Belarus has come to a halt mirroring the impact of the crisis in
the region. The global economic and financial crisis led to a sharp reduction in export demand
and prices that, combined with constrained access to external finance, resulted in external
financing difficulties. The government's macroeconomic policy response, supported by the IMF
SBA, has involved external adjustment via expenditure compression, induding fiscal discipline
and wage restraints, and expenditure switching, through a one o f f adjustment o f the exchange
rate (which remains the main nominal anchor).

    11.     Economic growth in Belarus averaged over 9 percent between 2003 and 2008 driven
    mainly by a favorable external environment and high investment rates. Supportive external
    factors were the re-alignment o f the exchange rate following the 1998 crisis, substantial terms of
    trade improvements for Belarus exports (in particular o i l products and chemicals), under-priced
    energy supplies, and strong growth in the country's main trading partners (in particular in
    Russia). Prices o f Belarus's major exports rose sharply in the commodity price boom from 2006
    to 2008. Prices of o i l products doubled, and prices o f fertilizers tripled over that period while
    energy imports from Russia were highly subsidized until 2007 when a gradual move toward
    market prices began. The centralized economic model used these terms-of-trade gains to deliver
    high levels of investment and credit to flagship SOEs, allowing them to maintain high levels of
    productivity and defend or even gain market share in major export markets. Investment demand,
    particularly fueling industry and construction, made an important contribution to growth, with an
    average growth rate o f over 20 percent (see Figure 2.1). At the same time, terms o f trade gains
    were also redistributed through higher wages, l o w levels o f unemployment and transfers to the
    population, thereby boosting domestic demand. Household consumption rose in real terms by 12
    percent per annum on average over the last 6 years. Strong economic growth and a more stable
    financial situation in the household and corporate sectors were also accompanied by increased
    financial intermediation, reflected in growing bank deposits and lending, including directed
    lending.

    12.     However, signs o f overheating and vulnerabilities emerged in 2007-2008. The
    exchange rate peg to the USD and selective price controls helped to contain inflation from over
    60 percent in 2001 to 7 percent in 2006. At the same time, high economic growth and small
    fiscal deficits contributed to public debt ratios at l o w double digits levels (13 percent o f GDP at
    the end o f 2008). However, with rapid wage and credit growth fuelling domestic consumption
    and increased directed lending from the state-owned banks to maintain high investment growth,
    the current account position shifted from a surplus o f 1.4 percent o f GDP in 2005 to a deficit o f
    8.4 percent o f GDP in 2008 (see Table 2.1). The rapidly widening domestic savings-investment
    gap was covered mostly through short-term borrowings, particularly bank borrowings and trade
    credits, weakening the external debt maturity structure (see Table 2.3). At the same time, FDI

range of 0.6 to 1.6 months o f imports from 2004 to 2008 (see Table 2.2).

13.      The crisis was transmitted to Belarus in the fall o f 2008 through lower export
revenues and reduced access to international borrowing. The impact o f the crisis was
heightened by external payment difficulties arising from two main transmission channels. First,
access to external finance, trade credit and foreign bank loans tightened whilst foreign reserves
cover was very limited. Second, there was a sharp negative shock to export demand and prices as
the crisis hit the economies o f major trading partners, in particular Russia, and contributed to
reversals o f recent gains in world prices o f major exports, such as fertilizers, o i l products, and
food products. The terms o f trade were also adversely impacted by the further increase in the
cost o f imported gas from Russia from January 2009. Lower export receipts and increased delays
in their payment led to reduced foreign exchange inflows. External demand and financing
difficulties prompted the authorities to request financing from Russia, the IMF and the World
Bank as well as to undertake measures to help close the financing gap in the balance o f payments
through a combination o f expenditure reduction and switching.

14.     Economic growth has stalled in 2009, as the real sector adjusted to the sharp
deterioration in the global environment, GDP growth, which stood at double-digits through
the third quarter o f 2008, slowed down to 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter o f 2008 (see Figure
2.2). In the first 9 months o f 2009 the economy experienced a 0.3 percent decline. Industrial
production was down 5.8 percent year on year in January-July 2009 and it i s increasingly going
to inventories (the ratio o f the stock o f inventories to monthly output reached 95 percent in the
first half o f 2009 compared with 50 percent in the first half o f 2008). The machine building
sector has been hit hard, posting a decline o f 39 percent over 7 months (see Figure 2.3). The
growth o f real wages followed the dynamics of the economy and fell from over 10 percent year
on year in 2008 to zero in mid-2009. In addition to lowering real wage growth, enterprises have
responded to the crisis by reducing working hours, with forced underemployment rising to about
100 thousands in mid-2009 as compared to 10-20 thousands last year. At the same time, official
registered unemployment has barely changed at 0.9 percent in July 2009. As household incomes
decelerated, so did retail sales: from a peak o f 24 percent in mid-2008 to zero in the second
quarter o f 2009.

15.     Exports fell faster than imports in 2009. During the first half o f 2009 the contraction
in merchandise exports (48 percent year on year) outstripped the decline in imports (34 percent
year on year), leading to a widening trade deficit. The relatively slow decline in imports partly
reflected the reluctance o f some SOEs to adequately adjust to substantially weaker demand
conditions in the international markets under the pressure to meet production targets whilst
keeping levels o f employment. As a result, some imported inputs were used to produce goods for
inventory and SOEs continued requesting (and receiving) financing fiom state-owned
commercial banks. In the first half o f 2009, the current account deficit reached USD3.7 billion,
implying a USD2.3 billion increase year on year.

B.       THE GOVERNMENT'S MACROECONOMIC RESPONSE AND THE IMF'S SBA

16.     The authorities recognized early the negative implications o f a worsening external
outlook and requested IMF support in the last quarter o f 2008. The IMF Board approved a
15-month USD 2.5 billion SBA on 12 January 2009, in support o f a macroeconomic program
built upon the following pillar^.^ First, the initial devaluation and re-pegging o f the Belarusian
ruble to a basket o f USD, EUR and RUR were intended to cope with the worsening terms o f
trade, deteriorating trade balance and limited access to market-based external financing. Second,
tighter monetary policy was aimed at achieving positive real interest rates on ruble deposits to
limit currency substitution and to cool domestic demand. Third, fiscal discipline with a zero
deficit target (with some adjusters for local government spending and project financing) and
wage restraint in the public sector were to reduce domestic demand f i o m the public sector.
These measures were aimed at closing the external financing gap through a combination o f
expenditure reduction and switching. Among other measures, the program also calls for
refraining from new "directed lending" programs financed with budget deposits, avoiding the
establishment in 2010 o f any quantitative targets on output and employment for enterprises (for
companies that do not benefit from government's financial support and in which the government
has a minority share), and bringing loan classification and provisioning in line with good
international practice. To complement these measures on the structural side, the government re-
invigorated efforts through the Liberalization Program and Modernization program (both

discussed in detail in Section 3), which contain measures supported by the present Development
Policy Loan.

17.     While exchange rate depreciation with a subsequent widening of the band and re-
pegging to a basket o f currencies helped to ease external imbalances, domestic demand
needs to be further contained. As the Belarusian ruble came under pressure in late 2008 with
foreign exchange inflows falling, the National Bank of the Republic o f Belarus (NBRB) opted to
support the peg to the USD, despite the real effective appreciation o f the ruble as many trade
partners' currencies had depreciated (see Figure 2.4). This policy resulted in international
reserves dropping by US$1 billion over two last months o f 2008 to USD 3.1 billion as o f 1
January 2009, despite the receipt o f the first U S D 1 billion tranche o f the loan from Russia. At
end-2008, reserves covered only around 1 month o f imports or 50 percent o f short-term debt. In
January 2009, the currency was devalued by 20 percent relative to the U Dollar (USD) and re-
                                                                              S
pegged to a basket o f currencies including the USD, Euro and the Russian ruble with equal
weights and with a band o f movement o f +/- 5 percent around parity. Subsequently, in June, the
band was widened to +/- 10 percent to allow more flexibility. Reserves stabilized through
January and subsequently rose through to end-March reaching US$4 billion but fell over the
second quarter to US$2.6 billion. The reserves increased again to over US$3 billion in July after
the disbursement o f the second tranche o f the SBA (see Figure 2.5).

18.     The authorities' fiscal response to the shock has been adequate. The slowdown in
external trade and the real sector has put pressure on fiscal revenues. Prior to the crisis, the
government was redistributing half o f GDP through central and local budgets and the social
protection fund (which includes social insurance programs such as pension and unemployment).
The government played an important role in investment, contributing around 10 percent o f GDP
to gross capital accumulation. With the economic contraction, fiscal revenues dropped from 5 1
percent o f GDP in 2008 to an expected 43.5 percent o f GDP in 2009 (See Tables 2.1 and 2.4).
The value added tax, the profit tax, and o i l related duties have been the most affected revenue
sources. To adjust to the projected revenue shortfall, the 2009 budget was revised to reduce
capital expenditures and the wage bill.

19.    Adjusting to reduced energy subsidies from Russia i s a major challenge. In 2003,
energy subsidies from Russia were estimated at 6.4 percent o f GDP for gas and o i l due to: (a)

                                                 8
natural gas prices below European export parity and (b) an export-duty waiver on crude imports
to Belarusian refineries (many with Russian ownership). The implicit subsidies in both sectors
become larger between 2006 and 2008 in the context o f energy prices at their peak in
international markets6 Given the current o i l prices (in 2009), under-pricing o f o i l has been
significantly reduced. Moreover, now there i s a revenue sharing scheme between Russia and
Belarus for the expod taxes of o i l products exported from Belarus. In 2009, Bank staff
estimations suggest that the gas subsidy would amount to roughly 3.6 percent o f GDP in the
context o f lower gas prices in the European market (compared to 2007-8) and higher import
prices paid by B e l a r u ~Import prices from Russia are expected to be gradually phased out. This
                             .~
will allow time to adjust, but requires significant gains in efficiency and tighter budget
constraints in the SOE sector. The government is already taking action through gradual tariff
increases in energy and reduced cross-subsidies (some o f the measures supported by this DPL).
The energy increases expected over the medium term are embedded in the macro projections.

20.     Monetary policy has been tightened and inflation has subsided, but State
"recommended" lending implemented by state owned banks continues to be high.
Consumer price inflation started to accelerate in late 2007 and has been in the mid-teens
throughout 2008. As demand conditions weakened, inflation started to decelerate by late 2008,
but the one-shot ruble depreciation o f 20 percent in January 2009 was partially passed through to
inflation. The NBRB responded by tightening monetary conditions in March, increasing the
refinancing rate (reference interest rate) which made real interest rates firmly positive. By mid-
2009, consumer inflation slowed down to 13 percent (see Figure 2.6). Directed lending was
about 5 percent of GDP in 2008 and i s expected to be around 4 percent o f GDP by end 2009.
Mainly due to this factor, the deceleration o f commercial banks lending to the economy i s
proceeding slowly and delaying the necessary adjustment. While state banks stopped the
practice o f directed lending using government deposits as required by the IMF SBA, they
continued the practice o f "recommended" lending to certain SOEs. These activities continued
strongly until August 2009, only subsiding gradually toward the end o f the third quarter. From
over 60 percent in early 2009, credit growth to the non government sector is down to 45 percent
year o n year by August 2009 (see Figure 2.7).

21.     The banking sector o f Belarus has managed to withstand the crisis but fragility
remains. Total banking system assets accounted for 57 percent o f GDP as o f July 1, 2009. Six
banks, four o f which are state-owned, dominate the market with a combined share o f 80 percent
o f the assets. During the first half o f 2009, bank assets increased by 15 percent, as the NBRB
more than doubled its lending to the system whilst the government's blanket guarantee on
household deposits helped to avoid a loss o f confidence. The banks' capital adequacy ratios
stood at 19 percent in mid 2009, highlighting their likely ability to absorb the shocks, including
ruble devaluation, rate increases, and increases in non-performing loans (NPLs). Small private
banks are particularly well capitalized, while the largest state-owned banks have been able to
rely for the past several years on new capital injections from the budget. Roll-over rates for
commercial banks' external debt are indeed low in 2009, but the commercial bank debt accounts
for only about 20 percent o f total external debt. Bank recapitalization costs in 2010 are expected
to reach 1.1 percent o f GDP (and below one percent o f GDP in 201 1).

22.     Non-performing loans may increase. The NPL provisions marginally increased to 3
percent o f gross loans in mid-2009. However, as reported in the 2009 FSAP report, the loan loss
provisioning regime discourages the early recognition and write-offs o f impaired assets, and
likely understates the true scale o f problem debts. Loan quality data i s further distorted by a high
share o f loans which are guaranteed by the government and classified as standard (Group 1)
loans.

23.    Following the first review o f the SBA in June 2009, IMF financial support was
augmented b US$1 billion to US$3.5 billion to reflect a worse than expected external
environment! The I M F Board also granted a waiver o f nonobservance o f end-March
performance criteria on net international reserves and supported the authorities' decision to
widen the exchange rate target band from 5 to 10 percent around parity. But the program also
incorporated important structural measures relating to privatization, particularly the setting of
benchmarks for establishing the privatization agency. The review also stressed the compliance
with the continuous performance criterion as regards to not approving any new directed lending
programs financed with government deposits.

24.     On October 21, 2009 the IMF Executive Board approved the second review under
the SBA. The government met end-September targets set by the program. This decision enables
the disbursement o f SDR 437.93 million (about USD 699.5 million), bringing total
disbursements under the program so far to about SDR 1.4 billion (about USD 2.23 billion). As
stated in the press release following the Board's approval, it i s critical for Belarus to secure
sufficient external financing from the international community. In this context, the authorities
would need to be ready to implement contingency measures should a financing gap emerge.

C.    MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS

25.    Belarus's external adjustment has remained incomplete and requires further
macroeconomic and structural measures. Real GDP i s expected to fall by one percent in 2009,
representing an 11 percentage point drop from the growth rate in 2008. Tight fiscal policy,

exchange rate re-alignment and positive real interest rates contributed to the narrowing o f the
external financing gap, while the initial low level o f debt made some additional financing
affordable to the country. However, high rates o f credit growth have supported domestic demand
and imports, thus delaying external adjustment, and state directed credit w i l l need to be curtailed.
The recovery commencing in 2010 i s likely to be driven by a gradual upswing o f export demand
from Russia and other major trading partners and a moderately improved price outlook for major
export commodities. With capital markets likely to remain risk averse and domestic investment
growing at a more moderate pace, growth in 2010-2013 i s projected to remain below the pre-
crisis level. Structural reforms w i l l be critical to the recovery and to the sustainability of the
economy moving forward.

26.     The IMF SBA provides an anchor to macroeconomic policies, but its adequate
implementation, in tandem with structural reforms, i s crucial for achieving an orderly
adjustment and economic recovery. Belarus remains vulnerable to a variety o f shocks.
Reducing uncertainty requires consistent signals from the authorities, and the willingness to
adjust further should the situation deteriorate beyond original forecasts. Residual risks to the
economic and policy outlook remain large even after mitigation measures, as emphasized below.
Structural reforms are also o f particular importance for economic recovery and sustainable
growth in the medium-term (see Section 3).

27.    The basic macroeconomicassumptions and parameters described below are broadly
consistent with those o f the IMF's SBA. Table 2.4 contains the latest macroeconomic
estimates for 2009-2013, and includes the IMF SBA over 2009-2010. Given the macroeconomic
anchor provided by the IMF's SBA and our own evaluation, the policy framework i s adequate
for the DPL to proceed. Given the continued global and domestic volatility, the assumptions
underlying these projections are likely to undergo further revisions and thus are associated with a

                                                     11
higher than usual degree o f uncertainty. The key factors underlying these projections are as
follows:

   (i) Progress on structural reforms and a gradual reduction of under-priced energy
       supplies. The medium term projections assume a gradual but steady increase of private
       sector activity in the economy through further liberalization and structural reforms (as
       discussed in Section 3). Continued reforms would gradually attract increased FDI.
       Energy prices, particularly in the gas sector, will gradually converge to market levels
        over the medium term.

   (ii) o reach external equilibrium in 2009, further adjustment of domestic demand i s
       T
        needed through the remainder o f the year, The key measure will be a containment of
        credit growth to the private sector, particularly directed lending b y the state-owned
        commercial banks. As a result, consumption and investment are expected to contract
        during the second half o f 2009 leading to a 1 percent annual GDP decline. The reduction
        o f imports resulting from this will help reduce the current account deficit and will enable
        an improved level o f coverage o f international reserves.

   (iii)
       Growth i s projected at 2 percent growth in 2010, followed by medium-term
       average growth of 6 percent starting in 2012. The estimated medium-term growth
        rate is at a lower level than the previous growth episode, owing to less favorable terms-
        of-trade, assumed protracted high level o f risk aversion in international capital markets,
        and lower availability o f capital, The growth composition i s expected to stabilize with
        moderate domestic demand growth. Medium term growth prospects o f Belarus will
        depend on its ability to improve productivity growth and create an enabling environment
        for business entry and competitiveness (see Section 3).

   (iv) The current account deficit i s expected to reach 9 percent of GDP in 2009 and then
        gradually adjust to below 7 percent of GDP in 2010. Financing will increasingly
        depend on FDI inflows as the envisioned structural reforms take hold. In the next few
        years, though, bilateral and private debt financing, as well as financial assistance o f
        multilateral creditors will play an important role in closing the balance o f payments gap
        (see Table 2.5).

   (v) The government i s expected to maintain a tight fiscal stance. The general
       government deficit is projected to be 1.7 percent o f GDP in 2009 (this reflects spending
       o f local budget surpluses accumulated in previous years and the implementation o f
       foreign-financed net lending investment operations approved prior to the crisis). A fiscal
       deficit in the range o f 1.5-2 percent o f GDP in 2010-13 i s assumed. In 2009, the
       authorities demonstrated commitment to fiscal discipline and adjusted the expenditure
       envelope to lower revenues. In the future, this i s expected to continue in line with a
       fiscal reform aimed at reducing the size o f the government. O n the revenue side, tax
       policy will be gradually reformed by eliminating remaining distortions and exemptions
       (to expand the tax base) and reducing marginal rates on direct taxes whist relying more
       on indirect taxation.




                                                12
    (vi) The NBRB will increasingly put inflation at the core of its policymaking. Consumer
         price inflation is expected to decline to single-digits in 2010, as the credit growth
         moderates and fiscal spending i s contained. While formal inflation targeting i s not likely
         to be introduced over the coming years, exchange rate policies are expected to allow for
         greater flexibility.

28.       Public debt levels are projected to remain sustainable. Given the l o w pre-crisis level
of public debt (at 13.7 percent of GDP in 2008), the projected economic downturn, fiscal deficit
and ruble depreciation, public debt would increase to above 27 percent o f GDP in our base case
scenario, before coming down to 20 percent by 2013. Figure 2.8 presents a number o f debt
sustainability stress tests. For example, should the exchange rate depreciate significantly more
than expected (30 percent beyond the base case), the debt level would temporarily rise to over 37
percent o f GDP. In case the state assumes 50 percent o f its current estimated contingent
liabilities, the debt ratio will reach 36 percent o f GDP. These explicit and implicit contingent
liabilities are originated by the state guarantee on household deposits in banks (currently at 9.8
percent o f GDP) and by directed lending through state owned banks (expected to be at 5.5
percent o f GDP by the end o f 2009).

 29.    The downside risks to the macro and external financing outlook for Belarus are
 large. Ongoing structural reforms, political considerations and the structural break that the crisis
 represents with the previous growth model add to the uncertainty o f the outlook. The most
 important, interrelated, risks to the outlook are:
         A greater and longer than expected deterioration in the external trade and financing
         environment. Particular risks are associated with the growth in Russia, international prices
         o f fertilizers and oil products, and availability o f credit from bilateral donors.
             An insufficient tightening of domestic credit that would place additional pressure on
             the exchange rate and delay the external adjustment. The pressures on the balance o f
             payments due to the lack o f substantial rebalancing could result in a larger. than expected
             financing gap and would put pressure on the exchange rate. Failure to defend the exchange
             rate at the band, in the absence o f additional flexibility, could undermine the credibility of
             the arrangement.
             Slippages in the IMF SBA implementationcould widen the balance o f payment gap in the
             presence o f a substantial current account deficit and limited financial assistance from other
             multilateral creditors.
             Inadequate progress on the structural reform agenda may negatively affect the timing
             and magnitude o f the recovery. Failure to address major vulnerabilities and advance
             structural reforms could undermine new sources o f growth and place Belarus at a
             competitive disadvantage.
             Vulnerabilities in the banking sector such as liquidity management and growth in
             NPLs. A 10-20 percent withdrawal o f deposits from the system would cause a significant
             deterioration o f liquidity ratios in a number o f banks, including the largest ones. Growth o f
             NPLs, especially in lending to the agriculture sector, would cause CARSo f the largest banks
             to go below the regulatory minimum. Furthermore, there i s the risk o f growth in NPLs due

                                                         14
       to potential, and needed, changes in loan classification, which would place additional fiscal
       pressures in dealing with the re-capitalization o f the largest state-owned banks. The
       potential for a further growth in NPL ratios i s high, due to the large share of
       "recommended" or directed loans.

        2007

30.     Belarus's progress in implementing structural reforms was slow since the middle of
the 1990s until 2007. The country is behind most transition economies in various structural
reform areas as measured by the EBRD Transition Indicators (see Figure 3.1). Some market
reforms were initiated early in the transition, roughly at the same pace as in other CIS countries
but efforts stalled in the second half o f the 1990s. Following the Russian crisis, some additional
but modest reforms were undertaken, including in lifting some price controls, making progress
toward cost-recovery in utility tariffs, and trade and foreign exchange systems. Yet Belarus
continued to lag behind peers in most reform categories, including those where it achieved more
progress at the beginning o f the transition.

3 1.   Notwithstanding slow reform, the favorable external environment, underpriced
energy supplies, and a tightly run economic model allowed the country to achieve high
growth rates. The Belarusian economy had a different growth path compared to the neighboring
former Soviet Union countries through the transition (see Figure 3.2). Following the collapse o f
the Soviet Union, Belarus was able to avoid the larger collapse in output o f neighboring Russia
and Ukraine and recovered faster. L i k e in .other former Soviet Union republics, production
chains in several industrial sectors were broken as the centrally planned production stages were
divided among countries. But Belarus was able to reconstruct internally a large portion o f i t s
value added chains, and rebounded quicker from the output fall in early 1990's. The input and
output inter-linkages within the state owned enterprise sector remain significant. The country


                                                  15
has also been able to achieve higher energy efficiency than several o f i t s neighbors (see Table
3.1). While it relies heavily on trade, it remains crippled by l o w levels o f F6I and technology
adoption.

32.     Belarus has followed its own economic model. The country's growth model relied on
large and sustained public investments and a general government budget that i s roughly half o f
the economy (public investments have averaged about 10 percent o f GDP per annum over the
last decade). The model has also relied on a number o f export-oriented and highly productive
flagship SOEs (although there are also many enterprises that are much less productive). The
authorities have made sure these flagship companies had available credit and resources to
finance investments and operations, mainly through the state owned banks, but also through
production subsidies from the government's budget. Moreover, the authorities emphasized
proper management in the state enterprise sector.

33.    Growth relies heavily on the manufacturing sector. The manufacturing sector
represents 35 percent o f the value added in the economy and, together with agriculture, i s b y far
the most heavily supported. This has been at the expense o f the service and related industries,
which in fact have declined in their share o f value added over the last years (see Figure 3.3). At


                                                           16
    the same time, industry has been the driver o f economic growth over the last decade (see Figure
    3.4). Productivity figures for the manufacturing sector in Belarus, which i s the core o f the
    economy, are certainly impressive. But the analysis on the levels and dynamics o f innovation,
    technology adoption, and structural transformation show that these are not the primary drivers of
    productivity. This may indicate high levels o f production efficiency and reduced waste and
     leakage^.^ Moreover, the external environment, particularly higher prices for Belarusian exports,
    has significantly helped to maintain the level o f investments in the state owned sector.

    34.     At the same time, the country has kept tight control over product and factor
    markets, introducing market principles only gradually. Labor markets have remained tightly
    controlled to allow economic gains to be broadly shared in a largely state run economy.
    Domestic production has been subject to significant price controls with the aim o f achieving a
    desired equilibrium between profitability of SOEs and price stability. Up to 2007, some modest
    progress in price liberalization was achieved in tandem with the gradual opening o f trade.

B.       PRESSURES ON THE ECONOMIC MODEL AND THE FIRST ROUND OF
         REFORMS 2007-08


35.    A number o f recent trends show that Belarus's growth model has been running out
of steam. While real wage growth has been outstripping productivity 'growth over the last
decade, the gap has been widening sharply since 2004 (see Figure 3.5). Total factor productivity
growth has been dropping steadily since 2004 (see Figure 3.6). Additionally, the decline in the
value added share o f the service industry (particularly business services) by more than 10 percent
over the last 8 years, may have serious implications for productivity over the medium term,
particularly if companies have to invest in servicing themselves at higher costs (see Figure 3.3
above). It may also affect decisions o f prospective foreign investors who often look at the
services available in each country before investing.

36.     There are a number o f structural weaknesses compromising the sustainability of
the country's economic growth model. These weaknesses became evident even prior to the
international financial crisis. Mounting competitive pressures in external markets as well as
increased prices for imported energy resources led the authorities to begin reevaluating the fiscal
and economic costs o f large-scale investments and government subsidies at the end o f 2007.
Some o f the key structural weaknesses are the following:

            High reliance on energy subsidies from Russia. Belarus enjoys relatively l o w gas
            import prices, even after a threefold increase during 2007-2009. Future expected price
            increases will put further adjustment pressures on the economy. The planned phase out o f
            these subsidies will require the hardening o f budget constraints in the SOE sector as well
            as the gradual reduction o f subsidies to households.
            High and increasing concentration o output, tax base, and exports. The 10 largest
                                                      f
            companies are responsible for almost 40 percent o f total industrial output, 25 percent o f
            consolidated budget revenues (and 1/3 o f profit tax revenues), and more than 50 percent
            o f total exports (over 75 percent o f exports to non-CIS countries). Dependence on only a

                                                                               18
       few exports renders an economy vulnerable to external shocks (including those caused by
       drastic movements in terms o f trade).
       High tax burden. The average tax burden was about 48 percent o f GDP in 2008, well
       above most countries in the region and other comparable countries in the world. The tax
       burden will need to come down gradually to allow more space for private initiative while
       carefully managing the fiscal implications.
       Underdevelopment o the services sector, especially business services. The declining
                           f
       share of services in value added (more than by 10 percentage points over the period
       2001-2008) is at odds with the experience o f other countries, showing that once an
       economy reaches the middle income level o f development, services become an
       increasingly important source o f GDP growth, productivity and new jobs.
       Large size o the government and system o state support. The high tax burden supports
                   f                              f
       a large tax benefits and subsidies system for enterprises which in many cases are less
       efficient than the flagship SOEs, undermining competition and productivity
       improvements. The volume o f government support granted o n an individual basis to
       companies was reduced from 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2006 to 1.7 percent o f GDP in 2008.
       However, these figures do not include the full cost o f broader schemes o f state support,
       for example via directed lending and tax expenditures. .
   0   Distortions in the banking system. Government influence continues to constrain
       Belarusian banks. The large share o f directed (or `recommended') lending and
       administrative controls reduce incentives for effective risk management and efficient
       resources reallocation across the economy.
   0   Competition Issues. The private sector accounts for 30 percent o f GDP and, despite
       recent improvements, the playing field between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
       private companies remains far from even, especially regarding access to resources. The
       lack o f a more vibrant private sector reduces the flexibility o f the economy and i t s
       capacity to adjust to external shocks.
   0   Low and slow technological adaptation and innovation, The share o f high-technology
       exports in total exports fell from a peak o f 6.3 percent in 2002 to 3.8 percent in 2007 and
       is much lower than in neighboring countries such as Poland and Lithuania. The WB
       Economy's Innovation Index also shows that Belarus i s lagging all its neighbors and that
       the gap has been growing over time. This points to lack o f incentives for domestic f i r m s
       to innovate and low FDI inflows, which often can facilitate technology transfer.

37.    Concerned with sustaining high growth rates, and further delivering on social
commitments, the government began to adjust economic policy with the objective of
attracting FDI and increasing private domestic investment. Among the measures taken were
a number o f asset sales involving strategic foreign investors (including the sale o f 50 percent o f
the major national gas pipeline company; the sale o f the second largest mobile phone company;
and the sale o f three small banks). Several steps were also undertaken in relation to business
deregulation, for example, the declarative principle for business registration was introduced,
which included a one stop shop business registry to reduce business registration processing


                                                 19
times, the minimum capital requirement for start-ups was reduced by half, and a one-stop-shop
was introduced for business liquidation.

38.     These reforms efforts intensified in 2008. The government abolished the "golden
share" rule that allowed the state veto power on any decision taken by enterprises in which the
government had shares (regardless o f the portion o f shares the state held). The government also
set a target to improve markedly the ranking o f Belarus in the World Bank's Doing Business
(DB) Indicators and adopted an action plan to do so, including in the following areas: (i)
improvement in the general conditions for doing business (regulations); (ii)      simplification of
administrative procedures; (iii)  improvements in regulations for importers/exporters; and (iv)
financial market development. As a result, Belarus moved from 115 (overall ranking among
countries in the DB survey) in 2008 to 82 in 2009 and to 58 in 2010 and was among the top 10
reformers in the last two years. However, it i s unclear to what extent the reforms undertaken up
to 2008 alleviated the real binding constraints on private sector development, particularly
considering some o f the structural weaknesses described earlier.

C.    THE GOVERNMENT'S SHORT TERM AND MEDIUM TERM PROGRAMS:
      RECALIBRATING THE ECONOMIC GROWTH MODEL TO ACHIEVE
      SUSTAINABILITY

39.     I n 2009, partly in response to the global economic crisis, the government launched a
one year action plan called the "Liberalization Program". The Liberalization Program
contains 52 priority measures aimed at facilitating entry o f new businesses, reducing operation
costs for the private sector, further price liberalization, and improving the legal framework for
land and property. The dialogue under this Development Policy Loan i s strongly linked to
selected key areas o f reform under this program. Section 4B explains specific policy reforms
supported by the D P L and their economic significance, in the context o f the broader reform
agenda. The measures under the "Liberalization Program" represent a significant and decisive
step.

40.     The government has also drafted a medium term strategy called "The
Modernization of the Economy Program". This program, which i s the basis for the
government's five year plans under preparation, builds on the liberalization program. It
represents a marked departure from earlier programs in the weight i t places on the development
o f market institutions and further economic liberalization. The program envisages the co-
existence o f a modernized and more innovation-driven state enterprise sector, with aq expanded
private sector led by foreign investment and private small and medium enterprises in the services
sector.

41.     The key strategic goals and priorities of the draft medium term "modernization o f
the economy" program include the following: (i)         further liberalization, including in price
formation; (ii)reduction in the size o f the government, including subsidies to the economy (and
cross-subsidization); (iii)acceleration o f the privatization process; (iv) improvements in the
investment climate; (v) development o f capital markets; (vi) reforms to encourage innovation;
(vii) expansion in the SME sector; (viii) laying the grounds for the formation o f larger national
integrated industrial structures with local and international private participation; (ix)

                                               20
streamlining administrative controls, including a switch from administrative controls and
supervision over SOEs towards traditional financial audit; (x) labor market liberalization; (xi)
financial market liberalization, including attraction o f additional foreign capital to the banking
sector, opening the insurance market for foreign investors, and abolishing the existing
restrictions for private insurers'; (xii) foreign trade liberalization, including a gradual decline in
the average import tariffs and intensification o f the WTO negotiation process; (xiii) divestiture of
social assets, including housing, and non-profitable assets currently on the balance sheets of
industrial enterprises to municipalities; (xiv) pension reform; and (xvi) reforms in the power
sector.

42.     The likely slow global recovery coupled with Belarus's declining productivity
growth and diminishing returns on capital investments, underscores the need to consider
bold steps. The resources available to the authorities to cushion the impact o f economic
adjustment on the less competitive parts o f the economy will be limited by risk aversion in
capital markets, higher prices for energy supplies, and only gradual improvements in export
demand. The reform agenda i s large and complex and the authorities are likely to proceed
gradually in removing the multiple distortions in the economy.

43.     The 1arge.reform agenda and its complexities are recognized by the medium term
draft "Modernization of the Economy Program". Some o f them are also highlighted in the
Letter o f Development Policy attached to this document. The crystallization o f this program into
more detailed action plans (such as the 5 year plans) will further lay out some o f the specific
actions that need t o be taken. The pace o f the necessary reforms and their precise sequencing will
be determined by the authorities; the Bank is providing policy advice through i t s AAA program.

44.     I n essence, the challenge facing Belarus i s to move from extensive, public investment
driven growth to productivity growth led by the private sector. This will require increased
private investment, in particular FDI, to support the transfer o f new technologies, and facilitate
the process o f structural transformation. Belarus will need to conquer new markets with new,
more sophisticated products, building on the assets accumulated during the last decade.

45.     T o address this challenge and secure a sustainable growth path, some o f key reform
priorities include the following:
      0   The liberalization program initiated will need t o be deepened to encourage a positive
          supply response. The absence o f deeper reforms in the regulatory and control framework
          under which businesses operate can act as a deterrent to entry and hence to the
          development o f a competitive economy.
      0   All remaining obstacles for business entry need to be lifted.
          Price controls should be comprehensively lifted in tandem with introducing regulation for
          public monopolies and strengthening competition policy. Market based price signals will
          allow non-traditional sectors o f the economy to expand.
          The gradual reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade needs to continue.
          Fostering competition will be essential to encourage innovation.


                                                   21
       State support willneed to become better targeted and public investments more efficient.
       Fiscal reform should be aimed at reducing gradually and in a fiscally prudent way the
       size o f the government. The government would need to reduce the tax burden and
       improve the tax structure to make it more resilient to economic shocks. Moreover, it will
       need to improve the efficiency o f public investments and service provision whilst
       gradually lifting direct subsidies to the enterprise sector.
       Privatization, SOEs restructuring, and hardening budget constraints in the SOE sector are
       central to the expansion o f the private sector and to productivity gains in the economy.
       Harder budget constraints together with increased competition will generate the needed
       pressures to achieve increased efficiency and productivity in the context o f phasing out
       subsidies. As regards to privatization the main priority i s to establish a transparent and
       well-structured process that assures a fair value to the State assets and attracts quality
       buyers that contribute to the modernization o f the economy. Experience suggests that this
       will take time.

46.     The timing and sequencing o f reforms will be important to maximize their benefits
and mitigate potential costs. The potential benefits o f reform are large, but the authorities are
rightly concerned about mitigating the costs o f adjustment as much as possible, bearing in mind
the negative liberalization experiences in other transition economies in the 1990s. This may
dictate a more gradual approach to prevent disorganization effects leading to an underutilization
of existing and economically valuable capacity. This will also require significant investments in
training and re-training as well as other labor market reforms. In parallel, automatic stabilizers to
absorb changes in unemployment will need to be strengthened.


              4.   BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A.    LINKS TO THE CAS

47.     The original FY08-11 CAS did not envision Development Policy Lending, but rather
selective assistance based on analytic and advisory work and limited investment lending. The
economic and political developments over the past two years, however, have provided the
opportunity to enter into a much deeper engagement and reform dialogue with the Belarusian
authorities, as explained in detail in the CAS Progress Report accompanying this operation. The
CAS Progress Report also expands the lending envelope to include development policy lending
together with investment lending to support the country's recovery and sustained growth agenda
based on needed structural reforms.

B.    COLLABORATION W I T H THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

48.     The D P L program has been designed in close collaboration and coordination with other
development partners. Throughout the process of preparation o f the operation, from the
analytical work that underpins the policy measures through implementation in some areas, the
Bank's team worked closely with the IFC and collaborated with a number o f other development
partners, including the IMF, EBRD, and UNDP. This operation is the natural structural

                                                 22
complement to the macroeconomic framework supported by the IMF's SBA initiated in January
2009. The Bank maintains close coordination with the IMF on issues related to the
macroeconomic framework and the structural reform agenda, which i s also partly tackled under
the IMF's SBA program (particularly in the financial sector).

49.     The collaboration with other development partners i s intensifying. The E C and
EBRD are revisiting their assistance frameworks for Belarus, The EC may consider a Macro-
Financial Assistance (MFA) for Belarus. EBRD i s proposing an expansion o f the scope and size
of their lending. There are on-going discussions on a potential mandate for EIB subject to
progress under Eastern Partnership Agreement. The reform dialogue as well as the size and
sectoral orientation o f Bank assistance is and will be closely coordinated with all these partners.

C.    ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

50.     This operation draws heavily on the Bank's AAA work. Given the strong structural
nature of the reforms supported by this operation, a significant portion o f the analytical
underpinnings came from on-going work on the Belarus Economic Policy Notes (forthcoming)
and the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). The former focuses on the sources o f
recovery and sustained growth, particularly evaluating the drivers o f productivity growth,
product diversification, export sophistication, and labor market issues. The latter focused on an
analysis o f the Belarusian economic growth model. Tax policy and other fiscal measures were
informed by a policy dialogue undertaken through the regular macro monitoring program of
Bank. The social assistance and safety net measures were informed by a new technical assistance
in the social protection area, begun in the middle o f FY08. Several o f the business climate
measures are anchored on the Advisory Services provided by the IFC. The Bank has also
provided advice to the government on intergovernmental fiscal relations and capital budgeting,
through a recent set o f Fiscal Policy Notes, as well as on debt management and energy efficiency
issues. The FSAP (2008) provided valuable insights on the key vulnerabilities in the financial
sector (The IMF program has largely relied on this WB-IMF work to approach needed reforms in
the sector under the SBA). The recently finalized Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) has provided the necessary assurance on fiduciary risks for
development policy lending. Moving forward, and with the aim o f informing the fiscal and
structural challenges, a programmatic public expenditure review will be initiated.

                             5.   THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A.    OVERALL OPERATION DESCRIPTION

51.     This i s the first DPL for Belarus. I t was designed to respond to the window of
opportunity that has opened up as a result of the deepening reform effort and commitment
of the authorities. Up until now, the Bank has had a very selective engagement with Belarus,
based largely on analytic work and limited investment lending. This operation represents an
important opportunity to support the government's ongoing reform efforts and engage the
authorities in a dialogue on the key medium-term development and reform challenges. The
reform agenda is large and the government has confirmed i t s goal to tackle it gradually but


                                                 23
decisively. The substantial steps supported by this initial operation are a signal o f this
commitment.

Consultations with stakeholders

 52.      The authorities, including the Presidential administration, have undertaken
 consultations with relevant stakeholders on its reform programs and specific measures
 supported by this operation. O n the measures related to business entry and competitiveness
 (Pillar 2), the authorities held discussions with businesses associations, organizing workshops
 and seminars with open participation. The authorities also organized consultation forums in
 different regions o f the country. Other stakeholders such as trade unions, NGOs, and other
 international financial organizations also interacted with the government around the preparation
 o f the measures supported by this operation. In January 2009, the presidential administration
 established a "public consultative council" to discuss the liberalization program and other
 planned economic reforms. All stakeholders above-mentioned were invited to participate. `This
 council has also organized discussions around regulation and laws supported by this operation.
 O n the reforms o f the social assistance system, the government consulted with several
,stakeholders, including think thanks, NGOs, trade unions, and international organizations (Pillar
 1 o f this operation).

53.     A number of comments provided by stakeholders to the proposed reforms were
incorporated by the authorities following consultations. Draft regulations and laws were
actively revised in tandem with the consultations during the spring and summer o f 2009. These
consultations are a relatively new phenomenon in the Belarusian policy making environment.
This new dynamic reflects the recognition o f the authorities that a broader process o f
consultation i s important to achieve sustainability and credibility in attracting investment.
Several comments received by the government were discussed and incorporated into the
approved regulations and legislation. In addition, several government agencies and the
presidential administration have put forth open internet forums to gather comments on the
liberalization and economic reform started and planned. These are encouraging initial efforts that
will need to be extended, but are consistent with a gradual opening o f the climate for public
participation.

54.        The D P L i s designed in line with good practice principles in conditionality (see Box 5.1).

1   Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

    The proposed DPL program i s based on the government's own liberalization and modernization programs. The
    Bank's support to the government's program i s summarized in an agreed policy matrix (see Annex 1). This
    matrix outlines the key reform measures and outcome goals. This operation has a narrow set o f conditionality,
    establishing 4 policy prior actions deemed critical to the program and 11 benchmarks. Three o f the prior actions
    deal with price and regulatory reforms, areas that the government recognizes as essential for further structural
    reforms. The prior action on scaling up targeted social assistance and improving the targeting power o f the
    overall system o f social assistance i s seen by the government as an effective way to protect vulnerable groups
    during the economic downturn and as vehicle for the government's own social cohesion agenda as reforms move
    forward. Close coordination with the IMF i s helping improve the alignment o f support to the Belarusian reform
    program. Other development partners, including the EC, the EBRD and the EIB are currently reviewing their
    engagement strategies. The DPL has also been coordinated with them and Bank staff have attended several
    coordination meetings in Brussels on support to Belarus.

                                                          24
Operation design

55.     Given Belarus's limited reform track record the Bank has opted for a single DPL
operation as opposed to a programmatic series. Once a successful track-record had been
established, the possibility o f a follow-on programmatic engagement can be considered. Yet this
operation has provided the Bank with the opportunity to engage in a medium term reform
dialogue with the authorities.

56.     The proposed DPL recognizes cross-sectoral linkages between structural and fiscal
reforms. Core reform areas are organized under two thematic pillars: (i)addressing the impact
of the economic slowdown and reforms by strengthening the system o f social assistance; and (ii)
laying the foundations for economic recovery and sustainable growth by enabling private sector
entry and competitiveness through liberalization and financial discipline. In addition, the
maintenance o f an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework is a pre-condition for this
operation as for all DPLs.

57.     The reform agenda confronting Belarus i s large and complex. Measures supported
by this operation have been prioritized to address key structural rigidities. The measures in
the first pillar support efforts t o strengthen and broaden existing social safety net programs to
deal with the impact o f the crisis and post-crisis restructuring and reform o n vulnerable groups.
The measures under the second pillar aim at increasing incentives for private sector development
and strengthening financial discipline.

58.   Table 5.1 lays out key prior actiondtriggers o f this operation. Table 5.2 lays out
other key benchmarks related to hardening o f budget constraints for the SOE sector,.
eliminating the most inefficient taxes, creating the institutionalbasis for privatization, and
improving the business environment. All these measures and their relevance are described in
more detail in section 5B.

Table 5.1. Prior Actions under DPL Operation
Pillar 1. Addressing the Impact o f the Economic Slowdown and Reforms by Strengthening the System
o f Social Assistance
0    Targeted social assistance i s improved and scaled up, by adopting a Presidential decree that contains, inter alia,
     the following:
     o Increasing income eligibility threshold for targeted social assistance program above the subsistence
          minimum, namely up to 150% o f subsistence minimum for lump sum assistance;
     o Extending the duration o f the targeted social assistance from 3 months to 6 months;
     o Calculating the total income o f the applicant based on the total income during the year preceding the
          application;
     o Integrating Housing and Utility allowance program in the targeted social assistance program;
     o Incorporating asset test in the eligibility criteria for targeted social assistance.



0     A Presidential Decree reforming the role of control and supervision activities i s enacted which, inter-alia,
      reduces the burden o f state inspections on business and improves the penalty system.
0     Prices liberalization i s advanced
0     Restrictions on retail trade margins for domestic and imported goods are removed, except for a limited and

Hardening Budget Constraints, Tax efficiency, Setting the Basis for Privatization, and Business
Environment (under Pillar 2 of the operation)
   A reduction o f the turnover tax rate in 2009 i s implemented and its elimination i s planned for 20 10
   Cost recovery i s advanced with electricity and heating tariffs o f household consumers increasing by 19 percent
   and 15 percent, respectively in 2009
   The cross-subsidization o f energy tariffs within the industrial sector was also streamlined in 2009 (compared
   to 2008), including by reducing the list o f industrial consumers eligible for preferential energy tariffs.
   Fiscal transparency i s improved by establishing an integrated and public report on the itemized fiscal costs of
   state support to the economy
   The New Budget Code establishes a limit on the stock of local government debt (including guarantees) of 30
   percent o f local government revenues (net of transfers)
   A new Law on "privatization" was drafted
   A Law that significantly simplifies administrative procedures for businesses was enacted

pillars. Each sub-section details the institutional and policy reforms this operation supports.
Annex 1 o f the Program Document contains the economic and social policy reform matrix with
details o f the actions agreed under the DPL, the outcome/monitoring indicators, and an indicative
future reform agenda as elaborated in the government's Letter o f Development Policy.

B.     POLICY AREAS

Strengthening the Targeting o Social Assistance
                             f

60.     The government already spends a substantial amount o f resources on social
assistance and social insurance programs (see Box 5.1). Targeting was marginally i,mproved
within the social assistance system in 2008 by starting a gradual move away from spending on
privileges but remained weak overall.

Box 5.1: Social Assistance and Social Protection in Belarus
The Belarusian safety net system consists of (1) child benefits; (2) housing and utilities allowance; (3) Chernobyl
benefits; (4) categorical privileges; and (5) targeted social assistance. Most programs in Belarus use categorical
targeting criteria, with weakly targeted outcomes toward those in need. Starting in 2008 there was a shift away from
programs based on privileges towards targeted social assistance and child benefits. Targeted social assistance (TSA)
and programs for children channel most o f the resources to the poor population: 44 percent o f the funds o f these
programs accrue to households from the poorest 20 percent of the population. In the case o f child-related programs,
the success in identifying the (pre-transfer) poor stems from the high correlation between the presence o f children in
the households and poverty status. The budget spends above 1.5 percent o f GDP on social assistance (without
counting under pricing o f services and other quasi fiscal costs).
The system o f social protection (social insurance) runs separate to the safety net or social assistance system, and
includes pensions, unemployment, accident and sickness, and disability benefits. The budget spends above 11
percent of GDP on social insurance programs.
Almost 80 percent o f the population benefits from some form o f social protection or social assistance. Yet, the
overall targeting accuracy o f social assistance spending so far has been modest, with only 15 percent o f the spending
reaching the poorest 20 percent o f the population in 2008.


                                                         26
61.     Improved targeting o f social assistance i s key not only to mitigate the impact of the
crisis, but also the social costs of structural reforms going forward. One o f the main concerns
o f the authorities i s maintaining social stability, and the chosen gradual reform path and the
strong redistribution effects o f its economic model .have reflected this priority. Weak growth
prospects for Belarus in 2009 and 2010 will likely increase demand on social safety nets as the
number o f poor i s expected to grow (see Section 6A). At the same time, lower fiscal revenues
due to lower growth makes it difficult to accommodate these increased demands. One way to
create fiscal space to deal with the poverty implications o f the crisis i s to target a larger share of
the already sizable expenditure envelope o f social assistance programs to the poorest.

62.    A prior action for this operation i s the enactment of a Presidential Decree that
strengthens the targeting power of the system whilst scaling up funding for targeted social
assistance for the most vulnerable. This Decree has been prepared taking into consideration the
advice o f World Bank staff.

63.     There are two effects taking place simultaneously under the reform supported by
this operation: (i) reallocation effect, by moving the untargeted program o f housing subsidies
                    a
to the Targeted Social Assistance program (TSA); and (ii) doubling o f the TSA budget in 2010.
                                                              a
Thus, the overall result is a larger and better targeted social assistance system.

64.    There are several significant components to the overall reform supported by this
operation.

        0   First, access will be expanded under the TSA by raising the eligibility threshold. This
            automatically will increase the number o f vulnerable beneficiaries. According to the
            most recent data, in the first 8 months o f 2009 the state targeted social assistance was
            granted to nearly 136,000 individuals; and it i s expected this number will reach
            around 200,000 by the end o f 2009. In line with government calculations, the Bank
            estimates that the benefit will reach more than 300,000 individuals in 2010, with a
            much improved targeting to the most vulnerable. Most o f the required expansion o f
            funding in 2010 comes from savings in other parts o f the budget (e.g., investments
            and subsidies) and through small savings in the housing and utility allowance. In the
            hture, savings will increasingly be generated through the streamlining o f untargeted
            social assistance programs.
        0   Second, the duration o f the TSA will be expanded from 3 to 6 months. This measure
            means that verification o f income will be done every six months, as opposed to 3
            months as it i s currently done, reducing costs for authorities and beneficiaries alike.
            Nonetheless, if beneficiaries remain eligible for the program they will continue to
            receive benefits.
        0   Third, the process o f verification o f income will be done using the last 12 months o f
            income as opposed the shorter period o f verified income currently requested.
        0   Fourth, the housing and utility allowance will be moved to the TSA to improve its
            ability to reach the poor. Due to i t s untargeted nature, this program reaches
            households in all deciles o f income. Although currently this i s a small program, i t s


                                                   27
              improvement (by placing it in the TSA) i s quite important as this untargeted
              allowance may increase rapidly with hrther hikes in energy prices.
          0   Fifth, eligibility will be improved by incorporating assets test criteria for the TSA.

65.     The reforms supported under the DPL are the first important stage o f a broader
reform. The aim i s to move gradually away from subsidies and categorical allowances (although
not in all cases) and privileges toward the TSA program that reaches the poor and vulnerable
more effectively. Going forward improved administrative mechanisms and a gradual reduction of
categorical programs through attrition are envisaged with the objective o f not creating resistance
o f any particular group currently receiving those benefits. The Bank will continue to provide T A
in this area with the aim o f improving efficiency, targeting, administration, and monitoring of
results and performance in social assistance.

Enabling Economic Recovery through Private Sector Entry and Competitiveness through
Liberalization and Finan cia1 Discipline

66.     Belarus faces a large and challenging reform agenda to enable sustained growth
through FDI, private sector expansion, and competitiveness o f the economy. The D P L
supports further reforms to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers needed to facilitate
entry and growth o f new businesses. At the same time, it supports the competitiveness o f the
overall economy by reducing the high costs to f i r m s generated by the state inspection system and
distortive taxes (which also deter entry). The removal o f price controls will provide signals to
private investors and help develop the incipient service sector, which is critical for employment
expansion and economic diversification. At the same time, the SOE sector will require hardened
budget constraints to improve efficiency and foster competitiveness. The gradual removal o f
energy cross-subsidies from industry to households will complement the tightening o f financial
discipline as energy import prices rise to market levels.

67.       There are three prior actions under this pillar:

          Reform o f the role o f control and supervision activities. Among other benefits, this
          reform will reduce the burden and costs o f state inspections to business, improve the
          penalty system, and encourage businesses entry. The Presidential Decree enacted in this
          area contains important progressive provisions, such as: (i) use o f check-lists for
                                                                               the
          inspections (as recommended by best international practice); (ii) introduction o f risk-
                                                                                 the
          management principles for the application o f planned inspections by differentiating
                                              i i setting a l i s t o f the responsibilities and rights o f
          businesses by the degree o f risk; ( i )
          inspecting bodies and inspected businesses; and (iv) a reduction in the share o f
          enterprises undergoing planned inspections in a given year to no more than 15 percent (as
          compared to 22 percent in 2008).
      0   Price reform, by eliminating the requirements for price registration (including for
          new goods) and removing administrative limits on increases in prices. As part o f this
          reform the government cancelled the general requirement to register prices for new
          goods, removed the limits on monthly price changes for individual entrepreneurs, and
          reduced the number o f price-regulated goods. By not extending the annual Council o f

                                                    28
       Ministers resolution on price regulation, the government also removed the limits on
       monthly price changes for all other business (Le., those not classified as individual
       entrepreneurs). This measure significantly reduced the application o f price regulations,
       particularly for producers.
       Removal of retail trade margins for domestic and imported goods '(excluding a
       limited list of socially important goods and goods subject to monopoly power). This
       measure implies that the government would no longer be able to establish retail trade
       mark-ups (or margins). The only exception would be a limited (closed) l i s t of socially
       sensitive goods and those primarily consumed by low-income households. The list also
       includes additional categories such as specific prescription drugs and goods subject to
       monopoly power. Current economic conditions will mute any potential inflation
       pressures resulting from the removal o f trade margins and price controls. These measures
       would greatly strengthen the incentives for entry and expand the service sectors.

68.   Over the medium term, regulatory and price reforms will need to deepen further. The
government, including as highlighted in the Letter o f Development Policy is committed to do so.

69.   The DPL supports significant additional reforms under the second pillar, to
complement and enhance the impact of the selected prior actions:

   a. Taxation. Two key measures to reduce the tax burden and distortions in the economy
      have been achieved: (i) rate o f the highly distortive turnover tax rate was decreased
                                  the
      from 2 percent to 1 percent in 2009, and the draft o f the Special Part o f Tax Code (as well
      as the draft 2010 budget) envisages its full elimination in 2010; and (ii) local sales tax
                                                                                  the
      rate was unified at 5 percent for imported and domestic goods and the complete abolition
      o f this tax i s planned from 2010. In the presence o f a solid Value Added Tax (VAT), the
      sales tax increased the tax burden, tax compliance costs and represented an inefficient
      duplication.
   b. Energy Subsidies-Hardening Budget Constraints. A gradual reduction o f the cross-
       subsidization o f tariffs from industrial consumers to households in the utilities sector was
       initiated. In January 2009, electricity and heat tariffs o f household consumers were
       increased by 19 percent and 15 percent, respectively. This measure is already leading to
       higher cost recovery ratios (79 percent for electricity and 49 percent for district heating,
       in the first half o f 2009). The cross-subsidization o f energy tariffs within the industrial
       sector was also streamlined in 2009 (compared to 2008): the list o f industrial consumers
       eligible for preferential energy tariffs was reduced (by 14 percent) as was the overall
       volume o f this state support. This will level the playing field and improve energy
       efficiency.
   c. Fiscal Transparency in State Support to SOEs. The Ministry o f Finance has placed on
      their website an integrated report on the itemized fiscal costs o f state support to the
      economy (and will continue to do so on a quarterly basis). This i s an important step
      toward increased transparency and a basis for the needed comprehensive reform o f the
      state support system.
    d. Fiscal Discipline. The N e w Budget Code establishes a limit on the stock o f local
       government debt (including guarantees) o f 30 percent o f local government revenues (net

                                                29
         o f transfers). During the first eight months of 2009 the Ministry o f Finance together with
         all local governments worked out and approved Action Plans to bring local governments'
         debt into compliance. By imposing fiscal discipline on local governments, the
         government will be winding down an important channel for softening enterprise and local
         government budget constraints.
      e. Foundations for the Privatization Process, A new Law on "privatization" was drafted.
         The Draft Law, inter alia: (i)   establishes clear procedures for privatization o f state-owned
         enterprises in an open, competitive and transparent manner; and (ii)      clarifies the division
         o f power between different state bodies involved in the privatization process. Moreover, a
         new L a w on "objects in exclusive state property" was drafted. This Draft Law reduces
         the l i s t o f enterprises not subject to privatization. Future DPLs could support the
         enactment and implementation o f this important agenda.
      f. Regulatory Issues. The government drafted and discussed with the business community
         a Decree on the licensing regime to (i)            reduce the number o f economic areas and
                                                                   i)
         activities subject to licensing requirements; and ( i simplify licensing procedures and
         requirements. These reforms will shorten the time required for acquisition and renewal
         o f licenses as well as the l i s t o f documents required. In the medium-term the government
          plans to fbrther reduce the l i s t o f activities subject to licensing requirements. These
          measures will be central in encouraging business entry. The government had intensive
          discussions with the business community on this issue and improvements expected on the
          draft decree are primarily the result o f these consultations.
      g. Administrative Procedures. A Law that significantly simplifies administrative
         procedures for businesses was enacted.
      h. Price and product market reforms. In addition to the prior actions highlighted earlier
          on price reforms, the Council o f Ministers approved a resolution reducing the l i s t of
          "socially-important goods and services subject to administrative controls". The
          government plans to further work on the gradual reduction o f the list.

A.      POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT ANALYSIS

Impact o the Economic Downturn on Poverty
        f

70.      The recent financial crisis and the global economic slowdown are likely to increase
poverty in the country. The transmission channels o f the crisis to the population are multiple.
They include adverse labor market outcomes (mainly underemployment) and reductions in real
wages as a result o f the contraction. The crisis in Belarus has been milder than in other former
Soviet Union countries in terms o f output decline and unemployment growth. Nonetheless, there
are income and underemployment effects that account for the largest share o f the poverty effect.
In 2009, and consistent with Bank staff macroeconomic parameters (as presented in Section 2), it
i s estimated that at least 94 thousand people will fall into poverty. This i s equivalent to a 0.8
percentage point increase in the poverty rate due to the economic downturn (see Figure 6.1).

71.     Some particular groups are more vulnerable to the crisis. These are predominantly
rural households, unemployed, households with 3 or more members, and families with children
(particularly those with more than 2 children) (see Figure 6.2). Pensioners, families without
children and urban households show lower risks o f poverty as a result o f the crisis.

Poverty and Social Impact Assessment o this Operation
                                      f

72.    Price and regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the incentives for private
sector development, in the medium term, would be expected to have an indirect positive
impact on poverty reduction, through creating an environment for sustainable growth. The

                                                                          31
measures to lift price controls and retail trade margins could lead to higher prices for consumers
but socially sensitive food items and goods primarily consumed by low-income households will
remain protected, thus mitigating the impact o f the price increase for the poor. In addition, low
aggregate demand will reduce inflation pressures resulting from price liberalization. The
government i s committed to contain domestic demand (through fiscal and monetary policies) to
allow the external adjustment and assure price stability. In the medium to long term, improved
competition and entry in the private sector would lead to lower prices, including in the retail
sector.

73.      There will be only a moderate distributional impact as a consequence of the gradual
increase in energy tariffs. The Bank and the authorities support a gradual approach in this area.
Initial efforts are focused on arresting the declining trend in the cost recovery levels o f household
tariffs. However, the adjustment o f import energy prices will continue throughout the next few
years, requiring consistent domestic tariff adjustments.

74.     The energy tariff increase enacted in January 2009 has only a marginal effect on
poverty. Moreover, this effect will be offset by the social assistance measures also
supported by this operation. The resources spent by households on utility tariffs as a share o f
their total consumption was l o w before the increase in tariffs. Moreover, the tariff adjustment
(which took place earlier in the year) had only a very moderate effect on that share (see Figure
6.3). Even when looking at households by quintile, only a marginal loss in consumption i s
observed as a consequence o f the tariff increase. Figure 6.4 shows the cumulative consumption
loss to households due to the increase in energy tariffs (by 20 percent), with a total loss o f
consumption (as proxy for the disposable income) o f 0.16 percent for the poorest 40 percent o f
the population. The overall increase in tariffs would potentially increase poverty rates by 0.2
percentage points. But this does not count the savings for households that could arise from
greater energy saving. Moreover, households with larger shares o f expenditures on utilities will
receive additional subsidies from the social assistance system. The additional support i s expected
to help offset the disposable income decline generated by the tariff increase to the poorer
households (see discussion on measures on safety nets supported below).

    75.     The decree (prior action) supported by this DPL that scales up targeted social
    assistance will have a positive distributional impact. The reform supported b y this operation
    effectively redistributes fiscal resources from other parts o f the budget and from weakly targeted
    programs to programs that reach the poor and the most vulnerable, namely the Targeted Social
    Assistance (TSA) program (see Section 5B for a detailed explanation o f the social assistance

                                                                 33
reform supported by this D P L and advised by Bank staff). The program i s expected to reach
300,000 low income individuals in 2010 (compared to the expected 200,000 beneficiaries by end
2009).

76.    Bank staff estimations suggest that the social assistance measures approved would
help offset the impact o f higher energy costs and help offset the impact o f the economic
downturn on the poor. The estimations suggest less than 0.1 percent o f GDP o f additional
funding (that is, on top o f the existing regular funding) for the social assistance programs would
be enough to offset the energy price increase. The most disadvantaged groups and the ones most
vulnerable to the crisis (as shown in Figure 6.2) are the ones primarily targeted b y the TSA
(through specific income verification and other eligibility parameters).

B.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

77.      Specific actions under the proposed DPL operation are not expected to have any
significant negative effect on the environment. In sectors that have a close link with the
environment and that are supported by this operation (such as energy tariffs), the actions laid out
by this D P L might improve environmental conditions in the long run as they are geared to
improving energy efficiency. There i s a possibility that fuel substitution toward greater reliance
o f fuel wood and coal in rural areas might lead to greater carbon emissions. There could also be
some risk o f deforestation if reliance on fuel wood increases. However, rural households already
rely to a significant extent on fuel wood for cooking and heating. Moreover, substitution
possibilities in urban households, where the majority o f the population resides, are limited due to
the predominance o f central district heating. Moreover, as showed in the poverty analysis,
households only spend a small part o f their income on utilities, so a change in behavior through
energy sources substitution is less likely. Price, regulatory, and other reforms under the second
pillar o f this operation are not expected to have any significant impact on the environment.

C.    FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

78.     I n 2009, the Bank prepared a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Assessment (PEFA) for Belarus. The PEFA assessment concluded that Belarus has an
effectively functioning fiscal and budget management system, which has enabled the government
to finance and execute a budget delivering public services to the general population.
Furthermore, the government has launched a number o f reforms aimed at increasing
transparency o f public finance. Belarus scores relatively well on budget credibility,
comprehensiveness and classification. While the budget does not have a particularly strong
policy or strategic focus, the strong control framework ensures a high degree o f compliance with
prevailing laws and regulations. Weaknesses exist in such areas as extra-budgetary expenditure,
public access to key fiscal information, public procurement, and internal and external audits.

79.    The budget calendar i s well understood and generally followed and budget
documentation i s comprehensive and complete. The emphasis in the presentation o f the
budget has moved from the central government toward integrated presentation o f the
consolidated budget including local governments as well as off-budget funds. While the
government has also introduced elements o f program budgeting, the budget has only recently

                                                34
included a multi-year perspective; however the realism o f the outlying years has yet to be
demonstrated.

80.    Annual planning, quarterly allocations and regular monitoring o f tax receipts and
expenditure projections ensure that expenditures do not exceed the availability o f cash, and
thus the consolidated budget arrears have been below 1 percent of total budget
expenditures. While extra-budgetary funds are declining and represent less than 5 percent of
consolidated budget expenditures, there are weaknesses in monitoring and reporting o f "own-
source" revenue for subordinate budgetary institutions, as this source o f financing s t i l l remains
outside the treasury system.

81.     While the treasury system i s strong and the PFM system generally produces
complete and comprehensive information, areas for improvement still remain. These
include clearer assignment o f responsibilities for lower tier governments, stronger monitoring
systems for identifying and managing fiscal risks (particularly with regard to guarantees of
domestic borrowing by lower tier governments) and most significantly, greater public access to
all key budget and budget execution documents.

82.     Basic systems for accounting, recording transactions and financial reporting are in
place. There are regular reconciliations between transactions data in the Treasury systems,
central and local, and accounting data provided by Ministries and lower tier governments. There
are accounting records for every service delivery unit (schools, hospitals, cultural centers, etc.),
although these are not published, and the internal auditkontrol system has not reviewed the
accuracy o f accounting records for these front-line users. Consolidated government statements
are prepared covering all expenditure, but coverage o f financial assets and liabilities i s not
complete. National standards for accounting and financial reporting are largely based on
compliance with tax legislation and are not compatible with international standards and
practices.

83.     There i s a heavy apparatus o f compliance controls at central and local levels. In
addition to the procedures operated by and within spending Ministries or lower tier authorities to
ensure correctness, there are periodic inspections by MoF central and/or local inspectorates
(KRU), sometimes in conjunction with the State Control Committee (SCC). The main focus o f
these inspections i s comprehensive ex-post checking o f transactions, with a view to the discovery
and correction o f errors. Internal audit, in the sense o f an operation reporting to management on
the performance o f the systems for which it i s responsible, hardly exists in Belarus, although
there are indications o f recent KRU inspections identifying improvements in systems needed to
prevent errors from recurring, Audit as a tool to increase efficiency i s currently not the focus o f
attention.

84.     Expenditure by all government levels i s subject to detailed rules and procedures,
and the discipline i s further reinforced by strong ex-post control, resulting in a high degree
o f compliance with rules for processing and recording transactions. Revenues and
expenditures from all levels o f government are executed through the State Treasury system, and
starting from 2010, off-budget funds will also be included. Most central government revenue
and expenditure transactions are executed through the Treasury Single Account and the majority

                                                  35
o f local government revenue collections and expenditures are executed through regional
Treasury branches.

85.     External Audit in Belarus does not follow international standards, with the State
Control Committee's (SCC) reporting to the President rather than Parliament. The SCC
audit focuses mainly on the compliance o f transactions with all applicable legislation.
Furthermore, when the SCC performs their "external audit" they very often do so in association
with MoF, KRU and other bodies that usually performs internal control/audit; thus there i s no
clear boundary between external audit and internal control/audit. The SCC annual reports on
budget execution do not include any comprehensive financial audit, or any opinions on the
overall accuracy or reliability o f the financial statements provided by MoF.

86.      The IMF Safeguards Assessment of the NBRB was updated in M a y 2009. The
assessment identified significant weaknesses and risks in the NBRB's safeguards framework,
with particular regard to the legal, financial reporting, and control areas. Additionally
transparency o f NBRB operations and the arrangements for external audit require further
strengthening. The accounting framework o f NBRB also requires strengthening as the use of
Belarusian Accounting Standards lags far behind International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) and results in fragmented and less than comprehensive reconciliation o f key economic,
financial and statistical data. The NBRB agreed with the report's findings and recommendations
and i s executing an action plan to address these weaknesses and implement reforms.

87.      The fiduciary risk for this development policy operation was initially -assessed as
substantial, but with the mitigating measures the residual risk i s moderate. The fiduciary
risk i s based on two dimensions: (i)   the overall P F M environment in Belarus and (ii)   the
safeguards assessment o f the NBRB. While the government's core P F M systems (budget
management, treasury, etc.) function well, the weak oversight functions diminish the quality of
the overall P F M environment. The Bank i s working with the government to follow-up on the
PEFA report recommendations to further improve the performance and strengthen the country's
P F M systems. Additionally, the weak control framework o f the NBRB (as noted above) and
issues noted by the IMF contribute to the higher overall risk for this operation. The NBRB has
agreed to an action plan and i s implementing the reforms recommended by the IMF. As
elaborated further below, measures have been taken to mitigate this risk.

D.    DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

88.     Given the serious risks identified in the 2009 IMF safeguards assessments, two
additional mitigating measures will be required for this development policy operation. The
government will maintain accounts and records showing that loan disbursements were made in
accordance with the provisions o f the Loan Agreement. Within 15 days o f remittance o f funds
by the Bank, the government will provide confirmation (including a treasury report) to the Bank
that the funds have been received by the NBRB and that these funds are available for financing
budget expenditures.

89.     Disbursement. This operation i s a single-tranche loan o f US$200 million. Upon approval
o f the loan and notification by the Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the'government will submit a

                                              36
withdrawal application. The Bank will disburse the proceeds of the loan into a dedicated deposit
account at the NBRB. The government will transfer an amount (in local currency but equivalent
to amount disbursed by the Bank) to the budget (the general fund). If after deposit in the NBRB
account, the proceeds o f the loan are used for ineligible purposes (e.g., to finance goods or
services on the Bank's standard negative list), the Bank will require the government to return that
amount to the Loan account. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon request shall be cancelled.

90.    The two mitigating measures are meant to ensure that the proceeds o f this operation
will be transparently maintained by the Central Bank and be made available to the budget.
As previously noted the central PFM systems, including treasury systems, are strong and provide
accurate and reliable information on budget execution and government operations. As this
operation already includes two mitigating measures (the treasury report and dedicated account),
and as the performance o f the Belarus's core P F M systems is strong, there i s no need to require
an audit o f the deposit account."

E.    R I S K S AND MITIGATION

91.    The proposed DPL operation faces high risks associated with the macro-economic
outlook and the sustained implementation o f the structural reform agenda. This remains the
case even with the potential risk mitigants coming from adherence to the macroeconomic policy
framework o f the IMF's SBA, the Bank's structural reform engagement, and other donors
increased interaction and support (including EC and EBRD).

92.     Economic Risks. The primary risks to the program from a macro-economic perspective
include: i)a deeper and more prolonged deterioration in the external trade and financing
                                                                                 i
environment o f Belarus, particularly in relation to export demand from Russia; i ) inappropriate
macro policy responses, for example, through deviations from the IMF's SBA supported
program, particularly as regard to the NIR and NDA performance criteria; and (iii)   unfilled gaps
in financing in the context o f significant external imbalances and constrained access to capital
markets. For example, additional "recommended" credits to the economy may delay the needed
external rebalancing with the authorities unable to support the exchange rate within the current
band. Moreover, external bi-lateral financing could be further constrained due to different
factors, including political developments in the country. Finally, the uncertainty associated with
the nature o f the recovery remains considerable. Many o f the macro policy choices that Belarus
faces involve trade-offs, but the authorities should be encouraged to tackle squarely the current
imbalances on the balance o f payments.

93.      Adherence to a consistent macro policy framework, progress on structural reforms to
attract FDI and appropriate measures to address "recommended" lending in the financial sector
are the primary mitigation measures for the above economic risks. O f particular importance,
therefore, i s progress on the IMF's SBA supported program which sets out the key macro
policies to adjust to the shock in terms o f expenditure compression and switching. Movement


loThe Treasury Report i s regarded to be a reliable resource which would make the requirement for an audit
superfluous.


                                                        37
away from the IMF program or delays in i t s implementation may exacerbate the risks o f a more
abrupt adjustment, for example via a disorderly exchange rate correction.

94.     This operation supports structural measures to enhance competitiveness which are
expected to facilitate economic recovery, including through incentives for the expansion of the
private sector and FDI. In addition, the planned strengthening o f the system o f social protection
helps to mitigate the impact o f the necessary adjustment on vulnerable households. In building
up a track record, with respect to both the IMF's SBA and proposed D P L operation, the
government's actions may increase the confidence o f domestic private investors and other donor
partners.

95.     Medium-term implementation and governance risks. The proposed DPL operation i s
based on reform measures that are achieved prior to its approval. Nevertheless, there are clearly
risks that the medium-term reform agenda may not be sustained or may be slower than
anticipated. Given the concentration o f political decision-making, the risk o f reversibility of
reforms i s high. Belarus ranks l o w in cross-country rankings on the control o f corruption and the
level o f voice and accountability, highlighting associated governance risks.

96.       The government's publication o f its short-term liberalization program has provided
visibility to i t s reform efforts in the area o f the business entry. The elaboration o f the medium-
t e r m strategy through the draft modernization o f the economy program and in the Letter o f
Development Policy provides greater clarity on the wider economic reform agenda planned by
the government. Moreover, Belarus's external economic conditions are likely to remain
sufficiently tight to help mitigate against the risk o f a full-scale reversal o f reforms in the near to
medium-term. Some o f the reform measures may, o f course, be subject to opposition from vested
interests. The risk o f these political pressures leading to a reversal in the reform progress remains
strong but may be viewed to be offset somewhat as the authorities o f Belarus build up their track
record o f reform. Moreover, the rationale for this operation is based on the conviction that
medium-term implementation risks are best mitigated through deepened engagement making use
o f the window o f opportunity that has opened for an intensified dialogue in Belarus. A medium
term programmatic engagement o f the Bank in the structural reform agenda would help mitigate
implementation risks in future years should this approach be successful.

97.     As the Bank's engagement with Belarus deepens, the dialogue on Governance i s expected
to intensify (see CASPR accompanying this operation). The approach to governance issues in
the CAS consisted o f (a) advocacy for reforms on governance and measures to address
corruption, (b) deepened engagement in areas such as public finance management (PFM) in
which the government and Bank have common goals, and (c) ensuring that appropriate fiduciary
oversight is applied to proposed resource transfers from the Bank. This approach remains
appropriate but will be extended in line with the broader engagement proposed to mitigate
related risks. Follow-up work on the PEFA and on public procurement is planned to strengthen
public financial management systems, the IMF is leading work to strengthen the independence o f
the National Bank o f Belarus, and the Bank's presence in the country has been strengthened to
support a stronger advocacy role but also intensified dialogue with the authorities.

                               Letter o f Development Policy

Mr. Robert Zoellick
World Bank President
Washington D.C.


Dear Mr. Zoellick:

L e t u express our deep respect to the World Bank and to you personally, and inform you
       s
about the following.

The Government o f the Republic o f Belarus attaches great importance to the cooperation
with the World Bank and i s interested in its deepening in the framework o f the revised
Country Assistance Strategy o f the World Bank for the Republic o f Belarus for the period
of 2008 - 201 1 fiscal years by requesting a Development Policy Loan.

Belarus has being building a model o f socially-oriented market economy, which aims at
raising the wellbeing o f the population based on the fast growth o f gross domestic
product and implementation o f market reforms.

The Development Policy Loan would support the medium-term reform agenda o f the
Government o f the Republic o f Belarus to liberalize economic activities, mitigate the
negative impact o f the global financial crisis on vulnerable sectors o f the economy, and
create the necessary prerequisites to foster sustainable economic growth.

Maintaining macroeconomic stability

From mid-October 2008, the impact o f the global financial crisis on Belarus became
strongly evident. In the environment o f continued gas price growth for the Republic o f
Belarus, declining demand for exports and falling international prices for Belarus's
exports are having a significant impact on the real sector and trade deficit. In 2008, the
rate o f real gross domestic product growth was still 10 percent. Besides, the global trends
o f increasing prices on energy, raw materials, and food impacted the pattern o f inflation,
which increased to 13.3 percent in 2008.



                                             52
The impact of the crisis on the real sector intensified in 2009. In 2009, the January-
September year on year rate o f real gross domestic product decline was 0.3 percent.
During the first three quarters o f 2009, the country continued to feel the impact o f
worsening terms o f trade. In January-August 2009, the volume o f foreign trade in goods
and services was 61.9 percent o f the volume for the corresponding period o f 2008, while
exports were 57.6 percent, imports - 65.8 percent, and the deficit amounted to
US$3,595.9 million. The unfavorable developments had a significant impact on the
country's industrial output performance. In January-September 2009, the industrial
output dropped by 4.5 percent compared to same period o f 2008. In January-September
2009, the overall consumer price index was by 7.9 percent and the real wage growth
reached 1.7 percent.

Since the beginning o f the global financial crisis, efforts o f the Government o f the
Republic o f Belarus have been geared to mitigating i t s negative effects and maintaining
economic and financial stability. Belarus has undertaken a range o f systemic measures
aimed at implementing satisfactory macroeconomic policies, first o f all, those to stabilize
the banking system (the state has undertakento guarantee household deposits). Resources
have been allocated from the budget to support banks' liquidity. Public expenditures were
reviewed in 2009 to have a balanced budget, maximize resource savings and tighten the
fiscal sphere.

With the IMF support (a 15-month Stand-By Arrangement for Belarus, involving
financing o f SDR 1.62 billion or about US$2.46 billion was approved in January 2009).
Due to the deterioration o f the external environment in 2009, the IMF Executive Board
took a decision to augment the financing. The Government o f the Republic o f Belarus
and the National Bank are taking steps to ensure macroeconomic stabilization and
minimize the impact o f the global economic and financial crises o n the country's
economy. The major objectives o f the IMF-supported program are to promote an orderly
adjustment to external shocks and overcome major vulnerabilities o f the economy.

Under the program:
       a       from January 1, 2009, a new regime was introduced and the exchange rate
       was devalued to a new parity to the US dollar with a simultaneous switch to a peg
       to a currency basket to better reflect the structure o f Belarus's trade and financial
       flows;
       0       tight fiscal policy has been implemented to contain domestic demand
       growth. Budget consolidation measures were explicitly aimed at reducing the rate
       o f investment and consumption growth. In 2009, a deficit-free state budget was
       approved, with limited growth in public investments and wages in the budget and
       state enterprise sectors;
       a       it i s stipulated to continue privatization efforts and reducing distortions in
       the economy and financial sector.

Since the Stand-By Arrangement approval, the Republic o f Belarus has been
implementing policies consistent with the commitments undertaken under this program
and it intends to continue doing so.


                                             53
    At the same time, we see the need to complement the macroeconomic program with key
    fiscal and structural reforms that will ensure economic recovery through liberalization
    whilst helping strengthen automatic stabilizers to protect the vulnerable in a more
    targeted way.

    We envisage reforms that will allow the country to open avenues for a sustainable
    recovery and medium term growth, including:
           further abolishing barriers for business,
           further liberalizing prices,
           reducing tax distortions,
           reducing operational costs o f business activity, and
           undertaking gradual and transparent privatization process.

    In parallel, we envisage reforms to further strengthen fiscal discipline and transparency as
    regards to cross-subsidies in the energy sector, local budget debt management, and timely
    budget reporting.

    Several key measures and reforms under the above areas would be supported by the
    World Bank's Development Policy Loan. Below we provide a more detailed account on
    their current progress,

    Progress in the Reform Agenda Supported by the Development Policy Loan

    O n the onset o f the economic crisis, a key concern for us was to mitigate the negative
    impact o f the crisis on the most vulnerable groups o f the population by improving the
    system o f targeted social assistance.

    The system o f state targeted social assistance was created in the Republic of Belarus in
    2001 with grant support from the World Bank and aims at providing temporary welfare
    assistance to low-income citizens and families, and helping to overcome difficult life
    situations. In order to improve the system and the mechanism o f its provision, a Decree
                                                   e
    o f the President o f the Republic o f Belarus N 458 On State Targeted Social Assistance
    has been enacted on September 14'h 2009. The Decree expanded the state targeted social
s   assistance and improved i t s targeting, as well as replaced non-cash housing subsidies
    with targeted assistance. All these measures have been discussed in consultations with the
    World Bank experts. These improvements have been coordinated with all ministries
    concerned and local authorities.

    The Government o f the Republic o f Belarus will continue efforts to liberalize the
    economy and strengthen financial discipline to lay foundation for post-crisis development
    based on private sector growth and improved competitiveness.

    Significant reforms have been and are being undertaken under the advice o f the World
    Bank Group to reduce regulatory and administrative costs in business. In 2008, about 40
    regulatory legal acts were adopted to create a favorable business climate in the country.


                                                 54
Reforms are expected to stimulate entrepreneurship development in the real sector of the
economy, attract foreign investment, and expand Belarus's export potential.

In 2008, Belarus also implemented a number o f reforms in the area o f business regulation
that facilitated access to credit resources by abolishing the minimum threshold for
submitting reports on a loan to the State Loan Register. New business entry was eased by
introducing a single registration data base and halving the minimum requirement to
capital adequacy.

In 2009, we made a number o f important reforms in the area o f company registration and
certification. The L a w o f the Republic o f Belarus On Administrative Procedures came
into force on M a y 12, 2009 and an Action plan for simplification o f administrative
procedures for doing businesses till the end o f 2009 was approved on June 11, 2009.

T o simplify licensing procedures and reduce the l i s t o f licensed activities, the
Government o f the Republic o f Belarus drafted the Decree o f the President o f the
Republic o f Belarus On Licensing Individual Types ofdctivities, stipulating a 40-percent
reduction o f licenses issued. The version o f the Decree, which has been revised to lay out
even more radical reform o f licensing requirements, will be presented to the Head o f the
State in November 2009.

Decree o f the President o f the Republic o f Belarus On Improving Control (Supervision)
Activity in the Republic o Belarus # 510 was enacted on October 16, 2009 to reduce
                             f
control burden on businesses and improve transparency and efficiency o f control
activities. We expect that introduction o f the progressive provisions o f the Decree will
reduce the number o f inspections o f small enterprises, which are generally characterized
by a l o w level o f risk and the overall duration o f all inspections o f any enterprise; ensure
consistency between the materiality o f errors and the severity o f penalties, and support
new firms' growth by exempting them from inspections during the first three years since
opening the business.

The drafts o f the above-mentioned Decrees had been discussed with experts o f the World
Bank and the International Finance Corporation, as well as with the business community,
and recommendations o f all the parties concerned have been incorporated therein.

Decreasing tax distortions and tax burden on enterprises

Over the last few years, 22 tax payments have been abolished in Belarus, the procedure
o f calculating the majority o f applicable taxes and fees has been significantly simplified,
tax system stability has been increased, and the number o f administrative procedures
performed by tax authorities has been significantly reduced. Starting from January 1,
2009, the rate o f the fee paid to the Republican Fund to Support Producers o f Agricultural
Produce, Food Stuffs, and Agrarian Science (turnover tax) was reduced from two to one
percent o f proceeds from sales o f goods (work, services). The active part o f basic
production assets was removed from the object o f real estate taxation. The local sales tax
rates for retail goods trade and the local service tax rates were unified and set at 5

                                               55
percent, and the rate o f tax on automobile vehicle purchases was also reduced from 5 to 3
percent. A flat (unified) personal income tax rate was introduced in the amount o f 12
percent, and the standard tax deduction for each employee was raised. As to incomes of
individual entrepreneurs, a flat (unified) income tax rate o f 15 percent was introduced.

These measures will reduce the tax burden on the economy by 1.3 percent o f gross
domestic product in 2009.

The draft annual Law o f the Republic o f Belarus on the 2010 budget was prepared by the
Ministry o f Finance in parallel with the draft Specific Part o f the Tax Code, which had
been submitted to the President o f the Republic o f Belarus on October 1, 2009. The Tax
Code envisages the abolition o f a number o f taxes from January 1, 2010 and, in
particular, complete abolition o f the turnover and local sales taxes. It will raise the
transparency and efficiency o f the tax system o f the country, significantly reduce the tax
burden on enterprises, and ultimately raise the competitiveness o f Belarusian economic
agents.

To follow the chosen course o f economic liberalization, phased efforts are being made in
the Republic o f Belarus to reduce the scope o f state regulation o f prices (tariffs) by
amending the legislation and regulations on pricing establishing limits in this sphere.
From January 1, 2009, price registration was abolished and no administrative limits on
producer price increases are applied. The list o f socially important goods and services
subject to administrative price regulations had been reduced, with the range o f service
categories being cut by half. In August 2009, the Government o f the Republic o f Belarus
lifted restrictions on retail trade margins except for an approved l i s t o f socially important
goods and goods subject to monopoly power.

In parallel to measures aimed at stimulating new private business growth, the
Government o f the Republic o f Belarus has been taking steps since 2008 to develop the
basis for quality privatization.

The golden share rule has been abolished, the moratorium on selling shares held by
individuals has been lifted, and the requirement to sell shares to employees has been
removed. In July 2008, a new Privatization Program was approved for 2008 - 2010. In
2008, about 200 state-owned enterprises were corporatized, and in 2009 and 2010, it i s
planned to corporatize 301 and 382 state-owned enterprises (of republican and communal
ownership respectively). Under the program it i s planned to privatize shares o f 160 joint-
stock companies during 2008 - 2010.

In order to improve the legislative and institutional base for privatization, the
Liberalization Program for 2009 stipulates measures to improve the legal base for
privatization, corporatization procedure, state property management, and to raise the
transparency o f the privatization process.

We are interested in gradual, consistent, and transparent privatization using international
best-practice experience in this area. We have. presented to the Parliament and the


                                               56
President o f the Republic o f Belarus new draft Laws On Privatization and On Objects in
Exclusive State Ownership developed taking into account the World Bank's
recommendations. The Government o f the Republic o f Belarus i s taking significant steps
to strengthen fiscal discipline.

In the area of energy efficiency and energy saving, the country i s implementing
consistent state policies on efficient energy use. In 2001 - 2005, the energy intensity o f
gross domestic product was reduced by 25.3 percent. However, the energy saving
potential remains quite high.

In future, the Government o f the Republic o f Belarus plans to ensure a reduction in the
energy intensity o f gross domestic product by at least 31 percent in 2010, by 50 percent
in 2015, and by at least 60 percent in 2020 compared to the level o f 2005. Even with the
sharp decline o f the rate o f gross domestic product growth, we manage to continue
energy savings efforts and ensure a reduction in the energy intensity o f gross domestic
product in January-August 2009 by 4.2 percent compared to the corresponding period of
2008.

We have set the task to produce in 2012 at least 25 percent o f electricity and heat energy
output using local fuels, waste energy, and alternative sources o f energy. In 2008, the
share o f own energy sources in the boiler and stove fuel balance was 18.3 percent.

To reduce cross-subsidization through prices (tariffs) on natural gas, electricity and heat
energy for enterprises o f the real sector o f the economy, raise the level o f cost recovery
for utilities provided to households, Resolution o f the Council o f Ministers o f the
Republic o f Belarus # 1942 dated December 16, 2008 raised electricity and heat energy
tariffs for households by 19.3 and 15.64 percent respectively from January 1, 2009.
Taking into account the need to reduce cross-subsidization through energy prices (tariffs)
for enterprises o f the real sector o f the economy, the level o f utility cost-recovery will be
increased in 2009-2010 by stages. In 2010, for electricity and heat energy it is planned to
reach respectively at least 80 percent and at least 45 percent cost recovery by households.

In recent years, the Government o f the Republic o f Belarus has been paying a lot of
attention to streamlining and improving the efficiency o f state support to the real sector of
the economy.

A register o f state support has been put in place, and the eligibility criteria of i t s
recipients as well as reporting requirements o n the efficiency o f its use have been
hardened. I t i s also planned to phase out extension o f state support to economic entities
on an individual requests' basis and move to redistribution of state resources in
predetermined volumes under priority state programs.

However, in the environment o f the global financial crisis a quick solution o f the task
deems impossible. Improving transparency o f state support i s treated as a priority
measure. So, a decision has been taken to place information on the volume and directions
o f state support on the website o f the Ministry o f Finance on a regular basis (quarterly,


                                               57
starting from the first quarter o f 2009. Dissemination o f this information is seen as an
important step toward further medium- and long-term restructuring o f state support,
gradual reduction of i t s scope, and bringing the system o f state support in accordance
with the W T O rules.

One o f the forms o f state support is the provision o f budget guarantees on loans extended
to enterprises o f the real sector. The Government o f the Republic o f Belarus is concerned
about rapid growth o f guarantees issued by local executive and administrative authorities.
The new Budget Code (came into force on January 1, 2009) sets a limit on the stock of
local executive and administrative authorities' debt (including guarantees) o f 30 percent
of local budget revenues (less intergovernmental fiscal transfers received from other
budgets). Oblast Executive Committees, on agreement with the Ministry o f Finance,
approved action plans to make their debt level consistent with the established parameter.

Government Priorities Going Forward
The country's authorities are committed to ,further gradual liberalization o f the economy
in order to increase i t s efficiency and competitiveness and create a solid basis for the
post-crisis recovery and growth.

In the medium-term, we will continue and intensify our efforts for:
          maintaining external and internal balance by pursuing a sound economic
          policies' mix;
          improving system o f targeted social assistance to bring it closer to the OECD
          countries' standards with budget financing o f the targeted social assistance
          being further expanded;
          easing barriers to entry and reducing regulatory and administrative costs o f
          business regulations. This will be achieved through the increased transparency
          o f the control process and application o f its modern methods, including audit,
          further reduction in the number o f activities subject to licensing, creation o f a
          register o f all administrative procedures in relation to legal entities and
          individual entrepreneurs, and setting clear and strict rules for the introduction
          o f new administrative procedures;
          increasing the efficiency and predictability o f the tax system and reducing the
          tax burden by enacting and enforcing the Specific Part o f the Tax Code;
          advancing price liberalization by refraining from setting limits on price
          increases and further reducing the l i s t o f goods and services subject to
          administrative price regulation;
          accelerating and deepening privatization, ensuring transparency, predictability,
          and efficiency o f the process by setting a proper legal and institutional basis for
          privatization;
          ensuring full cost recovery through energy tariffs for all categories o f
          consumers by gradually eliminating cross-subsidization and budget subsidies;
          and
          increasing transparency and efficiency o f the state support system by making
          public the integrated report on state support on regular basis and improving i t s

         presentation and contents and bringing the state support in compliance with the
         WTO requirements.

The Government o f the Republic o f Belarus requests the World Bank to provide a
Development Policy Loan in the amount of US$ 200 million which would promote
continued market reforms.

  IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Stand-By Arrangement,
              Concludes 2009 Article I V Consultationwith Belarus

The Executive Board o f the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the
second review o f Belarus's performance under an economic program supported by a
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). This decision enables the disbursement o f SDR 437.93
million (about US$699.5 million), bringing total disbursements under the program so far
to about SDR 1.4 billion (about US$2.23 billion).

The original 15-month SBA was approved on January 12,2009 (see Press Release No.
09/05). Financial support was subsequently increased to SDR 2.27 billion (about
US$3.63 billion) on June 29,2009 (see Press Release 09/241).

The Executive Board also concluded the 2009 Article I V consultation with Belarus. A
Public Information Notice and the staff report will be published in due course.

Following the Executive Board's discussion on Belarus, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"Belarus has made good progress in adjusting i t s policies in response to the global crisis.
Despite a substantial decline in exports, the economic contraction has been modest
relative to other crisis-hit countries. Exchange rate adjustment has helped reduce external
vulnerabilities, with the present exchange regime providing a buffer against external
shocks. The adjustment has been supported by a tight fiscal policy, with revenue
shortfalls offset by spending cuts, and by an interest rate policy that has kept market rates
high in real terms.

"Nevertheless, the strategy o f expanding credit under various government programs,
while helping to cushion the impact o f the crisis on output, put pressure on the external
position. The authorities are committed to a tight credit policy, with a view to reducing
the current account deficit and pressure on international reserves. The decision to limit

                                             60
lending under government programs in the remainder o f 2009 will help contain domestic
demand and support the stabilization efforts.

"The authorities have made important progress in their structural reform agenda aimed at
improving the business climate and facilitating private sector development. Privatization
will play an important part in easing external financing constraints and promoting
technological development. The planned setting-up o f a Privatization Agency i s on track.
Reducing the burden o f regulation and quantitative targets on the private sector, as well
as increasing the commercial orientation o f banks, will promote more efficient allocation
o f resources. I t will be important to protect vulnerable groups and enhance the
effectiveness o f the social safety net.

"The authorities have also progressed well on financial sector reforms, including bringing
loan classification and provisioning requirements in line with international practice and
improving the framework for crisis preparedness. The commitments to disengage the
central bank from non-core business and to enhance its independence are welcome.

"Securing sufficient financial resources from the international community i s essential for
Belarus' reform efforts. In this context, the authorities stand ready to implement
contingency measures should a financing gap emerge."
