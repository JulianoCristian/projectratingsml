F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Addressing the impact of the economic slowdown and reforms by strengthening the
system of social assistance. The DPL supported the Government's socioeconomic reform


                                                 ii
program to mitigate the impact of the recession and promote a stronger recovery. The
Government's reform program aims to strengthen social safety nets with a particular
emphasis on scaling up better-targeted social assistance programs.

  Laying the foundations for economic recovery and sustainable growth by enabling
private sector entry and competiveness through liberalization and financial discipline.
The DPL encourages resource reallocation in the economy by reducing the cost of entry
(through lower regulatory costs, less inefficient taxation, and deregulation of pricing),
hardening budget constraints on the enterprise sector (through higher energy tariffs and a
reduction of cross-subsidies), and creating a legal and institutional basis for better
privatization.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Economic growth in Belarus averaged over 9 percent between 2003 and 2008 driven mainly by
a favorable external environment and high investment rates. Supportive external factors were
the re-alignment of the exchange rate following the 1998 crisis, substantial terms of trade
improvements for Belarus exports (in particular oil products and chemicals), under-priced energy
supplies, and strong growth in the country’s main trading partners (in particular Russia). The
centralized economic model used these terms-of-trade gains to deliver high levels of investment
and credit to flagship SOEs, allowing them to maintain high levels of productivity and defend or
even gain market share in major export markets. At the same time, terms of trade gains were also
redistributed through higher wages, low levels of unemployment and transfers to the population,
thereby boosting domestic demand. Strong economic growth and a more stable financial situation
in the household and corporate sectors were also accompanied by increased financial
intermediation, reflected in growing bank deposits and lending, including directed lending.
However, signs of vulnerabilities intensified in 2007-2008. With rapid wage and credit growth
fuelling domestic consumption and increased directed lending from the state-owned banks to
maintain high investment growth, the current account position shifted from a surplus of 1.4
percent of GDP in 2005 to a deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP in 2008. The rapidly widening
domestic savings-investment gap was covered mostly through short-term borrowings, particularly
bank borrowings and trade credits, weakening the external debt maturity structure. At the same
time, FDI played a limited role. International reserves remained at persistently low levels. The
exchange rate peg to the USD and selective price controls helped to bring inflation down from
over 60 percent in 2001 to 13 percent in 2008.
The crisis was transmitted to Belarus in the fall of 2008 through lower export revenues and
reduced access to international borrowing. The impact of the crisis was heightened by external
payment difficulties arising from two main transmission channels. First, access to external
finance, trade credit and foreign bank loans tightened, in the absence of adequate foreign reserves
cover. Second, there was a sharp negative shock to export demand and prices as the crisis hit the
economies of major trading partners, in particular Russia, and contributed to reversals of gains in
world prices of major exports, such as fertilizers, oil products, and food products. The terms of
trade were also adversely impacted by the further increase in the cost of imported gas from Russia
from January 2009. Lower export receipts and increased delays in their payment led to reduced
foreign exchange inflows.
External demand and financing difficulties prompted the authorities to request external
financial support. Belarus requested financing from Russia, the IMF, the EU and the World
Bank. An IMF Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved in January 2009.
The Government’s macroeconomic policy response involved external adjustment through
containment of domestic demand and a one off exchange rate depreciation. First, the initial
devaluation and re-pegging of the Belarusian ruble to a basket of USD, EUR and RUR were
intended to cope with the worsening terms of trade, deteriorating trade balance and limited access
to market-based external financing. Second, tighter monetary policy was aimed at achieving
positive real interest rates on ruble deposits to limit currency substitution and to cool domestic
demand. Third, fiscal discipline with a zero deficit target (with some adjusters for local
government spending and project financing) and wage restraint in the public sector were to
reduce domestic demand from the public sector.



                                                1
In addition to addressing the short-term challenges stemming from the global financial crisis,
the Government designed a structural reform program that included a one-year action plan
called the “Liberalization Program” and a medium term strategy called “The Modernization of
the Economy Program”. The Government’s Liberalization Program contains 52 priority
measures aimed at facilitating entry of new businesses, reducing operation costs for the private
sector, further price liberalization, and improving the legal framework for land and property. The
government has also drafted a medium term strategy called “The Modernization of the Economy
Program”. It represents a marked departure from earlier programs with its focus on the
development of market institutions and further economic liberalization. The program envisaged
the co-existence of a modernized and more innovation-driven state enterprise sector, an expanded
private sector led by foreign investment and private small and medium enterprises in the services
sector. The design of the Development Policy Loan was strongly linked to selected key areas of
reform under this program.
The economic crisis was expected to increase poverty in Belarus. It was expected that at least 94
thousand people will fall into poverty, equivalent to a 0.8 percentage point increase in the poverty
rate due to the economic downturn. The crisis, however, was milder in Belarus than in other
former Soviet Union countries in terms of output decline and unemployment growth. The actual
poverty rate fell in 2009 by 0.7 percentage points.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The DPL was designed to respond to the window of opportunity that had opened up as a result
of the deepening reform effort under the “Liberalization Program” and “The Modernization
Program”. Up to this point, the Bank had had a very selective engagement with Belarus, based
largely on analytic work and limited investment lending. This operation provided an opportunity
to support the government’s ongoing reform efforts and engage the authorities in a dialogue on
the key medium-term development and reform challenges. Such reform dialogue did not exist
prior to this engagement.
The key Program Development Objectives were the following:
       i.   Addressing the impact of the economic slowdown and reforms by strengthening the
            system of social assistance. The measures in the first pillar support efforts to
            strengthen the targeting of the system and expand the targeted social assistance
            program for the most vulnerable to deal with the impact of the crisis and post-crisis
            restructuring and reform on vulnerable groups.
      ii.   Laying the foundations for economic recovery and sustainable growth by enabling
            private sector entry and competitiveness through liberalization and financial
            discipline. The measures under the second pillar aim at increasing incentives for
            private sector development and strengthening financial discipline.
Key Outcome Indicators:
       i.   Improve targeting accuracy of social assistance system.
            a. Expenditures on targeted social assistance (TSA) increased in real terms in the
               2010 budget compared to 2009 and 2008 to provide for an effective
               implementation of the Decree.
      ii.   Ease barriers to entry and reduce regulatory and administrative costs of business
            regulations.
            a. Length of inspections for individual entrepreneurs is cut by one half.



                                                 2
                  b. The number of bodies with the right to conduct inspections is reduced.
                  c. As a result of the reduction in the number of activities subject to licensing,
                     planned number of licenses issued is reduced.
                  d. Time to get a license reduced by half.
        iii.      Move toward market based pricing in product markets.
                  a. Share of socially-important goods in CPI basket reduced from 10.4% in 2008 to
                     9.2% in 2009 as result of reducing the number of service categories by half.
        iv.       Support energy efficiency and energy savings by increasing cost recovery of energy
                  and utility tariffs.
                  a. Cost recovery of the energy component of housing and utility bill in 2009 and
                     2010 is maintained or improved from its current level of 79% for electricity and
                     45% for district heating.
                  b. The energy intensity of GDP is reduced by not less than 2.5% in 2009 as
                     compared to 0.32 toe/thousand USD PPP in 2008 due to continued
                     implementation of energy saving measures.
         v.       Harden budget constraint of the public enterprise sector.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)
The main objective of the program was to support the Government’s socioeconomic reform
program to mitigate the impact of the recession and promote a stronger recovery. Specifically,
the emphasis was on strengthening social safety nets with a particular emphasis on scaling up
better-targeted social assistance programs, encouraging resource reallocation in the economy by
reducing the cost of entry (through lower regulatory costs, less inefficient taxation, and
deregulation of pricing), and creating a legal and institutional basis for better privatization. The
program called for:
              •   strengthening the Targeting of Social Assistance to mitigate the social impact of
                  the economic slowdown;
              •   strengthening private sector entry and competitiveness through liberalization
                  and financial discipline.
Given Belarus’s limited reform track record the Bank opted for a single DPL operation as
opposed to a programmatic series. However, the DPL was designed taking into account the
medium term reform agenda of the Government and the possibility of a follow-on programmatic
engagement.
1.4.1         Strengthening the Targeting of Social Assistance
The government spends a substantial amount of resources on social assistance and social
insurance programs. The budget spent above 1.5 percent of GDP on social assistance (without
counting under pricing of services and other quasi fiscal costs) and above 11 percent of GDP on


                                                      3
social insurance programs. Almost 80 percent of the population benefited from some form of
social protection or social assistance. Yet, the overall targeting accuracy of social assistance
spending is modest, with only 15 percent of the spending reaching the poorest 20 percent of the
population in 2008.
Improved targeting of social assistance was seen a key mechanism to mitigate the impact of the
crisis and social costs of structural reforms going forward. Targeting was improved within the
social assistance system in 2008 by starting a gradual move away from spending on privileges.
Despite these positive steps forward, targeting remained weak. The first step under the reform
supported by this operation was to increase the reach of the Targeted Social Assistance program
by (i) increasing eligibility; (ii) extending the duration, (iii) integrating Housing and Utility
allowance program in the TSA, and (iv) incorporating an asset test in the eligibility criteria. The
second step was to ensure sufficient budget financing for TSA by doubling the TSA budget in
2010. The intention was to achieve a larger and better targeted social assistance system.

1.4.2. Enabling Economic Recovery through Private Sector Entry and Competitiveness
through Liberalization and Financial Discipline
Belarus faced a number of structural weaknesses compromising the sustainability of the
country’s economic growth model that became even more profound during the international
financial crisis. Some of the key structural weaknesses included: (i) high reliance on energy
subsidies from Russia, (ii) high and increasing concentration of output, tax base, and exports, (iii)
high tax burden, (iv) underdevelopment of the services sector, especially business services, (v)
large size of the government and system of state support, (vi) distortions in the banking system,
(vii) low and slow technological adaptation and innovation.


The DPL supported reforms to reduce administrative and regulatory barriers to facilitate entry
and growth of new businesses. The DPL supported the competitiveness of the overall economy
by reducing the high costs to firms generated by the state inspection system and distortive taxes
(which also deter entry). The removal of price controls aimed to provide signals to private
investors and help develop the incipient service sector, critical for employment expansion and
economic diversification. The gradual removal of energy cross-subsidies from industry to
households aimed to complement the tightening of financial disciple as import prices rise to
market levels. The introduction of hard budget constraints for the SOE sector was intended to
improve efficiency and foster competition.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:
Strong ownership of the program content contributed to smooth implementation of the
operation. Policy actions in the program supported by the DPL were timely and relevant, oriented
towards supporting the government’s reform program. The design of the program and the pace of
its implementation were driven by the authorities. The success of this engagement was supported
by the Government’s strong ownership of and commitment to the implementation of the reform
agenda. The renewed engagement with the Government served as an important opportunity for
the Bank to start policy dialogue on structural reforms. The role of the DPL was to help focus the
reform efforts and track the commitment of the authorities. The dialogue has deepened since then,
as evident by new analytical and advisory work (i.e. CEM, programmatic PER, PEFA) as well as
initial discussions about a possible programmatic DPL going forward.
High coordination capacity enabled delivery of results. The overall government reform program
was overseen by the Government, led by the Prime Minister. The DPL program was coordinated
by the Ministry of Economy, which also coordinated among various ministries and agencies
involved, which proved to be effective. The counterparts were well-informed, engaged in their
respective areas and provided necessary support towards the success of operation.
Strong complementarities with the IMF and other development partners. The DPL program
was designed in close collaboration and coordination with other development partners, including
the IMF, EBRD and UNDP. The DPL program complemented the macroeconomic framework
supported by the IMF’s SBA initiated in January 2009.
The DPL program was supported by analytical work. The DPL program relied on an extensive
portfolio of analytical work that covered all aspects of the DPL. Given the strong structural nature
of the reforms supported by this operation, a significant portion of the analytical underpinning
came from the Belarus Economic Policy Notes and the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum.
The social assistance and safety net measures were supported by a technical assistance in the
social protection area, which begun in the middle of FY08. The business climate measures are
anchored on the Advisory Services provide by the IFC.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:
The main reform areas under the DPL were centered on two thematic pillars with clearly
specified policy areas, measures, baseline values, target indicators, and medium-term
outcomes. Targets to be reached were quantified properly, with the exception of a few cases
where target levels were not specified. While the medium-term outcomes were well beyond the
horizon of the operation, they provided a strategic framework for the short-term targets. The
Ministry of Economy played the primary role in coordinating monitoring and program
implementation and collected monitoring data. The monitoring data was used by the Bank team
to monitor the progress of outcomes under the DPL.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation
In the run-up to the December 2010 presidential elections, macroeconomic policies were
significantly loosened, while at the same time the authorities outlined plans for deepening
economic liberalization. The Presidential Directive #4 (enacted on December 31st 2010) and the
Main Provisions of the Program of Socio-Economic Development for 2011-2015 (discussed at
the All Belarusians Assembly in December 2010) stipulate important positive policy changes,
supportive of the competitiveness of the national economy. However, inconsistent
macroeconomic policies during the second half of 2010 and the cooling of political relations with
Europe and the USA after the presidential elections have increased the risks facing investors. As a



                                                 7
result the need for deep structural reforms has become more apparent and the timeframe available
for their implementation may have been reduced.
The Bank can continue to play an important advisory role in the design and implementation of
structural reforms. The on-going Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) and Technical
Assistance (TA) activities include:
    •   The upcoming CEM focuses on the major challenges facing Belarus’s economic growth
        prospects in the context of an uncertain post-crisis external environment.
    •   The upcoming programmatic PER has three core objectives: (i) to identify options to
        achieve efficiency gains in selected areas of the budget; (ii) to quantify the impact of key
        fiscal reforms; (iii) and provide options for expenditure and revenue policies that are
        better aligned to the envisaged structural reform agenda.
    •   TA in the social protection area that focuses on scaling up the TSA program and
        providing advice on improving targeted accuracy of social assistance programs.
    •   On-going TA to support the Belarus privatization program aims to provide legal and
        institutional instruments and implementation capacities to successfully launch and roll-
        out a privatization program that is both on par with international best practice and able to
        be tailored to the particular industry/business.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The implications of the global economic crisis on Belarus were profound and prompted the
government to undertake an ambitious reform program. The impact of the global economic
crisis on Belarus was transmitted through lower export revenues and reduced access to
international borrowing. After growing on average over 9 percent a year between 2003 and 2008,
the pace of economic growth in 2009 stalled to 0.2 percent as the real sector adjusted to the sharp
deterioration in the global environment. The crisis exposed the Belarus economy’s structural
weaknesses that compromise the sustainability of the Belarus economic growth model. The likely
slow global recovery coupled with Belarus’s declining productivity growth and diminishing
returns on capital investment, underscored the need to consider bold steps. The crisis prompted
the Government to design a structural reform programs as part of its one year action plan called
the “Liberalization Program” and a medium term strategy called “The Modernization of the
Economy Program” with the aim to increase the role of the private sector and to support
economic recovery.
Therefore, the objectives of the DPL program, closely integrated with the government’s
program, were highly relevant when the operation was appraised, and they remain relevant to
date. The reform program supported by the DPL was anchored into the medium term reform
agenda of the Government. Thus, the objectives of the program were fully consistent with the
government’s reform agenda, which was part of its medium-term socio-economic policy
framework.
Measures supported by this operation were prioritized to address the key structural rigidities.
The DPL focused on two pillars: (i) addressing the impact of the economic slowdown and
reforms by strengthening social assistance, and (ii) laying the foundations for economic recovery
and sustainable growth by enabling private sector entry and competitiveness through
liberalization and financial discipline.




                                                 8
The DPL program led to a deeper engagement and reform dialogue between the Bank and
Belarusian authorities, not envisioned in the CAS. The original FY08-11 CAS did envisioned
rather selective assistance based on analytical and advisory work and limited investment lending.
The changing economic and political developments in 2008 and 2009 are reflected in the CAS
Progress Report that also expanded the lending enveloped to include development policy lending.
The PDOs of the DPL captured well the development impact of the government’s reform
program. The measures undertaken were targeted to support the Government’s socioeconomic
reform program to mitigate the impact of the recession and promote a stronger recovery.
The macroeconomic framework at appraisal was adequate. The macroeconomic framework was
prepared under higher than usual degree of uncertainty at the end of 2009. The team properly
identified the key macroeconomic vulnerabilities. The framework presented in the PD of the DPL
was consistent with the macroeconomic framework included in the IMF SBA program.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives – satisfactory
Overall, the Program Development Objectives were achieved with only minor shortcomings.
Development outcomes are summarized in Table 3.1.

Macroeconomic framework
Although economic policy helped to mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis on
Belarus, structural imbalances remain and create significant vulnerabilities going forward.
Economic growth in 2010 was significantly higher than projected at appraisal. The program
document projected growth at 2 percent in 2010 followed by medium-term average growth of 6
percent starting in 2012. In 2010, GDP and industrial output grew at a rate of 7.6 percent (year on
year) and 11.3 percent (year on year), respectively. The government’s macroeconomic policy
response supported by the IMF SBA to contain domestic demand and to apply a one-off exchange
rate adjustment initially helped mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis. However,
macroeconomic policies were relaxed prematurely in the course of 2010 and external imbalances
widened again contrary to expectations at appraisal. The current account deficit in 2010 remained
at about 15 percent of GDP with foreign exchange reserves well below prudential norms. The
FDI inflow in relation to GDP in 2010 has been similar to that in 2009 (5 percent) necessitating
higher foreign borrowing than expected at appraisal. Capital goods imports that are needed to
modernize SOEs continue to be financed by debt rather than FDI flows. Furthermore, despite the
strong recovery of output, fiscal pressures have intensified. The budget deficit for 2010 was
revised upwards to 3 percent of GDP from an estimated 1.5 to 2 percent at appraisal to


                                                10
accommodate: (i) the revenue shortfall due to changed conditions in import of oil from Russia
since January 2010 (estimated at about BTR 2.6 trillion or about 1.9 percent of GDP); (ii) the
increased support to agriculture due to adverse weather conditions this summer; (iii) public sector
wage and pensions increases in the run-up to the elections; and (iv) recapitalization of major
state-owned banks (1.3% GDP).
Pillar I: Addressing the Impact of the Economic Slowdown and Reforms by Strengthening
the System of Social Assistance
Belarus has broad-based, but poorly targeted system of social assistance. Almost 80 percent of
the population benefits from some form of social protection or social assistance. Yet, the overall
targeting accuracy of social assistance spending has been modest, with only 15 percent of the
spending reaching the poorest 20 percent of the population in 2008.
Since the impact of the crisis was expected to be severe, the government’s efforts were toward
mitigation of the social impact of the crisis through targeted social assistance. The Government
introduced a framework to improve the targeting accuracy of social assistance system. The
improvement of accuracy of social assistance was to be achieved through the following policy
actions introduced by a Presidential Decree: (i) increasing eligibility threshold for targeted social
assistance program, (ii) extending the duration of the targeted social assistance from 3 months to
6 months; (iii) lengthening the period of verified income using the last 12 months of income
rather than 3 months; (iv) integrating Housing and Utility allowance program in the targeted
social assistance program; and (v) incorporating an asset test in the eligibility criteria for targeted
social assistance. The DPL program supported (i) improving the framework for improving the
targeted social assistance and (ii) increasing funding for Targeted Social Assistance ensuring that
adequate resources are provided for scaled up targeted social assistance programs.
The 2010 budget increased the allocations for targeted social assistance, but these allocations
were not disbursed fully. Although budget allocations on TSA in 2010 increased, actual
disbursements are expected to be smaller. For the first 11 months of 2010, the TSA disbursements
amounted to 48 billion BYR compared to 97 billion BYR budgeted. The TSA program was
expected to reach 300,000 low income individuals in 2010; however, about 160,000 individuals
will be reached.
Shortfalls in expected disbursement of targeted social assistance have been the result of lower
than expected demand for social assistance and constraints in implementing scaled-up targeted
assistance programs. First, the demand for targeted social assistance was lower than expected
because the impact of the crisis on poverty was significantly lower than expected prior to the
crisis. Before the crisis the poverty rate was expected to reach 6.8 percent in 2009 while it turned
out to be only 5.4 percent. In fact, the poverty rate in 2009 decreased relative to 2008 by 0.7
percentage points. However, while the aggregate poverty rates actually decreased, select
population groups experienced increases in poverty. Poverty increased among older people (age
55+), people with low level of education as well as among those having tertiary education, and
families with unemployed members. This experience highlights the importance of
strengthening the framework for targeted social assistance. The demand for targeted social
assistance decreased because the additional steps that the Government introduced aimed at
mitigating the social impact of the crisis (e.g. introduction of reduced work schedules rather than
layoffs at the SOEs) likewise reduced the demand for social assistance. In addition, the
implementation of the intended scaled-up targeted social assistance faced capacity constraints in
increasing outreach, because the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection designs policy but the
implementation is the responsibility of regional institutions.
The social assistance reforms supported under the DPL were the first stage of a broader reform
efforts that aims to move gradually away from subsidies and categorical allowances (although


                                                  11
not in all cases) and privileges toward the TSA program that reaches the poor and vulnerable
more effectively. The implementation experience showed that increasing targeting accuracy of
social assistance on the ground remains problematic. Going forward the strategy of the
government foresees a gradual reduction of categorical programs through attrition with the aim of
not creating resistance of any particular group currently receiving those benefits. In addition, the
government plans to remove the capacity constraints that were discovered during the
implementation of this program. The Bank will support these efforts through technical assistance
geared towards improving efficiency, targeting, administration, and monitoring of results and
performance in social assistance
Overall, the objectives in the reform area of improving targeting accuracy of social assistance
system were met. Outcomes in this reform area are deemed to be satisfactory. The shortfalls in
scaling up the targeted social assistance identified during the implementation require
strengthening capacity of both the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection and municipal bodies.
Since the bank team had engagement on a policy level, these implementation deficiencies could
have been discovered only at the implementation stage of operation.
Pillar II: Laying the Foundations for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Growth by
Enabling Private Sector Entry and Competitiveness through Liberalization and Financial
Discipline.
Belarus had begun addressing a number of structural weaknesses that compromise the
sustainability of its economic growth model. The private sector accounts for less than a third of
GDP, and the playing field between SOEs and private companies has been far from even. The
planned phase out of energy subsidies from Russia required the hardening of budget constraints
for the SOE sector as well as increasing energy efficiency. Tight controls over product and factor
markets have traditionally undermined the growth of the private sector hindering development of
small businesses. While these weaknesses were evident even prior to the economic crisis, in the
post-crisis environment these constraints pose a risk to sustainable economic recovery. In
essence, the challenge facing Belarus is to move from extensive public investment driven growth
to productivity growth led by the private sector.
a) Strengthening financial discipline through hard budget constraints
Belarus’s growth model was supported by a number of export-oriented and highly productive
flagship SOEs. However, a large tax benefit and subsidy system covers enterprises that in many
cases are less efficient than the flagship SOEs, undermining competition and productivity
improvements. Hence, it remains of critical importance to introduce hard budget constraints on
the public enterprise sectors.
The transparency of State Support to SOEs was increased. The DPL aimed to increase the fiscal
transparency of the state support to SOEs by establishing an integrated and public report on the
itemized fiscal costs of state support to the economy and making its available from the MOF web-
site.1 The Ministry of Finance is committed to continue with the publication of such reports
regularly as a part of the report on budget execution for the period in question. The Ministry of
Finance confirmed its interest and willingness to work further on the improvement of the
presentation and content of the report to incorporate other forms of state support and thus, to
make it more comprehensive.
While direct budget support to enterprises declined somewhat, overall state support remains
high. The scope of direct budget support to enterprises was reduced from 3.8 percent of GDP in

1
 According to the Belarusian legislature, the term “state support” is used in relation to state aid provided on individual
basis by the decisions of the President or the Government. The provision of such support is regulated by the
Presidential Decree #182 from March 28, 2006.


                                                           12
2004 to less than one percent of GDP in 2009. Despite these positive changes and improved
administration of state support to the enterprise sector since 2004, the overall fiscal costs of state
support during 2007-09 are estimated at 10.2 percent of GDP on average as compared to 8.4
percent of GDP during 2004-06.2
Overall, the ICR considers that objectives to improve financial discipline through hardening
budget constraints were achieved. The outcomes in the reform area are deemed to be
satisfactory. State support in Belarus continues to be high and further reforms are needed in this
area.
b) Strengthening financial discipline through energy efficiency
The oil and gas agreements concluded between Russia and Belarus at the beginning of 2007
implied a substantial deterioration of Belarus’ energy terms of trade and called for systematic
efforts to reduce energy intensity and improve efficiency. With Russia’s push towards market
prices for its exports, the natural gas import price more than doubled in 2007 to U$100/tcm, and,
according to the agreement, will continue to gradually increase. The reforms to support energy
efficiency and energy savings was to be achieved through (i) increasing cost recovery of the
energy component of housing and utility bill and (ii) reducing the energy intensity of GDP.
Notwithstanding high energy intensity, Belarus’ policy efforts to improve energy efficiency
have delivered positive results. The reduction of energy intensity continued during the crisis
driven by capital investments in asset renovation, efficient utilization of fuel and energy resources
at the SOEs and more extensive use of domestic, alternative and renewable energy sources. The
achieved results are encouraging; energy intensity was about 0.78 tons of oil equivalent (toe) per
dollar of GDP in 1990 and was reduced to 0.34 in 2007 and to 0.32 in 2008 (down by 9.1 percent
compared to 2007). In 2009 the energy intensity decreased by additional 5 percent compared to
2008. The Department of Energy Efficiency of Gosstandart jointly with the parties concerned is
preparing proposals for the implementation of the national project Alternative Energy in 2011-
2015 aimed to further reduce energy intensity.
In 2010, the government did not implement the intended agenda to reduce cross-subsidies and
increase the cost recovery in the energy tariff system. In early 2009, the tariffs for electricity and
heating for the population were increased by 19.3 percent and 15.6 percent, respectively in order
to reduce the cross-subsidization of households by industrial sector. For 2010, the government
planned on further tariff increases linked to higher salaries. However tariffs were not increased in
2010 despite a sizable wage increase prior to the Presidential Elections late in the year. The
Government recognizes the inherent inefficiencies built into its system of energy tariff subsidies
and the loss of competitiveness these cross-subsidies imply for industry. Therefore, the view of
the government remains reversing the recent trend of declining cross recovery and increasing
cross-subsidies is essential for putting the economy on a more sustainable development path. The
Government informed the team of its efforts to ensure that the cost recovery by the population for
electricity is not less than 80 percent, and for heating is not less than 45 percent in 2011.
Overall, the outcomes in the area of energy efficiency are deemed to be moderately satisfactory.
The government succeeded in continuing reducing the energy efficiency of the country through
administrative means; however, it did not continue with the gradual reduction in cross-
subsidization of tariffs from industrial consumers to households in the utilities sector. The
understanding is that the process will continue in 2011.

subsidies, implicit subsidies under the budget credit programs, budget spending on repayment of guaranteed credits,

directed lending and tax expenditures. See, World Bank (2010). Belarus: Industrial Performance Before and During

c) Reducing price controls and creating basis for privatization
Belarus has traditionally kept tight control over product and factor markets with domestic
production subject to significant price controls with the aim of achieving a desired equilibrium
between profitability of SOEs and price stability. Up until 2007, only modest progress in price
liberalization was achieved in tandem with the gradual opening of trade. After 2007, the
government initiated the removal of price controls, so that prices can provide private investors
signals for the allocation of capital that would help develop the incipient service sector.
Under the DPL, price controls in product markets were reduced. The price reform was
implemented as intended through (i) eliminating the requirements for price registration (including
for new goods) and removing administrative limits on increases in prices, (ii) removal of retail
trade margins for domestic and imported goods (excluding a limited list of socially important
goods and goods subject to monopoly power), and (iii) reducing the list of socially-important
goods and services subject to administrative price controls. These measures significantly reduced
the application of price regulations, particularly for producers. The impact of these actions as
measured by the reduction in the share of socially important goods in CPI was small but it is
expected to further decrease over the medium term.
While important steps towards the liberalization of prices in the economy have been
undertaken, a number of important price control mechanisms remain in place – price controls
and retail trade margins on so-called socially important goods. Given the importance of price
signals and incentives for economic adjustment, broadening these price liberalization efforts
should be a top priority for the Government. The Government has confirmed its medium-term
objective to further reduce the list of socially-important goods and services.
In addition to advancing the price control liberalization agenda, the government has
undertaken measures to further reduce the role of the state by developing the basis for quality
privatization. The government has adopted a law on privatization which establishes clear
procedures for privatization of state enterprises in an open, competitive and transparent manner;
and clarifies the division of power between different bodies involved in the privatization process.
The new legal framework also foresees that certain assets would remain state property, however,
the list of enterprises not subject to privatization was reduced.
Overall, the outcomes in the reform area of reducing price controls are deemed to be highly
satisfactory. First, there was significant progress in price liberalization. This was recognized by
the EBRD price liberalization index, in which Belarus was upgraded from 2.7 in 2008 to 3.0 in
2009 (for the first time since 2001) and further to 3.3 in 2010. While the reform agenda in this
area remains large, the operation supported highly significant and decisive steps toward market-
driven pricing. Second, there was significant progress in supporting privatization. The new legal
framework creates the basis for open, competitive and transparent privatization. The government
is committed to undertake further reforms efforts to liberalize prices and supporting privatization.
d) Strengthening incentives for private sector development
Strengthening incentives for private sector development is the one of the greatest development
challenges Belarus faces and is one area where Bank assistance can have substantial impact.
State regulations, particularly, with administrative procedures constrain the activities of
businesses, most severely those of private agents. The World Bank BEEPS survey in 2008
confirmed this appreciation as permits, licensing, inspections and tax administration were found
to be serious obstacles to business activity in Belarus:
         • Licensing. The survey found that licensing requirements covered 91% of medium-
             sized enterprises, 77% of small enterprises, and 74% of individual entrepreneurs. The
             average time spent by an SME on securing a license increased from 36 to 49 working



                                                14
            days between 2005 and 2008. According to IFC surveys, licensing coverage
            increased from 72.1% of SMEs in 2005 to 77.8% in 2008.
        •   Inspections. In 2008, 62% of SMEs and 53% of IEs were inspected at least once. On
            average, in 2008, 3.3 different inspection authorities paid visits to an SME during the
            course of scheduled inspections; in addition the authorities conducted 1.8
            unscheduled inspections were conducted. While the average duration of one
            inspection had dropped from 27 to 15 hours in the period between 2005 and 2008,
            surveys showed that lengthy inspections remained a major problem for SMEs.
        •   Tax burden. The average tax burden remained high. Tax revenue represented 48
            percent of GDP in 2008, well above most countries in the region and other
            comparable countries in the world.
The DPL supported government policy reforms that would ease the barriers to entry and
reduced the cost of doing business. The reform of the role of control and supervision activities
was to be achieved through the following policy actions introduced by two separate Presidential
Decrees: (i) reducing length of inspections for individual entrepreneurs from 30 to 15 working
days; (ii) reducing the number of bodies with the right to conduct inspections; (iii) reducing the
number of activities subject to licensing, (iv) reducing time to get a license from 30 to 15 days,
and (v) simplifying administrative procedures by implementing the law “On administrative
procedures”. Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus On Improving Control
(Supervision) Activity in the Republic of Belarus # 510 was enacted on October 16, 2009 to
reduce control burden on businesses and improve transparency and efficiency of control
activities. A new Presidential Decree 450 on Licensing of Certain Types of Economic Activities,
enacted on September 1, 2010 and coming into effect on January 1, 2011 envisages a number of
important improvements, such as reduction in the number of economic activities subject to
licensing requirements (from 53 to 37) and simplification of licensing procedures and
requirements. Although the reduced activities represent only 30 percent of total activities that
were subject to licensing, the number of issued licenses is expected to decline by about 60 percent
beginning in 2011. A large expected decline in the number of issued licenses is due to the
removal of licensing requirements for retail trade and catering that accounted for a significant
share of licensing.
Tax distortions and tax burden were decreased. The turnover tax was first reduced from 2
percent to 1 percent in 2009, and consequently completely eliminated in 2010. The average tax
burden declined from about 48 percent of GDP in 2008 to less than 40 percent in 2010, but it still
remains high relative to other comparable countries in the region. Remaining numerous tax
exemptions make the system unduly complex and unfriendly to investments and hamper private
sector development. The government continues to work on further tax simplification and
reduction of tax burden. Two key measures to further reduce tax distortions in the economy have
been achieved through the amendment of the Tax Code passed on October 15, 2010. They
include the elimination of two local levies: the local service tax of 5 percent on gross sales and
the local development fee of 3 percent on net corporate profit. Going forward, the provisions of
the Presidential Directive #4 and the Program of Socio-Economic Development for 2011-2015
envision notable fiscal policy changes, including gradual and fiscally prudent reduction in the tax
burden and move towards a modern tax system.
Overall, objectives in the reform area of reducing business regulations were met. The outcomes in
the reform are deemed to be satisfactory. The progress in reducing business regulations paved
the way for tackling other challenges. However, complex administrative hurdles continue to
punctuate the business climate in Belarus, hindering development of small business. A large
spectrum of reforms are still needed to enhance the competitiveness of the economy and attract




                                                15
quality FDI to Belarus with the aim to enable technology transfer, productivity enhancements,
export diversification, trade integration and facilitate private business growth.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The rating of the achievement of outcomes for the DPL is rated as satisfactory as all of them
were achieved either satisfactory or highly satisfactory, or in one case as moderately satisfactory.
With prior actions having been taken before the operation was approved by the Board, the
government demonstrated strong ownership of the program, and for some of them it was noted
that this DPL provided the critical push behind the reform program.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Due to the short period of implementation, it is difficult to attribute any specific impact on
poverty to this DPL. However, the feared impact of the crisis on poverty did not take place in part
because of the policies of the government that the international community, including the Bank
supported. Government policies supported under this DPL did not have any known
disproportionate gender impacts.
Overall poverty decreased in 2009 by 0.7 percentage points; however, the crisis had diverse
adverse effects on various groups and regions, especially the middle class. In 2009, the official
poverty rate was 5.4 percent - approximately half a million people still lived below the officially
determined poverty line. However, while the aggregate poverty rates actually decreased, select
population groups experienced increases in poverty. Poverty incidence has been reduced both in
urban and rural areas; however, rural poverty remains almost twice as higher than urban. Income
inequality has been increasing since 2005, but declined in 2009. In inequality remains low as
measured by Gini coefficient (0.27 in 2009), which is one of the lowest in the region and the
world.
The price liberalization in products and services, which are not on the list of socially important
goods and services, is expected to have had a marginal direct impact on poverty. While the
price liberalization has reduced the proportion of subsidies over the last 7 years, the share of the
goods and services controlled by the government is still significant. Price controlled products and
services of social importance (such as food, children related goods, utilities, communication and
health services) represented 41.5 percent of households’ consumption in 2009.
The distributional impact from the gradual increase in energy tariffs remains moderate. The
energy tariff increase in January 2009 had only a marginal effect on poverty and there were no
additional tariff increases in 2010 as the government continued its policy of linking tariff
increases to increases in salaries.
In the medium-term, price and regulatory reforms aimed at strengthening the incentives for
private sector development are expected to have an indirect positive impact on poverty reduction,
through creating an environment for sustainable growth.
There were no gender aspects to this operation.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The DPL operation contributed to a number of institutional changes:
      • An institutional framework to improve the targeting accuracy of social assistance
          system is in place. A Presidential Decree was adopted that (i) increased eligibility



                                                  16
            threshold for targeted social assistance program, (ii) extended the duration of the
            targeted social assistance from 3 months to 6 months; (iii) lengthened the period of
            verified income using the last 12 months of income rather than 3 months; (iv)
            integrated Housing and Utility allowance program in the targeted social assistance
            program; and (v) incorporated asset test in the eligibility criteria for targeted social
            assistance.
        •   Regulations on the control and supervision of businesses were streamlined. A
            Presidential Decree was adopted that (i) reduced length of inspections for individual
            entrepreneurs from 30 to 15 working days; (ii) reduced the number of bodies with the
            right to conduct inspections; (iii) reduced the number of activities subject to
            licensing, (iv) reduced time to get a license from 30 to 15 days.
        •   The DPL operation strengthened the process of consultations with relevant
            stakeholders on Government’s reform programs by holding discussions with
            business associations, organizing workshops and seminars with open participation on
            specific measures supported by this operation. Several government agencies and the
            presidential administration have put forth open internet forums to gather comments
            on the liberalization and economic reform program.
        •   Tax burden was reduced. The turnover tax was first reduced from 2% to 1% in 2009
            and the tax was completely eliminated in 2010.
        •   A refurbished privatization agenda has been launched. The government has
            adopted a law on privatization which establishes clear procedures for privatization of
            state enterprises in an open, competitive and transparent manner; and clarifies the
            division of power between different bodies involved in the privatization process.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Substantial
External imbalances and their financing remain the key macroeconomic concern. The external
environment remains challenging and as of early 2011 there is clearly a need for a second round
of macroeconomic adjustment, including both exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policies.
However, over the medium-term addressing Belarus’ external imbalances requires a structural
transformation of the state led economy. The measures supported by the DPL laid the foundation
for such a transformation to occur.
While the authorities have committed to deepen structural reforms under their new Five Year
Plan, the external environment in which these would be implemented has become considerably
less favorable. The government has drafted two key documents to support its medium-term
economic agenda: (i) The Program for Socio-Economic Development of the Republic of Belarus
for 2011-2015, discussed and endorsed at All-Belarusians Assembly on December 6-7, 2010, and
(ii) the Presidential Directive #4 on The Development of Entrepreneurial Initiative and
Stimulation of Business Activity in the Republic of Belarus (called “The Liberalization
Directive”, enacted on December 31st 2010). Both documents reflect an ambitious medium-term
reform agenda for structural transformation of the economy in response to the phasing out of
under-priced energy supplies, the international economic crisis, and intensified competition on
global markets.
In the aftermath of the presidential elections of December 2010, relations with Europe and the
USA cooled considerably, which may have increased the risks for investors and may
complicate raising external financing in the short term. Belarus faces immediate external
financing needs related to the large current account deficit which may be difficult to cover from


                                                17
commercial debt sources alone. The authorities thus face the need to deepen structural reforms to
attract strategic investors and FDI at a time when the prospects for support from official sources
are less certain. While this may give reform plans further impetus and momentum, there is also
the risk that earlier reform efforts are reversed as the authorities tighten administrative controls
over the economy,
Despite the strong performance under the DPL and persistent commitment of the authorities to
its objectives, the risks to development outcomes must be regarded as substantial. The Project
Appraisal Document rightly pointed to the DPL as a high risk operation. Given the uncertainty
over the future course of developments in Belarus, these risks remain.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Satisfactory
The decision of the Bank to reengage with Belarus was appropriate. However, discussions
about the best way to reengage resulted in delays at the start of the operation. There was a slight
delay in determining the best mechanism to reengage with Belarus since the original CAS neither
envisioned Development Policy Lending nor provided a sufficient lending envelope to support
this operation. Since this was the first DPL operation in Belarus, technical discussions with
Government counterparts to ensure appropriate implementation of agreed measures took longer
than anticipated. As a result, the lead time between the request for assistance and Board’s
approval of the program was longer than anticipated.
The decision to align the matrix to government program was appropriate and contributed to a
well-designed operation. The policy actions under the DPL covered the most important reforms
to mitigate the impact of the crisis and promote a stronger recovery. The design, however, was
prudent and therefore the DPL agenda was less ambitious in scope than the government’s reform
program.
The DPL Policy Matrix targeted key reform areas. It indicated the actions to be taken and how
success would be measured in the short run (including baseline values of the indicators). The
matrix also specified expectations regarding medium-term outcomes.
The decision to opt for a single DPL operation was appropriate. At the time of program
preparation, Belarus was in the middle of external adjustment in an uncertain external
environment. Given Belarus limited reform track record, there were risks that the medium-term
reform agenda might not be sustained, or be slower than anticipated.
Bank performance during preparation is rated satisfactory based on: (i) the difficult conditions
under which the operation was prepared, (ii) after clearing the logistical hurdles with the design
of operation the Bank team finalized the program document within 3 month period.
(b) Quality of Supervision
    Rating: Satisfactory
This operation was well supervised. The team possesses deep knowledge of the Belarus economy
as well as details of various reform agendas, processes of achieving them, and the history of the
reforms in each area. The co-TTL of operation was permanently stationed in Minsk and ensured
day-to-day engagement with relevant counterparts. In addition, the Government counterparts also
highly appreciated the opportunity to draw on and use effectively specialist advice from within
the Bank, as needed.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance was rated satisfactory on both dimensions, therefore, the Bank
performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The government coordinated the DPL design and implementation effectively. Government
agencies engaged in the DPL dialogue included various ministries (Ministry of Finance, Ministry
of Economy, Ministry of Taxes, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection), the Central Bank, and
the Presidential Administration. The Ministry of Economy effectively coordinated the
implementation of the program across the agencies and the Bank. All agencies worked effectively
with the Bank at all stages of the DPL operation. The counterparts were well-informed, engaged
in their respective areas and were at ease to provide updates on the reform progress and
outcomes. This engagement was supported by strong sense of ownership of and commitment to
the implementation of the reform program.
The implementation of the program was smooth. The opinion of the team is that there were no
shortcomings in government’s performance during the implementation. The performance of the
Government has been satisfactory.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The implementation agency, the ministry of Economy, provided competent coordination. The
ministry also showed a strong ownership of and commitment to the reform program. The overall
performance of the MoE was satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
    Rating: Satisfactory
The performance of the borrower was rated Satisfactory on both dimensions, therefore, the
overall rating is satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
Close alignment of the DPL with the Government reform program facilitates program
implementation. The DPL design accompanied the implementation of the government’s medium
term strategy that complimented the macroeconomic stabilization efforts. The design of the
program and the pace of implementation were driven by the authorities. The role of the DPL was
to help focus and track the commitment of the authorities. The actions supported under this DPL
represented a first step in strengthening the role of private sector in the economy. Through this
approach, the Bank can help inform the internal and external constituencies about the progress in
shifting the strategic direction and prospects of economic transformation in Belarus.
A single tranche DPL was the appropriate instrument to scale up engagement in Belarus
during the crisis. The transformation strategy of the government covered the medium term.
However, it was prudent for the DPL to focus on a shorter-time frame given the main priority of
the government was to manage the threats to macro-stability and the government past experience
with broad-based structural reforms was limited. It was also the first policy lending operation
ever in the country. The DPL strategy succeeded in helping bolster the credibility of authorities to
reform, even during a time of crisis.


                                                19
Strategic technical assistance and analytical support can help greatly with program design and
implementation. The quality of the DPL design benefited from the World Bank and IFC
analytical work and the technical assistance that had been undertaken in the previous years.
Although the technical assistance and the analytical works were small, they were well focused on
key priorities. A similar approach in the future will enhance the effectiveness of bank support to
Belarus.
Given the breath of the reform agenda in Belarus, the Bank should maintain a flexible
approach that accompanies the authorities in surmounting the reforms’ implementation
hurdles. Even in the context of a one-tranche DPL, the program implementation faced capacity
constraints in targeting social assistance. Looking forward, it is likely that the pace of
implementation would vary across areas. Hence, it is important that any future program focuses
on critical and thematic priorities, some of which linked to the reforms supported under this DPL.
Effective use of the strong complementarities between the IMF’s and Bank’s programs
improve the effectiveness of both. The government’s policy response supported by the IMF’s
SBA helped ease the most immediate pressures on the current account in the first half of 2009
and stabilize the economy to achieve better growth outcomes. By relying on the IMF support for
macro-stabilization, the Bank’s operation could focus on complementing these efforts through the
implementation of the first steps of a structural reform agenda that over the medium term will
strengthen the role of private sector and external competitiveness of Belarus economy. The ability
to focus on structural reform in turn will serve to address the external imbalances over the
medium term, as an exclusive focus on short-term monetary policy instruments alone may not be
sufficient.

World Bank Representative in Belarus
Mr. Ivan Velev


Dear Mr. Velev:

        The Ministry of Economy, jointly with other government bodies concerned, has
considered the Implementation Completion and Results Report prepared by World Bank experts
on the first Development Policy Loan extended by the Bank to the Republic of Belarus in 2009 to
support the medium-term agenda of the Government’s program of social and economic reforms.

        The conclusions reflected in the Report in general show that the Republic of Belarus has
complied with its commitments to implement the measures of social and economic policies
specified in the DPL Program Matrix. It should be also noted that there are some comments to the
Report prepared by government bodies concerned (attached).

       We find that the Report can be disclosed after it has been considered by the World Bank’s
Board of Directors.

                                           Sincerely yours,



                                           Deputy Minister
                                            A.V. Filonov




                                              25
       Pillar I: Addressing the Impact of the Economic Slowdown and Reforms by
Strengthening the System of Social Assistance

        Changes of the poverty rate in 2009 compared to 2008 for certain population groups and
by regions need revising (para three on page 2, para three on page 14, and para four on page 20
[of the Russian version, in English - para two on page 2, para three on page 11, and para three on
page 16]). According to the data of the National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus,
the poverty rate increased only in Minsk (by 0.3 percentage points). No poverty rate increase was
observed in other regions of the country. Besides, the poverty rate of families with two children
went down by 2.2 percentage points – not increased, as mentioned in the draft Report.

        In the column “Comments”, Table 2.1, prior condition # 4 “Restrictions on retail trade
margins for domestic and imported goods are removed, except for a limited and closed list of
social goods and goods subject to monopoly power”, Law of the Republic of Belarus # 239-
dated January 6, 1999 On Minimum Subsistence Budget in the Republic of Belarus and
Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus # 1016 dated September 13,
2005 On approval of the average subsistence level per capita and for main social and
demographic groups and provisions for the procedure for preparation and calculation of the
subsistence budget should be deleted as these regulatory legal acts do not regulated pricing issues.

        The amount of budget allocations for targeted social assistance of BYR 97 billion
specified in the report was the planned amount for 2010. According for the actual data for 11
months of 2010, owing to the poverty rate decline, the amount of targeted social assistance
needed was BYR 48 billion. Based on the declarative principle of its provision and the actual
poverty rate, which went down during 2010, the state targeted social assistance was granted to
158 thousand people.

        Pillar II: Laying the Foundations for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Growth by
Enabling Private Sector Entry and Competitiveness through Liberalization and Financial
Discipline

        Item a) Strengthening financial discipline through hard budget constraints

          1. Since the term “state support” is currently regulated only by Decree of the President of
the Republic of Belarus # 182 dated March 28, 2006 stipulating its provision on a case-by-case
basis, it deems expedient to specify in pillar II, subitem 3.2, section 3 of the draft Report the exact
composition of budget subsidies taken into account by the World Bank when assessing the
amount of expenditures of the Republic of Belarus on state support of the economy.
          For example, according to the data of the single state register of legal entities and
individual entrepreneurs, who have benefited from state support, the volume of state support is
assessed as 1.5-1.7 percent of GDP for the period of 2008-2009 compared to 2.0 percent of GDP
for 2004-2007.

        Item b) Strengthening financial discipline through energy efficiency

        2. In the section related to the policy of reducing energy intensity:


                                                  26
        the word “1990-s” should be replaced with the word “1990”;
        the figure “0.76” should be replaced with the figure “0.78”;
        the figure “0.35” should be replaced with the figure “0.34”;
        the figure “8.4” should be replaced with the figure “9.1”

       the words “Ministry of Energy” should be replaced with the words “Department of
Energy Efficiency of Gosstandart jointly with the parties concerned”.

        Item d) Strengthening incentives for private sector development

        1. The following taxes and fees were abolished in the Republic of Belarus: the fee paid to
the Republican Agricultural Producer Support Fund (a turnover tax), the local tax on retail sales
of goods – from January 1, 2010; the local tax on services – from January 1, 2011. Thus, no
turnover taxes exist in the country as of January 1, 2011.
        Based on the abovementioned facts, we propose to delete the words “remaining turnover
taxes” from the paragraph about tax burden in subitem d), pillar II, section 3 Assessment of
Outcomes.

        We also propose to add the following paragraph to the section on tax burden reduction:
        “The Government continues its efforts in the area of the tax system simplification and tax
burden reduction. Effective as of January 1, 2011, all taxes specific to the tax system of the
Republic of Belarus will be cancelled. Judging by the number of applicable taxes, the system will
be made consistent with the standards of developed countries, due to which the Republic of
Belarus will ensure further tax burden reduction.”
