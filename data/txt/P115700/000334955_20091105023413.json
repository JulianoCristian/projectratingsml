at addressing the social\n            impact of the crisis, while advancing the structural reforms\n            to foster economic recovery. The reforms supported by this\n            operation aim at strengthening social assistance programs to\n            function better as a cushion to protect the poorest and\n            those vulnerable to fall into poverty due to the economic\n            slowdown and future reforms. Moreover, this operation\n            supports a significant structural reform agenda aimed at\n            unlocking new sources of recovery and medium term growth,\n            particularly through further price liberalization, reducing\n            the costs of entry for new businesses, reducing regulatory\n            and administrative costs of operation for the private\n            sector, reducing subsidies, and eliminating inefficient\n            taxes. At the same time, it supports initial steps in\n            setting the legal and institutional basis for an adequate\n            and transparent privatization process."}, "docdt": "2009-10-22T00:00:00Z"}
