Some lessons learned included: the\n            Borrower's capacity to absorb reforms should be\n            estimated more carefully: it is no use to build a project\n            with impressive objectives if these objectives cannot be\n            achieved. Objectives should be limited in number, simple and\n            consistent, and formulated in similar terms in all\n            documents, and implementation timetables should be\n            realistic. Special attention should be paid to sustaining\n            internalization of sector reforms when frequent changes of\n            staff in the administration occur. Legal work should be more\n            substantial in preparation, appraisal, and operations and\n            follow-up. Especially with regard to the relation to be\n            established and maintained, through adequate legal\n            arrangements, between the strategy letter and the work plan\n            for project execution."}, "docdt": "1997-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
