improving urban services; b) improve incomes and living\n            conditions of low income groups in urban areas; c) improve\n            the ability of the national and local governments to sustain\n            urban services over time by establishing improved systems\n            for financing and managing urban services; d) contribute to\n            sustainable municipal development through environmental\n            improvement and protection. The project consists of two main\n            components: i) priority urban works, including minimum\n            infrastructure for small municipalities; pilot operations in\n            squatter settlements to be developed into a rehabilitation\n            program for low-income areas; revenue-earning investments\n            (markets, bus terminals etc); and ii) municipal capacity\n            building, through training and support to Mission\n            d'Appui a la Conduite d'Operations Municipales\n            (MACOM); improvement of the mobilization of local resources;\n            and support to the informal sector."}, "docdt": "1995-03-17T00:00:00Z"}
