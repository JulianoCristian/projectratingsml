The key lessons learned from\n            these projects include: 1) Financing by the Bank and other\n            donors to restructure/capitalize state banks may have\n            postponed unavoidable reforms and increased the cost of\n            reforming the financial sector. 2) The use of\n            foreign-financed consultants to act as line managers delayed\n            rather than accelerated reforms, especially to the civil\n            service. 3) The amount and timing of financing was not\n            proportional to the Government's commitment to reform.\n            4) Sector-wide reforms should be targeted directly rather\n            than as an appendix of Structural Adjustment Credit."}, "docdt": "1999-03-16T00:00:00Z"}
