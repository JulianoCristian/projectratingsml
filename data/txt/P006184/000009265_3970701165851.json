          Program Project for Bolivia were as follows: the overall\n            outcome of the program is satisfactory. The despite the\n            successes, the fiscal balance and balance of payments remain\n            fragile. The Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Social sector\n            and direct poverty related issues should be dealt with\n            directly-i.e., either through a carefully designed\n            sub-program or through separate sectoral operations-and not\n            included as marginal elements in a structural adjustment\n            program. Minor actions do not contribute to resolve the\n            structural problems of the social sectors and detract the\n            focus on the other key sectors included in the program. To\n            avoid delays in the implementation and allow for greater\n            focus, technical assistance supporting a structural\n            adjustment program should be handled through a separate\n            operation that is prepared in advance and implemented in\n            parallel. Furthermore, sufficient institutional capacity\n            needs to be developed through such technical assistance to\n            implement the program in a timely manner."}, "docdt": "1996-11-12T00:00:00Z"}
