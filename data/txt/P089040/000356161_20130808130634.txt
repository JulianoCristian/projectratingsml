Afghanistan’s ability to enhance its human capital resources will determine the course of
the nation’s future economic, human and social development. Recognizing this, the
Government of Afghanistan is committed to implementing policies aimed at getting
children, particularly girls, into the education system. This paper aims to inform this
process by investigating a variety of characteristics of children, such as their households,
educational facilities, community factors, and spatial variables that are associated with
education enrollment in urban and rural Afghanistan.

                              COUNTRY CONTEXT

The country has an acute shortage of human capital resources (World Bank, 2013). This
is evident from the fact that 78 percent of employed Afghans between the ages of 16 and
60 have not been to school. In 2007/08, 57 per cent of employed men and 86 per cent of
employed women in urban areas had no schooling (NRVA, 2007/08). The situation in
rural Afghanistan was much worse: there, nearly three-fourths of employed men, and
almost all employed women, had not been to school. In the entire population of employed
Afghans, only 4 per cent had completed primary school, only 2 per cent had completed
middle school, and only 5 percent counted at least 12 years of schooling.

School enrollment is a key indicator of a country’s progress in developing its human
capital. As Figure 1 indicates, Afghanistan school enrollment rates are low even in
comparison to other conflict- affected regions. Figure 2 illustrates the extent of the
problem as it plots age-specific enrollment rates of boys and girls in 2007/08. Enrollment
rates for boys range from 15 per cent of 6 year olds to 42 per cent of 18 year olds,
peaking at 71 per cent in the 11-12 age range. Girls’ enrollment is everywhere lower,
from 11 per cent of 6 year olds to 17 per cent of 18 year olds, with a peak of 50 per cent
at 11 years of age. The inverted U-shaped curves of the plots with higher rates in the
middle of the age-range, likely reflect the movement through the system of the cohort
enrolled in the ‘significant leap’ of the first two years following reconstruction in
Afghanistan in 2002 (Miwa, 2005).

There appears to be significant leakage from the system which gathers momentum over
the school cycle. This is evident in Figure 3 which plots grade-specific net completion
rates. Only 27 per cent of six year old boys complete that grade, and this figure drops to 6
per cent at 17 years of age. It is much worse for girls. Only 20 per cent of six year old
girls complete the grade, while only 2 per cent reach the finishing line at 17 years of age.
Figure 4 sets out the ratios of gender-specific enrollment and net completion rates. Boys’
enrollment rates are 1.5 times girls’ enrollment rates at primary and lower secondary
levels, rising to more than twice the female enrollment rate at the end of the school cycle.
Gender differentials become even more starkly apparent when we look at the ratios
between boys’ and girls’ net completion rates.

This paper aims to investigate the factors underlying these low school enrollment figures
and is structured as follows. Section 1 reviews previous research in this area. Section 2
provides a brief description the data and the methodology used in this analysis. In Section
3 we present the results which are then discussed in Section 4.

                         REVIEWING THE LITERATURE

There are few studies that investigate the factors associated with school enrollment in
Afghanistan. Some these are econometric analyses (Rashid, 2005; Guimbert et al., 2008;
and Aturupane, Gunatilaka, Shojo and Ebenezer, 2013) and others are qualitative
investigations. Hunte , 2006 and Rashid, 2005 used the National Risk and Vulnerability
Assessment (NRVA) Survey data of 2003 while Guimbert et al., 2008 also used NRVA
2003 data but combined it with data from the School Census of 2004 and the Public
Expenditure Tracking Survey of 2004/05. Hunte, 2006 used qualitative methods and the
material from four case studies (two in in the cities of Kabul and Kandahar and two in
villages in the provinces of Kabul and Faryab) to explore the complexities surrounding
the issue of household decision-making about enrollment. In terms of supply-side factors
affecting school enrollment, these studies suggest that:

 1)    The availability and quality of schools was found to be an important driver of
 enrollment and (Guimbert et al., 2008); In fact, among the reasons given for non-
 enrollment in the NRVA 2003, non-availability of a school accounted for 30 per cent of


                                                  5
cases and the availability of secondary schools was found to have some impact on
primary enrollment. Proximity was another important factor

2)      The quality of teaching was also found to be important. A high proportion of
contract teachers reduced the likelihood of enrollment, a higher pass rate in the district
increased the probability of enrollment and a high proportion of female teachers
increased the likelihood of enrollment while the proportion of male-only schools had
little impact. Enrollment was found to be higher for schools not operated by the
government.

In terms of demand side factors, these studies indicate that:

1)      Age and gender were strongly associated with the probability of being enrolled,
with children in the age 7 to 11 age group, and boys, more likely to be in school than
older children and girls (Guimbert et al., 2008). They found that being a boy increases
the likelihood of going to school by almost 40 per cent.

2)     Size of the household also was a significant factor: children in large households
had significantly lower probability of enrollment but household expenditure was not
strongly correlated with enrollment. For example, Hunte, 2006 found that many
extremely poor households continue to place high expectations on education as a way
out of poverty and, rather than require their children to work, they send boys (and to a
lesser degree, girls) to school in the hope of a better future. But she also cautioned that
while parents may want to educate both sons and daughters, they may be constrained by
a combination of poverty (which inhibits the enrollment of both boys and girls) and their
fear of negative social pressure (specifically in relation to girls’ enrollment). As a result,
some but not all boys in a household may go to school, while girls are not enrolled at all
or stop going to school with the onset of puberty (Hunte, 2006).

3)    Parents are the primary decisions makers in the enrollment process with input from
grandparents and the child’s older brother (Hunte, 2006). In general, those households
which enroll all of their children (boys and girls) in school appear to have comparatively
more egalitarian relations between members. This is in contrast to another conflict-
affected society, Somaliland, where the mother’s decision-making was found to be
highly predictive of girls’ schooling (Viswanathan, 2006).

4)    Disability was negatively associated with enrollment (Guimbert et al., 2008)

5)    Working children were also less likely to go to school. (Guimbert et al., 2008).

6)      The children of literate parents were more likely to go to school and community
factors were also found to be important. For example, the probability of enrollment was
lower in the Western region and higher in the Eastern and Southern regions, and Pashto
speakers were less likely to be enrolled than Dari speakers. (Hunte, 2006) also noted that
households tend to copy their neighbors’ enrollment decisions.



                                             6
7) Insecurity was negatively associated with enrollment as households that experienced
a security incident were 9 per cent less likely to send their primary aged children to
school than households which had not, other things being equal (Guimbert et al., 2008).
But insecurity did not appear to be associated with less likelihood of girls enrolling rather
than boys. This is contrast to Tajikistan, for instance, where exposure to conflict had a
large significant negative effect on the enrollment of girls, and little, or no, effect on
enrollment of boys (Shemyakina, 2011). In post-conflict Mozambique, too, conflict-
exposure during the first seven years of life was found to be negatively associated with a
lower probability of enrollment for girls, not boys, and this result was related to the
choices that the household made during the conflict years (Domingues, 2011). But
Guimbert et al. (2008) found that in Afghanistan, insecurity did not have a significantly
negative effect on girls’ secondary enrollment, even though it was associated with
marginally higher enrollment for the entire sample.

8)      Migration was found to be a factor in qualitative study but not in the econometric
analysis. Hunte (2006) found that Afghan refugees returning home have greater
aspirations for their children’s education, having observed the benefits of education in
Pakistan and Iran. This appears to have been the experience in some other conflict-
affected countries too, for example in Somaliland (Viswanathan, 2006). But Guimbert et
al.’s (2008) econometric analysis found migration having little impact on enrollment in
Afghanistan.

In this paper we investigate use the most recent NRVA household survey (2007) data set
to investigate the association of these and other factors with the enrollment of girls and
boys in rural and urban Afghanistan.

              DATA AND METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY

Data

This analysis is based on data from the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment
(NRVA) Survey of 2007/08. This comprehensive household survey collected information
on demography, consumption expenditure, education, maternal and child health,
employment, household and community-based infrastructure. The survey instruments
also included several questions related to certain cultural practices and the respondents’
perceptions. The sample of 20,576 households was drawn from 2,572 communities in all
34 provinces of all Afghanistan and was designed to be representative at the province
level for most key indicators. The survey took place over a 12 month period from
September 2007 through August 2008 to capture the effects of seasonality unlike its
predecessors, the NRVAs of 2003 and 2005.

The NRVA 2007/08 includes four key instruments: a men’s questionnaire, a women’s
questionnaire and two community questionnaires, one for male community leaders and
the other for female community leaders. While the quality of household-level information
related to demography, consumption expenditure of households and educational
attainment of individuals was good, there was a very high non-response rate for several
                                             7
key education facilities-related variables at the community level. For example, the
community questionnaire included questions about the availability of schools by type,
distance and source of funding, as well as about the number of male and female teachers
in the community, but the response rate for most of these variables was around 20-30 per
cent. Hence in looking at supply-side factors, we had to confine ourselves to only a few
variables. Nevertheless, the survey instrument also included some questions about
household decision-making concerning enrollment which enabled us to investigate
econometrically some of the issues raised by Hunte (2006), although parents’ attitudes
about children’s education have not been elicited in this survey, unlike the NRVA of
2003 which Guimbert et al. (2008) used. Moreover, the 2007/08 questionnaire also
included some questions on cultural practices which we used as proxies for the extent to
which some cultural factors are associated with the probability of enrollment.
Investigating these influences is particularly important as cultural notions that education
is ‘unnecessary’ or ‘harmful’ for girls in particular are fairly widely prevalent, and have
been leveraged by political groups for their own advantage (World Bank, 2005).

Methodology and Variables

The conceptual framework used for the econometric analysis follows Guimbert et al.’s
(2008) previous analysis in comparing the demand and supply-side factors associated
children attending school. The model is based on the relationships between school
enrollment and demand and supply-side factors that have emerged from the theoretical
and empirical literature as follows:
                                  E  f  C, H , S , R  .                  (1)

The binary dependent outcome E takes the value one if the individual is enrolled in
school and zero if he or she is not. C is a vector of child characteristics, H a vector of
household characteristics, S a vector of school characteristics and R a vector of
community and spatial characteristics. It should be noted that the model does not address
the issue of causality and only seeks to identify the variables associated with school
enrollment.

Equation (1) is a reduced form equation in which some key variables influencing
enrollment outcomes are absent: for example, school inputs under the parents’ control,
such as school attendance and purchase of stationery, and other child characteristics that
may be unobservable. Some of the omitted variables may also be correlated with the error
term.

While Guimbert et al. (2008) adopt the probit model as their standard specification, with
logit and linear probability model specifications used for robustness tests, in this paper
we adopt the logit model as the standard specification. This is because Stata’s estimation
commands that adjust for sample design do not produce goodness of fit tests, whereas
Archer and Lemeshow’s (2006) user-written program, svylogitgof.ado, can be deployed
to perform a F-adjusted mean residual test to measure goodness of fit after fitting a
logistic regression model to survey data.

Primary education in Afghanistan consists of Grades 1-6 from age 7-12, mid or lower
secondary school consists of Grades 7-9 from age 13-15 and high or senior secondary
school consists of Grades 10-12 from age 16-18. Hence, equation (1) is estimated over 12
sub-samples related to enrollment type (primary, mid and high school enrollment of
children in the relevant age groups), gender and sector of residence (urban or rural). Our
main variables are as follows:

Child Characteristics
Among the child characteristics considered, apart from the usual demographic
characteristics such as age, we were able to include variables denoting two levels of
disability, mild and severe; whether the child was employed; and, how many hours he or
she spent on household chores the previous week.

Group Variables
Of the group of variables denoting household characteristics, we included per capita
household consumption expenditure which had been adjusted for spatial and temporal
differences. This was exactly the same data used for the World Bank’s (2010) Poverty
Status in Afghanistan, and details about how the data was adjusted can be found in that
report. The impact of conflict was captured by a dummy variable which took one if the
household had suffered a security-related shock last year. To represent the impact of
inter-generational schooling, both mother’s and father’s years of education were included
in the model. To control for the impact of cultural factors, we included dummy variables
denoting whether the child’s mother was usually accompanied when she left the family
compound, and whether she wore a burka outside the home. Some aspects of the nature
of household decision-making about enrollment, highlighted by Hunte (2006) were
captured by variables that took the value one if the decision about boys’ or girls’
education was taken by the principal female of the household, or the principal male
member of the household, who need not necessarily have been the child’s parent. The
reference category includes consultative decision-making that ranges from including just
the spouse of the principal male or female member in making the decision, through
consultation with the child concerned, to consultation with male members of the family
or the decision being made by non-family members. Matching the data used for the
construction of the two variables with the child’s own parents’ data would have resulted
in the loss of too many observations, hence we opted to maintain the representativeness
of the variable and hence of the sample. It should be noted that other studies that have
looked at the impact of the nature of household decision-making have expressed the
variable as a dummy variable that takes one if the mother has sole decision-making
responsibility rather than sharing decision-making with someone else (for example, see
Upadhyay and Hindin, 2005 and Viswanathan, 2006). However, given the patriarchal and
traditional nature of Afghan society, we thought that it would be more interesting to look
at the extent to which sole decision-making responsibility by both men and women in the
household was correlated with the enrollment of girls and boys separately. Hence we
constructed the variables accordingly.

Supply-side variables
The only variables relating to supply side factors available in the survey at relatively high
non-missing frequencies were those related to the availability of a boys’ only school,
girls’ only school, co-educational school and madrassa in the community. Among
community variables considered, topographic variables were included in the model
estimated on the rural sample as variation in terrain characteristics were mainly in rural
areas, the towns locating mainly in plains, and also because terrain has been found to be
highly correlated with poverty in Afghanistan (World Bank, 2010). We also controlled
for accessibility and connectivity by including variables on the distance to the nearest
road, and a dummy variable to indicate whether the road was passable all year. Since the
World Bank’s (2010) poverty assessment suggested that the level of economic prosperity
of the community as denoted by the proportion of bad jobs (casual laborer, self-
employment and family work) and the share of underemployed (working less than 35
hours a week) among the employed were important correlates of poverty, we included
these variables in the models to see their impact on enrollment. Finally, we included
province dummies to capture the effect of regional fixed effects not captured by the other
spatial variables.

The results of the econometric analysis of the factors associated with primary, mid and
high school enrollment of girls and boys in rural and urban Afghanistan are presented in
the next section.

                            RESULTS AND FINDINGS

We will focus here on explaining the results pertaining primary school enrolment in some
detail. We have discussed middle school and high school results when they differ from
the results of our primary school analysis.

Factors Associated with Primary Enrollment

Table A.1 sets out the marginal effects of the logistic estimation of factors associated
with the probability of being enrolled in primary school for children between 6 and 12
years of age. The first two columns set out the means or proportions of the explanatory
variables relating to the sub-samples of boys and girls in the sample as a whole, and the
remaining columns set out the results of the estimation for the urban and rural sub-
samples. Results of the F-adjusted mean residual test suggests that the four specifications
explain the variation in the probability of enrollment of the sub-samples quite well.
The following factors that appear to be most strongly and significantly associated with
the probability of enrollment: 1) The two age-related variables; 2) The variables related to
disability; 3) Child labor; 4) Who makes the decisions about children’s education; 5) The
level of economic prosperity in the community; and 6) Regional variables. Of these
factors, however, the level of economic prosperity in the community as measured by the
proportion of bad jobs appears to be the single most important factor as its marginal
effects in all the equations are much larger than those of any of the others. All of the



                                             10
above are demand-side factors and supply side variables, while significant, together
account for much less of the variation in school enrollment.

There also appear to be important rural and urban differences in the association of these
key factors with the dependent variable. For example, household per capita expenditure is
positively correlated with the probability of enrollment but impact is largest and most
significant in urban areas. On the other hand, the negative impact of child labor is also
most pronounced in urban areas, and is likely to reflect the opportunity cost of going to
school in terms of foregone household income. Severe disability appears to constrain
boys’ access more than girls’ access. Sole decision-making about children’s education by
the principal female member of the household appears to be more strongly correlated
with the probability of enrollment than sole decision-making by the principal male
member. But note that the impact of sole female decision-making is much higher in rural
areas rather than in urban areas and on girls’ likelihood of participation than boys’
likelihood.

The regional variables are by and large significant across the board, but there are
important differences among provinces. Girls and boys in the south, west, and southwest
regions are less likely to participate in primary education than children in Afghanistan’s
central region. Those in the southwest region, in particular seem much disadvantaged as
all the marginal effects are negative, large and significant. However, while children in the
west central region are more likely to be enrolled than those in the central region, girls in
the west and the north east appear to have a higher probability of being enrolled than
boys in the same provinces.

The marginal effects of the age-related variables are note-worthy. Together they tell us
that the probability of enrollment rises but at a decelerating rate as age rises. This is
reflected in the inverted U of the plot on enrollment in 2 and confirms that the significant
leap in enrollment which began with reconstruction has not been sustained.
We turn next to some of the other variables that appear to be significantly correlated with
the probability of enrollment although their impacts appear to be relatively smaller. Of
particular interest is the impact of parental educational attainment on the probability of
enrollment. These two variables appear to be significantly correlated (at the 1 per cent
critical level) with the probability of enrollment across all four equations, but note that
mother’s education always has a bigger impact than the father’s level of education, and
that it is more for girls’ enrollment rather than boys’ enrollment. Thus, the results show
that while parental education is important, mother’s education is the more important,
particularly for girls’ enrollment.

The impacts of cultural factors are also interesting. It appears that the mother usually
wearing a burka outside the compound is positively correlated with child enrollment
although only the results for urban boys and rural girls are significant. It is possible that if
the mother wears a burka she has greater freedom of movement outside the home and is
able to take her children to school and bring them back herself, which increases their
chances of enrollment. On the other hand, having to be accompanied by somebody else
when she leaves the compound is significantly and negatively associated with girls’


                                              11
enrollment in urban areas and positively and significantly associated with girls’
enrollment rural areas. It is possible that it is more difficult to find people to accompany
one in busier urban areas hence the mother is not able to accompany her daughters to
school in urban areas. In contrast, in rural areas, it may be easier to find people to
accompany oneself, and safer to do so as well. Hence girls’ chances of participating in
school appear to be greater in rural areas if the mother is always accompanied when she
leaves the compound.

The impact of an insecurity or violence-related shock on the probability of schooling is
negative across all four equations, but significant only for rural girls. These results are in
line with Guimbert et al.’s (2008) findings for Afghanistan in 2003. Although
Afghanistan is a conflict-affected country, the impact of conflict on the probability of
children’s education does not appear to be as important as the impact of many other
variables, although it is likely to have an impact on other variables associated with
enrollment, for example, by affecting the economic prosperity of communities.

The signs of the accessibility variables in the rural samples are counter-intuitive and hard
to interpret. The results show that in urban areas, the sign of the marginal effect of the
variable is as expected with the probability of enrollment declining as distance increases.
But in rural areas, the probability of enrollment increases as distance from the nearest
road increases. It is possible that if the model included variables denoting distance from
the nearest educational facility, we would obtain more meaningful results for the rural
sample as well. However, the poor quality of the relevant data in the survey precluded our
including that information in our model as well.

Factors Associated with Enrollment in Middle School

Table A.2 sets out the marginal effects of the logistic regressions which looks at the
extent to which much the same factors investigated in the analysis of primary education,
are associated with the probability of children in the relevant age group being enrolled in
mid or lower secondary school. The four equations on the four subsamples differentiated
by gender and location appear to explain variation in the dependent variable quite well as
they all pass the goodness of fit test.

The key factors found to be associated with the probability of primary enrollment also
appear to be at play in determining the probability of enrollment in mid-school.
Community-level economic development and regional factors appear all important. The
average proportion of bad jobs in the community has the largest and most significant,
negative association with enrollment from among all the explanatory variables. Girls and
boys in urban and rural areas in the north, west and southwest are significantly less likely
to be attending mid-school than children in the central region. Children in the south are
also less likely to be attending mid-school but the results are significant only for rural
girls. In contrast, both girls and boys in urban and rural areas in the west central region
are more likely to be attending school than children in the central region, although the
result for boys in urban areas is not significant. Boys and girls in rural areas in the north
east, however, are more likely to be attending school than those in the central region.


                                             12
The next most important variable associated with the probability of enrollment is
disability, as in the primary school enrollment analysis. But here we are on the downward
slope of the inverted U- shaped curve apparent in Figure2, and the econometric results
confirm that the probability on enrollment declines as the child’s age increases: the
leakage from the system begins here. Household per capita expenditure and child
employment also behave in much the same way. But note that involvement in household
chores is negatively and significantly associated with the enrollment of rural girls.
Experiencing a security-related shock the previous year has little significant impact on
mid-school enrollment and it should be recalled that Guimbert et al. (2008) found much
the same in relation to secondary school enrollment in 2003. Mother’s years of education
continues to be more positively correlated with the probability of children’s enrollment in
mid-school than father’s education other than in the case of rural boys where mother’s
education has a negative but not statistically significant impact but father’s years of
education has a positive impact. Sole decision-making power over enrollment by the
principal male member of the household has a significantly positive effect only on the
enrollment of boys and girls in rural areas, whereas sole decision-making power by the
principal female member of the household has a much larger positive impact on
children’s education, particularly on the enrollment of girls. The availability of
appropriate schools in the community is also positively and significantly associated with
the probability of enrollment, but here too, the demand-side factors appear to have greater
explanatory power in the equation.

Factors Associated with Enrollment in High School

Table A.3 sets out the results of the logistic regression analyses investigating the factors
associated with the probability of young people between the ages of 16 and 18 attending
high school. All the equations except the last one pertaining to the enrollment of rural
girls in high school pass the goodness of fit test.

Here too, the same variables found to be highly correlated with the probability of primary
and mid-school enrollment, appear significantly correlated with the probability of high
school enrollment. But there are interesting differences. The impact of employment on
employment is larger and significant across the board. The negative impact of household
per capita expenditure on high school enrollment is also much larger, suggesting that the
opportunity cost of foregone earnings in household income is much higher at this age and
stage of the education cycle. Exposure to conflict appears to have little impact on the
probability of high school enrollment.

Sole decision-making over education by the principal male household member is
correlated significantly only with the enrollment of girls in urban areas. In contrast, sole
decision-making about education by the principal female member of the household has a
little less than twice as large an impact, and highly significant in the equations related to
the probability of enrollment of urban boys and rural girls. Unlike in the case of primary
and mid-school enrollment, neither of the decision-making variables is significantly
correlated with boys’ enrollment in rural areas.



                                             13
Father’s years of education appear more significantly correlated with the probability of
boys and girls attending high school in urban areas, and its impact is even greater than
that of mother’s years of education for urban boys. But the size of the marginal effect of
mother’s years of education on the probability of girls participating in education, whether
in rural or urban areas, is much larger. The impacts of variables denoting cultural
background of household are interesting. The mother having to wear a burka and having
to be accompanied when outside the compound are significantly and negatively
correlated with the probability of enrollment of girls in urban areas. It is possible that in
urban areas, negative social pressure may be preventing girls from participating in school
after puberty if their cultural background is more traditional, as Hunte (2006) points out.
But the mother wearing a burka is significantly associated with a greater probability of
rural girls and urban boys attending high school. It is not immediately clear why this may
be so.

In comparison with these demand-driven factors, supply-side factors are not significantly
correlated with the probability of high school enrollment other than in the case of rural
girls whose likelihood of participation is positively and significantly associated with the
availability of a girls’ only high school.

Thus the findings of this study, too, confirm those of Guimbert et al. (2008) and Hunte
(2006) that conclude that demand-side factors appear to be more important in
Afghanistan.

                                    CONCLUSION

Our results confirm that demand-side factors appear to be more important in Afghanistan.
In fact this study found that while the availability of appropriate schools is significantly
correlated with primary and mid-school enrollment, they have a significant impact only
on the enrollment of rural girls in high school.

In particular, the mix of explanatory variables we have been able to include in our
models and the results obtained reinforce the observation that, while parents may want to
educate both sons and daughters, they may be constrained by a combination of poverty
and their fear of negative social pressure. The analysis in this paper found that economic
factors such as the economic backwardness of the community families live in, and their
level of economic welfare as denoted by consumption expenditure were the most
important correlates of the probability of enrollment. These two factors likely combine
with the opportunities available for child labor in the community, and so affect the
opportunity costs of sending children to school. It is apparent that these choices become
more acute as the child grows older, and his or her income-earning capacity increases.

While children of more educated parents, particularly of better-educated mothers, are
more likely to go to school, whether they actually do crucially depends on the economic
situation the household is in. Moreover, while sole decision-making, by either the female
or male principal member of the household about the education of boys and girls
increases the chances of enrollment, relative to a more consultative decision-making

                                             14
process, decision-making solely by the principal female member has a greater impact,
particularly on the enrollment of girls. Less consultative decision-making such as this,
either by the principal male or female member of the household, is likely to be closely
influenced by immediate family circumstances rather than with the opinions of others
who may not be as preoccupied with the cost constraints, both in terms of parental inputs
and children’s foregone earnings and help with household chores, perhaps freeing up
older members to go out to work, that face the household.

Right now, Afghanistan appears to be in a paradoxical situation: while education and
better human capital needs to power economic growth, incomes need to expand to ease
the constraints on education enrollment that are currently imposed by economic
backwardness. To break out of this circle of constraints against enrollment, policy makers
need to aggressively pursue policies that concentrate on easing the economic costs to
households of children attending school, while enhancing the supply and quality of the
facilities provided.

Notes:
1. Dependent variable is the probability of being enrolled in primary school. Boys: mean 0.62, standard deviation 0.005. Girls: mean 0.41, standard deviation 0.005
2. The omitted categories in the dummy variable analyses are: consultative decision-making that ranges from including just the spouse of the principal male or female member in making the
decision, through consultation with the child concerned, to consultation with male members of the family or the decision being made by non-family members; plain; Central.
3 ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the one per cent, five per cent and ten per cent levels respectively.
4. The F-adjusted mean residual test measures goodness of fit after fitting a logistic regression model to survey data. Archer and Lemeshow’s user-written Stata program svylogitgof.ado was
used to generate the test results. See Archer and Lemeshow (2006), ‘Goodness-of-fit test for a logistic regression model fitted using sample survey data’, in Stata Journal, 6 (1), pp. 97-105.
5. Estimated using NRVA 2007/08 data, individual weights used.
