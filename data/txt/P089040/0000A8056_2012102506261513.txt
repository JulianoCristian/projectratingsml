                         The development objective of the program is to progressively restore basic operational performance at a group of core universities in Afghanistan, which will provide an
                         institutional base for an agenda focusing on tertiary education development, capacity building and reform.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         SHEP is the first major higher education investment in Afghanistan by the World Bank. SHEP commenced operation in June 2005 with a grant of USD 40 million. Originally the
                         project supporting six universities (Kabul, Balkh, Herat, Kandahar, Nangrahar, and Kabul Polytechnic), mainly in the areas of staff development, curriculum development,
                         development of physical infrastructure and the improvement of equipment. In June 2008 SHEP received a contribution of US$5 million from the ARTF to increase support for four
                         universities (Nangrahar, Balkh, Kandahar and Kabul Polytechnic), chiefly to expand physical infrastructure and the provision of equipment. In June 2010, SHEP received additional
                         financing of USD 20 million from the IDA Crisis Response Window(CRW) to expand activities and cover six additional universities: Bamyan, Khost, Takhar, Jawzjan, Al-Beroni and

                         The pace of project implementation under the Additional Financing of SHEP and the ARTF funded activities slowed down in 2010, due to a variety of reasons including the departure

                         of staff from the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at that time for alternative employment. The appointment of a new PCU helped speed up implementation in 2011-2012. However, a
                         backlog of activities and undisbursed funds remain. There is considerable work to be done to utilize the remaining funds and to fully achieve the project development objectives.

                         SHEP is in its final year of implementation. The Government of Afghanistan has indicated that it wants the World Bank to provide further long-term support for the higher education
                         sector. A Bank mission in September commenced discussions on options for future assistance. The mission stressed that progress on the current project will be important when
                         deciding on future assistance.
