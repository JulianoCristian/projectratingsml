                         Implementation Status Overview
                         SHEP is the first major higher education investment in Afghanistan by the World Bank. SHEP commenced operation in June 2005 with a grant of US$40 million. Originally, the project
                         supported six universities (Kabul, Balkh, Herat, Kandahar, Nangrahar, and Kabul Polytechnic), mainly in the areas of strategy development, staff development, curriculum
                         development, improvements in and development of physical infrastructure and the improvement of laboratories and libraries. In June 2008, SHEP received an additional grant of US
                         $5 million from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) to increase support for four universities (Nangrahar, Balkh, Kandahar and Kabul Polytechnic), chiefly to expand
                         physical infrastructure and for the provision of equipment. In June 2010, SHEP received additional financing of US$20 million from the IDA Crisis Response Window (CRW) to

                         Overall the project has progressed well and has met its objectives. Through partnerships with foreign universities and block grants, all twelve universities under SHEP have
                         developed strategic plans. 86 faculties in the 12 universities have updated their curricula and are in the process of implementing the revised curricula. A Quality Assurance (QA)

                         staff were able to secure MA's degrees under SHEP and another 50 are currently completing their Masters studies. In addition, 627 academic received short term training for their
                         professional development.

                         18 faculties have already received science laboratory facilities and equipment. A further 13 faculties will receive laboratory equipment by June 30, 2013. All 12 SHEP universities and
                         the MoHE have received computer laboratories and equipment. 6 universities have received library facilities, and books and reading material.

                         Although, monitoring and evaluation remains a key challenge for both the MHE and Universities, there are efforts underway (at various stages) to establish a Higher Education
                         Information Management System (HEMIS) in 8 of the 12 partner the Universities.
