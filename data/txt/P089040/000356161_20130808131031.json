The link between education and increased individual\n            earnings has been widely documented: there is a large body\n            of cross-country evidence that education enhances the\n            employability, productivity and income earning capacity of\n            individuals. The impact of educational attainment on these\n            various socio-economic indicators has been shown to vary by\n            region, sub-region, gender, age, by income levels, and other\n            variables. In this paper, we focus on the socio-economic\n            impact of educational attainment in Afghanistan. Afghanistan\n            presents a fairly unique context for examining the\n            association between education and the socio-economic\n            variable discussed above. It is a conflict-affected country,\n            with strong and rich cultural and religious traditions. It\n            also has some of the worst developmental indicators and in\n            the world. Using data from the National Risk and\n            Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) survey of 2007/08, authors\n            investigate the extent to which the educational attainment\n            of men and women is associated with greater economic welfare\n            and less likelihood of being poor. The analysis is divided\n            into four parts: part one looks education and other factors\n            associated with household economic welfare and the\n            probability of being poor; part two focuses on the education\n            and other factors associated with women's participation\n            in the labor force; part three looks at the association of\n            mother's education with health-related outcomes of\n            children; and part four looks at the association between\n            educational attainment of girls and women, and their\n            perceptions of well-being. Afghanistan's education\n            indicators are among the worst in the world and girls and\n            rural communities are particularly disadvantaged."}, "docdt": "2013-07-01T00:00:00Z"}
