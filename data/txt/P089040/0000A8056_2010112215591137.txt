                         Implementation Status Overview
                         SHEP has been in operations since June 2005, supporting selected faculties of six universities in Afghanistan in the areas of staff professional development, curriculum
                         strengthening, and improved facilities/equipment. The original grant signed in June 2005 was equivalent of US$ 40 million. In June 2008, SHEP received a contribution of US$5
                         million from ARTF. In June 2010, SHEP received additional financing from IDA of $20 million (through the Crisis Response Window, CRW), to scale up SHEP's program activities in
                         six additional universities. SHEP's progress indicators remain the same, as in the original design; however, targets have increased.

                         - Implementation of SHEP components in the framework of the National Higher Education Strategic Plan (NHESP)
                         - Restructuring of the Planning & Policy Department of the Ministry to maintain oversight on the implementation of SHEP and other development projects
                         - Reviewing the role of steering committee
                         - Support and strengthen implementation arrangements in SHEP components
                         - Advocate and implement measures to achieve institutional autonomy for higher education institutions

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
