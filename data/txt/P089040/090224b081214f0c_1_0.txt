O    Implementation Status Overview
SHEP has been in operations since June 2005. Since then it has been supporting selected faculties of six core universities (Kabul, Balkh, Herat, Kandahar, Ningrahar, and Kabul
S Polytech) in the areas of staff professional development, curriculum development, physical infrastructure and equipment improvement. The original grant signed in June 2005 is
equivalent of US$ 40 million. In June 2008, SHEP received a contribution of US$5 million from ARTIF which supports four national universities (Nangrahar, Balkh, Kandahar, Kabul
Polytech) mainly in physical infrastructure and equipment improvement. In June 2010, SHEP received additional financing of $ 20 from IDA Crisis Response Window(CRW), to scale
up SHEP's activities in six additional universities under its purview. The new universities are universities of Bamyan, Khost, Takhar, Jozjan, Albaroni, and Kabul Education University.

SHEP's progress indicators remain the same, as in the original design; however, targets have increased.
SHEP is the first major higher education investment in Afghanistan, seeking to support quality, relevance and management of higher education. This refers to progress in the various
project components which include: professional and faculty staff development; curriculum revision and material development; infrastructure, teaching and learning facilities; research
and graduate instructions; governance; accreditation and quality assurance. The project components are being supported through Afghan and foreign universities partnerships,
technical assistance, and the provision of the block grants to support universities and MOHE in formulating and implementing their strategic plans.
