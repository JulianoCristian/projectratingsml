                         Implementation Status Overview
                         SHEP has been in operations since June 2005. Since then it has been supporting selected faculties of six core universities (Kabul, Balkh, Herat, Kandahar, Ningrahar, and Kabul
                         Polytech) in the areas of staff professional development, curriculum development, physical infrastructure and equipment improvement. The original grant signed in June 2005 is
                         equivalent of US$ 40 million. In June 2008, SHEP received a contribution of US$5 million from ARTF which supports four national universities (Nangrahar, Balkh, Kandahar, Kabul
                         Polytech) mainly in physical infrastructure and equipment improvement. In June 2010, SHEP received additional financing of $ 20 from IDA Crisis Response Window(CRW), to scale
                         up SHEP's activities in six additional universities under its purview. The new universities are universities of Bamyan, Khost, Takhar, Jozjan, Albaroni, and Kabul Education University.

                         - Supervise and complete ongoing infrastructure projects, and finalize the bidding process for the planned infrastructure projects
                         - Finalize the transfer of Research grants to project universities
                         - Support project universities in the implementation of their strategic plans
                         - Begin self-assessment in project universities in preparation for quality assurance and accreditation
