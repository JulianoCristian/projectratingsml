It sets out to develop these\n            proven geothermal resources at the Lake Assal location. It\n            also provides the necessary infrastructure for the\n            generation and transmission of the geothermal based\n            electrical power to Djibouti City. The project consists of\n            the following components: (a) scaling studies for the\n            correct design of equipment; (b) a Nomad Settlement Impact\n            Study for potential settlement issues; (c) geothermal\n            drilling in the Lake Assal area; and (d) complementary\n            surface exploration works in the Lake Assal area. It also\n            includes: (e) the installation of power plants, and a well\n            head unit and desalination plant; (f) installation of an\n            electrical transmission line; and (g) technical assistance\n            to Electricite de Djibouti (EdD)."}, "docdt": "1989-06-08T00:00:00Z"}
