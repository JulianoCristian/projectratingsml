highway development programs\n            of the five participating Republics/Provinces. These\n            development programs, which result from the recommendations\n            of Highway Master Plan Studies which each agency carried out\n            cover: the construction of new roads; the reconstruction and\n            rehabilitation of existing roads; the purchase of\n            specialized equipment to assist the Roads Organizations in\n            monitoring traffic and in acquiring and processing data\n            related to the operations of their networks of interregional\n            and regional (including primary, secondary and feeder)\n            roads; and personnel training to assist the Roads\n            Organizations in improving their standards of administering\n            and maintaining their roads networks. Benefits of the\n            highway sector loan would be improved communications and the\n            lowering of transportation costs within the five\n            Republics/Provinces. All sectors of the economy will benefit\n            due to these improvements, and many outlying regions will be\n            better integrated with the main traffic system, thus\n            permitting a balanced development of the less-developed\n            parts of Yugoslavia."}, "docdt": "1979-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
