The project has made a\n            difference on the ground and was a positive force for\n            Tajikistan's movement toward peace, and, hence, toward\n            creation of an enabling environment for growth. The\n            assistance was successful in facilitating efforts to\n            repatriate opposition soldiers, refugees, and internally\n            displaced persons. Bank performance was highly satisfactory,\n            while borrower performance was satisfactory. Key lessons\n            learned follow. An adjustment operation with no specific\n            conditionality but strong government commitment, can be\n            efficacious. Flexibility and speed are critical elements for\n            post-conflict rehabilitation operations. Finally, timely\n            Bank support can make a major contribution to sustaining peace."}, "docdt": "1999-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
