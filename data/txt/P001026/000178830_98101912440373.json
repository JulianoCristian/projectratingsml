Through its national component the project\n            will: (a) strengthen the ministry of agriculture by\n            establishing a specialized unit for the planning and\n            coordination of the country's rice development program\n            including consultant assistance and fellowship funds for the\n            training of Guinean cadres; (b) upgrade the country's\n            agronomic rice research in order to provide a testing and\n            demonstration capacity for introducing technical\n            improvements; (c) undertake a pricing study to assist\n            Government to restructure agricultural prices so as to\n            provide appropriate incentives to its rural sector; and (d)\n            prepare for a future agricultural development project in\n            Upper Guinea. The project also contains a regional\n            component, a pilot project to be carried out in\n            Guinea's forest region to test and develop technical\n            improvements to rice cultivation practices of farmers. If\n            the pilot operation is a success, it will constitute the\n            basis for a follow-up project in that area."}, "docdt": "1979-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
