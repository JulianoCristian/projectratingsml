The project also\n            contains a regional component, a pilot project to be carried\n            out in Guinea's Forest Region to test and develop\n            technical improvements to rice cultivation practices of\n            farmers. If the pilot operation is a success, it would\n            constitute the basis for a follow-up project in that area."}, "docdt": "1979-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
