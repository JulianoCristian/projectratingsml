The project achieved\n            its main objectives, its impact has been significant on\n            agricultural development, and both the Bank and Borrower\n            performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be learned\n            from this project. First, the project demonstrated to the\n            Government that a smallholder orientation was a more\n            effective and less costly approach to development than\n            collectives or state farmers. Second, the project's\n            success can be attributed to the particular attention paid\n            to avoiding parallel organizational structures. Third, the\n            project was able to successfully test simple technical\n            packages that promoted low cost yield improvements by using\n            simple technology such as improved seed, fertilizer, simple\n            water control, and crop husbandry improvements. Finally, IDA\n            supervision in the areas of accounting, financial\n            management, and credit recovery was weak since supervision\n            efforts concentrated on technical and administrative matters."}, "docdt": "1988-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
