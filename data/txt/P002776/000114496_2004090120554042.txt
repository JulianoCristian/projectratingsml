The Honorable S. Kibona
Minister of Finance
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
Dear Mr. Minister:
          Re:  Agricultural Adjustment Program (Credit 2116-TA)
          Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
     We refer to our discussions regarding the use of Tanzanian
consultants under the Program and the provisions in the
Development Credit Agreement for the Agricultural Adjustment
Credit, dated April 6, 1990, between the United Republic of
Tanzania (the Borrower) and the International Development
Association (the Association).
     In order to allow for the participation of local consultants
in the activities to be carried out under the program, paragraph
2(b) of Schedule 1 to the Development Credit Agreement should be
amended by the deletion of the words "or services".
     Please confirm your agreement to this proposal by
countersigning this letter.
     Please accept, Mr. Minister, the assurances of my highest
consideration.
                         Yours sincerely,
                         Ridwan Ali
                         Chief
                         Agriculture Division
                         Southern Africa Department
The Honorable S. Kibona
Minister of Finance
