for the Rural and Main Roads\n            Project for Guatemala were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory; the risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory; and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            The financing of maintenance activities is the single\n            largest challenge in the rural roads sector, particularly in\n            highly centralized countries. Central to success is working\n            out the mechanisms to ensure that the adequate resources\n            will be made available on a sustainable basis. Whereas\n            central government transfers may remain an important\n            contributory factor, it will be prudent for specific funding\n            mechanisms to be designed for rural road maintenance,\n            including local level resource mobilization from road users.\n            Maintenance arrangements which rely on community based\n            organizations are a valid approach but present certain\n            limitations, particularly when there are no contractual\n            arrangements linked to payments for services. Addressing the\n            maintenance issues not only implies designing cost effective\n            mechanisms but also delivery methods (micro-enterprises for\n            example) that can be consistently applied in the local\n            context. There is a need to balance expectations between\n            local employment generations arising from rural roads works\n            and efficient execution. The usually small scale of rural\n            road works, coupled with the reasonable objective of most\n            rural roads programs of generating local employment, often\n            result in small local companies being awarded rehabilitation\n            works contracts. This can result in execution delays as\n            small contractors often lack the financial strength and\n            equipment required to undertake multiple works\n            simultaneously in an expeditions and efficient manner. A\n            careful analysis of the bidding eligibility criteria and the\n            possible inclusion of success fees for timely completion of\n            works can constitute efficient instruments to partially\n            solve this situation."}, "docdt": "2007-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
