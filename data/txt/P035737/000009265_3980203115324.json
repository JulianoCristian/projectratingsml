1) support building up of\n            the country's institutional capacity to administer and\n            maintain rural roads; 2) improve the rural road system in\n            the ZONAPAZ region, specifically the Department of San\n            Marcos (part of the geographic area most affected by\n            internal conflict before the December 1996 Peace Accords,\n            where the government is focusing a major post-conflict\n            development effort), critical to providing access to social\n            and other public services and fostering economic development\n            through integration to markets; and 3) continue to improve\n            the efficiency of the main and secondary road networks. The\n            components are three: 1) to develop and implement a national\n            rural roads and transport strategy; 2) to implement a pilot\n            rural roads component using innovative institutional\n            arrangements for maintenance and rehabilitation including\n            the testing of new technologies for cost-effective\n            strengthening of rural road surfaces, and pilot a new\n            institutional framework for road management and financing;\n            and 3) to continue support, through consultant services and\n            providing equipment, for rehabilitating the main and\n            secondary road network."}, "docdt": "1997-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
