MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  memorandum  and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the People's Republic of China for $200.0
million equivalent to help finance a Technology Development Project. The
proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a
maturity of 20 years, including five years of grace. The Government will pass
on $194.3 million of the loan proceeds to the Project Office (PO) of the State
Planning Commission (SPC), which will act as the implementation agency for the
project. The SPC will pass on these funds to eligible sub-borrowers in the form
of sub-loans, through the Golden China Corporation (GCC) acting on its behalf
as a financial agent in funding investments to develop Engineering Research
Centers (ERCs). For most ERCs 60 percent of the proceeds of each sub-loan will
become an equity investment when the ERC is converted into a limited liability
company (LLC). The balance will have the same interest rate as the Bank loan,
with a term of up to 20 years including up to five years of grace. The GCC will
manage the disbursement and collection of the sub-loans on behalf of the
Government. The PO will receive a service fee of 0.85% of each sub-loan to
cover the costs of project implementation. The sub-loans will be provided in
foreign currency, and the exchange rate risk will be borne by the ERCs. The
Government will bear the credit risk.
2.           Background.  China's  rapid industrial growth,  which for  1994  is
estimated at nearly 14 percent, has been fueled mainly by investment in fixed
capital and increased use of natural resources. While productivity gains have
made some contribution to growth, annual productivity growth in state-owned
enterprises-the backbone of China's industrial sector-has been relatively slow.
As a result, the fast pace of industrialization has required a greater savings
rate than would have otherwise been necessary to achieve the same rate of
growth. Greater use of capital and natural resources has also placed demands on
a limited resource base that are potentially unsustainable in the long term. On
a per capita basis,  arable land in China is one third of the corresponding
world average, renewable water resources one fourth of the world average, and
fossil fuel reserves one half. Continued resource-intensive growth is not
considered sustainable, and China is now refocusing its industrial strategy on
improvements in productivity, as well as in husbandry of its natural resources,
and sound environmental management.
3.           Technological change is a key contributor to productivity growth,
and to sustainable increases in national income. Prior to 1980, three problems
prevented rapid technological progress in China. On the demand side of
technology markets,  enterprises were not subject to market forces,  did not
enjoy decision-making autonomy, and had no incentive to adopt new technologies.
On the supply side,  the command economy invested heavily in university and
research laboratories, but their results were not oriented to commercial
purposes. Finally, the overall policy framework prevented absorption of
technology from abroad, offered no assurances to owners and investors in
technology, and provided no incentives for the diffusion of technology.



-2-
4.           During  the  1980s,  progressive  reforms  in  enterprise  governance
increased the demand for technology. Price liberalization increased competition
and put pressure on firms to become more efficient. Adoption of the New
Operating Mechanism for state enterprises (1992) empowered firms to make their
own business decisions; this autonomy, coupled with the reduction in subsidies
as financial sector reform proceeds, provides new incentives for firms to adopt
modern technologies.
5.           Simultaneously,  reforms  in  the  overall  policy  framework  have
progressively removed impediments to technology acquisition from abroad and
provided improved incentives for the diffusion of technology. The Government
has promulgated laws and regulations consistent with sound international
practices and enhanced the professional capabilities of entities charged with
administering such measures. The legal environment is thus increasingly
conducive to the functioning of an open market for research and development
(R&D) services. China's 1992 revision of its Patent Law and associated
regulations introduced a body of legal and administrative enactments generally
in line with international standards. To ensure copyright protection, in 1992
China implemented provisions of the Berne Convention and the Universal
Copyright Convention, again bringing its own regulations in conformity with
international norms. The 1992 revision of the Trademark Law, modeled on that of
Japan and the United States, is also consistent with international conventions.
China also joined the World Intellectual Property Organization and the Paris
and Vienna Conventions governing trademarks, industrial property, products and
services. Basic, albeit limited, protection of trade secrets is provided in
China's 1993 anti-unfair competition law, which sets the framework for fair
competition among enterprises. The newly enacted Company Law should also foster
trade in technology between domestic and overseas partners by allowing
intangible property, such as patents and know-how, to be accepted as capital
contributions. Capping this legal reform is the 1993 Technology Law, which
evidences the national commitment to technology development. The Government's
remaining policy goals, as articulated in a recently issued Policy Statement,
include improved enforcement of intellectual property rights, rationalization
of the technology contract system, amendment of tax policies affecting
technology companies, and enhanced mobility of personnel involved in science
and technology (S&T).
6.           To improve management of its large S&T institutional system,  the
Government has introduced institutional and financing reforms. A National
Research Center was established to coordinate planning and priority-setting for
S&T development, under joint control of the SPC, the country's lead planning
agency, and the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC). Simultaneously,
the Government granted the 63,000 research institutes greater administrative
and financial autonomy, while also forcing them to respond to the needs of the
market by cutting direct budgetary support. This signaled a fundamental change
from the concept of S&T knowledge as a free good to a productive commodity,
tradable in the market. As a result, central government grants for S&T
financing declined from 100 percent of the S&T budget in the early 1970s to 33
percent in 1991, with the difference reflecting self-financing derived from
contract work and other sources. A market-based incentive regime for S&T
personnel was developed to complement these initiatives. The result has been a
dramatic expansion in domestic trade in technology development and a
proliferation of organizations aimed at managing the commercialization and
industrialization of R&D results. In 1991 alone, about 1,000 technology market
management organizations were established.



-3-
7.           Public services to diffuse commercial technology have also been
improved. The Government has, for example, established 53 Technology Diffusion
Stations to promote the dissemination of information on domestic technology
innovations  to  large-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,   and  to  encourage
cooperation among the various S&T providers. Ten Productivity Centers have also
been set up to promote productivity-enhancing measures at the enterprise level.
Finally, the National Institute of Metrology (NIM) is expanding its activities,
which center around maintaining an accurate standard measurement base and
calibrating  measurement  instruments  at  provincial  standards  institutes,
universities,   and  the  research  institutes  of  sectoral  ministries  and
enterprises. NIM has now begun to enter into contracts to provide services to
industry and has assisted in the diffusion and adoption of internationally
recognized quality standards.
8.           The  Government  has  recognized  the  need  to  make  the  R&D
establishment more commercially oriented and to improve further its public
technology services. Many R&D institutes still lack the incentives, facilities,
and personnel to scale up the results of their laboratory research to a pilot
plant size, or to test at a semi-commercial level developments in manufacturing
processes. Furthermore, few enterprises in China can carry out the detailed
engineering necessary to adapt foreign technology to specific local conditions.
As a result, despite continuing significant improvements in the regulatory and
incentive regimes, technology diffusion to the productive sectors has not
occurred at the desired pace. The Government is therefore promoting the
restructuring of R&D institutions into more commercially oriented Engineering
Research Centers (ERCs), which have been tested by the Government on a limited
basis as a means by which to fully separate R&D institutions from their parent
governmental bodies. The ERCs would become autonomous cost centers responsible
for their own financing and business decisions, and facing increasingly hard
budget constraints.
9.          Proiect Obiectives.  The project  would  support  the  Government's
continuing reforms in technology policy and institutions so as to promote the
development   of   clean,   productivity-enhancing   technologies   for   China's
industries. The project is designed to accelerate adaptation and diffusion of
technologies in China through institutional initiatives and through deepening
of technology markets. Its institutional reforms are intended to speed
diffusion by making China's R&D assets more market-responsive through the
transformation of a segment of university laboratories and research institutes
into for-profit, technology development corporations. It would also improve
public services, such as those for norms and standards, which are necessary for
technology development. The existing technology policy framework has been
reviewed and found supportive of the project objectives.
10.          Project Description.  The project  has  two components.  The  first
would assist in restructuring part of China's large R&D establishment into
market-responsive corporations, whose purpose would be to identify, adapt or
develop cleaner, productivity-enhancing technology to meet the needs of Chinese
industries. This component is expected to attract the most dynamic and service-
oriented elements of existing research institutions to create-through a
competitive   selection   process-new,   market-oriented   ERCs,   organized   as
independent LLCs under Chinese law. The ERCs would produce, under contract with
downstream manufacturers and users, equipment and systems designs, prototypes
and customized products and services that adapt foreign and domestic technology
to local inputs, scales of production and other market conditions. At their
creation, the ERCs would be supported with equity and loan finance from the
Government and other sources, but government subsidies would be limited to this



-4-
front-end investment; thereafter, the ERCs would be subject to market forces,
with provision for exit for those that prove commercially unviable.
11.         The second component would help improve technology-related public
services through: (a) modernization of NIM (para. 7); and (b) a technical
assistance program to strengthen a Productivity Center and to carry out
selected training activities for the project participants, including training
in administration and enforcement of technology regulations. Strengthening of
NIM is expected to result in the modernization of norms and standards to
facilitate the introduction of new products and services and to improve the
quality of industrial products. It is an important element in technology
development. The technical assistance activities will support training and
technical assistance for the ERCs and the agencies involved in project
implementation. Bank funds for both components would finance primarily the
foreign exchange costs of process lines and production equipment, testing
equipment and instruments, and computers, as well as related licenses, patents,
and intellectual property rights, expert services, materials and other
consumables, spare parts and maintenance that would be required to conduct the
business of the ERCs and NIM.
12.          Project Implementation. Most ERCs have already been selected based
on feasibility studies covering agreed topics, including a market analysis for
the services to be provided, an assessment of competition from other providers,
their technology diffusion strategy and intended cooperation with foreign and
domestic suppliers of technology. An Evaluation Committee, comprised of noted
scientists, engineers and representatives of various government technology-
related agencies, ranks proposals according to agreed criteria, and forwards
top-rated proposals to the Bank for final approval. Since the project is
designed to widen independent technology markets, ERCs supported by the project
are only those warranting public investment which would not otherwise be
supplied by private domestic or foreign suppliers. Investment is limited to
ERCs developing technologies to address environmental externalities or which
would have a substantial productivity impact that downstream users could not
develop individually owing to economies of scale or the high risk involved.
Domestic and foreign enterprises, as well as management and staff, will be
allowed to participate in the ownership of ERCs; their shareholder interest in
the ERCs will be proportionate to their share of the total equity. Once
established, ERCs will be entirely responsible for their own survival in the
marketplace, and will benefit from no operating subsidies or protection from
competition. Any ERCs that fail would be sold to other competitors or
downstream customers to become their in-house R&D facilities, or go bankrupt
and their assets sold to interested buyers. ERC proposals representing about 90
percent of Bank funds for the component have already been approved. Once
established, ERC progress would be monitored closely, and a mid-term review
would be carried out during implementation to take stock of the experience
gained.
13.         Day-to-day implementation of the project would be handled by the
Project Office of the SPC, a new entity incorporating a Technology Service
Center (TSC) set up by SPC in April 1993 and active since then in assisting to
prepare the proposed project. The PO would supervise the ERCs, organize and
coordinate project training, coordinate procurement, and use as a financial
agent the Golden China Corporation, a newly constituted limited liability
company to handle disbursement and collection of project funds for the
Government. GCC would act as a financial agent and not as a risk-taking
intermediary since most of the beneficiary ERCs have been pre-identified
through a selection process and the newly formed GCC lacks the required



- 5 -
expertise. It was decided not to develop such expertise in GCC to avoid further
complicating the project and increasing its risk. As a new institution, the GCC
will receive training under the project's technical assistance component.
14.          The SPC, which was the lead agency in planning aind preparing the
project, would remain involved in project monitoring through the Project
Office. The SPC was involved in the similar, successful Key Studies Development
Project (Cr. 2210-CHA), which in part supported development of a number of
research institutions with an outreach capacity.
15.          The estimated project cost is $402.0 million equivalent. The Bank
loan of $200 million would cover the foreign exchange component, equivalent to
50 percent of project costs. To maintain the momentum already gathered in
constituting the ERCs and in other project activities, retroactive financing of
up to $5.0 million is recommended to cover all eligible expenditures incurred
after March 31, 1994. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in the country are given in
Schedules C and D. respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12814-CHA,
dated January 18, 1995, is being distributed separately.
16.          Lessons from Previous Bank Group ORerations. Since 1975, the Bank
has supported 11 industrial technology development (TD) projects, four of which
have been completed. A review of Bank experience in this area was recently
completed by our Operations Evaluation Department (OED) . The OED report and
experience under the projects indicate that: (a) a project's impact on TD
hinges on the existence of a clearly defined and articulated strategy, with TD
as part  of the overall  process  of industrialization;  (b)  besides  a sound
macroeconomic environment, the framework of TD incentives -- trade, industrial
and technology policies -- is crucial to successful TD; (c) strengthening of
technology capabilities may need interventions to promote local R&D activities;
(d) involvement in TD projects results in technology policy reform; (e) TD
institutions should have clear economic and commercial criteria against which
their success or failure can be judged; (f) the Bank's role in TD has been
critical in areas where financial returns are difficult to quantify or limited
in the short term and where business failures are a necessary part of the
innovation process; and (g) technology policy for industry has a major role in
determining competitiveness and productivity and cannot be seen in isolation
from macroeconomic policy, trade, licensing procedures and exit policies. The
design of the proposed project has taken these lessons into consideration.
Among other things, the project has been designed under an overall strategy, as
expressed in the official Policy Statement (para. 5). It incorporates a broad
framework of incentives and concentrates on bolstering local capabilities and
on the development of market-oriented technology transfer institutions in the
context of an improving policy and regulatory framework.
17.         Rationale  for  Bank  Involvement.  The  project  responds  to  the
Government's strategy for economic development which calls for both the use of
S&T to promote economic development and the need to integrate S&T with the
productive sector. The landmark 1993 Third Plenary Session of the 14th Central
Committee of the Communist Party has endorsed the continuation of market-
oriented reforms in the science, technology and educational systems. Government
commitment to and ownership of the project concept has been evident since it
first approached the Bank about a potential S&T project in 1990.



-6 -
18.          The  proposed  project  supports  the  Country  Assistance  Strategy
presented to the Board on August 3, 1993. That Strategy indicates our
commitment to China's industrial reform by supporting enterprise reform and
reforms in related factor markets, such as for technology and finance. It also
calls for innovative operations supporting enterprise reform and related
institutions, imparting new skills and creating supporting infrastructure. The
proposed project fulfills this strategy by complementing the Bank's ongoing
support for industrial, financial and labor market reforms with assistance to
reform of the S&T system. The aim is to institute a new organizational
mechanism for technology transfer, enhance the capabilities of S&T personnel
and develop technology markets. The project also provides the Bank with an
opportunity to continue its policy dialogue with the Government on those S&T
policy issues still requiring action. During project preparation, that dialogue
led to changes in the incentives framework for S&T institutions.
19.          Agreed  Actions.  At  negotiations,  the  following  assurances  were
obtained from the Borrower: (a) each ERC feasibility study will include a plan
for conversion of the ERC to an LLC within five years, which will be approved
by the Bank;  the ERCs will be required to implement the approved conversion
plan  under  a  sub-loan  contract  with  GCC;  (b)  ERCs  will  be  selected  in
accordance with technical and financial criteria acceptable to the Bank and all
ERC proposals will be submitted to the Bank for final approval; (c) project
training will be carried out according to a training program acceptable to the
Bank, and any studies will be carried out according to terms of reference and
timing accep-able to the Bank; and (d) the Borrower will undertake with the
Bank a mid-term review of project implementation progress and prospects by
December 30, 1997. As a condition of loan effectiveness, a financial agency
agreement, with terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, would be signed
between the SPC and the GCC.
20.          Environmental Aspects. Most of the ERC proposals already approved
will result in technologies with positive environmental impacts. For example,
two ERCs would work in the area of clean coal combustion. China's inefficient
coal utilization causes serious air pollution in major urban areas and
contributes to acid rain problems. The ERCs working on clean coal combustion
would have a very significant environmental impact by introducing technologies
to increase energy efficiency, reduce waste and pollution, and reduce specific
coal consumption. All ERCs already approved by the Bank have been subject to
thorough environmental impact assessments which identified potential negative
environmental impacts and included action plans to ameliorate these impacts.
Similar assessments will be carried out for the remaining ERCs.
21.          Sustainability.  Activities  proposed under  the project  have been
designed with a long-term perspective in mind and under a policy and regulatory
framework conducive to sustainability. Once established, ERCs would be entirely
responsible for their own development and survival through market competition.
The proposals approved have identified clear market demand for the activities
to  be  developed,  including  competition  from  other  providers  of  the  same
products and services in China and abroad. The ERCs that fail to meet the
market test are expected to go bankrupt and their assets would be sold to
interested buyers.
22.          Benefits.  The  project  would  play  a  significant  role  in  the
development and adaptation of technology to Chinese conditions, and in the
broad diffusion of productivity-enhancing and environmentally sustainable
technologies. It would support a new institutional initiative designed to
increase the productivity of R&D assets and their effective deployment, linking



-7-
the R&D system with foreign as well as domestic sources of know-how and with
the emerging market for technology.  It would also help strengthen technology-
related public services to improve the quality and performance of Chinese
products and services. In helping to bring about productivity gains and
improved environmental performance, the project is ultimately expected to
contribute to the sustainability of China's industrialization process. All ERC
subloans under the project would be expected to have a rate of return of at
least 12 percent.
23.          Risks. Because of the uncertainly of results associated with the TD
process, investments in TD corporations necessarily entail high risk. To
minimize this risk, the project establishes clear market incentives for the
ERCs, their management and owners; the ERCs would be subject to hard budget
constraints and would not receive operating subsidies. This risk has also been
minimized through the preparation and review of feasibility studies for each
ERC, with special emphasis on the projected market demand, access to domestic
and foreign sources of technology, and managerial competence. The Bank is
responsible for finally approving all ERC investment proposals. A further risk
is that the ERCs would compete with potential private investments. This risk
has been offset by investing in areas warranting public sector involvement in
R&D, and by ensuring that future entry into those areas is unrestricted. There
is a risk associated with the project implementation institutions, the PO at
SPC and the GCC, which may fail to reach the required level of managerial and
technical competence. Care has been taken in selecting well qualified and
experienced staff for the PO and GCC and in including in the project design
adequate technical assistance and training for the GCC. The high risk
associated with the project is considered justified in view of the very high
potential benefits for the country as a result of efficient technology
innovations.
24.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

(a) As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
baLances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the SDR.
In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a doLlar amount greater than the
original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
(b) Credit fully disbursed.
(c) Not yet effective.
