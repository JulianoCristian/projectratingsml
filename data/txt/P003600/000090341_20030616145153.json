satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was modest, and the Bank and borrower performance\n            were both satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that\n            the overly complex procurement procedures adversely affected\n            the efficient procuring of advanced research equipment and\n            technology. Although procurement delays are common to all\n            Bank projects, it was particularly detrimental in this case\n            given the rapid obsolescence of the equipment and\n            technologies to be acquired. Almost all parties concerned\n            contributed to the overall delay of the process: (a) local\n            procedures were cumbersome: it took 2-3 months for MEIO\n            (Mechanical, Electrical Import/Export Office) to complete\n            the review process, something that is beyond the control of\n            the implementing agency; (b) Engineering Research Centers\n            (ERCs) also contributed to the delay either through delay in\n            submission of necessary information/documentation for\n            procurement process, and in some cases, holding off\n            procurement decision in anticipation of newer technology\n            which will be in the market in a few months time; (c)\n            procurement agencies: due to lack of comprehensive\n            experience in processing Bank projects and following Bank\n            procurement guidelines, much unnecessary delays occurred;\n            (d) Bank procedure is cumbersome: The process of converting\n            the ERCs into corporations raised many problems of asset\n            allocation, ownership definition and the establishment of\n            new management rules. Due to the diversity of product lines\n            as well as manufacturing sectors included in this Project,\n            the conversion experience and all the problems encountered\n            could serve as lessons for all future prospective\n            conversions for a wide array of state owned enterprises.\n            Given the number and dispersion of the ERCs, this proved an\n            impossible task. Instead of asking for a total coverage, it\n            may have been better to settle for a sample. The performance\n            of selected ERCs could have been easier to follow in details."}, "docdt": "2003-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
