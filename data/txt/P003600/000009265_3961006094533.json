in technology policy and institutions so\n            as to promote the development of clean, productivity\n            enhancing technologies in China's industries. The\n            project is designed to accelerate diffusion and adaptation\n            of technologies in China and abroad through the deepening of\n            technology markets and through institutional initiatives.\n            The project will consist of two components. The first\n            component is designed to assist in transforming part of the\n            research and development establishment (R & D) into\n            market-responsive technology development and\n            service-oriented elements of existing research institutions\n            to create -- through a competitive selection process -- new,\n            market-oriented entities, called Engineering Research\n            Centers (ERCs). The second component comprises complementary\n            investments in improving technology public services,\n            including: 1) the modernization of the National Institute of\n            Metrology and 2) technical assistance program for a\n            Productivity Center as well as for several training activities."}, "docdt": "1995-01-18T00:00:00Z"}
