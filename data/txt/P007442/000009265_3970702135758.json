"The Second Technical Assistance Project\n            has been conceived to help the Government implement, monitor\n            and sustain its structural adjustment effort as supported by\n            the Bank under a series of structural adjustment loans.  The\n            project finances consultants, training and equipment to\n            support three major objectives.  They include institutional\n            development and improved fiscal performance of key\n            public-sector entities; promotion of exports; and human\n            resources development.  In particular, the project will,\n            inter alia, help improve the financial and managerial\n            performance of the revenue services and of the\n            publicly-owned airline company and strengthen the Planning\n            and Statistics Institutes, National Investment Bank of\n            Jamaica, and the Ministry of Education.  It will also\n            finance a manpower planning study to help identify ways of\n            mobilizing, training and employing human resources.  In\n            addition, the project will fund a facility to provide\n            financing for technical assistance to exporters on favorable\n            terms, as well as a study to reorient the incentives system\n            to promote expansion of exports.  The project will also help\n            the Government improve its planning and administration of\n            externally-financed technical assistance.  A portion of the\n            loan proceeds will be utilized for other priority needs as\n            they arise."}, "docdt": "1985-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
