Dear Mr. Koichumanov:
           Re: Credit No. 2860 - KG (Health Sector Reform Project)
               Amendment to Development Credit Agreement
     We refer to the  Development Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement)
dated June 13, 1996 between Kyrgyz Republic (the Borrower) and the
International Development Association (the Association) for the above-
referenced project, and to the letter of Mr. Kemelbek Nanaev of December
6, 1996, requesting the Association to increase the amount of the
"Authorized Allocation" of the Special Account to an equivalent amount
of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).
     We hereby agree to the proposed amendment and therefore, paragraph 1
(c) of Schedule 5 (Special Account) is amended to read as follows:
     "the term 'Authorized Allocation' means an amount equivalent to
     $500,000 to be withdrawn from the Credit Account and deposited
     into the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this
     Schedule."
Sincerely,
Yukon Huang
Director
