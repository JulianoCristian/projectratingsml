About this Report
       The Independent EvaluationGroup assessesthe programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrityof the Banks self-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Bankswork is producingthe
expected results, and second,to help develop improveddirections, policies, and proceduresthrough the
disseminationof lessonsdrawn from experience.As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Banks lending operationsthrough field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large,or complex; those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for
which Executive Directorsor Bank managementhave requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
importantlessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB RatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiencyis the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratingsfor Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loankredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for BorrowerPerformance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

PREFACE

        This i s an EnhancedProject Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the
Kyrgyz Republic's Health Sector Reform Project (Health I)    (US$20.6 million) and
Second Health Sector Reform Project (Health 11) (US$19.5 million). Health Iwas the
first World Bank-supported health project inthe Kyrgyz Republic (other previously
active donors includedthe UnitedStates Agency for InternationalDevelopment
(USAID), with a project on health finance reform, and the World Health Organization
(WHO), which provided significant assistance to the Kyrgyz government on health
strategy development). HealthIwas approved on May 14, 1996, became effective on
June 1,1996, and closed three months later than scheduled, on September 1,2002. The
credit was 93 percent disbursed andthe remaining US$1.37 million was cancelled. Health
11, an explicit follow-on to its predecessor, was approved on May 8,2001, became
effective on September 1,2001,and closed six months later than scheduled, on June 30,
2006. The HealthI1credit was 75 percent disbursedand the remaining US$4.9 million
was cancelled.

        This PPARwas prepared by JudythTwigg, IEGconsultant. The findings are
based on a review o fproject files; the projects' Mid-TermReviewsand Implementation
CompletionReports; publishedandunpublishedliterature on health status andhealth
reforminthe Kyrgyz Republic; health statistics released by the Government; and
interviewswith the project task managers, other World Bankmanagers, staff, and
consultants who worked on the project, officials from the Ministryo f Health, health
providers, and other donors. Duringa ten-day mission to the Kyrgyz Republic inJuly
2007, government, health sector, and World Bank staff and donors were interviewedin
Bishkekand Issyk-Kuland Chui Oblasts. A list ofthose consulted is inAnnex B. IEG
would like to express appreciation to those interviewed and to the World Bank Resident
Mission staff, particularlyAsel Sargaldakova, Asel Almanbetova, and Gulya Kolakova,
who helpedmakeappointments, arranged for transportation, and assembled key
documents.

        The findings from this PPARwill serve as inputfor a forthcoming IEGevaluation
ofthe World Bank's support for the health, nutrition, and population sector. A timeline
o f events with respect to Kyrgyz health reform i s inAnnex G.

        Following standardIEGprocedures, copies ofthe draft PPAR were sent to
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. However, no formal
responsewas received.

SUMMARY

        The objectives o fthe Health Sector Reform Project (Health I,1996-2002) were
to reform and improve the Kyrgyz Republic's health care system, improve the health
status o fthe population, improve the clinical effectiveness o fthe service delivery system,
improve the economic efficiency o f the delivery system, extendaccess to appropriate
care, and assure long-term financial viability o fthe system. The project emphasized
strengtheningprimary healthcare, rehabilitatingfacilities, reforming provider payment
mechanisms, and improving pharmaceuticals management.

        The project closed three months later than scheduled inSeptember 2002. Itwas
explicitly designed to implementa Government-generated health care reform strategy,
with the Banktakingthe lead inan active and cohesive donor environment. Despite
challenges stemmingfrom the 1998financial crisis, the project established a nationwide
health insurance mechanism that pools resources within a single purchaser, alongside a
provider reimbursement mechanism inkey oblasts based on capitation at the out-patient
level and case-basedpayments inhospitals. It introduced clinical protocols and trained
personnel for a cluster o fprimary health services, resulting indemonstrable
improvements inhealthoutcomes. Inflation and currency fluctuations underminedthe
planned implementation o f improvements inpharmaceutical management.

        The outcome o fHealthIis ratedSatisfactory,based on substantial efficacy and
efficiency inmeetingthe project's development objectives, and substantial relevance o f
the project's objectives anddesign.

        Bankperformance is ratedHighly Satisfactory, with strategically important and
timely interventions coupled with appropriate willingnessto wield the leverage o f Bank
support to make sure that implementationremained on track. Borrower performance i s
ratedHighly Satisfactory, with the Government, ledby a small number o f "champions,"
crafting the health system reform strategy and coordinating implementation and donor
activities throughout. The risk to development outcome i s rated Moderate. Many o fthe
project's activities contained built-in strategies to ensure sustainability, including
important efforts at institutional development, and the Government's commitment to a
follow-on project suggested that the reform process would both persist and deepen.
Declining public spendingon health, however, called into question the availability o f
resources to sustain the project's benefits.

        The objective ofthe SecondHealth Sector ReformProject (Health 11,2001-
2006) was to continue to improve performance and long-term viability o f the health
system by adjusting the delivery system to available means, focusing on important health
risks and diseases, improving access through better distribution o f services, improving
access by offering financial protection for the population against potentially
impoverishing levels o f out-of-pocket health spending, and improving the responsiveness
o fthe health system to the expectations o fthe population. HealthI1focused on the
restructuring o f health services delivery, most centrally the continued support o f family
group practices and family medical centers and the rationalization o fthe hospital sector;

                                             xii


the further reform ofhealthcare financing; quality improvementsachieved through
training and a new system o f licensing and accreditation o f healthfacilities; and
improving attention to public health.

        HealthI1closed six months later than scheduled inJune o f 2006. The project
extended and completed the healthfinancing reforms begununder Health I,         with a
Mandatory Health Insurance Fundestablished as the single purchasingagency for health
care services, and output-oriented provider payment schemes implemented across the
country. A network o f family physicians andfamily group practices was put inplace,
combining treatment for adults, pregnantwomen, and children inone location and in
many cases with one family practicephysician. As a result ofthe family medicine and
financing reforms, in-patient capacity was significantly reduced, hospitals usedtheir
remaining capacity more efficiently, and the quantity and quality o fhealth services at the
out-patient level was increased. A State Guaranteed Benefits Package explicitly defined
entitlements to healthcoverage, with a system o f co-payments introduced (with
exemptions for poor and disadvantaged groups) to permit transparency andpredictability
inanenvironment that hadbeencorrupted bydemands for illegalout-of-pocket
payments. Despite these reforms, private payments remained a significant percentage o f
total health spending, andtherefore improvements inaccessto health care were mixed.
Political opposition swelledto significant dimensions duringproject implementation.
Bankinterventionandpolicy dialogue at key moments sustainedmomentumfor reform,
butopponents still managedto block key activities, most importantly the restructuringof
tertiary hospital facilities inthe two major cities.

        The outcome o f HealthI1i s rated Satisfactory,based on substantial efficacy and
efficiency inmeetingthe project's development objectives, and substantial relevance o f
the project's objectives and design.

        Bankperformance is ratedSatisfactory,withthe supervision team bringing
consistent and appropriate oversight and expertise to the project, and particularly
important support from management when necessary, through high-level interventions
involving operations and instruments inother sectors. Sector-wide monitoring and
evaluation was strong, particularly withthe emergence o f a WHO/DfID-funded Health
Policy Analysis team conducting extensive data analysis. Borrower performance i s rated
Satisfactory,with the Ministryo f Healthcontinuing to play a crucial role insuccessfully
coordinatinga wide range o f donor activity inthe sector, while makingthe transition
from purchaser and service provider to stewardand policy maker. The risk to
development outcome i s ratedNegligible to Low. The project achieved significant
institutionaldevelopment inthe establishment o f family practice medicine, the
purchasing role o fthe MHIF, and the institutionaltransformationo fthe MOH. The
decline inpublic funding for the health sector duringthe project period was evidence o f
the needto continue to educate leaders outside the sector on the macroeconomic and
multisectoral context o fhealthreform; inthe subsequenttwo years, however, the
Government has met all commitments to increase public financing o fthe health sector.
The exodus o fproject-trained family physicians to Russiaand other destinations
jeopardizes the project's achievements.

Lessons from Health Iand Health I1

  The political economy of health sector reform inevitably creates both winners
  and losers. Early and comprehensive anticipation of stakeholder interests,
  institutionalanalysis to facilitate understanding of those interests, and the
  generation of a coherent planto build support for reform and to persuade and/or
  co-opt potential opponents is essential. Eventhe most informed risk assessment
  and management, however, may not always guarantee success; heavily entrenched
  interests (inthis case, those defendingthe existing structure o ftertiary facilities in
  Bishkek and Osh) may prove extremely difficult to overcome.

  The Bankshould not, however, underestimate the potential leverage wielded by
  its financing and expertise. The opposition to rationalization o f health facilities, for
  example, was fierce everywhere, but the failure inBishkek and Osh should not
  overshadow the Bank's success inthe rest o fthe Kyrgyz Republic outside those two
  cities. The Bank's contributions interms of reform sequencing, technical inputs, and
  political positioning were instrumentalineffecting meaningfulhospital rationalization
  across the country. On other issue areas as well, at several key points during Health I
  and 11, Bankinterventionsbroke political logjams and movedthe reformprocess
  forward. Explicit andearly political risk analysis i s essential to the effective
  development o fthis goodjudgment.

   One effective mechanismfor countering political resistance to reform is strong
   and consistent M&E,where analytic results can be generated and disseminated
  rapidly and effectively, buildingsupport for project activities in a politically
  contentious environment. Positive data and analysis on intermediate project
  outcomes can generate broad support for further project activities. Inthis case, the
  Issyk-Kulregion has become a recognized demonstration site whose successeshave
  promptedother regions to accelerate their participation inthe reforms.

  Another important tool for overcoming political resistance to reform is the
   engagement with civil society organizations that give healthprofessionals and users
  o fthe health care system a voice inthe decision process and a clear sense o f
  affiliation and identity. Inother words, supporting potential "winners," and creating
  pathways to transform "losers" into "winners,"  can be as important as overcoming or
  sidesteppingrecalcitrant "losers." The creation inthe Kyrgyz case o fthe Family
  Group Practice Association and related organizations demonstrates the potential long-
  term impact o f institutional development investments that may at first seem
  unsustainable or risky.

  The complexity of health care systems dictates that reforms be carefully
  sequenced. Inthis case, capacity buildinginthe primarycare sector through the
  family medicine and other primarycare reforms was apreconditionfor hospital
  rationalization; revenue gains from financing and service delivery reforms made
  possible the later benefits package and co-payment schemes; and the changes in
  revenue collection andpooling were necessary prerequisites to the introduction o f
  newpurchasing arrangements.

Tradeoffs between efficiency, equity/access, and quality of care will not be
addressed in the absence of explicit and consistent attention to the balance
between them and interventions to correct imbalances. Gains inefficiency do not
automaticallytranslate into improvements inequity; infact, the opposite may be true
ifthere isnot sufficienttrackingandanalysis ofinequities. The clear emphasis in
Health Iand I1was on achievements inefficiency; althoughthere were equity and
access objectives inbothprojects, and some evidence to indicate that progress was
made inthis area, the bulk o fthe project's major activities andindicators focused on
efficiency-relatedgoals. It may be argued, however, that this point illustrates the
earlier lesson on sequencing: given limitedpublic financing for health care, enhanced
efficiency may be seenas an essential prerequisite for meaningful efforts toward (and
adequate resources for) increased equity and access.

Targeted interventions to improve clinical quality can demonstrably impact
health outcomes. Inthe Kyrgyz case, the Bank's efforts to improve the quality and
use o f clinical practice guidelines for highblood pressure have measurably reduced
the incidence o f heart disease. While the direct impact o f immunization or nutrition
interventions, which impact health risks more immediately, may be more easily
measured, it i s reasonable and should be expected that health systems interventions
can similarly affect health outcomes.

The presence of a clear sector strategy, authored andwholly owned by the MOH,
can play a key role in achieving donor harmonization. Inthe Kyrgyz case, the
MOH's role as a leader and coordinator o fdonor activity, inpartnership with the
Bank,hasbeencentral. Longevity andconsistency ofdonor support, along with
clear "division o f labor" among donors, is also essential inan environment where
donor presence i s strong. Itprevents needless duplication o f activity, assigns donors
to activities best suited to their comparative advantages, and ensures that there i s
appropriate donor activity across all issue areas.

Improved efficiency may result inthe reallocation of public funds to other
sectors, reducingthe incentives for continued reform. Inthe Kyrgyz case, during
the second project the government responded to the efficiency gains inthe health
sector ina classic Soviet manner: ifinputrequirements decline, then public funds
should decline. This "stealing" o f conserved resources from the health sector
diminishedenthusiasm for the reforms andreduced the incentiveto persist anddeepen
downsizing efforts. The input-based budgeting process "punished" the health sector
for rightsizing health infrastructure and personnel. The introductionof formal co-
payments had a similar crowd-out effect on public spending. It i s therefore necessary
to negotiate proactively with ministries o f finance and legislatures on the disposition
o fproceeds from efficiency gains.

Some elements of health sector reform can have "spillover" effects, leading to
improvements in governance and accountability practices in other sectors. For
example, modernization inthe way that drugs are procured has benefits for all public
procurement. Donors agree that success inthis area has met or surpassedthe
expectations o f all involved; health reforms have begunto improve the overall
governance of the country, andthe education sector and chamber o f accounts have

                                              xv


   begun (albeit ina preliminarymanner) to discuss transitioning to the use o f
   internationally-accepted procedures for procurement, financial management,and
   audit.

       Inlate2004, the Bankbeganpreparationfor afive-year HealthandSocial
Protection Project (HSPP) that became effective inMarch2006. Its objective is to
improve health status by improving access, financial protection, efficiency, equity, and
fiduciary performance inthe health sector; to ensure sufficient and reliable financing for
the healthsector; andto strengthenthe targeting o f social benefits by developing
effective administrationand information management systems to improve access to social
services ingeneral. Fromthe beginning, the HSPP was expected to be implemented
through a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) centered on a new Government-derivedhealth
strategy. Strong donor coordination andpolicy consistency had already existed inthe
health sector for several years; under the SWAp, pooled donor financing (without ring-
fencing) accounts for 20-25 percent o f the total healthbudget. Even donors who are not
formally part o fthe financing arrangement (most importantly, USAID)are participating
inthe implementationofthejoint strategy. The MinistryofHealthis responsible for
implementation, with strongjoint ownership by the M O H andthe Ministryo f Finance.
The latter haspledgedto continue to increase public spendingon healthincrementally
each year with a target o f 13.4 percent of all government spendingby 2010; so far, this
commitment has beenmet. Ina relatively stable fiscal environment, the M O Hhas been
able to focus on the tasks o f capacity-building at the national and local levels, particularly

1. INTRODUCTION

COUNTRY       AND HEALTH        BACKGROUND

1.1      The Kyrgyz Republic emerged fromthe ashes of the Soviet Union in 1991as a
poor country with declininghealth indicators and a decaying health system. GDP per
capita in 1990 was about US$1,200; between 1992 and 1995, GDP contracted by half,
social expenditure declined significantly, andpoverty increased from an already-high
level to well over fifty percent. Poverty remains high, with significant differentials in
income and accessto infrastructure (electricity, water, and roads) between rural and
urbanareas as well as withinandbetweenregions, althoughthere is substantial overall
improvement since the early 1990s (World Bank, 2007b; Jakab and Manjieva, 2007).

1.2      Politically, the Kyrgyz Republic has been identifiedby the international
community as one o fthe few success stories inthe region, with nicknames rangingfrom
"island ofdemocracy" to "the Switzerlando f Central Asia." Independent media, NGOs,
political parties, and civil society organizations have beenpermittedto develop and
thrive. Within this context, however, beginning inthe mid-l990s, the President's
intermittentattemptsto curb these freedoms broughtthe country close to crisis on several
occasions. Unrest came to a head inthe early springof 2005, when Parliamentary
elections that were widely perceived as unfair caused mass protests that resulted inthe
President resigninghis post inApril and fleeing the country. The new Government has
not yet met expectations of accelerated economic, social, and political development,
leading to an overall environment o f uncertainty that is not conduciveto long-term
structural reforms (Jakab and Manjieva, 2007).

1.3      The Kyrgyz Republic was the first Central Asian country to join the World Trade
OrganizationinDecember 1998. Economic growthhas been ledby an extractive gold-
miningindustry(40 percent ofexports in2004), with exports also concentrated incotton,
electricity andtobacco. Over halfo fthe population remains employed inthe agricultural
sector. InMay 2001,the Governmentapproved a Comprehensive Development
Framework for 2001-2010, setting out a strategy for socioeconomic development and
poverty alleviation. A National Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2003-2005 was the first
phase inthe implementation of that framework.

1.4      The government is aunitary state with a strongcentral government.' Itis divided
into eight regions (oblasts) and 43 districts (rayons), withthe president appointing
regional governors. Until2006, health andeducationwere local government
responsibilities, but revenue raising instrumentsinmost localities were never adequate to
cover expenses. Beginningin2006, financing of healthservices was transferred to the
central Republican budget, with the exception o fthe capital city o f Bishkek
(Meimanaliev et al, 2005; Jakab and Manjieva, 2007).



'A unitary  state i s a state whose components are governed constitutionally as one single unit, as opposed to
a federal state, where the components making up the federation have a constitutional existence and
functions that cannot be unilaterally changed by the central government.

                                               2


1.5     The Soviet system o f health care inheritedby the Kyrgyz Republicwas riddled
with inefficienciesandweaknesses. The systemwas fragmentedinto four levels o f
government administration-republican(national), oblast, city, andrayon -that served
overlappingpopulations (Meimanaliev et al, 2005). Itperformed well interms o f
guaranteeingaccessto health care andpromoting a relatively equitable distribution of
healthresources, but it was structurally inefficient, with heavyreliance on in-patient and
tertiary hospital-based care. The emphasis on costly in-patient care was evidenced inthe
large numbers o fhospital beds andphysiciansand highuse rates compared to Western
industrialized countries (25 percent ofthe population was admittedto the hospital in
1987) (World Bank, 1996). As a result, there was virtually no diagnostic capacity and
equipment at lower, less costly levels o fthe system. Instead o ftreating patients at these
lower levels, patients were typically referred upwardsfor treatment at the tertiary level.

1.6     This systemo fhealthprovision was highly specialized andfragmented. The
populationwas serviced by specialized research institutes at the tertiary level, specialized
hospitals and clinics at the oblast level, and specialized dispensaries at the rayon level.
For example, a woman was not able to go tojust one primaryhealthfacility inorder to
receive health care for her children andherself. For gynecologicalproblems, she hadto
visit a women's consultation clinic; for contraception, a marriage and family clinic; for
venereological problems, a dermatovenereal clinic; andfor HIV testing, an AIDS clinic
(World Bank, 1996).

1.7     The system ofhealthfinancingperpetuated these inefficiencies. Budgetingnorms
based on physical capacity (numbers o f beds or numberso f doctors) encouraged
overstaffing, provision o fmore beds than dictated by medical need, and increased
utilizationo f in-patientservices. Combined with a rigidly enforced 18-line budgeting
system usedto pay medical care providers(hospitals and polyclinics), there were no
incentives for primary care providers to use cost-effective ambulatory treatment protocols
or to perform a "gate-keeping" function o f screening inappropriate referrals. The reliance
on capacity-basedbudgetingpromotedinefficiency and waste. The impact o fthese
inefficiencies was exacerbated by the low levels o fhealth spending: US$156 per capita in
1990 (usingpurchasing power parities), decliningto US$37 in 1993 (World Bank, 1996).
Inthe context ofthesedeclininglevels ofbudgetspending onhealthcare, a rise in
informal healthpayments duringthe post-Soviet period led to a rapidtransition from
universal, free-of-charge accessto health services to a de facto fee-for-service system.

1.8     Health indicators are poor, with the country facing the double challenge o f
controlling highrates o f communicable andnon-communicable diseases simultaneously.
Inadditionto highrates ofchildhoodmortality dueto infectiousdiseases, the Kyrgyz
Republic also has very highrates o f adult mortality largely due to cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and injuries(Jakab and Manjieva, 2007). Inthe early 1990s, there were
significant increases inthe incidence o fhighly infectious diseases such as TB and STIs.

1.9     Infantmortality in2006 was 29.8 deathsper 1,000 live births, andmaternal
mortality was 41.6 deaths per 100,000 live births. Although there has beena significant
improvement inthese indicators since the mid-1990s (Figure 1.l), assessments
                                                                     most
doubt that Kyrgystanwill achieve its MillenniumDevelopment Goals by the target date
o f2015. Differencesacross regions are significant, with the high/low ratio between

                                                                3


regions for the infantmortality rate (IMR)in2004 at 2.1 (Figure 1.2). An increase inthe
reported IMRandunder-fivemortality rate (USMR) in2004 resulted from the countr 's
mid-2003 adoption ofthe World HealthOrganization (WHO) definition of live birth.                                        Y
The current reality is probably still not capturedaccurately by official statistics due to
mandatory investigations withpotentially severe disciplinary consequencesafter maternal
andchilddeaths; insome cases, hospitals haverefusedto admit pregnantwomen ifthe
riskof deathinhospital is perceivedto behigh.

2 The WHO definitionof a live birth (fiom whichthe infantmortality rate is calculated), adoptedin 1950
andusedinmost developedand developingcountries, is as follows: "The complete expulsion or extraction
fromits mother of a product of conception, irrespectiveofthe durationofthe pregnancy, which, after such
separation,breathes or shows any other evidenceof life, suchas beatingofheart, pulsationofthe umbilical
cord, or definitemovementof voluntarymuscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has beencut or the
placentais attached." The SovietUnionmaintainedanalternate and less rigorousdefinition of a live birth,
classifyingonly breathingas a signoflife, and presuminginfantswho were bornbefore the end of28
weeks of gestation, or who weighedless than 1,000 grams at birth(there is considerable overlap
betweenthesetwo groups), to benon-viable. These were not countedas live birthsuntilthey surviveda
full sevendays (or 168hours). Ifthey survived for less thanthis time, they were consideredto be
miscarriagesandnotcountedat all, resultinginlower reportedinfantmortality ratesthanwouldhavebeen
the case underWHO reportingguidelines (AleshinaandRedmond, 2003).

1.10    According to the 1997 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), infantmortality
was 1.8 times higher inthe poorestquintile than inthe wealthiest, childmortality was
twice as high, and the stuntingrate was 2.4 times higher. Self-reported illhealth,
however, has been significantlyhigher for richer than for poorer households according to
household surveys taken since 2001,with 1.6 percent o f adults inthe poorest quintile in
2007 reporting anepisode o f acute illhealth inthe last 30 days compared to 4.6 percent
among the richest quintile (this i s a decrease fiom 2001,when 13.3 percent o fthe poorest
quintile and 26.6 percent o fthe richest quintilereported similar episodes) (WHODfID,
2007b). In2000, there were similar inequities inhealth services utilization: the
utilization ratio o fthe poorest to the richest quintiles for primaryhealth care services was
25, and for hospitalization it was 3 5 . In2001, per capita health expenditures were 2-5
times higher inBishkekthaninother, more rural oblasts inthe country. This funding gap
had increased by 2003 betweenBishkekandthe country's poorest regions (Batken,
Naryn, and Talas; WHODflD, 2005).

1.11    Inresponseto these challenges, the government initiateda series ofmeasures
aimedat improving the performance o fthe public sector. Prominent among these was
the adoptioninlate 1996ofaten-year programfor healthsystemsreformknownas the
Manas strategy, designedto runfrom 1996through 2005. The key goals o f the Manas
planwere to redress imbalances inthe healthcare delivery network and strengthen its
orientation toward preventive andprimaryhealth care; to improve equity inresource
allocation; and to address financial and non-financialconstraints impactingthe
accessibility o f health services.

Box 1-1: The ManasHealthReform Strategy

From 1994through 1996,the Governmentworked together with WHOEURO, the UnitedNations
DevelopmentProgram(UNDP), and TICA, the Turkish developmentagency, financedby aUS$300,000
UNDP grant, to create aten-year (1996-2005)health systemreformprogram known as the MANAS
program(named after a famous Kyrgyz leader, aboutwhom the 1000-year-oldnational epic poem "Manas"
was written). Adopted by the Governmentin 1996,the program defined four broad goals: health gain,
equity, efficiency and effective andhighquality health care. Itsprogram elements were focusedon (i)
improvingthe health ofthe population and access to care; (ii)  reducing disparitiesinhealth; (iii)
guaranteeingthe population's access to existing health services; (iv) improvingthe effectivenessand
quality of care provided by the health system; and (v) increasingthe responsibility of citizens for their own
health, while protecting patients' rights.

The ManasProgramalso establishedspecific objectivesto be achievedduring the first severalyears of
implementation,particularly relatedto a focus on reorienting the health systemtowards primary care and
away from specializedhospital care. This shift was to be supportedby areallocation ofthe Government's
healthresources, accompanied by areduction inthe number ofhospital beds andthe closure of some
hospitals. The goal was to improve the quality of care at all levels, updating and standardizingclinical
practicesfor examinationandtreatment andprotocols for referral to in-patient care. Inaddition, new
managementmodels were to be developedfor hospitalsas abasis for greater managerialautonomy inthe
future, supportedby new management structures and information systems.

The World Bank's first and second HealthReformProjectswere explicitly designedto implement key
elements ofthe ManasProgram. While the ManasProgramprovided a coherent policy fiamework for
personalhealth care services (both preventive and curative), the publicpolicy fi-ameworkfor public health
services was not as well developed, and little change was envisionedfor the content or organizationof
these services or inthe SanitaryEpidemiological Services (SES) Departmentof the MOH(World Bank,
1996 and2001).


WORLDBANKSUPPORT

1.12     The Kyrgyz Republicjoined the World Bank in 1992. Since then, the Bankhas
financed projects ranging from landreform, which distributedthe lando f former
collective farms to small, private farmers, to village investmentand water management
improvement. Inthe social sectors, the Bank completed a US$ 36 million Social Sector
Adjustment Credit from 1998-2000intendedto establish a sustainable pension scheme,
improve the effectiveness o f labor market interventionsunder conditions o fhigh
unemployment, and implement poverty alleviation programs3 Infiscal year (FY) 2006,
new World Bank commitments to the country were US$38 million, with overall
commitments for active projects totaling US$232 million (see Annex E).

PARTI:PROJECTASSESSMENT

2. HEALTHSECTOR REFORMPROJECT

BACKGROUND CONTEXT AND

2.1      The healthcare financing and delivery systemwas, in 1996, at the time ofproject
preparation, still a vestige o fthe centrally planned Soviet system. The efficiency and
quality o fthe system were low. An input-based budgeting system still allocated funds to
health facilities based on the number o fbeds and staff positions, with no consideration o f
actual quality or results of services provided. Managers were not permitted to re-allocate
funds across eighteen line-item budget categories (personnel, drugs, utilities, etc.) without
a cumbersome permission process. Resources were wasted due to continued
overemphasis on specialized in-patient care.

2.2      The Ministry of Health (MOH) received significant technical assistance from the
WHO Regional Office for Europe beginningin 1994 for the development and
implementation o fthe Manas health reformprogram. Also in 1994, the UnitedStates
Agency for International Development (USAID) beganto support an initial health reform
pilot project inone ofthe country's regions (Issyk-Kul) through its ZdravReform
program. USAID's work was closely aligned with the development o fthe Manas
program, and many o fthe specific measures implementedinIssyk-Kul became a part o f
the Manas strategy. Numerousother donors, includingthe World Bank, became involved
inthe healthsectorbeginningin1995-1996, andthe Manasprogrambecame the umbrella
for all the international andbilateral organizations working inthe health sector inthe
country. As a result o fpre-project consultations, the roles o fUNICEF- and IDA-
supported projects inthe area o f ARUCDD were better defined, andthe overall
contributions o f GTZ were delineated, so that promotional activities inadult health
lifestyles and family healthwould complement and support one another. Prior to the
Bank's involvement, no other donor hadundertakenany serious, comprehensive, and
sustainable activity to support tuberculosis control (Annex E).

OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

2.3      The objective o fthe HealthSector ReformProject (referred to hereafter as Health
I) thereformandimprovementofthehealthcaresystem,through(i)
    was                                                                               improvement o f
the health status o fthe population; (ii)        improvement o fthe clinical effectiveness o fthe
service delivery system; (iii)       improvement o fthe economic efficiency o fthe delivery
system; (iv) extension o f access of appropriate care; and(v) assuranceo f long-term
financial viability o fthe ~ystern.~

2.4      The HealthSector Reform Project includedfour components, plusfunding for a
separate component for project administration:



  ``Reform and improvement o f the health care system" is considered here to be a summary statement o f the
objectives that follow, and it is therefore not evaluated separately here.

                                              7


   a) Primarv Health Care (US$3.5 million. 17.4 percent o fproiect costs), meantto
   reorient health services away from hospitals andtoward upgraded primary health care
   (PHC) centers. Ithadthree subcomponents: strengthening women's reproductive
   healthmanagement, acute respiratory infection and diarrhea disease control, and
   tuberculosis control. Interventionsinthis component includedproviding training to
   upgrade the skills o fprimaryhealth care workers, providing primaryhealthcare
   facilities with basic equipment, ensuringthose facilities an adequate supply o f drugs,
   andmakingavailable culturally appropriate printedmaterials for the general public on
   the home management ofA N anddiarrheal diseases.

   b) FacilitiesRehabilitation (US$2.2 million, 10.9 percent ofproject costs), meant to
   improve the capacity o fthe M O Hto maintainbuildingsand equipmentand to
   facilitate the shift o f emphasis from curative to ambulatory and preventive care. The
   project financed the improvement o f 30 ambulatory centers and the conversiono f 30
   rural hospitals into polyclinics, with additional equipment and supplies provided to
   ensure the efficient performance o fthe renovatedconverted facilities.

   c) Medical Care Provider Pavment (US$7.3 million, 36.3 percent o fproiect costs),
   aimed at implementingprovider payment reforms that separatedpayment for care
   fiom delivery o f care. The payer would thenfocus on paying for the best care at the
   lowest cost, on purchasing care rather thanmanaging andmaintaining facilities.
   Providers would be financially accountable for more efficiency and higher-quality
   care. Interventions inthis component includedtraining o fhealthpersonnel innew
   provider payment mechanisms (capitation-based payments to clinics, and case-based
   payments to hospitals made only after referral from the primary-care level) and the
   management o f clinics.

   d) Pharmaceutical Management (US$3.9 million, 19.4 percent o fproject costs),
   meantto improve the availability of essential drugs directly, by financing
   procurement and distribution o fessential drugs, and indirectly, by supporting reforms
   that strengthened government regulation and rational and appropriate use o f drugs.
   This component includedrenovations to the premises o fthe national drug regulatory
   organization, technical assistance and training for its staff, broad dissemination o f
   information on drugregulation to health care officials around the country,
   development and widespread dissemination o f a national Essential Drugs List,
   training o f health care officials and managers on the goals and rationale for an
   Essential Drugs Program (EDP), development o f newtreatment guidelines based on
   the EDP, and procurement and distribution o f a significant quantity o f essential drugs.

   e) Proiect Administration (US$0.6 million, 3.0 percent o fproject costs), for
   supporting and ensuringeffective administration o fproject activities.

2.5    The designofHealth Itook place at the same time that the Government was
crafting the Manas program, and therefore the two emerged deliberately inparallel, with
the Bank-financedproject forming the backbone o f Manas program implementation.
Although the WHO andthe Bank worked handinhandwith Government duringproject

                                                      8


preparation, ultimately the leadwas taken by Government.' As a result, the MOH
claimed strong ownership o fthe project and o fthe reforms, with the project based not on
WHO opinion or Bankopinion, but Government opinion. The project was explicitly
designedto introducemodernmethods o f clinical practice andprovider payment
(separatingpurchase and payment for services from delivery o f care), while at the same
time preservingthe major positive features o f the Soviet-era centrally planned system,
most notably universal accessto care and a relatively equitable distribution o f health
resources.

2.6      Intendedcoverage varied among the components. The primaryhealth care
component was plannedto be nationwide, focusing onthe primaryhealth care facilities
offering health care to all o fthe country's 43 rayons outside o f Bishkek. The tuberculosis
activities underthe PHC component were to be piloted inBishkek, Issyk-Kul, and Chui
duringthe first year ofthe project, with expansion to Narynand Talas duringthe second
year andto the rest o fthe country duringyear 3. The provider payment component, by
contrast, was plannedonly for Bishkek and Chui, extending models that hadbeenpiloted
inIssyk-Kulunderthe auspicesofUSAID.

2.7      The project was designed to strengthen primaryand ambulatory service delivery
as a precursor to in-patient capacity reduction. While recognizing the necessity o f
hospital facility and staff rationalization, the project preparation team didnot think it was
reasonable to include an explicit, pre-defined facility and staff rationalization program
withintheproject itself, particularly givenlimitedimplementationcapacity andlikely
political opposition. At the time, ODA was developing a detailed facility rationalization
planfor BishkekCity, andthe Manasprogram contained amaster planfor facility
rationalization, but the Bank remained uncertainthat these efforts would be sufficient to
buildthe political will inGovernment necessary to undertakephysical andhuman
resource rationalization. Itwas intendedthat the new provider payment mechanisms
financed by the project would furnishthe necessary incentives (financial) to promote
primaryandout-patient care while eliminating unnecessary in-patientbedcapacity. The
project's facilities rehabilitation component was explicitly intendedto assist the
Governmentinthe repair, rehabilitation, andreutilization of existing structures andplant
rather thanthe development o f new andunnecessary capital investmentprojects. The
project's pharmaceutical component was intendedto make sufficient drugs available at
the primarycare level andtherefore supportdecreasedhospital utilization.

2.8      The overall implementationandadministrationo fthe project were the
responsibility o fthe MOH. Policy advice was provided by a Project Policy Council
(PPC), formed inJuly 1995 to oversee the policies undertaken by the M O H and other



  Inthe KyrgyzRepublic,there existsawide range ofopinion onthe explanationfor the emergenceof
strongand sustained Governmentcommitmentto progressivehealthreform, including the existenceof a
small but committed group of "champions" ofreform who were responsiblefor the creationofthe Manas
Program. Some respondentsattribute the commitment to reformto the Kyrgyz nomadic culture, rendering
the country naturally more opento new ideasthanits neighbors. Otherscite the extremepoverty inthe
country during the immediatepost-Sovietperiod, claiming that the country hadno choice but to adopt
strategies to use its scarce resourcesmore efficiently. The unique presence of severalstrongKyrgyz
"policy entrepreneurs" who were able to collaborateeffectively with donors was clearly a major factor.

entities involved inproject implementation. The PPC was chaired by the Minister of
Health and includedM O H deputy ministers, representatives from other M O H
departments, regionalmedical officials, representatives from the medical and
pharmaceutical communities, anda representative from the Ministryo f Finance.

2.9     The Technical Coordination Committee (TCC), formed inAugust 1995, managed
the technical implementationo f the project and served as the secretariat o f the PPC.
Functioningon a permanentbasis duringthe course o fthe project, the TCC formulated
andrecommended for approval any policy reforms associated withthe project;
coordinated activities among the components; and coordinated the project's activities
withother donors inthe healthsector. The TCC also coordinated the budgetplanningand
control o fproject funds. Itwas composed o f a full-time Director and four technical
Component Coordinators assigned to the four functional areas o f activity under the
project (primary health care, pharmaceutical management, medical care provider
payment, and facilities management).

2.10    The Project CoordinationUnit (PCU) o fthe Bank's Social Safety Net Project
served as the procurement and administrative consultant of the MOHfor Health I.The
PCUserved the specific needs o fthe project with administrative functions required for
project management and implementation; it was expected that this arrangementwould
cost considerably less than setting up a separate PCU inthe MOH. The PCUwas
specifically charged with responsibility for procurement, finance and accounting,
disbursements, reporting, design and implementation o f a system o f supervision o f civil
works, and accounting training on-site for M O Hpersonnel.

IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS

PlannedVersus Actual Costs andFinancing

2.11    Health Iwas approved on May 14, 1996 and became effective on June 1,1996.
O fthe original amount of the credit (US$19.9 million), US$18.5 million was actually
disbursed, with more spent thaninitially plannedonprovider paymentreform andless
thaninitially plannedspent onprimary healthcare andproject administration (see Annex
C). The project closed three months later than scheduled, on September 1,2002. As a
rule, counterpart funds were delivered infull and on time, although delays inreceiving
counterpart funds at one point ledto training sessions at the rayon level beingcancelled
(November 1998-July 1999).

ImplementationExperience

2.12    Introduction of health insurance. The project did not initially specify the creation
o f a nationwideMandatory Health Insurance Fund, as the provider payments component
was plannedto be introduced only to the City o f Bishkek and Chui Oblast. Inadditionto
the plannedformation o ffamily group practices and supporting the implementationof
appropriate provider payments mechanisms inthose regions, however, it was recognized
that a single-payer fundingmechanism would have to be established inorder to
consolidate limitedpublic sector funds and develop risk pooling mechanisms. In 1997,
the Mandatory HealthInsurance Fund(MHIF)was introducedwith a small payrolltax

                                               10


contribution collected from the economically active population (employees, the self-
employed and agricultural workers). Pensioners were funded from the pensionfund, and
the registeredunemployed were financed through the unemployment fund. These monies
were collected by the Social Fund, which was to make appropriate transfers to the MHIF.
By 1999, coverage hadreachedonly 30 percent due to anarray of impediments: lack o f
trust inthe insurance system, limited employment inthe formal sector, and low tax
compliance. By 2000, coverage reached 70 percent, as the Republican budget beganto
fundinsurance contributions for childrenunder the age of 16 and social welfare
recipients. Interms o fthe specifics o f coverage, the benefits o fthe insured didnot differ
dramatically from those of the uninsured; the real benefit o fthe introduction o f the MHIF
was at first institutional, inthat it permittedgradual introduction o f output-based
purchasing mechanisms ina previously input-based environment (WHOiDfID,2005).

2.13     Impact of thefinancial crisis. The mainexternal factor impactingproject
implementationwas the devaluation o fthe som followingthe economic crisis inRussia
inthe summer of 1998(almost 70percent in1998andover 50percent in1999against
the US dollar) (National Bank o fthe Kyrgyz Republic, 2002). The crisis affected the
allocation andtimeliness o fpayments o f counterpart funds insome instances, but most
importantly it impactedthe pharmaceutical component. Inflationand the deteriorating
exchange rate underminedthe drug distribution scheme that hadbeen established, as it
became increasingly expensive for the distributors to participate becausethe loan and
interest rate were denominated indollars rather than soms. The dollar-denominated
drugs also became increasingly expensive andmore difficult to sell. Because o fthese
factors, the distribution scheme for the third lot o f drugs was abandoned. Eventually, all
drugs were distributedwithout lossesdue to expiry; after havingexhausted a number o f
incentive schemes for distributors, the drugs were distributed free to hospitals.

2.14     Political economy. Resistance to efforts to rationalize the health sector was
anticipated from medical professionals and auxiliary staff fearingjob loss (particularly in
the Republic-level tertiary facilities inBishkek),andalso from usersincatchment areas
o f facilities being closed. Itwas recognized duringproject design that the Government
would needassistance inconsulting with various constituencies such as doctors, other
medical staff, users inurbanand rural areas, M O H staff, Parliament, and others, to
develop support for rationalization, designa compensation package, identify retraining
opportunities, disseminate information on the need for rationalization, and generally to
builda consensusonthe issue. The project countered muchpotential resistance through
the creation o f institutions that could effectively lobby potentially recalcitrant groups on
behalf o freform (the Family Group Practice Association, Hospital Association, and
Licensing andAccreditation Commission).

2.15      Some resistance from Government was also expected to the treatment o f some
social groups with STIs on an anonymous ambulatory basis andto the shift to
internationally-recognized standards for treatment of TB, botho f which were part o fthe
PHC component. The project built infinancial incentives for case detectionand cure of
TB patients to counter this resistance, including a 60 sompayment to aprimary health
worker who manages a smear-positive TB patient to a documented cure, and a 30 som
payment for the management o f a smear-negative patient after treatment completion.

2.16   Impact ofgovernmental reorganization. InJanuary 2000, oblast-level health
departmentswere eliminated as a part ofa more general, unanticipatedcivil service
reform. The M O Hresponded rapidly and strategically to this decision, using it as an
opportunity to further strengthen the healthinsurance mechanism. Oblast health
department economic, financial, accounting, information, and quality control functions
were transferred to the Oblast Health Insurance Funds, creating a single-payer health
purchaser institutional structure at the regional level comparable to that already
established at the national level.

OUTPUT AND OUTCOMES BY OBJECTIVE

2.17    A number oftheproject-sponsored activities contributed significantly to the
achievement o fmore thanone o fthe project's objectives. Here the activities will be
notedunder the objective to which they contributed most strongly, withreference to them
inthe discussion ofother objectives for whichthey were also important.

Improvementof the healthstatus of the population

2.18    The project implementeda number o f activities posited to affect health status.
National policies and programs on women's reproductive healthand tuberculosis were
developed under the auspices o fthe project. Clinical protocols were introduced and/or
updated for a cluster o fprimaryhealth care services, including women's reproductive
health, acute respiratory infections (ARI),chronic diarrheal disease (CDD), and
tuberculosis (TB) (years o f adoption not specified). Approximately 1,000 health
personnel, primarilygynecologists, neonatologists, andprimaryhealth care specialists,
were trained inSafe Maternity and Childhood Programs, and about 300 were trained in
protocols for ARI/CDD; this represented nationwide coverage o fthe country's 43 rayon
hospitals. The project trained anunspecifiednumbero fhealthpersonnel inmodern
methods o f TB control, including DOTS, anda system o f incentives (described earlier)
was put inplace to encourage healthpersonnel to adhere to the latest clinical protocols
for the detection and treatment of TB. Project funds refurbished and equipped a
decentralized network o ftraining institutes.

2.19    A numberof improvedhealthoutcomes canplausibly be linkedto these activities.
Duringthe life ofthe project (1996-2002), the IMRdeclinedfrom 25.9 to 21.2 per
thousand live births; of the major causes o f infant mortality, the infant mortality rate from
asphyxia declined from 23.8 in 1994 to 15.2 in 1999, and the infant mortality rate from
ART declined by 41 percent (from 25.4 cases in 1996 to 13.3 in2000). The number o f
cases o f early post-natal bleedingdeclined by 47 percent (25.4 cases/1,000 women in
1996, to 13.3 cases/1,000 in2000), and the maternal mortality rate declined (from 65 per
100,000 birthsin 1996to 45.9 in2000, but then up to 58.4 in2002). Tuberculosis
incidence, which hadbeenincreasing since shortly after independence, continued to rise
until2001,whenitdroppedsharply (Figure 2.1). While itis likelythat some ofthe
increase i s due to improvedreporting as a result ofthe project, the trend i s also affected
bythe fact that new cases among prisoners were addedto the reporting system from 1999
onward. However,the increase inthe reportednumber o f cases did not result inhigher
mortality, which i s consistent with more effective treatment.

2.20     Because o fthe many donors involved inthe country over this time period,
becausethe healthcare system(which was the focus o fthis project) i s only one o f many
determinants o f health status, andbecausethe project did not provide for evaluation
techniques that would have allowed comparison o f health status among groups exposed
to project interventions compared to those who were not, it is difficult to attribute any
results directly to project activities. However, the project-fundedprograms in
reproductive health, childhood illnesses, andtuberculosis were by far the largest
interventions targeted at these diseases duringthis time period.6

Improvement o f the clinical effectiveness of the service delivery system

2.21     This objective is defined here as improvement inthe quality o fhealthcare
services. To some extent, this objective could be interpreted as a contributor to the
achievement o fthe first objective, improvement o f the health status o fthe population.

2.22     Interventions aimed at improving clinical effectiveness included clinical protocols
beingintroducedand enhanced, as described above, for AM, CDD, TB, and sexually
transmittedinfections. Underthe new family practice mechanism, providers were made
autonomous and accountable to consumers for their performance. Printed materials were
also made available to the general public on the home management o f A M and diarrheal
diseases. The project also provided for modernization o f bacteriological services o f pilot
TB facilities, andit supplieddrugs for free treatment of all newly disclosed TB patients.


6UNICEF donatedemergency drugs for winter and summer programsand fknded some training ofhealth
workers on control ofA M and CDD. WHO provided ongoingtechnical assistanceon TB control.

                                              13


Newlaws were passed: "On residents' protection against TB" (April 1998); "On
reproductive health" (January 2000); and "On prevention o f iodine deficiency diseases"
(February 2000). Rehabilitationwas completed in72 facilities inBishkekand Chui (12
more than the originally-planned 60), including capital repairs andprovision o f modem
equipment.

2.23    Presumably as a result o f these interventions, the percentage o f caretakers o f
children under five years o f age with diarrhea who knew how to make and administer
oral rehydrationtherapy (ORT) rose from 20 percent to 93 percent over the life o f the
project, andthe percentage o f childrenunder 5 with ARI treated at a family medicine
clinic who received correct treatment rose from 10 percent to 95 percent. A project-
sponsored evaluation inthe fourth year o f the facility rehabilitation effort indicated that
themedicalequipmentpurchasedthroughthe projectwas beingusedproperly (World
Bank, 2001).

2.24    However, TB diagnostics bythe bacteriologicalmethodremained low, withthe
percentage of patients discovered at the primary care level through bacteriological
analysis o f smear at 1.1percent (the WHO norm i s no less than 10percent), and the
country's regulatory framework continuedto require in-patienttreatment o f TB patients,
incontradictionto the DOTSprogram; physicians continued to debateappropriate
treatment methods inother areas as well.

Improvement of the economic efficiency of the delivery system

2.25    Project activities includedestablishing the basis o f an effective healthinsurance
system that pools resources within a single purchaser, withthe MHIFas the purchaser
now separate from the providers o fhealth services, andreimbursement o fproviders in
some regions basedon capitationat the out-patient level and case-basedpayments in
hospitals. The foundation for modernprovider paymentmechanisms, initially pilotedby
USAIDinIssyk-Kuloblast, was enhanced bythe project andtakento the next stage of
implementationinChui Oblast and Bishkek City. A modemManagement Information
Systemwas established to connect purchasers and providers and to track health
indicators.

2.26    Equally importantly, the
foundation was laid for                Figure2-2: Adults and ChildrenVisitingFamily
comprehensive restructuring o f        MedicineClinic inIssyk-Kul
the primary care sector through
the establishment of new primary
care group practices (Family
Group Practices, or FGPs); these
were established inall regions.
These FGPs are independent
health facilities, accessedby free
choice o fthe population and an
open enrollment process, subject
to reimbursement basedon
financial incentives for quality

                                              14


andcost-effectiveness of care. Inaccord with internationalbest practices, family
physicians were trained to treat adults, pregnantwomen, and children (Figure 2.2). By the
endo fthe project period, there were 798 FGPs inoperation: 106 inBishkekCity, 144 in
Chui, 72 inIssyk-Kul, 38 inTalas, 57 inNaryn, 175 inOsh, 142 inJalal-Abad, and 64 in
Batken. The project providedthese centers with a minimumset o f equipment and
instruments, computers, and office equipment. From 80-95 percent o fthe population in
these oblasts were enrolled inFGPs by the end of the project, due inpartto an extensive
public informationcampaign that reached about 400,000 people. Inaddition, 1,362
doctors and 889 nurses were trained infamily medicine, and 90 people were certified as
family medicine trainers, inthree-month, full-timetraining courses. Ninety-nine percent
o fthe trainers and 87 percent o fthe physicians trained were tested and received
certificates. Additional shorter workshops were offered to approximately 10,000
professionals inall regions.

2.27     The project also supported the development o f a network o f non-governmental
organizations to support and sustain these reforms and to strengthen the autonomy o f
health facilities: the Family Group Practice Association (FGPA), the Hospital
Association (HA), and the Licensing-Accreditation Commission(LAC). Each o fthese
was instrumentalincreating and sustaining the new provider paymentmechanisms, inthe
contractingprocess betweenproviders and the MHIF, and inthe evaluation andquality
control function. Over the life o fthe project, the L A C licensed and accredited 78 multi-
profile in-patient facilities, 13 rural catchment area hospitals, 19 multi-profile out-patient
facilities, and 425 FGPs.

2.28     Although there were challenges facing the pharmaceutical sector, as described
above, the introduction o f a management structure and of a legislative andpolicy
framework contributedto the process o fprivatization o fthe pharmaceutical market. In
particular, the project's development and operationalizationo f an Essential DrugsList in
1996, along withthe emergence o f ten new distributors on the national market duringthe
project period (bringingthe total to fifteen), contributed to greater competition and a
resultingdrop inthe prices ofessential drugs.

2.29     A wide range ofoutcomes are positedto have resulted fromthese project
activities. By June 2000, 3.4 millioncitizens, or about 73 percent of the total population,
including retired and unemployedpeople, children, and people receivingsocial benefits,
were insuredby the MHIF(Figure2.3). This achievement, while an indicator of
increased access to the health care system, i s more relevant to efficiency inthis case; the
state budgetwas still accounting for the majority of public health spending, and therefore
the MHIFwas initially aimednot at improvingaccess so muchas buildingthe
efficiencies inherent ina single-payer model. A total of 66 hospitals and 403 family
practice centers (representing almost complete coverage inIssyl-Kul and Chui) were
operating inthe MHIF system andwere financed according to the new provider
reimbursementmethods; bythe end o fthe project, morethan 800,000 hospital cases were
processed according to the newhospital payment system. As a result ofthe new
incentive structures, there was significant capacity reduction inin-patient healthcare
facilities inIssyk-Kuland Chui (Figure 2.4). New provider payment mechanisms were
introducedinthese regions duringthe project period, and pooled financing for health care

2.30    There was a stable and consistent decline inthe average lengtho fhospital stay
(ALOS) over the life o fthe project, although ALOS also declinedinnon-project hospitals
where the new payment mechanisms were not yet introduced, and it had begun declining
before the project was effective, calling into question the attribution o fthese outcomes to
the project-sponsored activities (it has been speculated that decrease inALOS can also be
attributed to the demand by hospital personnel for informal payments, driving down
hospitalizationrates and lengths o f stay). A regional analysis, however, indicates that
ALOS declined more dramatically inthose regions where the new provider payment
mechanisms were first introduced (Issyk-Kul and Chui), indicating that the project-
sponsoredreforms had a demonstrable impact (Figure 2.6).

2.31    There was also a significant decline inself-referrals to in-patient facilities
participating inthe newpayment system duringthe project period- a 58 percent decline
between August 1997 and August 1999 - indicating that the population was making
greater use o fmore efficient primary care, and/or that the hospitals were responding to
financial disincentives to admit self-referred patients. As o fAugust 1999, the self-
referral rate for hospitals participating inthe MHIF system was 11percent, compared to
26 percent for hospitals not participating inthe system.

Extension of access to appropriate care

2.32    The family medicine reforms, while contributing significantly to enhanced
efficiency, also contributedto improved access to appropriate care. Familygroup
practices were supplied with equipment and with essential drugs for maternal health
protection and TB,enhancing the population's access to services delivered inappropriate
settings by practitioners trained inappropriate clinical protocols. Inaddition, US$ 8.3
millionworth o f drugs we1 :procured and distributed, the first lot through private
distributors, and the secon and third (due to the impact o fthe financial crisis) directly to
hospitals at no charge.

2.33    The introductiono fnew ambulatory alternatives to in-patient care should have
enabled the poor, who may not have been able to afford costs associated with in-patient
care (lost wages, food, bedlinens, etc.) to access treatment they may otherwise have
foregone. Specific data collection andanalysis to demonstrate this increased access,
however, was not performed. Improved services at primary care facilities should also
have reduced transportation costs (time andmaterial) that patients would have borne to
access in-patient care at the more centralized tertiary care institutions. Public resources,
however, remained insufficient to cover pharmaceutical needs, with patients still forced
to pay out-of-pocket and substandard counterfeit drugs still estimated at 25 percent o f
drug consumption.

2.34    The project appears not to have monitoredthe potential impact on accessto
medically appropriate care o fthe newprovider payment mechanisms and their
disincentives for in-patient admissions.

Assurance of long-runfinancialviabilityofthe healthcare system

2.35    The rationalizationo fthe healthcare system's structure andprovider payment
mechanisms i s intended to assure more efficient use o f scarce resources; this increase in
efficiency contributes to the long-run financial viability o fthe system by increasingthe
viability o fthe system evenduringpossible future periods o fresource scarcity. Despite
the Government's clear commitment to the principles o f reform, however, the overall
economic and budgetary environment remainedunstable, and it was unclear that the
Government would be able to sustain many o fthe activities essential to the project's
success. Health spending as a percentage o f GDP declined from 3.1 percent in 1996to
2.2 percent in2002 (Meimanaliev et al., 2005). At project closing, it was also not clear
that most o fthe new private pharmaceutical distributors would be ina position to remain
inthe marketdue to the deteriorating economic situationandexchangerate losses.

PROJECT    RATINGS

Outcome

2.36    The outcome o fthe project as a whole, based on the relevance o f its objectives
and design and its efficacy andefficiency inmeetingthose objectives, is rated
Satisfactory (Table 2.1).

Relevance

2.37    The assessmento f relevance i s based on the relevance o f the objectives
themselves andthe relevance o fthe project's design inmeetingthose objectives. The
relevance o fthe objectives is uniformly high. The May 2007 Joint Country Support
Strategy (JCSS) for the Kyrgyz Republic7focuses on four areas identified inthe Country
Development Strategy as especially important for the achievement o f overarching goals;
thethirdofthose areasis "building sustainable humanandsocial capital through
improved health and education outcomes, including access to andimproving the quality
o fhealth, education, and social protection services." The JCSS also highlights the need
for progress inpublic financial management, improving effective public administration,
andlegalreform, all o fwhichwere core elements o fthe health system reforms. The
project's objectives are also highly relevantto the government's pursuit o fthe health-
related MillenniumDevelopment Goals: reducingmaternal and child mortality rates, and
stemming the spread o f infectious diseases.




7The JCSS was developedby the World Bank,the AsianDevelopmentBank, DfID,the Swiss Agency for
Developmentand Cooperation, and UnitedNationsAgencies.

Table 2.1: OutcomeRatings by Objective




2.38    The relevance o fthe project's designwas substantial. The project design concept
was very strong, reforming the provider payment system(thus increasingincentives to
shift careto the ambulatory level) while simultaneously strengtheningprimaryhealth
care through improving clinical practice, rehabilitating facilities, andmakingdrugsmore
available on an out-patient basis -ineffect, a multi-pronged approach to reversing
inefficiency inthe service delivery system. Careful cost-benefit analysis informed the
choice o f specific diseases and conditions targeted by the PHC component. The focus on
acute respiratory infections and diarrheal disease was appropriate, since in2004 almost
halfo f all infant deaths were due to AM, 26 percent were due to perinatal causes, and
another 10percent were due to severe diarrhea; pre-project analysis concludedthat an
A W C D D program was the most cost-effective healthinterventionto reduce IMR inthe
country.

2.39    The objectives map coherently onto the components (see Table 2.2), but there are
two objectives for which there were few or no indicators specified inthe monitoring and
evaluation plan. Inparticular, the project mighthave included more direct indicators for
access to appropriate care and for enhancing the long-term viability o fthe health care
system. Inaddition, there were no indicators to measure the impact o fthe quality
assurance system set up as part o fthe provider payment component to ensure that the
quality o f services was not compromised as care was shifted to the ambulatory sector
(and as primary health care services were integrated). For both HealthIand the follow-
on project, Health11, the formally specified indicators did not capture completely the
projects' achievements. The M&E system conducted a significant amount o f data
collection and analysis that was directly relevant to an assessment o fthe projects'
efficacy but not captured by the indicators.

2.40    Perhaps most importantly, the project's designwas based explicitly on the
Government's healthpolicy, so that the Bank could effectively facilitate the conversion
o fthe Government's objectives under the Manas strategy into a coherent and
implementable project plan. Indeed,the Government's Manas strategy itself contained
anunusually highlevel o ffeasibility analysis and implementationdetails, andthe Bank-
sponsored project was derivedsquarely and logically from this detailed set o f
Government priorities.

Efficacy

2.41       The efficacy o fmeeting each o fthe project objectives i s assessedas follows:
substantial efficacy inimproving the health status o fthe population and improving the
clinical effectiveness o fthe service delivery system; highefficacy inimproving the
economic efficiency o fthe delivery system; and modest efficacy inextending access to
appropriate care and assuring the long-term financial viability o fthe healthcare system.
Overall efficacy was therefore substantial.

Efficiency

2.42       The efficiency o f the project inmeeting its objectives i s also substantial. During
preparation, the team usedthe Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) methodology to
select for interventionthose medical conditions that represented the highest disease
burden,andto choose interventions that were both cost-effective andthat could be
provided inan out-patient setting. The focus on ambulatory care, and the explicit
redirection o f demandtoward an integrated, strengthened PHC level o f care, was
designed to demonstrate the potential for savings that would be released ifexcess in-
patient capacity were reduced. At the beginning o f the project, it was estimated that a 10
percent reduction inhospital admissions and average lengtho f hospital stay (ALOS), and
a concurrent 10percent increase inout-patient visits, would reduce the cost o f care by 13
percent; a 20 percent decreaseinin-patient visits and20 percent increase inout-patient
visits would reduce the cost of care by almost 25 percent. It was also estimated that the
successful adoption o fthe out-patient-based TB protocols could reduce the cost o f TB
treatment by 25-50 percent, primarily through a reduction inthe use o f costly in-patient
bed-days.

                                              21


2.43     Although specific analyses were not conducted to assess the realization o f
anticipated cost reductions, the project successfully shifted the provision o f care toward
the more cost-effective ambulatory sector. It i s reasonable to speculate that the
achievements inreduction o f ALOS and hospital admissions, along with the expansion o f
primarycare, produced meaningful efficiency gains. The project's activitiesbuilt
explicitly on the prior work o f other donors, most specifically USAIDfor the provider
payment reforms, inorder to avoid duplication o f effort and achieve maximumpossible
synergy. This project markedthe beginning o f what would be an ongoing habit o f donor
harmonization, permittingcost-effective use of human, physical, andfinancial resources
to facilitate healthreform.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

2.44     Riskto development outcome is ratedModerate. Manyo fthe project's activities
contained built-instrategies to ensure sustainability. For example, the training-of-trainers
model was designed to ensure that the education and development o f family health care
providers would outlive the project. The institutions developed, including the MHIF,
FGPA, HA, and LAC, created a robust foundation for the continuation o freform efforts;
through these institutions, those most directly affected by the reforms -health care
providers -have beengiven a direct stake inthe success o fthe reforms. Perhaps most
importantly, the strong Government support for the follow-on project, the Second Health
Sector Reform project, suggestedthat the reform process would bothpersist and deepen.

2.45     However, while there was little basis to question Government commitment to the
project's goals and methods, since these emerge directly from the Government's own
healthreform strategy, the availability o f resources to sustain the project's benefits
remained uncertain. Not only inthe Kyrgyz Republic, butthroughout the former Soviet
Union duringthis time period, the level o f financing directed to health suffered as federal
government divested responsibility and financial support to strugglingregional and local
government, and as central financial authorities were under pressure from international
financial institutions with regard to fiscal deficits. Because o f declining budgets, as the
project closed, there were concerns about the operations andmaintenance o f rehabilitated
facilities, and some facilities lackedthe spare parts necessary to operate equipment
procuredwith project funds. The overall economic situation inthe country remained
volatile, and the M O Hwas not well-positioned to argue for an increased share o fthe
national budget.

BankPerformance

2.46     BankPerformance is ratedHighly Satisfactory.

2.47     Quality at Entryi s rated Highly Satisfactory. The Bank intervenedat a
strategically important time, taking advantage o f Government initiative and commitment
to facilitate a deep and lasting reform process. A detailed burden-of-disease analysis was
combined with cost-effectiveness analysis to identifythose areas where the health status
o fthe population could be promoted through ambulatory care inthe most cost-effective
possible manner (thepossibility o f gaining the greatest number o f DALYsfor the lowest
cost). Careful analysis informedthe selection o fproject regions for activities that were

                                                22


not plannedto be nationwide; for example, Chui and Bishkek were chosen as the sites for
theprovider payment reformsbecauseo ftheir relatively dense, urbanpopulations, their
relative affluence, the relative sophistication o ftheir medical institutions andpersonnel,
the relative excess o fmedical care providers, their proximity to health sector leadership
andtechnical coordinating staff (Bishkek is the capital, and Chui is the region
surrounding the capital), andtheir geographic contiguousness. The Bank also made
explicit efforts to incorporate the lessons o f other donors into the design o f the project,
particularly with regard to the provider payment component, which was a direct
extension o f a USAID-fundeddemonstration project inIssyk-Kul.

2.48    A significant amount o fanalytic work was carried out to support the design o fthe
project, including an October 1994 assessmento fthe existing sexually transmitted
diseases program inthe country, a March 1995 analysis o fthe tuberculosis situation, a
June 1995 report on maternal and perinatalhealth, a July 1995 report on existing
AFWCDD programs, and several 1995 reports on health spending.

2.49    Quality o f Supervision i s ratedHighly Satisfactory. At several points during
implementation, when there was a conflict with elements withinthe Government who
wantedto move ina direction contrary to what had initially beenplanned,the Bank stood
its ground untilkey issues were resolved. Throughout, the task managers were willing to
wield the leverage o f Bank support to make sure that implementationremained on track.
Bankstaffmight havepaid even greater attention to the political economy o fchange,
specifically the receptivity o f major political groups to the reforms, and public education
and outreach programs requiredto reach interested stakeholders, including the general
public.

Borrower Performance

2.50    Borrower Performance i s ratedHighly Satisfactory.

2.5 1   Government performance i s rated Highly Satisfactory. Certainly the most critical
contributiono fthe Borrower was the fact and substance o fthe Manas healthreform plan
around which the project was built. A small handfulo f key Kyrgyz players, including an
eventual Minister o fHealth and an eventual General Director o fthe MHIF, were
instrumental throughout: they initiatedthe creation of the Manas strategy, brought donors
into the conversation and coordinated donor activities throughout the life o f the project,
sustained the intellectual andpolitical energy driving the reforms, and steered the reforms
through sometimes turbulentpolitical waters. They served as archetypal "champions" o f
reform. Despite difficult challenges to the overall reformprogram, including the almost-
constant risk o f availability o f counterpart funds, these champions managed to keep
healthreform highon the political agendaand successfully defended against political
attack.

2.52    Implementingagency performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The M O H
handledseveral specific potentially catastrophic situations with considerable political and
administrative skill, most notably the elimination of the oblast-level healthdepartments in
January o f2000. The MOHand TCC were similarly assiduous inmonitoring the

                                              23


distribution o f drugs duringthe complicated implementation o fthe pharmaceutical
program, with all o f the drugs eventually distributed andno losses due to expiry.

Monitoring and Evaluation

2.53    Monitoring and evaluation i s rated Substantial.

2.54    M&EDesignisratedModest. The M&Edesigncontained a comprehensive and
detailed set o f input, output, and outcome indicators for each component to be monitored
throughout the life of the project, including specification of baseline data for most
indicators. The project's indicators, however, did not cover all o f its objectives,
particularly access to appropriate care. Monitoringwas to be carried out by the TCC,
assistedby consultants, who were to complete annual progress reports and action plans
supplemented by quarterly reports. The PAD acknowledgedthat some o fthe data were
not routinely collected at the start o fthe project, and that it would require substantial
effort to collect and compile the appropriate data into a form suitable for analysis.

2.55     While the monitoring planwas comprehensive, the evaluationplanwas weak.
Several o fthe project's interventions were specifically designated as pilots. There were
two pilot projects (each covering up to 200 patients) to evaluate the feasibility o f
providing ambulatory treatment o ftuberculosis through the primaryhealth care system,
as compared to drug administrationthrough hospitalizationo f all patients at the initial
phase o ftreatment; these were to be evaluated before rollout to the entire country inthe
second andthirdyear o f the project. The construction activities o fthe facilities
rehabilitation component inthe Chui region were set to be evaluated before nationwide
application. The provider payment scheme (including the cost accounting and clinical
information systems andthe quality assuranceprogram) was also envisioned as a pilot,
with continuedevaluationplannedfor activities inthe Issyk-Kul region, and extension o f
the demonstration to Chui and Bishkek. For the latter, a Module Leader was specifically
assigned to evaluate andrefine the Issyk-Kul products to fit Chui and Bishkek. The
project design didnot, however, contain specific plans or timelines for the evaluation o f
these pilots, nor did it contain an evaluation planto determine the impact ofthe project
interventions incomparison with non-project facilities andregions. It should be noted
that this shortcoming was explicitly identifiedduringimplementation, and planswere put
inplaceto correct itfor the follow-on project.

2.56     M&EImplementationis rated Substantial. The project monitoredindicators ina
thorough and consistent manner, usingdata from the Republican Medical Information
Center (RMIC) under the M O H and its subsidiary organizations at the oblast and
rayodcity levels. Inaddition, coordinators of some o fthe individual project components
carried out repeated evaluation exercises, gathering data andfeedback from participants
andstakeholders.

2.57     M&EUtilizationisratedSubstantial. While procedures were not inplace from
the beginning o fthe project to evaluate the impact o f the reforms on project regions and
facilities compared to non-project areas, the positive results inaffected areas were not
only monitored closely but immediately analyzed and publicized. Feedback provided by
Banksupervisionmissions, component coordinator-ledevaluationexercises, and

                                             24


stakeholder inputwas continuously incorporatedinto further refinement and
implementation o f some project interventions. Some components benefited from this
mid-project evaluation activity more than others; while it was successful for the family
medicine training programs, for example, there was no monitoring and evaluation
exercise to ensure further communication and implementation of the study tours,
seminars, and training sessions attached to the pharmaceutical component. Inmany
cases, positive mid-project results were usedto generate political support for the reforms
among political leaders, physicians and other direct stakeholders, andthe general public.


3. SECOND HEALTH SECTOR REFORMPROJECT
    PROJECTASSESSMENT

BACKGROUND CONTEXT
                AND

3.1     Bythe time ofthe transition from the first to the secondHealthSector Reform
Project (Health 11) in2001-2002, commitment to reform remained high, but declining
overall public expenditures meantthat there were continuing budget shortfalls inthe
sector. As a result, patients were being asked to pay out-of-pocket for a variety o f
consumables as they sought health care, inaddition to frequent demands for informal
payments directly to health care personnel. By 2000, the meanout-of-pocket payment
(OOP) was 337 soms, or around US$ 8. Total OOP were composed of expenditures for
out-patient visits (14 percent), out-patient drugpurchases (58 percent), and in-patient
expenses (28 percent) (Jakab and Manjieva, 2007).

3.2     Inaddition, despite the progress achieveddue to the first project, there remained
outstanding issues o f allocative efficiency o f health expenditures between the out-patient
and in-patient sectors. In2001, only 15 percent o ftotal healthexpenditures were spent in
primary care facilities, andhospitalizationsremained frequent for conditions that could
betreated well and comprehensively on an out-patient basis. There was widespread
recognitionthat further reduction inhospital capacity and further enhancement of
primarycare was a necessarypreconditionto improvingefficiency andequityinthe
health system.

3.3     As the first healthproject transitionedinto the second, corruptionhadbecome a
significant factor plaguingthe economy. Inthe 2005 Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Survey, 59 percent o fbusinesses cited corruption as a significant
obstacle to doing business, andthe 2006 Transparency International Corruption Index
rankedthe country 142"d out o f 163. Covering a wide range o f services, corruption had a
corrosive effect on the health as well as other social sectors, primarily via demands for
informal payments inorder to access health services.

3.4     The World Bank completeda variety o fanalytic work inpreparationfor Health11,
includingthe studies "Health Status andPrivateHealthExpendituresinthe Kyrgyz
Republic" (1999); "Who I s PayingFor HealthCare ReforminEasternEuropeand
Central Asia" (2000); "Kyrgyz Health System: Performance, Organization, and
Financing" (2000); "Informal Health Payments inEasternEurope and Central Asia:
Issues, Trends, and Policy Implications" (2000); "Review of the Sanitary

                                                  25


Epidemiological Services (SES) inKyrgyz Republic" (2001); and a social expenditure
reviewin 1999/2000.

3.5     There was a wide range o f donors active inthe health sector duringthe time o f
Health I1(2001-2006; see Annex E). The Bank's main partner was USAID through its
ZdravPlus program, which was active inthe development o fthe new health financing
arrangements and the phased introduction o fthe single payer system. USAID also was
instrumentalinthe development ofthe web o fnon-governmental associations (FGPA,
HA, LAC) supporting the sustainability o freform and independence ofhealth care
organizations. The Bank also worked closely with the UK Department for International
Development (DffD),the Swiss Government, and WHO.

3.6     Health reform inthe Kyrgyz Republic has benefited from the continuity o f donor
personnel inplace. USAID andWHO have keptthe same personnel on the ground for
over a decade, andthere has been similar longevity among many o f the key Bank
personnel. Over time, a productive division o f labor has developed, where each donor -
at the initiative andprodding o fthe Kyrgyz "champions" who launched the Manas
strategy  -- has successfully carved out its own "niche" o f comparative advantage inthe
health sector reform effort. This continuity has contributed to a remarkably strong sense
o f familiarity and teamwork within the donor community, and betweenthe donor
community andthe government. It i s widely acknowledged that the Bank has served as
the convener and leader o f donor efforts.

3.7     The Bankalso supported the ongoing healthreforms through other operations and
instrumentsinother sectors. For example, the 2002 Governance and Structural
Adjustment Credit (GSAC) includedpolicy action on the health sector that helped
institutionalize the insurance reforms through the adoption o f a legal framework, as well
as actions on reforming the public expenditure management systemto better support
output-based payment mechanisms inthe health sector.

OBJECTIVESAND DESIGN

3.8     The objectives o fthe Second Health Sector ReformProject (referred to hereafter
as Health 11) were to continue to improve performance and long-term financial viability
o fthe health systeminthe Borrower's territory by (i)          adjustingthe delivery system to
available means; (ii)     focusing on important healthrisks and diseases; (iii)          improving
accessthrough better distribution o f services; (iv) improving access through offering
financial protection for the population against potentially impoverishing levels o f out-of-
pocket health spending; and (v) improving the responsiveness o fthe health system to the
expectations o f the population.'

3.9     The Second Health Sector Reform Project includedfive components:




8"Continue to improve performance and long-term financial viability o fthe health system inthe
Borrower's territory" is considered to be a summary ofthe objectives that follow, and it is therefore not
evaluated separately.

                                             26


a)    Health Services Delivery Restructuring(US$7.5 million, 43.1 percent of proiect
costs), aimed at modernization and improvement inthe management o fprimary and
secondary health services, and at support for ongoing reforms o fprimary care services. It
had six subcomponents: (i)   supporting family group practices/family medicine centers
(FGPsEMCs); (ii)     modernizing, streamlining, and rationalizing secondary healthdelivery
systems inline withthe country's healthneeds and sector resources; (iii)      restructuring
Bishkekterritory hospitals; (iv) improving humanresources policy andmanagement; (v)
supporting the M O H strategy for mental health services reform (activities to be financed
inparallelbyDfID);and(vi) buildingcapacity for sustainabilityofreformsthrough
estate management, hospital management training, and functional services planning.
HealthI1therefore continued the sequencing planfor restructuring begununder Health I,
where the first project laidthe groundwork for further reform by strengthening the
primarycare sector, anecessaryprecondition for the rationalizationo fthe hospital sector
that was the focus o fHealth 11;

b)     Health Financing (US$2.7 million, 15.5 percent o f proiect costs), for further
development o f a countrywide health care financing system that is logical, efficient,
equitable, and sustainable, enablinguniversal access to an affordable package o f services
including a differentiated co-payment system inorder to improve access for the poor.
Also, for the further development o fthe existing health information system that provides
the Government, the purchaser, providers, and clients with financial, clinical,
epidemiological, and quality data necessary for monitoring and improving the
performance o fthe health care system. Three subcomponents included: (i)        development
o f a health financing policy; (ii)
                                  strengthening o fthe purchasingfunction ofthe
MOWMHIF; and (iii)      development o fthe healthinformation system. Once again, Health
I1continued a sequencing arrangements started by HealthI,where the first project
created the MHIF, but with the majority o f healthfinancing still channeled through the
budget, and pooling into the MHIFas a single payer (as well as the co-payment
mechanism) rolled out gradually to all regions during Health 11;

c)     Quality Improvement (US$3.5 million, 20.1 percent o fproject costs), for
improvement o fthe quality o fhealth services by creating sector-wide quality
improvement capacity. Three sub-components included: (i)        education o f health
professionals and (re)training interventions, facilitation o f curricula revision,
development o f health management and systems research expertise, and retraining o f
staff; (ii)
          professional development supported by professional (FGP) andbranch
(hospital) associations, to include licensing andaccreditationandthe promotion o f
evidence-based medicine; and (iii)   improvement o fpharmaceutical management
(activities to be financed inparallel by DfID);

d)     Public Health (US$2.0 million. 11.5 percent o fproiect costs), for strengthening,
reforming, andreorienting public healthactivities to tackle effectively the main health
burdens ofthe populationby restructuringthe systemo fdisease preventionand health
promotion. Three subcomponents included: (i)      establishment o f aNational Center for
Health Promotion; (ii)  development o f a new and improvedpattern o f operation for
healthpromotion activities; and(iii)   reform o fthe sanitary and epidemiological services
(SES) system; and

                                              27


e)    Proiect AdministrationandEvaluation(US$1.7 million, 9.8 percent ofproject
costs), for supporting and ensuringeffective administration of the overall project
program, as well as project monitoring and evaluation underthe Project Implementation
Unit(PIU).

3.10    A key element ofproject implementation was the development ofthe State
GuaranteedBenefits Package(SGBP). Createdby government decreeinFebruaryof
2002, the SGBP explicitly definedentitlements to healthcoverage, includingthe
following (Jakab and Manjieva, 2007; Meimanaliev et al, 2005):

    0   free primary care, with co-payments for some laboratory and diagnostic tests;
    0   hospital care provided for a flat fee co-payment, payableupon admission; this co-
        pay varies with insurance status, exemption status (designedto protect
        populations with highexpectedusage of health care), case type, and whether or
        not the patient has awritten referral from aprimary healthcare physician; and
    0   anAdditional Out-patient DrugBenefit to subsidizethe price ofmedicines
        provided on an out-patient basisfor the managementofprimarycare sensitive
        conditions like anemia, ulcers, pneumonia, andhypertension, inorder to reduce
        unnecessary hospitalizations.

3.11 Another key element of the reforms involvedhealth care financing. Referredto
as the "single payer reforms," their main goal was to create regional purchasing pools and
therefore endthe fragmentation ofthe pooling mechanism. Although the MHIFhadbeen
createdin 1997, its role became significantly more important with the introduction ofthe
single-payer system. The MHIFbecame the sole purchasing agency for health care
services at the regional level, combining state budget resources andhealth insurance
premiums. These pooledfunds were thendistributedto out-patient facilities ona
capitation basis andto hospitals on a case-basedpaymentmodel. The case-based
payment system introduced the concept of output-oriented paymentto the health system
(WHODfID, 2005). The single payer reforms were introduced intwo oblasts (Issyk-Kul
and Chui) in2001,andthen systematically rolledout to the rest ofthe country, adding
two additional oblasts each year, untilthe entire health financing systemoperatedonthe
single-payer modelin2004. The perceivedeffectiveness ofthe reforms was so strong
that two regions scheduledto implementthem in2004 requestedpermissionto do so a
year earlier. In2006, the oblast purchasingpools were further centralized into one
national purchasingpool. The latter shift provides the opportunity for cross-national
subsidy ofpoorer regions and expands the risk pool to the national level.

3.12    The project was explicitly intendedto benefitthe poor, through a more equitable
distribution of funds (fromthe relatively rich andoverservicedBishkekto the regions). In
addition, through healthpromotion, training ofhealth care providers, andthe expansion
of primary health care centers closer to those inthe relatively poor rural areas, the project
was intendedto enable the health care systemto address healthrisks and diseases (such
as infectious diseases) more common among the poor.

3.13    Overall responsibility for the implementation of Health I1rested with the MOH.
Within the MOH, aDeputyMinisterof ReformPolicy, Planning, and Coordination held
responsibility for overseeingthe project's overall implementation;this Deputyreported

                                            28


directly to the Minister. A newly created Coordinationand Evaluation Divisionand a
strengthenedExternalRelations and InternationalProjects Divisionwithinthe ministry
reported to the Deputy on project progress.

3.14   The M O Halso established a HealthProject ImplementationDepartment, also
reporting to the Deputy, to oversee the Project ImplementationUnit(PIU) andthe
Technical Coordination Unit (TCU). This new department was intendedto contribute to
long-term implementation capacity and sustainability. The PIUwas responsible for
overseeing all project management activities, includingprocurement, disbursement, and
general administrative issues, while the TCU coordinated all technical aspects o fproject
implementation. The two units maintained separate identities to ensure that procurement
anddisbursement issueswere treated separately from technicalaspects o fthe project.
Essentially, this extended the PIU-TCU relationshipthat had worked well duringHealth
I; ProjectCoordinationUnit(PCU)underHealthIsimplybecamethePIUforHealth
  the
11, withmost ofthe staffcontinuingto work intheir previoustechnical capacities.

3.15    The contributiono fother donors to implementation o fthe project was
acknowledged from the beginning, and there were regular donor consultations and
meetings throughout the life o fthe project. Donor representatives were invitedto
participate inall supervision missions and aides-memoire were sharedwith other primary
donor agencies.

IMPLEMENTATION       AND COSTS

PlannedVersus ActualCosts andFinancing

3.16    Health I1was approved on May 8,2001 and became effective on September 1,
2001. Ofthe original amount ofthe credit (US$19.5 million), US$14.58 million (75
percent) was actually disbursed, with more spent than initially planned on public health
and less thaninitially planned spent onhealth services delivery restructuring, health
financing, and project administration (see Annex C). The project closed six months later
thanscheduled, onJune 30,2006.

3.17    Counterpart funds were lacking throughout project implementation. By the
second year, these shortagesledto errors ininformation submittedto the Bank for
reimbursement o f expenses, with counterpart funds informally offset with funding from
IDA. Eventually, Country FinancingParameterswere changedto allow the financing of
the projectentirely from IDAsources.

3.18    At project appraisal, DffDhadmade a commitment of US$3 millionto provide
parallel financing for parts o f Components A, Cyand E. Later, the Government was
informed that DfIDhad approved a smaller sum for the project than originally planned,
leavingthe mental health sub-componentunfunded. Also, duringimplementationa
USAIDgrant o fUS$22 millionbecame available to the Government, part o fwhich
(US$2.5 million) was usedfor technical assistance under Component C. Cost savings
were also generated due to depreciation o fthe dollar. Some o fthe freed IDA funds were
used to compensate for higher-than-anticipated expenses for trainees coming from
outside the capital; the remainder of the funds was cancelled.

ImplementationExperience

3.19    Attention to thepolitical economy of reform was key,JFom the very beginning of
the designprocess. The PAD contains an explicit recognitionthat health sector reform is
a lengthy and often politicized process, and that it was therefore necessary to create
realistic expectations and to buildflexibility into the project's design; that the
institutionalaspects o f reform were as important as the technical approaches; andthat
reforms would have to be "marketed" to lawmakers, the general public, and the medical
community.

3.20    Throughout project preparation, workshops were heldinall regions to inform and
discuss with all stakeholders the need for reform and various strategies for reform.
Technical Working Groups (TWGs) were established by the M O H for project
preparation, drawing key stakeholders from the MOH, MHIF,the associations o f
FGPs/FMCs andHospitals, the Licensing and Accreditation Commission, and other
health professionals. Focus groups were conducted with staff members from urbanand
rural family group practices and family medical centers, and with the trainers involved in
family medicine education, to confirm their continued support for the project's
interventions. Chairpersons o f relevantcommittees inthe Parliamentwere consulted on a
routine basis, as were governors andmayors inthe regions. A formal roundtablewas
heldto consult withthe head doctors inthe Bishkek republicanhealth facilities and city
hospitals. Focus groups were held with health professionals inboth urbanand rural
areas. OnAugust 11-12,2000, a formal conference was held to discuss project design.

3.21     Consultations withphysicians, a key grouppotentially opposed to theproject's
interventions, were important. Incontrast to mucho fthe rest o fthe former Soviet Union,
the Kyrgyz Republic was not over-endowed with doctors, but staff were maldistributed.
First,there was a needto redeploy andretrainstafffrom hospitals andpolyclinicsto
primarycare. Second, there was anunevengeographic distribution o fservices, with
Bishkek over-provided and some o fthe regions under-provided. Third, inBishkek the
ratio o f doctors to nurses indicatedthat the former were performing tasks more
appropriate for the latter. Fourth, there were shortages insome specialties and over-
provision inothers. Giventhese distortions, the restructuring process would requiresome
staff to be displaced from their current jobs through one o f three mechanisms:
redeployment to underserved areas and/or service sectors; retirement o f pension-aged
staff (11percent o fphysicians were within five years o f retirement age) to allow faster
intake of newly qualified staff with new ideas and more modern training; and elimination
o f those staff who could not or would not be retrainedor redeployed as the restructured
health care system required. Itwas expected that fear o fjob loss, unwillingness to work
inruralareaswhere staffwere inshort supply,andthe financial disincentives to retire
would generate a natural resistance to reform among staff and even managers. It was
therefore anticipated that policies would needto be developed and appropriate funding
provided across three areas: severancepayments to staff for whom redundancy was the
preferredoption; a retirement package to compensate older doctors opting for retirement;
and incentive payments such as relocation expenses or bonuses for staff opting to work in
places where health care staff were inshort supply. The project itself offered no direct
financial contributions for severancepayments or early retirement, but it did provide
training and financial incentives for a redistributiono f doctors, and inparticular it offered

                                             30


training and accessto internationalknowledge and equipment as an incentive to advance
the proposed reform measures.

3.22    Despite these efforts, political commitment to the reforms was volatile throughout.
At one critical point inmid-2002, it appeared as though opposition to reform would cause
some o fthe project's key elements to be dramatically altered or abandoned. This
oppositionemerged from several directions: parliamentarianswho were physicians and
had financial stakes inthe "old" system; those who still stressed the superiority o fthe
Soviet system; politically well-connected physicians who were profiting from private
practices runout o fthe tertiary hospitals inBishkek(significant, as these nine republican-
level national facilities employed 18 percent o f all doctors inpractice inthe country); and
political antagonists whose ultimate interests lay inother issue areas. There was also
significant oppositionto the family medicine reforms, as manyphysicians and consumers
felt that children and adults should be treated separately, andthat the loss o f out-patient
specialists inpediatrics would result inpoorer quality o f care andless efficient care. This
opposition to the development o f a systembased on family medicine was supported by
governments o f other Central Asian countries who tried to influence events inthe Kyrgyz
Republic.

3.23     Duringa peakperiodo fopposition inOctober 2002, the Parliament conducted a
formal assessmento fthe first Bank-sponsored project, as well as the Manas health sector
reformprogram overall, reaching a conclusionthat these reform efforts were
"unsatisfactory." The Parliament gave no reason for thisjudgment. The Bank team
successfully mobilized donor response to this opposition, threatening anUnsatisfactory
project rating at a point when this action would have tipped the country into a low-case
IDA lendingscenario. The Bank also organized a February2003 Roundtableon health
reforms that resulted ina renewed Government commitment to reform and a revised
action plan, endorsed by Parliament andby the President, for the implementationo f
project activities; the personal interventiono fthe Bank's Country Director was a key
element o fthe political turnaround. These events underline the importance o f effective
and sustained communicationwith clear, consistent, and focused messagesabout the
purpose and anticipated results o freforms.

3.24     Themost signifcant impact of thepolitical opposition was limitedprogress in the
rationalization of health services delivery in Bishkek and Osh. These powerful local
governments did not want to relinquishtheir authority over financial resources. In
addition, the Bishkek city government did not want to subsidize national-level health
facilities located inthe capital. Corruption also played a significant role, as the number
o fpotentially lucrative head-of-hospital positions, frequently for sale to the wealthy and
the influential, would be diminishedwith the closure o f in-patient facilities. The Bank
team continued to pushfor the development o fthe single-payer systemand the
implementation o fthe Bishkek rationalization plan. When it became clear that the plan
would not be implemented inits totality, the Bank shifted to a phased approach. This
sequence o f events had a negative impact on development o f increased geographic access
to health services, as it limitedthe plannedredistribution o fresources from the richer
capital city to the poorer regions.

                                              31


3.25    Public expenditure managementremained a challenge, as public financing for
health care declined throughout the life of the project, from 13.5 percent o ftotal
governmentspending inyear one to 9 percent in2005. Inaddition, there was a
significant roadblock involving the Social Fund, the government institutionresponsible
for collecting all insurance fees. Itwas initially thought that havingthe Social Fund
collect healthinsurance premiums andthentransfer themto the MHIFwould save money
on administration, butby the year 2000, the Social Fundhad incurred debt to the MHIF
inanamount over three times its annual commitment. Inessence,the money intended
for the MHIFwas cross-subsidizing other sectors, particularly pensions (Meimanaliev et
al, 2005). Repeatedattempts to erase the arrears throughout 2001 and 2002 resulted ina
series o f inadequate responses, including such measures as paying offpart o f the debt in
kind(withwheat and furniture, among other commodities). Recognizingthe extent to
which the MHIF served as the flagship o fhealthcare financing reform, the Bank
intervened. The Country Manager raised the subject inmeetings with the President and
Prime Minister; the Bank highlightedthe need to erase the debt inthe country's National
Poverty Reduction Strategy; and ultimately, there were threats to withhold further Bank
andIMFtranches unless the situationwere resolved(a benchmark was introduced inthe
IMF's Poverty and GrowthReductionFacility that disallowed buildup of arrears from the
Social Fundto the MHIF). These interventionsledto an elimination of the arrears,
ensuring consistent, sustainable funding o fthe sector (WHO/DffD, 2003; Meimanaliev et
al., 2005).

3.26     Another public expenditure management challenge was the disposition o f
resources savedthrough the restructuringo fhospitals. A significant level o fpolitical
support for the reforms was generated by the promise that those resources would be
channeled back into the hospitals themselves, for capital investment, salary increases, and
other health sector improvements. Instead, however, the Ministryo f Finance directed the
funds to other priorities (primarilyeducation), andthe premises that were freed were
often turned over to the private sector. This dynamic, perhaps more than any other, has
dampened enthusiasm for reform amonghealth sector professionals. What is the point of
healthreform, they reason, ifthey cannot realize directly the benefito fthe money saved
through their efforts? The project was scaling up output-based health financing reforms
through a traditional, input-basedpublic expendituremanagement system. A similar
dynamic surrounded the introduction o f co-payments, where the advantage inbudget
negotiations andthe allocation o f marginalpublic resources accrued to those sectors that
didnot have a similar opportunity to collect additional revenues. Itwas not well
understoodthat the co-payments were not intendedas substitutes for general tax revenues
(WHODfID, 2005). The Bank forcefully arguedagainst, ineffect, punishing the health
sector for its reform efforts.

3.27     Toward the end of theproject, one of the most serious emerging issuesfacing the
health sector was significant human resource emigration. In1994, according to official
statistics, the average monthly wage o f health personnel was 92 percent o f the national
average o f all occupations, falling to 49.2 percent in2003 (Meimanaliev et al, 2005)
(Figure 3.1). Significant emigration started in2005, andthe situation is now repeatedly
referred to as a "catastrophe," with the best-trained and qualified professionals leaving
for destinations like Kazakhstan, Russia, or Yemen, and new young specialists not
enteringthe health sector. When physiciansschooled inthe Kyrgyz Republic,

                                                     32


particularly those who have benefitedfrom training offered by the Bank-sponsored
project or other donor efforts, emigrate, they frequentlyrise very quickly to head doctor
and other managerial positions becauseo fthe skills andreform mentality they have
acquired at home.

3.28    In sum, the implementation experience of the secondproject was considerably
rockier and more challenging than that of thefirst project. Despite explicit consideration
o fpolitical economy risks and institutional analysis performed duringproject preparation,
political opposition beganto coalesce inan effective manner among groups whose
interests were most directly challenged: out-patient specialists; the heads o f the national
health care institutions, who lost resources and influence as funds were distributed
directly to regional levels; regional governors and others opposed to the co-payment
mechanism; anda myriad o f others. Inaddition, the overall macroeconomic situation
remained difficult after the 1998 economic crisis. The Bank-sponsored project went
through a series o f rapid changes intask team leadership. Ultimately, however, the
results generated by the reforms, along with key interventions and intensified dialogue by
the Bank, effective guidance from key Kyrgyz counterparts, andthe existence o f a
cohesive donor environment, sustained the momentum for reform.'




 The spring2005 "Tulip Revolution," whichresultedina new President, Government, andhealthminister
by the summer ofthat year, hadrelativelylittle impact, within this context of volatilepolitical support for
healthreform.

OUTPUTS OUTCOMES OBJECTIVE
           AND              BY

Adjustingthe delivery system to available means

3.29   Numerous interventions were intendedto improve the efficiency o f health care
delivery. A single-payer systemwas put inplace, with the number o fpurchasingpools
reducedfrom 62 to 2. A case-basedpayment system was introduced inthe hospital
sector nation-wide, with hospital administrations givensignificantly greater autonomy in
managingtheir budgets. Legally autonomous primaryhealth care (PHC) centers were
established and began to perform a gate-keeping function. The project financed
renovations andpurchasing o f new instruments and equipment for these facilities, as well
as an extensive system o f family medicine training centers.

3.30    Undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuous medical education curricula were
reformedto support the new modelo f healthservices delivery. The number o fprimary
care physicians per 1,000 populationrose from 5.8 in2001 to 8.2 in2005 (Atun, 2005).
The number o f facilities that were dues-paying members o f the Family Group Practice
Association rose from 1,221 to 4,8 19. By the endo f 2004, around 75 percent o f all
primarycare physicians andnurses inthe country hadbeenretrainedas family physicians
and family medicine nurses, andthe focus o ftraining shiftedto the development o fa
national system o f continuing medical education serving family medicine (Atun, 2005).
Between2001-2005,924 physicians, 2,604 medical nurses, 503 feldshers (low-level
health workers providing care at rural outposts), and 348 ambulance feldshers were
trained. A training-of-trainers model was established, with 23 physician-instructors, 43
medical nurse-instructors, and 22 feldsher-instructors trained and active. Family
Medicine Training Centers were established inall but one o fthe oblasts.   At project
closure, there were 87 FamilyMedical Centers (FMCs) incorporating 675 family doctors,
as well as 34 independent Family Group Practices (FGPs), all contracting with the MHIF
and linkedto the nationalhealthinformation system. As a result o fthis expansion, per
capita expenditures on primary care tripledfrom 2001 to 2005, despite the constraints on
the overall health budget. Salary and benefits o fprimary care personnel increased
accordingly, with the average wages of physiciansup by 70 percent, nurses by 78
percent, and support staffby 77 percent; these raises were intendedto contribute to
retention.

3.3 1 With the continuationo fthe family medicine and provider payment reforms
begununderHealthI,the numberofhospitalbeds andbedcapacity inthe impatient
sector was reduced by almost 25 percent from 2000 to 2005 (Figures 3.2, 3.3). Between
2001 and2003,97 hospitals were closed, and the number o f buildingswas reduced from
1464 to 784. The number o f hospitals per 100,000 population decreasedfrom 7.03 in
1999 to 3.01 in2004. The total square footage occupied by hospitals decreased by 39.6
percent (WHODfID, 2005a).

3.32     A National Center for Health Promotion (NCHP) was established, with over
1,300 people trained. 78,000 informational and educational materials on health
promotion were issuedthrough print and broadcast media. Health promotion unitswere
established at the FMCs and FGPs inorder to link healthpromotion service with primary
health care. Two hundredhealth promotiontrainers were trained at the cityhayon level.
The Sanitary-Epidemiological System(SES) was restructured, with excess laboratory
capacity closed and 120 lab scientists trained inmodern methods o f laboratory research
and procedure and 75 epidemiologists trained inissues o f modernepidemic control.

3.33     Political opposition effectively blockedthe pooling o f funds and implementation
o f a single-payer system inBishkek and Osh cities. As a result, most hospitals there were
not downsized or restructured. Some reorganizations were implemented, including the

merger o f in-patient pediatric services into one facility, but the overall rationalization and
consequent redistribution o fresources to other regions was not completed.

3.34     A variety o foutcomes are presumed to have resulted from these interventions.
The goal o f reallocating scarce resources away from the Soviet-era focus on unnecessary
andwasteful in-patient and specialized care, and toward the delivery o fmore cost-
effective primary care on an out-patient basis, was substantially realized, continuing and
deepening the achievements o f Health I.The share o f country and local government
spending on health care devoted to PHC rose from 11.2 percent in2001to 25.1 percent in
2005, and the share devoted to public healthrose from 5.2 percent in2001 to 7.1 percent
in2005 (World Bank, 2005) (Figure 3.4). Bythe time HealthI1closed, 98.5 percent of
thepopulationhadaccessto primary healthcare services; althoughthis is anindicator for
accessto healthcare services, it i s equally important indemonstrating increases in
efficiency, as care i s shifted from the in-patientto out-patient, primary care sector."

3.35     Fixedcosts were reduced inhospitals from 21.3 percent o ftotal hospital budgets
in2000 to 12.4percent in2005, allowing expenditures for meals anddrugs inhospitals to
increase from 18 percent in2000 to 20 percent in2004. Hospital utility expenditures
decreasedby 10percent from 1999 to 2004 (WHO/DfID, undated (c)). One key analysis



10Due to the continued shortage o f family doctors in rural areas, the Government decided to permit FAPs
to continue to provide core primary health services inrural areas for the next 3-5 years, even though nearly
100percent o fthe population i s enrolled with family medicine.

demonstratedthe significant cost savings onutilities alone inthe restructured
environment, versus what would have beenthe case inthe absence of restructuring; this
element o f savingswas particularlyimportant giventhe Government's phasingout o f
subsidies for public utilities, puttingthose expenses on a "true" cost-recovery basis
(Figure 3.5).

3.36    Average length o fhospital stay decreasedby 12percent from 2000 to 2005, with
hospitalization rates for several important chronic diseases declining significantly from
2000 to 2004 (hypertension from 21.5 percent to 13.9 percent; peptic ulcer from 45.4
percent to 37.3 percent; bronchial asthma from 54.6 percent to 22 percent (WHODffD,
2005a)

3.37     Between 1999 and 2004, hospital admissions per staff decreased by 50 percent,
andper bedby 25 percent (WHODffD, 2005a). The share o funnecessary referrals from
PHC to hospitals decreasedfrom 2.5 percent of total hospital referrals to 0.6 percent.
These outcomes clearly represent a more effective and efficient use o f scarce resources.
Anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that family medical centers are still perceived not
to be as well equipped as out-patient departmentsat hospitals, andtherefore some
patients are willing to pay to bypass the primary care "gatekeeping" function.

3.38     The direct impact of the public health reforms (establishment o fthe NCHP and
health promotion activity) was not measured, with the exception o f one study showing
that the NCHP's training activities had a positive impact on the way medical personnel
approached their professions. It i s therefore unclear how muchNCHP studies and
activities contributedto enhancing efficiency or to prioritizing focus on important health
risks and diseases.

Focusingon importanthealthrisks anddiseases

3.39     This objective did not involve explicit inputs, outputs, or outcomes. The leading
cause o f death at the time o fproject designwas disease related to the circulatory system,
withmorbidity andmortality from specific types ofheart and cerebrovascular disease
worsening from 1990to 1995; despite improvementsbeginningin 1996, late 1990s
mortality levels still exceeded those for 1990. Mortality from all forms o f cancer inthe
under-65 populationhadbeen declining since 1992. Deathrates from liver disease and
cirrhosis increased over the same period. Overall, mortality rates from non-
communicable diseasesremained high.

3.40     Incidence and mortality for several communicable diseaseswere also increasing.
The Kyrgyz Republichadthe highest levels o frespiratory diseasemortality o f any
former Soviet country. Mortality from infectious andparasitic disease was considerably
higher in 1998 thanin 1990. The incidence of syphilisand tuberculosis hadincreased,
withthe latter probably influencedby better case detection bythe DOTS strategy andthe
inclusion o fprisoners inthe reporting systemfrom 1999. Yet the TB mortality rate was
stable throughout the mid-late 1990s, suggestingan effective treatment strategy.

3.41     Highrates o fnon-communicable diseases andthe risingrates ofseveral were
aggravated by excessive consumptiono ftobacco, alcohol, andhigh-fatfoods. Social
factors were associated with the rapid increase in some STIs. The disproportionate
burdeno finfantandchild mortality andunder-nutrition among poorer households was
thought to be associated with economic factors. Health I1sought to addressthese causes,
butmore importantly to deliver specific, cost-effective clinical interventions.

3.42     The designofHealthI1emphasized the availability and quality o fprimary
curative care (e.g. treatment o frespiratory infections, STIs, and TB), as well as
preventive interventions to reduce the burdenof alcohol, tobacco, and diet-related
diseases and cross-sectoral social interventions such as informing young people about
preventingSTIs.

Improvingaccess throughbetterdistributionof services

3.43     HealthI1supported a rationalization o f health services that was intended not only
to redistributemoney from hospital to out-patient care andfrom secondary to primary
care, but also from Bishkekto the poorer regions. The main cause o f geographic inequity
was expenditures fromthe Republicanbudget goingto the specialized Republican
facilities located primarilyinBishkek. These tertiary facilities serve primarily the
populations o f Bishkekand Chui oblast, as the poor are unable to afford travel and other
costs associated with treatment inthese facilities (WHODBD, Undated(b)). Unless these
issues were addressed, progress towardthe provision o f universal access to quality
primarycarewould behindered. Itwas therefore considered essential that the reform
process include a progressive reallocation of resources from Bishkekto the regions.

3.44     Despite the lack o fprogress inrationalizingthe Republicanhealth facilities in
BishkekandOsh, the extent to whichgeographic inequities were resolved was mixed.
As stated earlier, 98.5 percent o fthe populationhadaccessto primarycare services by

                                               38


the end o fthe project. According to household surveys, the poor (who are located
primarily inrural areas) are still more likely than the wealthier urbanpopulation to seek
primary care at a FAP rather than at a polyclinic or other facility, with 22 percent o fthe
bottom economic status quintile in2007 receiving care at home (which implies a nurse or
feldsher visit) or at a FAP, compared with9 percent o fthe richest quintile. This i s an
improvement, however, over 2004, when 47 percent o fthe poorest quintile receivedcare
at home or ina FAP, compared with 24 percent o fthe richest quintile. In2004,40
percent o fthe poorest fifth o fhouseholds (again, mostly rural) saw a doctor at an FGP or
FMC; by 2007, this figure had risento 76 percent (WHO/DflD, 2007b).

3.45    Regional analysis indicatedthat total per capita public healthfundingrose inall
regions throughout the life o fthe project. Per capita distribution o f Republic finds
allocated to MOH for tertiary institutions rose insome areas, including Bishkek, Issyk-
Kul,andBatken, butfell inall other oblasts. In2001,total per capita healthexpenditures
were 2-5 times as highinBishkekas inother regions inthe country; by 2003, this gap
had increasedbetween Bishkek andthe poorest regions (Batken, Naryn,and Talas). Also
between 2000 and 2003, the total amount o fhealthcare resources spent inBishkek
declined considerably as a percentage o fthe national average; some other regions
experienced an increase relative to the national average over that time frame, while others
experienced a relative decline (Figure 3.6).

3.46    Inadditionto rationalization ofthe Bishkekhospitals, the project's restructuring
plans also targeted a number o f small, rural in-patient facilities for closure or conversion
to primary care facilities. This aspect o f restructuringwas successfully accompanied by
other changes, such as enhanced ambulance services, to ensure access to needed in-
patient services for the population livinginor near the villages where these hospitals
were closed.

Improving accessthrough offering financial protection for the population against
potentially impoverishing levels of out-of-pocket health spending

3.47    The project's interventions inthis area were chosen based on a pre-project
analysis o fhousehold surveys and other analytic work indicatingthat the need to make
payments for healthcare was, by the late 1990s, imposing a substantial financial burden
on families that experienced illness or injury, and that these burdens had grown more
substantialas the needto makepayments for healthcare had grown. Among the reasons
for this increasing burdenon families was a pervasive lack o fmedical supplies provided
through the budget, as well as the fact that salaries o f medical staff were very low and
usually were not paid on time or for long periods o ftime. As a result, there was an
increasing incentive for medical staff to seek informal payments. In 1994, the total out-
of-pocket cost o f an illness episode for one member of a family exceeded the monthly
income o fthe entire householdin20 percent ofhouseholds experiencing an illness.
Almost 50 percent o f out-patients reported severe difficulty finding the money to pay for
their hospital stays. Manyhadto borrow money or sell assets (such as farmanimals) in
order to make the necessary informal payments for hospital care. Existingarrangements
for financing healthcare didnot protect individualsandfamilies from falling into poverty
as a consequence o fhealth care expenditures (Meimanaliev et al, 2005)

3.48    The most importantinterventions inthis area were the State Guaranteed Benefits
Package and the introduction o f co-payments. The basic guaranteed health benefits
package was intendedto improve accessto primary care by makingit free for the whole
population. The co-payment system, introduced for secondary and in-patient care, was
intendedto substitute formal co-payments for out-of-pocket payments, with exemptions
for pregnantwomen, childrenunder 16, pensioners, andother socially vulnerable groups.
The co-payment mechanismaimedto increase the transparencyo fthe system, replacing
requirements for unpredictable informal payments with a clear system o f benefits and
entitlements andclarifying the responsibility ofthe state inthe provision o fhealthcare.
As was the case withthe single-payer reforms, the co-payments were introduced
gradually infour waves: initially inIssyk-Kuland Chui in2001; inTalas andNarynin
2002; inJalal-Abad andBatkenin2003; and finally inOshand Bishkek in2003/2004.

3.49    An out-patient drug benefit (ODB) was introduced as the centerpiece of
pharmaceuticals financing, with the objective o f improving population access to essential
drugs. Insuredpatients were to purchase prescribed drugs at lower prices, with the MHIF
reimbursingthe difference betweenthe retailprice andthe amount covered by the patient
to contracted pharmacies on a retrospective basis. Initially, 37 generic drugs received the
subsidy. The ODB was intendedto improve both financial and geographic accessto
drugs for the management o fprimary care-sensitive conditions.

3.50    The outcomes resulting from these interventions were affected by the continuous
decline inpublic financing for the health sector throughout the project period, from 13.5
percent of government spendingat the national level in 1996 (when the reforms began) to
9 percent in2004 (andfrom 25 percent to 22 percent at the local level). Since public
financingwas critical for the effective financing o fthe guaranteed benefitspackage and
the additional package and co-payment exemption for vulnerable groups, the shortfall
was detrimental to achieving the goal o f enhanced financial protectionfor the population,

                                               40


resultingineither increased out-of-pocket payments or reduced services through implicit
rationing. One analysis estimated, for example, that the total cost o fthe benefitspackage
in2005 was 2.5 billionsoms, while the actual financing for the programwas 1.8 billion
soms, resultingina 27.4 percent coverage gap (WHOiDffD, 2007a).                 This coverage gap
underminedone o fthe key goals o f the introduction o fthe benefits package: clear
definition o fthe rights and responsibilities o f patients and the state with regardto
provision o f health services, and clarification o f entitlements for different population
groups.

3.51 Nevertheless, the vast majority o fthe population gained accessto primaryhealth
services through the guaranteed benefits package, and after the introduction o fthe
package, the percentage o fthe populationreporting no access to health care services
steadily declined. According to household survey data, the percentage o fthe population
who saidthat they neededhealthcare but didnot seek it dueto expense or distance to
facility has fallen from 14.7 percent in2001, to 5.7 percent in2004, to 3.6 percent in
2007. Similarly, the percentage o fthe total population (regardless o f stated need) who
didnot seek healthcare due to expense or distance to facility has fallen from 1.9 percent
in2001, to 0.9 percent in2004, to 0.6 percent in2007 (WHODffD, 2007b). Itis
reasonable to speculate that the project's interventionsprevented access to health care
from becoming significantly worse ina context o f decliningpublic financing for health
care (see Figure 3.7).

3.52     Total household expenditureson health services increased moderately duringthe
first half of the project, with an increase inthe price o f utilization and a decline in service
utilization. Health spending as a percentage o ftotal household and per capita
consumptionincreased from 2000 to 2003, with a larger increase for poor households
thanfor richerones. This was likelydue to the declines inpublicfinancing andthe
subsequent inability of the guaranteedbenefits package to cover all services. Out-of-
pocket payments as a percentage o fhousehold income increasedmore for the poorest
income quintilethan for other income groups, and actually decreased for the richest
income quintile, between 2000 and 2003 (Figure 3.8). Data on visits to doctors by

                                              41


2000 to 2003, the decline was largest for the 4th and 5th richest income quintiles, while
the poorest and middle income quintiles experienced very minor changes, and there was
actually an increase inusage among the second poorest quintile (WHO/DfID, 2005a).

3.53    Expendituresfor out-patient drugs remain significant, so that the burdeno fhealth
care expenditures on households is still markedly larger for the poor than for the rich.
According to the 2007 householdsurvey, total payments for health care among those who
consulted a healthprofessional inthe last 30 days constituted 7.6 percent o fmonthly
household expenditurefor the bottom expenditure quintile, compared with 5.8 percent for
the richest quintile. This gap has narrowed, however, since the 2001 survey, when the
poorest 20 percent paid 10.4 percent o fmonthly expenditures for health care (among
those who had sought care), compared with 5.2 percent for the richest quintile
(WHO/DfID, 2007b).

3.54    The reforms also had an impact on patients' financial burdenfor hospitalizations,
particularly for the poor. Analysis o fhouseholdsurveys conducted bothbefore the
benefits package and co-payment reforms were implemented (2001), and then when some
regions had experienced reform and some hadnot (2004), shows that the reforms were
successful at limitingthe increase inout-of-pocket payments for hospitalization over that
time periodby 400 soms for an average household (withthe average increase inreform
regions at 200 soms, but the average increase innon-reform regions 600 soms).
Furthermore, the reforms had a proportionally greater impact on lower income groups,
withthe poorest 40 percent experiencing a significant increase inout-of-pocket payments
for hospitalizationinnon-reform regions but a slight decline inreform regions. By
contrast, out-of-pocket payments increased inall regions for the richest 40 percent, with

                                                         42


the reforms not appearing to impact their level o f out-of-pocket expenditures (Jakab,
2007).

3.55   The introduction o fthe drug package ledto the strengthening and geographical
expansion o fthe pharmaceutical market, allowing 91 percent o fthe enrolled population
to have access to medicines (WHODfID, undated(e)). The drugpackage also hada
positive impact on pharmaceutical price regulation; for example, there was a 30 percent
decreaseinthe price o fthe most frequently useddrugs for hypertension.

3.56    The per capita number o fprescriptions increased by 14percent between 2000 and
2003, perhaps reflecting the increased emphasis on out-patient treatment and resulting
need for pharmaceutical access at the out-patient level (WHODfID, 2005)). The price
per prescription increased by 60 percent over this same time period, although this varied
across drugs; there was a 30 percent decrease inthe price o f the more frequently used
drugs for hypertension. The percentage o fthe population reportingthat they were able to
obtain prescribed medicines increased significantly after the drugbenefit was put inplace
(Figure 3.9).

3.57    Surveys were conducted inIssyk-Kul and Chui immediately after the introduction
o fthe co-payment inthose regions, andthe findings were compared with other regions
that had not yet adopted that reform. InIssyk-Kul, there was a decline from 64 percent o f
patients reporting making informal payments to healthcare personnel before the
introduction o fthe co-payment, to 28 percent doing so five months later, and 38 percent a
year after the reforms. About 75 percent o f interviewedpatients inanother study said
that the co-payment policy was preferable to the previous system o f informal payments,
withlow-income respondents answering the question similarlyto high-income
respondents (WHODfID, undated (a)). Similar results were obtained for questions about
paying for drugs or medical supplies inhospitals, and for paying a health worker "under

the table" (Figures 3.10, 3.11). Overall, it appears that the co-payments are not adding
additional resources to the health care system, but rather are replacing the old,
unpredictable, corrupt system o f informal payments with one that i s predictable and
transparent, ifnot provably less financially burdensome.

3.58    The systemo f exemptions fiom co-payments is also functioning as intended. On
average, in2007 just under 10percent ofthe population reported seeking health care in
the last 30 days. However, 27 percent o fthose falling into one o fthe "exempt"
categories had sought care, with these "exempt" categories accounting for 8 percent o f all
consultations. Only 9 percent o f exempt people reported making any kindo fpayment for
a consultation, compared with 21percent o f non-exempt people; this i s an improvement

                                             44


over the situation in2004, when 15 percent o f exempt patients made an out-of-pocket
payment (WHO/DfID, 2007b).

Improvingthe responsiveness of the health system to the expectations of the
population

3.59    The PADexplains this objective as covering aspects o fan individual's interaction
withthe health system other thanthe healthandfinancial consequences.
"Responsiveness" is explicitly definedas "something o f an extension o fthe concept o f
consumer satisfaction," with four specific aspects to be evaluated: increasingthe level o f
consumer choice inthe health system for the entire population; improvedtimeliness in
accessto care andthe receipt o fthe results o f diagnostic tests; improvedbasic amenities
inhealthfacilities; andincreasedrespect for the dignityandprivacy ofindividual patients
inhealthfacilities. Itwas anexplicit goalto improveboththe levelanddistribution of
health system responsiveness defined inthis manner.

3.60    Several o fthe project's activities were designed to contributeto the achievement
o fthis objective. The capitation-based family medicine model gave patients a choice o f
providers under the guaranteed benefits package. There was active development o fnew
clinical protocols, with 80 protocols for the primary level, 65 for the secondary level, and
60 for the tertiary leveI established. Collections o fthese protocols were publishedand
disseminated with the support o fthe FGPA and HA.

3.61    Stakeholder interviews carried out by the ICR mission team indicated that one o f
the major achievements o fthe project was user choice o fprovider and free enrollment in
the PHC system. Increased user satisfaction inthe system was identified as stemming
from improvedphysical and financial access, continuity o f care, the existence o f a single
provider responsible for care, comprehensiveness o f care, and increased awareness o f
patients' rights. Inparticular, increased satisfaction with care was attributed to the ability
of family doctors to address most healthproblems at the PHC level, reducingthe need for
cross-referrals withinPHC and for referrals to secondary care. The new consumer-
provider relationship was said to encourage doctors to deliver higher-quality health
services inorder to attract more patients to enroll.

3.62    The increasedefficiency ofresource consumptioninhospitals meant that there
was more money available for direct patient care. Between2000 and 2003, the share o f
health expenditures allocated to direct patient care inIssyk-Kul and Chui oblasts
increased from 16.4 percent to 36.6 percent; this percentage declined somewhat by 2006
(Figure 3.12).

Table 3.1. Rating by Objective




Outcome

3.66    The outcome o fthe project as a whole, based onthe relevance o f its objectives
anddesignand its efficacy and efficiency inmeetingthose objectives, is rated
Satisfactory (Table 3.1).

                                                47


Relevance

3.67    The project's relevance is rated Substantial. Country conditions includeda high
(though declining) poverty rate, highmortality rates from non-communicable diseases,
increasing mortality from infectious and parasitic diseases, and a significant healthgap
betweenthe richandthe poor. The quality o fhealth care was poor, andthe structure of
the health care systemwas inappropriately skewed toward in-patient and specialized care
andtoward excessive fundingto healthfacilities inthe capital city. HealthIhad
successfully supported the Government health reform program, and the Government very
strongly encouraged further development o f Bank-financed efforts to continue these
reforms. The project contained a highly relevant focus on reducing inequities in
geographic and economic access to healthcare, through the intendedrestructuring of the
Bishkekhospitals andthe introduction ofthe co-payment mechanism. Giventhe
country's epidemiological profile, the project's efforts inhealth system restructuring and
inpublic healthappropriately prioritized improvementsinthe availability andqualityof
primarycurative care.

3.68    As cited above, HealthI1also falls squarely withinthe frameworko fthe May
2007 Joint Country Support Strategy, and also o fthe Bank's most recent Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2003-2005), whose major elements were the support o f
private sector-led growth, the provision o f essential services, andthe strengtheningo f
governance. Continuation o fhealth reforms was identifiedinthe CAS as importantto
facing the country's development challenges, with one o f its lessons that "follow-through
on past policy actions i s as important as initiating newones, to preventdilutiono f
important past reforms, such as inthe pension and healthsectors.yyThe project also
reflects several o fthe priorities o fthe 2007-2010 Country Development Strategy
prepared by the Kyrgyz authorities, which i s anchored on four pillars: growth-oriented
economic development and improving the business environment, governance and
transparency inpublic administration, humanresource development, andenvironmental
sustainability and natural resources management. HealthI1i s specifically and centrally
cited as one o f the cornerstones o fthe CAS andas key to preparationfor programmatic
support inthe form o f a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) inhealth and social protection
beginningin2006.

3.69    The relevance o fproject designis also rated Substantial. The project documents
create a clear and logical chain betweenobjectives, components, activities, performance
indicators, and data sources for monitoring achievements, with a specific time schedule
specified for the achievement o fperformance indicators (Table 3.2). A December2000
policy researchpaper by the W H O D f I D Manas Health Policy Analysis Project,
"Performance Indicators and Evaluation Framework for 2ndWorld Bank-FundedHealth
Project for the Kyrgyz Republic," carefully explains the project's results chain,
evaluation strategy, and key performance indicators (WHO/DfID, 2000). Most o f the
indicatorswere initially expressed inqualitative rather than quantitative terms, and no
targets were set, but the indicators were refined duringthe first year o f implementation
and finalized in2002-2003 (although end-of-project targetsremainedunspecified), with a
detailed analysis o f indicators, their significance, and data source/collection/reporting
planscontained ina September 2002 MOH/HPAP report, "Kyrgyzstan: Indicators for
Monitoring Health System Performance and the Effects o fReforms" (MOH, 2002).

3.70     The health services delivery restructuringcomponent, through improving quality
andefficiency o fprimarycare, establishing legally autonomous centers for primarycare
services, and rationalizingthe number o f hospitals and eliminating duplication, was
expected to result insignificant gains for patients interms o f quality and choice o f
services and access to services, and for the Government andthe healthcare systemin
terms o fbetter quality and cost savings. The health financing component, through the
development o f an efficient, equitable, and sustainable health care financing system and
the development o f a health information system, was expected to contribute to improved
access for patients and improved efficiency inthe financing and provision o f health
services (and therefore contribute to cost savings). The quality improvement component,
through the creation o f an appropriate infrastructure that would enable self-sustainable
quality improvement capacity andby increasing the role o fprimary care, was expected to
contribute to patient access, improved quality and choice o f services, and reduced costs
dueto better treatment o f illness. The public healthprotection andpromotion

                                               49


component, through expandedavailability o f new equipment for laboratory analysis and
consolidationo fthe existinghealth protectionsystem (SES), andthrough investmentin
nation-wide capacity buildingfor healthpromotion, was expectedto contribute to overall
better healthconditions, reduced morbidity, higher life expectancy, and enhanced cost
savings due to a reduction intreatment costs.

3.71     The phased approach to reform facilitated learning-by-doing over time andthe
potential accumulation o fpolitical support for reform based on prior demonstrated
success. The design o fthe project took into account the planned activities and
contributions o f other donors, successfully avoiding duplication or overlap. It also
anticipated effectively some o fthe potential negative impacts, such as the displacement
o f staff by health system reform. Key stakeholders were integrally involved inthe design
process through a series o fworkshops inall oblasts, engaging the key professional
associations, independent healthprofessionals, head doctors, and political figures
(includingmembers of Parliament).

3.72     The project anticipated a range o f risks andput inplace detailed provisions for
risk mitigation, including a series of covenants. These includedthe risk that savings of
fixed costs from closures andmergers o fhospitals would not be retained for reallocation
withinthe health system, addressedwitha dated covenant onthe issuingo f a
Government decree on retainingsaved funds for reinvestment inthe health care sector;
andthe risk o fresistance to rationalizingthe in-patient sector, addressedwith a dated
covenant on a Government decree on pooling o f funds for the city of Bishkekandon the
implementation o f a planto rationalizethe Bishkek facilities and redistributeresources to
other regions, as well as provisions for incentives aimed at professionals inthose tertiary
care facilities.

3.73     One particularly successful element o fthe project's designwas the introduction o f
the co-payment for in-patient services, inrecognitiono fthe widespread corruption
throughout the healthcare system inthe guise o f informal payments.

3.74     The project didnot incorporate activities for the rural healthoutposts knownas
feldsher-akusherka points (FAPs) that deliver a significant amount o fprimarycare to
residents outside the cities (as o f mid-2005, FAPs were delivering primary care to 24.4
percent o fthe population, comparedwith 75.6 percent o fthe populationthat received
most primarycare from a family physician) (HPAP website). A 1995 assessment, carried
out prior to Health I,had indicatedthat the FAPs, usually small buildingsinrural areas
where a limitedstaff o f a nurse and midwife carry out essentially a district nursing
function on behalfo f a small population, were generally neat and clean, not requiring
technical or financial support to continue carrying out their present functions. In2005,
the M O H conducted an inventory o fthe approximately 900 FAPs and discoveredthat
they had fallen into poor condition (infact, the inventory revealed that there were 914
FAPsrather thanthe 867 that were formally registered). The follow-on strategy to the
Manas program, Manas Taalimi, features funding for special equipmentbags to improve
the capacity ofrural healthservices.

Efficacy

3.75   The efficacy o fmeetingeach o fthe project objectives is assessedas follows: high
efficacy inadjusting the delivery system to available means; substantial efficacy in
focusing on importanthealthrisks and diseases and improving access through financial
protection for the populationagainst potentially impoverishinglevels o f out-of-pocket
spending; andmodest efficacy inimproving accessthrough better distribution o f services
andimprovingthe responsiveness ofthe healthcare systemto the expectations ofthe
population. Overall efficacy i s rated Substantial.

Efficiency

3.76    Efficiency i s rated Substantial. At appraisal, it was estimated that savings incosts
from the restructuringofhealth services delivery would amount to US$8.92 million, from
the reform of health care financing US$2.96 million, from quality improvement activities
US$12.38 million, andfrom public health protectionandpromotion activities US$7.49
million, all over a 15-year period. Overall savings comparedto costs, including IDA,
Government, and DFID contributions, were estimatedat appraisal to be US$32.75
million compared to costs o f US$17.59 million. Since manyproject activities
(particularly those intended to improve efficiency) were implementedsuccessfully, and
since actual expenditures were lower thaninitially estimated, it might be assumed that
overall savings were even higher.

3.77    A comprehensive cost-benefit study was not conducted at the endo fthe project.
Calculations based on data collected after project closure showed that project activities in
the areaof quality improvementresultedinannual cost savings due to restructuring o fin-
patient services o f about 4 percent. Iti s reasonable to speculate that, inthe mediumand
long terms, current increased costs for public health services will pay off through overall
health improvements and consequent declining costs for patient care, andthat current
restructuringcosts are already resultinginsignificant savings through reallocation o f
resources to the more cost-effective primary care sector.

Riskto DevelopmentOutcome

3.78    Risk to development outcome i s ratedNegligible to Low. The project achieved
significant institutional development, particularly interms o fthe establishment o f family
practice medicine, the activity ofthe NCHP, and the purchasingrole o fthe MHIF. In
particular,the M O His now engaged inpolicy making,priority setting, resource
mobilization, budgetformulation linked explicitly to policy priorities, and monitoring and
evaluation. Itno longer envisions itself as the purchaser o fhealth services. Financial and
management practices have evolved similarly, with the adoption o fnew payment
methods, the abolition o f line-item budgeting, and the reinvestment by managers o f saved
funds. Itwould require significant political andpolicy reversals to alter the trajectory o f
these achievements. Government i s clearly committed to continuing the momentum
established by the project, as evidenced by the move to the Manas Taalimi Health
Reform Program, the follow-on to the Manas program, and support for a sector-wide
approach (SWAP) inthe follow-on project.

                                              51


3.79    The fact that the project's underlying principles and activities remainedconsistent
through a change o f govement and repeated change o f health ministers testifies to the
resilience o fthe reforms' perceivedlegitimacy. The decline inpublic funding for the
health sector duringthe project period was indicative o f the need to continue to educate
leaders outside the sector on the macroeconomic and multisectoral context o f health
reform. The mutual agreement o fthe M O H andthe Ministry o f Financeto work
collaboratively to implement a sector-wide approach, including a Bank-financed follow-
on project, andthe Government's consistent fulfillment o f a commitment to increase
annually the level o f public financing o f the health sector, have been significant positive
developments.

3.80    The major factor currently perceivedas a risk to the longevity o fthe project's
achievements i s the exodus o f project-trainedfamily physicians to Russia, Kazakhstan,
and other destinations. The extent ofthis problemhas not yet beenquantified, butRussia
has recently accepted the Kyrgyz family medicine diploma for its own licensing
purposes, makingsuccessful emigration even easier. Ironically, it now seems to be the
case that neighboring countries are benefitingfrom the Bank's support for Kyrgyz health
reform. Humanresource management assumes a highpriority under the Manas Taalimi
program and the SWAP, andunless there is progress inthis area, some o f HealthIand
Health 11's achievements will be injeopardy.

BankPerformance

3.81    BankPerformance is ratedSatisfactory.

3.82    Bankperformance inassuring quality at entryis ratedSatisfactory. The project
was fully aligned with existing Government priorities; it relied inits designon extensive
analytical work; it involved the participation o fkey Kyrgyz specialists; and it took into
account lessons from the health sector reform experience inother ECA countries and in
Health I.Consultationand coordination with other donors, as described earlier, was
particularly strong. The preparationprocess could have attempted to identify more
effective mechanisms to counter the political economy risks o f rationalizing the tertiary-
level institutions inBishkek, and o f implementingcomplex, outcome-based payment
systems inthe context o f an input-based overall budget environment. For the latter in
particular, more consultation inadvance with the Ministryo f Finance might have been
appropriate, as it was challenging for the MOF to determine how to treat health
differently than all other sectors.

3.83    The quality o f Bank supervision is rated Highly Satisfactory. The supervision
team brought consistent and appropriate oversight and expertise to the project, with
particularly important support from management when necessary, through high-level
interventions involving operations and instruments inother sectors. This was particularly
true during the period inmid-2002 when project activities stalled due to political
opposition. The Bank team used regular supervision and monitoring to dialogue
proactively with the Ministry o f Finance on budget problems inthe health sector and
implications for project implementation. For much o f the project period, the Bank's
Country Representative was a respected health specialist, makinghimparticularly
effective when he engaged the Presidentor Parliament. Infact, the key Kyrgyz

                                                52


champions o freform came to recognize that they could rely on Bank intervention for
support inpolitical battles with other players. The Bankhelped these champions retain
their jobs duringturbulent times. Effective Bank-sponsored workshops, training
sessions, and study tours were also key tools inovercoming resistance to reform.

3.84     The project hadthree task team leaders, but the supervision o fproject activities,
relationships with other donors, andpolicy dialogue activity continuedrelatively
seamlessly. Other development partners looked to the Bank as the one institutionthat
could coalescethem all into a common view. Overall, the Bank's role as coordinator and
leader o f a complex donor environment and successful efforts to maintain health system
reform as a political priority were key to the achievement o f the project's development
objectives.

Borrower Performance

3.85     Borrower Performance is rated Satisfactory.

3.86     Government performance i s rated Satisfactory. The Government was willing to
embarkon and sustain manypolitically sensitive reforms, and significant constituencies
maintainedcommitment to the reforms under volatile political circumstances. Together
with the Bank supervision team, the M O Hplayed a crucial role insuccessfully
coordinating a wide range o f donor activity inthe sector. However, non-transparent cash
management and a shortage o f Government fundingwere consistent themes throughout
implementation, andchanges intop political leadership created significant challenges at
several points during implementation, particularly with regardto support for rationalizing
the hospital sector inBishkek and Osh cities.

3.87     Implementing agency performance is rated Highly Satisfactory. The M O Htook
ownership o fthe project inthe preparation stage, with the generation o fthe initial
concept paper andthe formation (by the Minister) o fthe Technical Working Groups that
supported the development andacceleration o fthe preparationprocess. The M O Hhas
successfully made the transition from purchaser and service provider to steward and
policy maker, and it was one o fthe project's significant strengths that it was implemented
bythe M O Hitself (withthe PMUproviding fiduciary services and support as anintegral
parto fthe ministry). This arrangement enhanced ownership ofthe project at all levels. It
i s testimony to the strength o f this project's P M Uthat it was able to administer a PHRD
grantto support project preparation activities on behalf o f all four countries involved in
the Central Asia AIDS Control Project.

3.88     The TCU and PCU continued timely and effective project implementation despite
externally-imposed challenges. The institutional transformation o fthe MOH i s a unique
development inthe ECA region, demonstrating the Borrower's commitment to the
emergence o f a modern systemo fpublic health and healthcare.

Monitoringand Evaluation

3.89     Monitoring and Evaluation i s rated Substantial.

3.90   M&EDesignisratedModest. Giventhe project's support to the Government's
overall health reform strategy, it was appropriate to choose a comprehensive sector
monitoring frameworkrather thana narrower project monitoring framework. The goal
was to establish M&E suitable for the wide range o f donor-financed projects supporting
health sector reforms, measuring project-specific outcomes as well as overall health
sector performance. Mucho f the project's monitoring and evaluation activity was to be
financed by DffD (through WHO/Denmark), and it was explicitly intendedto strengthen
the health policy evaluation and policy makingcapacity o fthe M O H (as well as to
evaluate the project itself). Inaddition to data generated by the information systems o f
the MOH, inorder to understand the effects o f the project's interventions on the
populationit was plannedto undertake household surveys in2001 and again in2003-
2004, as added modules to the National Statistical Committee's ongoing annual
household budget surveys, called the Kyrgyz Integrated Household Surveys. USAID
also plannedto conduct a Demographic and Household Survey inlate 2002 or early
2003, following the first DHS implemented in 1997. Planned analyses from these data
included a focus on changes inservice use andhealth status across different social
groups, at the national and regional levels; the impact o f rural hospital
closures/transformations on access to essential in-patient care; andthe impact o fthe
introduction o f explicit hospital co-payments.

3.91    Itwas also anticipated that, becausethe implementation ofreformswouldproceed
on a phased, step-by-stepbasis, there would be the opportunity for analysis o f "natural
experiments," for example, the pooling o f funds in some oblasts earlier than others
permitting an explicit comparison between the single-payer and fragmented-payer
systems.

3.92    At the time ofproject approval, specific project baseline dataandtargets were not
fully developed, although a list o fqualitatively-specified indicators was inplace. It is
possible that the comprehensive sector monitoring approach evolved initially at the
expense o ffocus on project-specific monitoring. Baseline data and quantitatively-
specified indicators were eventually developedduringthe first year o f implementation
and finalized in2003, when the DFID-WHO HealthPolicy Analysis team prepared a
comprehensive codebook o fhealth sector monitoringindicators and beganto issue
biannual "Health SystemMonitoring" reports that covered indicators for health
financing, healthcare quality, andpublic health, and that provided a framework for
evaluation. Project indicators were well aligned with the project's development
objectives and components; an effective plan was put into place to collect the data and
monitor project Performance; and institutional development was plannedto buildthe
capacity to analyze results to inform ongoing project refinement and policy making.
These M&Eplans were carefully delineated ina researchpaper publishedby HPAP
duringthe project preparation period(WHO/DffD, 2000). Project designexplicitly
acknowledged that it may not be possible to assess the extent to which different outputs
contributedto changes insectoral performance indicators, since broadsectoral goals tend
to be determined by multiplefactors, only some o fwhich are part o fthe project and
sectoral reforms.

3.93    M&E Implementationis ratedSubstantial. Monitoring and evaluationwas the
responsibility o f HPAP, tasked with pooling together all data from routine sources,

                                             54


analyzingthose data, and producing policy briefs and policy recommendations.
Household survey data were collected and analyzed extensively, as planned; USAID and
other donorsjointly decided not to conduct the plannedfollow-on DHS, as UNICEF was
already performing Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).

3.94    There was limitedM&E inBank supervision reports until May 2003. Duringthe
Mid-Term Review, the Bank organized a workshop with the HPAP project coordinators
to discuss the M&Eframework and suggest changes, including a simplification o fthe log
frame o fthe project and reductiono fthe number o f indicators. After this mid-course
correction, data were collected across a variety o f sources, for many o f the indicators at
both the country andoblast level, andextensive (and extensively communicated) analysis
was performedwith those data. Key outputs included a sector performance monitoring
framework and regular reporting ofprogress (quarterlyfor some indicators and
biannually for others). By the end o fthe project, the monitoring function was
institutionalizedwithinthe MOH, as planned, and evaluationwas institutionalizedwithin
the HPAP, under the umbrellaof the Center for Health Systems Development. Health
sector managers andM O H departments experienced significant capacity buildingin
M&E,includingthe development o fcapacity withinthe M O Hto monitor overallhealth
sector performance as well as specific reform areas to inform policy makers on required
readjustment o freform design.

3.95    M&EUtilizationis ratedHigh. Dataand analysis generatedbythe M&Eprocess
were regularlyused to informpolicy makingandpolicy interventions o fthe M O H (for
example, healthfinancing data were usedto further policy dialogue with the Ministry o f
Finance). The phased implementationof the reforms allowed learning-by-doing,
permitting continual analysis o f strengths and weaknesses o f specific elements o fthe
reform and application o f lessons learnedto the immediatenext phases. The Health
Policy Analysis unitproducednumerous publicly-available policy briefs and
recommendations, most of which were promptly approved andimplemented. Evaluation
studies o f lessons learned under Health 11, and under the Manas healthreform program as
a whole, contributedsignificantly to the development o fthe nextphase of health reforms.


4. LESSONSFROMHEALTHSECTOR REFORM
    PROJECTSIAND I1

4.1      The political economy of health sector reform inevitably creates bothwinners
and losers. Early and comprehensiveanticipation of stakeholder interests,
institutional analysis to facilitate understandingof those interests, and the
generationof a coherent plan to build support for reform and to persuade and/or
co-opt potentialopponents is essential. Eventhe most informed risk assessment and
management, however, may not always guarantee success; heavily entrenched interests
(inthis case, those defendingthe existing structure oftertiary facilities inBishkekand
Osh) may prove extremelydifficult to overcome (Paragraphs 2.14-2.1 5, 3.24-3.29, 3.38).

4.2      The Bank should not, however,underestimatethe potential leveragewielded
by its financingand expertise. The opposition to rationalization o fhealth facilities, for
example, was fierce everywhere, butthe failure inBishkekand Osh should not

                                              55


overshadow the Bank's success inthe rest o fthe Kyrgyz Republic outside those two
cities. The Bank's contributions interms o freform sequencing, technical inputs, and
political positioning were instrumentalineffecting meaningful hospital rationalization
across the country. On other issue areas as well, at several key points duringHealthI
and 11,Bank interventions -rangingfrom the firm but positive persuasion o fthe
President by a Country Manager with considerable expertise inthe health sector, to the
threatened stick o f suspendeddisbursements and withdrawn IMF support -broke
political logjams and movedthe reform process forward. Onthe other hand, the Bank
mustexercisejudgment indecidingwhento insist on implementation ofthe initially
agreed-upon reformprogram, andwhen instead to be more flexible and accommodating
o fthe political environment. Explicit and early political risk analysis is essential to the
effective development o fthis goodjudgment (Paragraphs 2.49, 3.29,3.30,3.88).

4.3     One effective mechanism for countering political resistance to reform i s
strong and consistent M&E,where analytic results can b e generated and
disseminated rapidly and effectively, buildingsupport for project activities in a
politically contentious environment. Positive data and analysis on intermediate project
outcomes can generate broad support for further project activities. Inthis case, the Issyk-
Kulregionhasbecome arecognized demonstration site whose successeshave prompted
other regions to accelerate their participation inthe reforms (Paragraphs 2.23, 3.100).

4.4     Another important tool for overcoming political resistance to reform i s the
cultivation and even creation of civil society organizations that give health
professionals and users o fthe health care system a voice inthe decisionprocess and a
clear sense o f affiliation and identity. Inother words, supportingpotential "winners," and
creating pathways to transform "losers" into "winners," can be as important as
overcoming or sidestepping recalcitrant "losers." The creation inthe Kyrgyz case o fthe
Family Group Practice Association andrelated organizations demonstrates the potential
long-term impact o f institutional development investments that may at first seem
unsustainable or risky (Paragraphs 2.14,2.27).

4.5     The complexity of health care systems dictates that reforms b e carefully
sequenced. Inthis case, capacity buildinginthe primary care sector through the family
medicine and other primary care reforms was a precondition for hospital rationalization;
revenue gains from financing and service delivery reforms made possible the later
benefits package and co-payment schemes; and the changes inrevenue collection and
pooling were necessary prerequisites to the introduction o f new purchasingarrangements
(Paragraphs 2.7,2.12,2.25, 3.55).

4.6     Tradeoffs between efficiency, equity/access, and quality of care will not be
addressed in the absence of explicit and consistent attention to the balance between
them and interventions to correct imbalances. Gains inefficiency do not
automatically translate into improvements inequity; infact, the opposite may be true if
there is not sufficient tracking and analysis o f inequities. The clear emphasis inHealth I
and I1was on achievements inefficiency; although there were equity andaccess
objectives inboth projects, and some evidence to indicate that progress was made inthis
area, the bulk o fthe project's major activities and indicators focused on efficiency-related
goals. Itmay be argued, however, that this point illustrates the earlier lesson on

                                             56


sequencing: given limitedpublic financing for health care, enhanced efficiency may be
seen as an essential prerequisite for meaningfulefforts toward (and adequate resources
for) increased equity and access (Paragraphs 2.34,2.39).

4.7      Targeted interventions to improve clinical quality can demonstrably impact
health outcomes. Inthe Kyrgyz case, the Bank's efforts to improve the quality and use
o f clinical practice guidelinesfor highblood pressure have measurably reduced the
incidence o f heart disease (Paragraph 3.69). While the direct impact o f immunization or
nutrition interventions, which impact health risks more immediately, may be more easily
measured, it i s reasonable and shouldbe expected that health systems interventionscan
similarly affect health outcomes.

4.8      The presence of a clear sector strategy, authored andwholly owned by the
MOH,can play a key role inachieving donor harmonization. Inthe Kyrgyzcase, the
MOH's role as a leader and coordinator o f donor activity, inpartnership withthe Bank,
has been central. Longevity and consistency o f donor support, along with clear "division
of labor" among donors, i s also essential inanenvironment where donor presence i s
strong. Itpreventsneedless duplication o f activity, assigns donors to activities best suited
to their comparative advantages, and ensuresthat there is appropriate donor activity
across all issue areas (Paragraphs 2.5,2.43,2.47,2.51,   3.5-3.6,3.20, 3.76).

4.9      Improved efficiency may result in the reallocation of public funds to other
sectors, reducing the incentives for continued reform. Inthe Kyrgyz case, duringthe
second project the government responded to the efficiency gains inthe health sector ina
classic Soviet manner: if input requirements decline, thenpublic funds should decline.
This "stealing" of conserved resources from the health sector diminishedenthusiasm for
the reforms andreduced the incentive to persist and deepen downsizing efforts. The
input-based budgetingprocess "punished" the health sector for rightsizing health
infrastructure and personnel. The introduction o f formal co-payments had a similar
crowd-out effect on public spending. It is therefore necessaryto negotiate proactively
with ministries of finance and legislatures on the disposition of proceeds from
efficiency gains (Paragraphs 3.31,3.87).    The Bankdoes not always speak with one
voice inthis area. Some Bank constituencies continue to pushfor reforms like increased
budgetary flexibility for hospitals (including residual claimant status for small
extrabudgetary income from user fees), while others stress the importance of strict input
controls and of reflecting all revenue sources inthe treasury system. It is therefore
importantto sustain dialogue onthis issue withinthe Bankitself.

4.10     Some elements of health sector reform can have "spillover" effects, leading to
improvements in governance and accountability practices in other sectors. For
example, modernizationinthe way that drugs are procuredhas benefits for all public
procurement. Donors agree that success inthis area has met or surpassedthe
expectations of all involved; health reforms have begunto improve the overall
governance o fthe country, and the education sector and chamber o f accounts have begun
(albeit ina preliminarymanner)to discuss transitioning to the use of internationally-
accepted procedures for procurement, financial management, and audit.

                                                       57


4.11      A variety of lessons from the experience o fHealthIand 11, andthe
implementationo fthe Manas Iprogram, were explicitly applied to the development o f
follow-on activities: the Manas Taalimihealth reform program, and the sector-wide
approach (SWAP) through which Manas Taalimi is being implemented (box 4.1). These
include the needto synchronize the financing base and budget formulation and execution
systems with healthreforms, so that healthproviders can retain and allocate funds saved
through rationalization o fhealth infrastructureand healthbudgetscan be formed
according to output-based formulas; a focus on governance, acknowledging the
institutionaltransformationo fthe M O Hby investing heavily instewardship functions
such as M&Eand stressing transparency and accountability inthe health sector; a
commitment to deepen the rightsizing ofthe health sector and completing the process o f
structural reform inBishkek and Osh cities, where the process remains incomplete; and
stress on donor coordination, acknowledging that the highly successful informal
collaboration supporting Manas Ishould be sustained through an explicit, Government-
directed Programo f Work and through periodic, formal, structured meetings for sector
monitoring anddonor coordination. The attentionto transparency is particularly
important giventhe acknowledged extent o f corruption inthe public sector; the follow-on
activities put special emphasis on disclosure and transparency and on strengthened
complaint handingmechanisms coupled with specific remedial measures.


Box 4.1: Manas Taalimi Health ReformProgram
The Manas Taalimi Health Reform Program was developed in2005 by the MOH as a successor to the
Manas strategy. It i s an extension o fthe health goals embedded inthe 2002 National Poverty Reduction
Strategy and Comprehensive Development Framework. The objective o f the Manas Taalimi program is,
broadly, to "improve health status through the creation o f an effective, comprehensive, and integrated
delivery system o f individual and public health services, and through increased responsibility o f every
citizen, family, society, and public administration bodies for the health o f each person and for society as a
whole." It explicitly aims to institutionalize the reforms initiated under Manas Iand to strengthen the parts
o fthe health care system that were relatively less emphasized under the earlier strategyeaInparticular, it
seeks to strengthen the targeting o fresources and interventions at groups with worse health outcomes,
including MDG outcomes; implement structural improvements inthe public health and health promotion
systems; enhance capacity inthe MOHand other relevant institutions inpolicy formulation, priority
setting, policy-based budget planning, and monitoring and evaluation; and strengthen quality o f care with a
focus on priority health problems including maternal and child health, cardiovascular disease, respiratory
illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and TB.

Manas Taalimi was developed and refined inan open and transparent manner through extensive
stakeholder consultation, including town hall meetings throughout the country, consultations with senior
government officials, and numerous formal and informal consultations with health sector donors - although
it shouldbe stressed that the core strategy and ProgramofWork were developedby the Government
through a genuinely indigenous process. The Government gave extended leave to fifteen key health
specialists from the MOH, MOF, MHIF, SES, and other institutions to work on the strategy, providing re-
entry guarantees to their original posts once the strategy was finished. The preparation o f Manas Taalimi
thus overcame any accumulatednegative experience and mistrust, evolving not only a consensus-based
technical process, but also a process inwhich the players knew and understood one another's personalities,
institutional constraints, and motivations.

a. The name "Manas Taalimi" is significant: Manas i s the Kyrgyz national hero, and it was considered
desirable to keep that name for the sake o f continuity with the prior health reform program. "Taalimi" is an
ancient Kyrgyz word signifyinga vast sense o f heritage and legacy. The name Manas Taalimi therefore
stresses the extent to which this reform program i s explicitly based on the lessons learned from Manas I.

PART 11: EVALUATIONQUESTIONS

5. HEALTHOUTCOMES AMONG THE POOR

5.1     The Kyrgyz Republic is apredominantly agrarian society, withtwo-thirds ofits
population livinginrural areas eventhough the agricultural sector contributes only
modestly to the national economy. Incomeper capitawas US$450 in2005, placing it
secondto lowest inthe Europe and Central Asia region (ECA), just above Tajikistan.
Estimated poverty in2005 was 43.1 percent o fthe population, with extreme poverty -
those whose consumptionwas inadequate to meet even food needs -was 11.1percent.
Poverty i s largely, though not exclusively, a ruralphenomenon; the incidence o f poverty
i s higher inrural areas (5 1percent o f the rural population) than inurbanareas (30 percent
o f the urbanpopulation). About three out o f every four people inpoverty lives ina rural
area, and extreme poverty i s twice as highinrural (14 percent) as inurban(7 percent)
areas. Inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient was highin2005,0.28, which i s
better thaninmanyparts o f ECA. Regional poverty rates are polarized, with the regions
o f Batken, Issyk-Kul, Jalal-Abad, Osh, andNarynexperiencing poverty rates inexcess o f
50 percent, while Bishkek's and Chui's poverty rates are 11percent and 22 percent
respectively (Talas falls inbetweenat 44 percent) (World Bank, 2007b).

5.2     The economy grew moderately by 3.7 percent annually from 2000-2005.
Concurrently, poverty fell from about 63 to 43 percent o fthe population, and extreme
povertyfell from about 33 to 11percent. This highrate ofpoverty reductionwas
accompanied by improvements ininequality and a rise inper capita consumption among
the poor (World Bank,2007b).

5.3     Overall, while Health Iand I1improved the efficiency o fthe health care system,
which could be interpretedas a necessary preconditionfor availability o f funds to support
increased accessto resources for the poor and equity indistribution of resources, the
Bank's interventions achieved mixed success inredistributing funds infavor of the
poor or addressing the needs of the poor. Neitherproject specifically tracked health
outcomes amongthe poor.

5.4     Specific achievements that benefitedthe poor includedthe following: primary
care was strengthened, broadened, and made more widely available, with documented
achievements inthe relative accessto care o fpoorer versus richer populations; the
introductiono f co-payments made more predictable (and insome cases lowered) the
burdenof out-of-pocket payments, although much ofthe evidence inthis area is
essentially neutral with respect to access o fthe poor; and the out-patient drug package
made prescription drugs more widely affordable and accessible. Although entitlements
were clarified through the State Guaranteed Benefit Package, the deficit ofpublic funding
for the health sector meant that these benefits were not universally implemented.
Previously fragmentedpooling arrangements were centralized, enhancing opportunities
for efficiency and cross-subsidization, althoughagain, it i s not clear that this actually
occurred to the benefit o f the poor. I t is reasonable to speculate that, even in cases
where the reforms resulted in outcomes that were essentially neutral interms of
their impact on the poor, the reforms prevented access to health care for the poor

                                                59


from becomingsignificantlyworse in a contextof decliningpublicfinancingfor
healthcare.

5.5     WhileHealthI1citedthe poor,andspecificallythe ruralpoor,as the
intendedbeneficiariesof the moreequitabledistributionof healthcare resources
from the relativelyrichandover-servicedBishkekto the oblastsand of the
expansion of primaryhealthcare/familymedicinecenters inpoorruralareas,this
redistributiondidnotoccur. Inequitiespersist; for example, inearly 2005, while the
numbero fregistered citizens per FGPphysicianwas 1500, inrural areas there remained
a shortage, with the number o f citizens per FGPinsome areas reaching 10-12,000
persons (Atun, 2005).

5.6     The State Guaranteed Benefits Package included provisions for the poorest o fthe
poor. Hospitals established reserve funds to subsidize co-payments for the very poor
that are uninsuredand not covered by any o fthe exemptioncategories; these funds were
financedby setting aside ten percent o f all co-payments (Jakab and Manjieva, 2007).
FromMarchthrough December 2001,about four percent o fpatients inthe Chui and
Issyk-Kulregionswere givencare throughthese reserve funds, butthere is no ongoing
systematic monitoring o fthe functioning and impact o fthis mechanism.

5.7      According to Atun (2005), the mediandistance from patients' homes to a primary
health care facility i s 1-2 kilometers. While this is a positive indicator o f overall access,
itdoes notaddressthe specific situationofthe poor. Formostpatients (73 percent), the
travel time to the nearest health facility i s less than 30 minutes (Jakab and Manjieva,
2007). The majority o fpatients walk to healthfacilities, with only one inthree incurring
travel expenses inorder to accesshealth care; ifit is assumedthat poorer people make up
the bulk o fthe 27 percent whose travel time to the nearest healthfacility is over 30
minutes, andifthose patients arewalkingto healthfacilities, then clearly the poor
continue to suffer a significant physical barrier to access.

5.8      Since independence from the Soviet Unionabout one-third ofthe population o f
the country has migrated, primarilyto the capital; by 2004,26 new districts had been
created around Bishkekto accommodate these population movements, serving (according
to various estimates) between80,000 and 300,000 people, and creating a new class o f
urbanpoor (WHO/DffD, undated(d)). Surveys o fthe residents ofthese development
districts indicatethat, inaddition to general problems o f access to health care, these
people have limitedaccess to ambulance services and inadequate enrollment mechanisms
for FGPs.

5.9      UnderManas Taalimi, inequities inaccess to care, specifically the targeting o f
resources and interventions at groups with worse health outcomes, have received
particular attention as part o f a deliberate effort to strengthen parts o fthe health system
that were earlier relatively less emphasized. New health budgetmechanisms have been
created to redress inequalities ingeographic and financial access. Correctioncoefficients
that account for differences inage, gender, population structure, climatic characteristics,
remoteness from administrative centers, andterrain are beingintroduced. Incontrast to a
budgetary strategy that simply reallocates existing money betweenregions -which was
judged to be managerially feasible and politically palatable -the newly-adopted strategy

                                               60


not only promotes equity inthe allocation o fresources but also directly targets remote,
rural areas o fthe country that are predominantly poor. The nationalpooling o f health
care financing, begunin2006, has strengthened the country's capacity to cross-subsidize
health services for the poor andvulnerable andto distribute resources according to an
appropriately weighted andnationally applicable per capita formula. Inaddition, as
public financing for healthcare increases under Manas Taalimi, it i s envisioned that there
will be a shift away from the burdeno fout-of-pocket payments for healthcare. The
Manas TaalimiMid-TermReview demonstrates success inthis area, with out-of-pocket
expenditures declining from 7.1 percent o fthe annual householdbudget in2004 to 4.9
percent in2006 for the poorest income quintile, and from 5.5 to 4.2 percent for the
second poorest quintile (MOH, 2008).

5.10    The Bank's follow-on project to support Manas Taalimi contains a component
explicitly intended to enable the social protectionand health systems to more effectively
target assistance and subsidies to poor or disadvantaged households. It streamlines
coordinationbetween the health and social protection systems by clarifying (through the
social protection system) those households eligible for reduced co-payments whenthey
needhealth care. Italso supports efforts to consolidate andrestructure cash social
assistance benefits, specify eligibility conditions for benefits, and build a more efficient
administrative systemfor implementing benefits.


6. SECTOR-WIDEAPPROACH(SWAP)

6.1     Fromthe outset, itwas envisagedthat the ManasTaalimiprogramwouldbe
implementedthrougha SWAp, definedas a comprehensive approachto sector
development. The SWAP inthe Kyrgyz healthsector context was defined as having
four core elements:

    0   a government-led process to define the vision for the health sector inthe form o f
        anexplicit health sector strategy with clear goals, priority interventions, and costs;
    0   a medium-term budgetframework (MTBF) to program annual spendingwith
        mechanisms to ensure that annual budgets will correspond to the MTBF, andthat
        budgetaryexecutionmatches agreed commitments;
    0   ajoint sector performance monitoring and evaluation system integrated with the
        monitoring and evaluation framework o fthe MTBF as well as of the National
        Poverty Reduction Strategy; and
    0   a formalized government-led aid coordination mechanism, with the M O H
        responsible for overall coordination o f internationalpartners' contributions to the
        program and for setting up a system o f regular meetings, forum for
        discussiodnegotiations, andjoint review meetings.

6.2     The expectations for the SWAPinclude improved quality of deliveredhealth
care, targeted at strategic priorities; increased efficiency inthe use o fhealth care
resources; increasedfiduciary standards; increased institutional capacity; and improved
health outcomes, although it i s recognized that health outcomes change slowly and in
responseto many factors inaddition to the quality and availability o f health care. While
the first two goals - improved quality and efficiency o f healthcare -most likely would

                                                    61


have continued to evolve under a third "traditional" Bank-financed healthproject, the
expectation o fthe SWAPis that the fiduciary and institutional capacity building,
including open and transparent procurement, will be the most significant development.l1

6.3     The genesisof the healthsector SWAP lay largely inthe fact that many of its
elements had already been inplace for years. The government-developed Manas
sector strategy dates to 1996, and strong donor coordination and policy consistency were
longstanding. Nonetheless, the SWAp approach inthe health sector was controversial
when it was first introduced in2004, with several players concerned about the level of
corruption inthe country andits lack o f overall institutional development. The Bank
team was instrumental inencouragingother players to move forward, inparticular
convincingthem that the SWAP was an effectiveinstrument for building
institutional capacity and for facilitating meaningful donor impact. Onthe second
day of its initial project identificationmission inlate 2004, the Bank helda dinner for
over fifty representatives o f fifteen donors andagencies, an indication o fthe Bank's early
commitment to generating broad support for the sector-wide approach.

6.4     World Bank involvement: Inspite o fthe considerable progress inhealthreform
andmajor gains inthe efficiency ofhealth sector performance over the previous decade,
in2005-2006 the Kyrgyz Republicremained apoor country withweak healthindicators
anda continued needfor investment andreform inthe sector. There was significant
rationale for continued Bank involvement: the Bank's long experience inthe country and
the sector, its successful recordo fsupporting healthreform, its experience with sector-
wide approaches inother countries, and its ability to draw connections across multiple
sectors and reform areas, including health, public financial management, civil service
reform, and fiduciary functions, that are o f particular relevance when movingtoward a
sector-wide approach.

6.5     The Banktherefore beganpreparationinlate 2004 o fa US$15 million, five-year
Healthand SocialProtection Project (HSPP) as a follow-on to Health Iand 11.
Effective on March 1,2006 and scheduled to close on June 30,2010, it is a Specific
Investment Loan (SIL). Its objectives are: (1) to improvehealth status by improving
access, financial protection, efficiency, equity, and fiduciary performance inthe health
sector; (2) to ensure sufficient and reliable financingfor the healthsector; and (3) to
strengthen the targetingo f social benefits by developingeffective administration and
information managementsystems to improveaccess to social services ingeneral. The
project contains two components: (i) millionto support implementationo f the
                                           US$13
Manas TaalimiHealth Reform Programthrough a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP); and
(ii) milliontostrengthentheadministrativesystemoftheMinistryofLaborand
    US$2
Social Protection, to help implementpolicy reforms and strengthen administration
systems to enable the social protection and health systems to target more effectively
assistance and subsidies to poor or disadvantaged households.




11Privately, MOHand MOF officials concede that the requirement to follow Bank-specified procurement
and financial management standards is welcome inthat it insulates them from corruption; they can rebuff
proposals to skirt procurement procedures by citing the need for strict adherence to Bank rules.

                                                   62


6.6      Specificanticipatedhealthoutcomes include improvementsinlife expectancy,
the infantand under-fivemortality rates, the maternal mortality rate, TB incidence and
mortality rates, andthe cardio-vascular disease mortality rate, all with baselines and
specific annual target values specified, and outputs expected to leadto those outcomes
delineatedinan explicit results chain.

6.7      Other donors: Inadditionto the HSPP, a Kreditanstalt fiir Wiederaufbau(KfW)
Granto f14 million, a DfIDgrant of &7million, andfurther financing from the Swiss
Agency for Development and Cooperation(SDC) and the Swedish Agency for
InternationalDevelopment (Sida) contribute to pooled financingfor the SWAp.l2
Together, donor funding now constitutes 20-25 percent o fthe total health budget. Even
donors who are not contributing pooled funds (most significantly, USAID) are
participating inthe strategy. The pooled funds finance a share o f MOH's annual
development plans under Manas Taalimi and, separately, efforts to strengthen
information systems inthe Ministryo f Labor and Social Protection.

6.8      Tools and mechanisms of the SWAp: Expenditures for the health sector and
contributions to Manas Taalimi are not defined indetail ex ante as ina traditional World
Bankinvestment operation, butIDA grantfunds flow through Treasury to the budgetand
then M O Hto finance a share o fthe combined Government o f Kyrgyzstan and external
assistance budgetsfor the Manas Taalimi Program. Inother words, there i s no ring-
fencing o fpooled donor funds. The basis for decisions on the level o f distributiono f
funds is providedbythe Manas TaalimiProgramof Work;13 detailed annual work
programs, budgets, andprocurement plans; progress against agreed sector monitoring
indicators, including budgettargets; andresults of biannual"Health Summits" at which
all o f these factors are discussed by Government andhealth donors. The Bank's annual
contribution i s approved inNovember of each year by the Country Director, based on
recommendations o fthe Bankteam resulting from discussions with the Government,
development partners, and other key stakeholders.

6.9      Three mechanisms o f coordination govern the process o f donor coordination
supporting Manas Taalimi: the twice-yearly Health Summits, one inMay and one in
September, intendedto review progress anddevelop Programs o f Work for successive
years; memoranda of support andunderstanding,the latter amongthe joint financiers and
the Government, specifying issues of special relevance to the pooledfunds (institutional
arrangements, fiduciary arrangements and capacity buildingrequirements, assessment
andmonitoring provisions, disbursement arrangements, information-sharing and conflict
resolution expectations, and arrangements for adding new partnersduring
implementation); andjoint supervision arrangements, includingregular joint supervision
missions and coordination o fpolicy dialogue.



'*The  pooledcontributions from DfID, SDC, and Sida are channeledthrough the World Bank(using trust
funds), while those ofKfW are channeledseparately. All disbursements,however, includingKfW's, are
subject to the Bank's approval, ensuringa coherent andharmonizedapproach.
l3The Programof Work encompasseseight themedsections: populationinvolvement, healthfinancing,
individualhealthservices, publichealth, priority programs,evidence-basedmedicine, stewardship, and
humanresources.

                                             63


6.10    Overall policy oversight andproject steering i s the responsibility o f a new Inter-
ministerial Coordination Committee (IMCC), chaired by the Minister o f Health, that
focuses on the coordination o f activities and harmonizationacross ministries and sectors,
andthe already existing HealthPolicy Council, serving as the forum for implementation
coordination. Within the HealthPolicy Council, two sub-committees have been formed:
an internal Reform ImplementationCoordinating Committee (RICC) for internal M O H
coordination, and an external health sector RICC for external dialogue and coordination.
The M O Handits Departmentof Strategic Planningand Reform Implementationhold
responsibility for program management andday-to-day implementation, with a 64-person
stafftasked explicitly to implementation o f Manas Taalimi.

6.11 M&Ehasbeenrigorouslydesignedandimplementedto date. The evolution
o f M&E capacity developed under the Manasprogram built an appetite for information
andpolicy analysis onthe partof policy makers. Italso developed the capacity o fhealth
sector staffto collect, analyze andinterpret data, and it made vital contributions to policy
development and eventually to the development o f the Manas Taalimi program itself.
Buildingonthe monitoring codebook developed underManas andHealthI, M O H        the
andthe HealthPolicy Analysis Projectteam, inconsultation with donorsandother
stakeholders, developed a package o f M&E indicators for Manas Taalimi. A ministerial
decree formally identified these indicators and defined the institutional arrangements and
frequency of collection of data; subsequent Health Summits have confirmed the validity
o fthe indicators and o fthe M&E arrangements. There are three sets o f indicators: a
panelo f"dashboard" indicatorsfor broad sector monitoring and for the attentiono fhigh-
level policy makers and donor agencies; performance/outcome indicators corresponding
to the goals and objectives o fthe Manas Taalimi strategy (healthstatus, access and equity
inaccess, financialprotection, quality ofcare, efficiency, andresponsiveness/
transparency); and implementation progress indicators, covering inputs, processes, and
outputs, corresponding to the Manas Taalimi components (population and community
involvement, health care financing, service delivery, and stewardship). Most o fthese
indicators are collected on a cycle intendedto informthe biannualHealth Summits. The
institutional arrangements for M&E are intended graduallyto absorb the Health Policy
Analysis Project's functions into the core MOH; inthe meantime, the HPAP continues to
conduct and disseminate extensive analysis o f collected data.

6.12    Oneof the key risks identifiedearly inthe designof the SWAPwas financial
management. Implementationresponsibility for financial management tasks lies with
the DeputyMinisterofHealth/General Director ofthe MHIFandthe Economics and
Finance Department o fthe MOH. A comprehensive Health Sector Fiduciary Assessment
(HSFA)for the SWAPwas conducted inmid-2005, intendedto assess and mitigate risks
associated with the use o f Bank funds, and to facilitate a common understanding by the
Bank, Government, anddonors o fthe fiduciary risks attachedto the financial
management andprocurement arrangements o fthe project inorder that appropriate
capacity-building programs could be designedand implemented. The HSFA found that
financial management capacity across health sector institutions was weak, mirroring
weakness inpublic sector financial management across the country, and therefore a
comprehensive riskmitigation framework, includingan immediate action planand
longer-term capacity buildingmeasures, was developed. It has beenacknowledged that a
significant amount o f financial capacity buildingis necessary, andtherefore from

                                              64


inception it has beenplannedto strengthen and integrate functions into the Economics
and Finance Department over time. Also, due to weak capacity, the Bank hadnot inthe
past placedany reliance on audits performed by the Chamber o f Accounts (CA), the
Supreme Audit Institution; the Manas Taalimiis audited annually bythe Chamber of
Accounts, butthere is also a twinning program between the C A and experienced auditors.
Experienced auditors also perform an annual Operational Reviewo fthe program
focusing on key areas o f fiduciary risk.

6.13    This overall implementation arrangement -high-level policy coordination under
the Minister o fHealth, fiduciary/procurement functions gradually integrated into the
MOH, andtechnical decisions taken ineach o fthe Ministry's own technical units -is
seen as an appropriate evolution from the PIU/TCU model usedinHealth 11. While the
PIU's performance during HealthI1was strong, it was felt that the M O H was too often
aloof from the reformprocess. The MOH's position as the implementing agency was
intended to cement its sense o f ownership and its consequent development o f institutional
andhumanresource capacity.

6.14    Another key riskwas whether the MOHwould both sustainownership of the
Manas Taalimi reform program and make the "right" policy and investment
choices. A decision was taken to buildcapacity-building tasks into the SWAP itself,
rather than waiting untilthe capacity was inplace before implementingthe pooled
arrangements. Because o f the significant preliminaryprogress already made on fiduciary
reform, it was felt that this would be a successful strategy. For example, the M O H
initially had limitedcapability to process and disburse funds, now that the PIUand its
staff are gone. The ministry staff i s handlingthe processing o f the program's activities,
andthey are gradually becoming more knowledgeable about the sector. Because
assistance under Manas Icame from various donors, it was difficult for the M O Hto see
the "big picture" o f the entire healthreform situation. N o w M O H staff are receiving
special training at a WHO-run HealthManagement Institute so that they know how to
program resources coming from various donors, and financial specialists inthe M O H
work side by side with technical specialists actually implementingprograms, so that the
M O Has a whole has learned to take into account the entire resource envelope inthe
sector: what are the resources available, where to get those resources, who the major
players are, andwhat are the priorities. Similarly, duringthe first year o fthe SWAp, the
M O Hexhibitedthe traditional reluctance to spend money on technical assistance and
training; after just one year o f implementation, however, the M O Hrealized that budgets
should be programmedbased not on what it wants to buy, but what objectives it wants to
achieve - andit is spending around 15 percent o f its procurement budget on technical
assistance. Rather than deciding the correct approach inthis and other cases on behalf o f
Government, the donors' role has now transitioned to one o f continuous engagement,
dialogue, andpersuasion, with the expectation -fulfilled inthis case -- that the
Government will eventually mature to makethe "right" decision. The M O H i s no longer
a passive beneficiary o f external aid.

6.15    The past year o f implementationhas constituted a significant turningpoint, where
the M O HandMOF have realizedthat their goal is not simplyto satisfy donors, but also
to satisfy broad development objectives. Capacity i s beingpushed down, from the
ministerial/deputy ministerial level to the department heads and below; as this process

                                               65


develops, the prospects for sustainability no longer lie inthe hands ofjust a few
champions, but instead inpersonnel and institutional capacity across the MOH. Inthe
words o f one interview respondent, the institutional transformation o fthe M O H cannot
beoverstated. The M O H andMOF now work collaboratively, andthey co-chair the
biannualHealth Summits, while donors are rapidlytransitioning from a supervisory to an
advisory role.

6.16     This "push-down" o f capacity also applies to the center-region relationship.
Whereas the M O Hunder Manas Iwould instruct the regions on reform measures ina
top-down manner, now it increasingly transmits objectives to work teams at the oblast
andrayonlevels, offering only broadguidance as the work teams figure out how to meet
those objectives.

6.17     A third riskwas whether budgetfinancingwouldmeetthe healthsector's
priorityneeds,a legitimate question giventhe steady decline inbudgetfinancing for
health care throughout Health Iand 11. DuringSWAp preparation, the Government
expressed a commitment to increasing health spending, and inparticular it recognizedthe
need to compensate for the decreasesinpublic expenditures on health since the late
1990s. TheNational Poverty Reduction Strategy and Comprehensive Development
Framework set a target for health spendingof 3.6 percent o f GDP by 2010, with
interpolated intermediate targets for 2006-2009. These targets were incorporatedinto the
Government's 2006-2008 Medium-TermBudget Framework (MTBF). Similarly, public
spending on health as a percentage o ftotal government spending was pledgedto increase
incrementally from 10.3 percent in2005 to 13 percent by 2010, with explicit annual
intermediate targets (Table 6.1).

recurrent financing to bridge gaps, but only to the extent that the Government would
make a good-faith effort to increase its own healthspending to the anticipated levels.
This leverage-which is significant, given the magnitude o fdonor financing compared to
the overall size ofthe healthbudget -is thought to ensure increased budgetaryallocations
to healththat might not have occurred inthe absence o fthe sector-wide approach. The
MinistryofFinance has made itclear that, althoughmeetingthis goalwill be a challenge
as the budget grows, it is absolutely committed to compliance with these arrangements -
and so far, this hasbeenthe case, with the Bankneverhavingto entreatthe MOFto
meet these commitments. The MOF is clear about its interest inthe successo fManas
Taalimi: ithas invested significant fundinginto the strategy, and itwants results to
emerge. This stability permits the MOH and MHIFto focus on managing funds properly,
rather than worrying about whether funds will be available; it also provides an incentive
for providersto enter contracts withthe MHIFwithout fear o f payment delays.

6.19    The May2008 Mid-TermReviewof the SWAPindicatesthat it has achieved
strongandsustainedprogresstowardmeetingsitstargetson financialprotection,
access, efficiency,andtransparency,with mixedresultsinthe achievements of goals
for healthoutcomes and qualityof care (MOH, 2008). The SWAPappears
successfully to besimultaneouslyfocusingon the sector-wideapproachitselfaswell
as on healthinputsandoutputs. Some key analytic lessons have emerged:

6.20    The Bank'ssuccessemerges as muchfromitseffortsat supervisionas from
projector strategydesign. Ina weak institutionalenvironment, a significant investment
insupervision missions, "Health Summits," andother efforts carries thepotentialfor
substantial payoff. Hightransaction costs (and a high supervision coefficient)
characterize the Kyrgyz HSPP, with large amounts o f staff time necessary for
communication and coordination with other donors, procurement, financial management,
andgeneral supervision. Itis still too soonto assess whether the potential for payoffhas
beenrealizedon this specific issue.

6.21    Somevaluable programsthatwere fundedundera projectapproachwill
inevitablyundergo changeswhenthe MOHis free to defineprioritiesindependently
-andthisistobeexpected. TheFamilyGroupPracticeAssociationandAccreditation
Commission, for example, now receive reduced funding underthe SWAPand are more
dependent on USAIDfunds (training i s now provided at state per diemrates, for
example, rather than the higher rates available from the Bank and other donors). This
decision would probably not have been made under a Bank-financed thirdproject, but the
M O Hhas determined that these associations should further develop as self-financing and
independententities. The shift inpriorities andprocedures from the project to the SWAP
approach, however, can leadto dissent andmisunderstandings among those whose
situations change. The FGPA and Hospital Association, for example, are concerned
about what they see as a lack o ftransparency under the SWAp compared to what they
observed underthe Bank-sponsored projects. One observer uses a horse-race metaphor:
continuing education for family doctors was started rapidly, butthen ground to a halt
before it got to the "home stretch." Familyphysicians did not get the needed follow-up
through traditional methods o ftraining, and other possible models - distance learning, for
example -have not yet matured.

                                                67


6.22     Stability remainsa challenge;with frequentchanges inMOHpersonnel,up
to the ministeriallevel, it is importantthat thisvolatility notimpactthe capacityto
harness the lessonsofprior experienceandthe developmentof institutional
memory. The structure o fthe SWAPinsome ways enhancesthe humanresources
challenge; with a traditional project format, the Bank canpay higher salaries to staff o f
the PIUinorder to retainthem as their increased skills make them more marketable.
Underthe SWAp, M O Hpersonnel are state employees governedbycivil service pay
structures, and the temptation is great for these people -accountants, procurement
officers -to leave for the private sector as their skills are enhanced. The Bank continues
to engage government officials indiscussions about exceptions to civil service
compensation rules, butthis remains a difficult issue.

6.23     Processandresultscan be sustained as dual, ratherthancompeting,
priorities. This is largely achievedthroughthe intensive supervisionand strongdonor
coordination already discussed (process), as well as the thorough, comprehensive
monitoring and evaluationarrangements inplace (results).

6.24     Coordinationof such a large numberof activedonors,with Governmentand
with one another,is a laborintensiveprocess, andinthe KyrgyzRepubliconly the
Bankhasthe capacityto playthat role. While the Government continues to develop
its considerable capacity to coordinate donor activity, the Bank has been the key
facilitator ofthe genesis and implementation o fthe SWAp. Because o fthat "first among
equals" role, there i s little risk that the Bank's impact will be dilutedas all the players act
inunison.


7. SUPPORTFOR COMMUNICABLE-DISEASE
    PROGRAMS

7.1      Over the ten years o f Health Iand 11, the Bankhas supported both subcomponents
withinhealthprojects, andmorerecently free-standingprojects, supporting
communicable disease control (Table 7.1). Many o fthe supervisionmissions for Health I
and I1also focused on communicablediseaseprograms, particularly the Central Asia
AIDS ProjectandtheNational Strategy on TB/HIV/AIDS inprisons. One early 2002
missionresulted inthe production o f a discussion paper, co-authored by Health 11's TTL
and other Bank staff, titled "Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS inthe Prisons of the Republic
of Kyrgyzstan: Tackling the Growing Public HealthProblems." This mission resultedin
a letter to the Minister o f Healthexpressingconcern about the situation o f TB/AIDS in
prisons and the release o f TB-infected prisoners, fueling the epidemic, and the inadequate
follow-up by the TB control systemat large. Subsequent Bank missions continuedto
work withM O Honthe development o fan action planto prepare for 2003 Global Fund
grant fundingto control the country's HIV/AIDS andTB epidemics.

PathogenicAvian Influenza (HPIA) prevention, preparednessand planning,     December
response, and containment activities inthe humanhealth sector specific to  2010
the needs ofthe Kyrgyz Republic.

7.2       The rationalefor targetingthese communicablediseasesinthe Kyrgyz
Republicwas notthattheir absolute levels were consideredto behigh,butthat their
levelswere increasingat a ratethat was perceivedto be apotentialthreat. This was
particularly true for HIV/AIDS, where there arejust 4,000 people estimated to be living
withHIV and fewer than 100recorded deaths due to AIDS, buta highperceived
prevalence o f risk behavior.

7.3       Alternativeprojectdesigns(free-standingprojectsversus components of
largerhealthreformprojects)were consideredfor some of the interventionson
communicablediseases, butnotfor others. The TB and STI interventionswere always
envisioned as a component o f Health I,with no consideration o f other models. HealthI
took a deliberately systemic approach aiming to change clinical protocols andthe
regulatory, payment, and management structures underlying inefficient resource use,
rather than a vertical approach targeting specific clinical programs alone. This choice
was driven by institutional analysis and observation o f international experience
suggesting poor sustainability o f improvementsto specific programs inthe absence o f
accompanying changes inthe system-wide incentives that resulted ininefficient resource
allocation inthe first place.

7.4       For the CAAP, which covers four countries, project designers considered
individual national free-standingprojects, but rejected this option on the assumption that
national actions are strengthenedby a coordinated regional response that, acknowledging
the global public goods nature o fprevention and control o f HIV/AIDS andthe
indivisibility o fbenefits, sharesbest practices and increases solidarity among countries to
stop the epidemic. EmbeddingHIV/AIDScontrol ina larger health reform project was
not considered. For avian influenza control, the restructuringo f one or more ongoing
projects and injection o f additional financing for influenza was considered; this
alternative was rejected based onthe importance o f the issue and the needto scale up the

                                               69


response at the country level, requiringa clear focus, preparation o f a multi-sectoral
national plan, and impetusto facilitate the implementation o fthe necessary priority
activities. It was decided that this could not be effectively achieved under the umbrella o f
a restructured ongoing project. There were also concerns that restructuring ongoing
projects and diverting funds to other uses might endanger the achievement o fthose
projects' original development objectives.

7.5     HIV/AIDS andavianinfluenzasupportare parallelto the ongoingHSPP,not
pooledwith it. The overlap between the HIV/AIDS project andthe HSPP lies primady
inepidemiologicalsurveillance. Inorder to minimize overlapandmaximize appropriate
use o fresources, a Memorandum o fUnderstandingdefines activities and facilitates
efficient allocation o f resources. It is recognizedthat the system remains fragmented.
For HIV/AIDS, for example, the fundingfiom the Global Fundand other donors on
infectious disease flows directly into the Ministry o f Finance, rather thanbeing integrated
with M O Hefforts. Coordination between healthreformprograms andvertical disease
programs i s perceived to be better inthe Kyrgyz Republic than inmost other countries,
however, largely because o f overlapping institutions andpersonnel: the PMU for the
HSPP is supporting the CAAP, andthe current manager for the CAAP i s a former
Kyrgyz minister o f health, one o fthe original champions o fthe Manas reform program,
witha strong network of connections inthe health sector and continuedrespect
throughout.

7.6      TheManasTaalimistrategy,andthereforethe HSPP,includesa central
focus on five priorityprograms,two ofwhich involvecommunicabledisease:
maternal and child health, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS,cardiovascular disease, and
micronutrient deficiency prevention and control. Importantly, emphasis is placed not
only on strengthening these communicable disease programs, but also on integrating
themwiththe individualhealthcare delivery system. Explicit plansinthis regardhave
includedexpansion o fthe functional responsibilities of family doctors andnurses,
provision o f health organizations andpersonnel with appropriate equipment and drugs,
modules on reproductive health inthe training programs for family doctors andnurses,
coordination o fpreventiveactivities between family medicine centers and units o f the
SES,further involvement o fthe population, communities, local self-governance
authorities, andNGOsinorder to improve the health culture, and the integrationo f
priority program monitoring indicators into the existing medical statistical reporting
system. Health Summits have applauded efforts to integrate priority programs into the
mainstream health care system, with no new single-profile structures or institutions
having been developed, and integration o f many activities into primaryhealth care.

7.7      Other thanTB, it is stilltoo early to assess the efficacy andefficiency of the
Bank's interventionson communicabledisease. The Bank's interventions on TB
appear to have helpedreduce incidence, stabilize mortality, andimprove treatment
outcomes (as discussed earlier); no specific analysis has been conducted to assess impact
on TB among the poor. The institutional arrangement, with TB control consistently
integrated with the primary health care delivery system, i s seen to be appropriate and
efficient.

                                                     70


7.8      Coordinationwith other donors onHIV/AIDScontrolpresentsa significant
riskto the CAAP. A large numberofother donors are involvedinHIV/AIDS control in
the Kyrgyz Republic andthe other three countries, including co-financing (US$1.9
million) from DfID for the CAAP. While the project i s intendedto further development
o f a regional partnershipbetween Governments, NGOs, the private sector, and
international partner organizations, it i s recognized that these stakeholders have interests
that do not always coincide. This risk i s mitigated through a deliberate effort to unify
different coordinationmechanisms, includinginthe context o fthe UNTheme Group, and
through the Technical Groups that prepared and are implementingthe project.


8. VALUEADDED OFTHE WORLD BANK

8.1      Itis universally acknowledged amongthe donors active inthe healthsector that
the WorldBankplaysthe leadrole among them, andthat this arrangementhas beenquite
satisfactory to all involved and quite s~ccessful.'~          Itwas initially plannedthat donors
would rotate responsibility for playing the lead role, but fairly quickly it was realized that
the Bank was the only agency withthe local capacity to do so effe~tively'~                -althoughit
is also acknowledged that the Bank frequentlyaccedes leadership responsibility to other
donors inspecific situations, when appropriate. The Bank has been key inmediating
conflicts among donors, particularly those related to donors' varying institutional cultures
and differingtolerance o frisk.

8.2      The Bankwas also instrumentalinkeepingreform not merely afloat, but squarely
on the political agenda, inthe face o f strong opposition at many key decisionpoints. The
Bank was the only donor with the credibility and leverage to do so. Itnot only lent
crucial general political support to the Kyrgyz "champions" o f reform; it also intervened
inkey specific instances to ensurethat squabbles over implementationdetails didnot
derail the entire reform process. For example, the Bank's efforts to prevent the efficiency
gains accrued from health sector reformto be allocated to other sectors, rather than
reinvestedinthe health sector, established animportant priority andprinciple o fpublic
expendituremanagement.




l4 is
  It telling that two separate interviewrespondentsrepresentingother donors, when askedabout Bank
activities, answeredquestions consistently inthe first personplural. This verbiage reveals the extent to
whichthere is genuine teamwork among donors inthis environment.
l5Onelimitationfrequently mentionedisthe fact thatthe TTL for the HSPPisbasednotin          Bishkek,the
Kyrgyz capital, but insteadinAlmaty, Kazakhstan. Some donors speculate that this TTL is not able to
exchange informationandplanday-to-dayoperationsincollaborationwith other donors as effectivelyas he
might, were he basedinBishkek. The Bankstrategically and deliberately locatedthe TTL severalhours'
drive away, however, inorder to facilitatethe developmentof capacity within the MOH; ifthe TTL is not
physicallypresentto solveeach and every immediate challenge, then the MOHby definition will adapt to
the situation and grow this capacity on its own. It is also important to notethat the Bankhas an extremely
capable and experiencedlocalhealthspecialist stationedinBishkek;this specialistprovides day-to-day
support to MOH, MOF, donors, and other stakeholders,mitigatingthe impact ofhavinga more distant
TTL.

                                              71


8.3     Although the Manas and Manas Taalimi programs were conceived and shaped
largely by the Government itself, the Bank (together with WHO and other donors) played
a critical role inworking out key implementation details and, most importantly, the
correct sequencing o f reform. The incentive structures andresulting efficiency gains
established inHealth Iwere an essential prerequisite to the benefits packages and
purchasing arrangements under Health 11.

8.4     Perhaps most significantly for sustainability o fthe project's benefits and
outcomes, the Bankhas played a key role indeveloping institutional capacity at the
MOH. Through the joint implementation o fproject activities and Bank-sponsored
technical assistance, there has been a steady learning curve traceable from Health I
through the SWAp, duringwhich the M O Hhas made the transition from a Soviet-era
relic to the most modern M O H inthe post-Soviet environment. This remarkable
evolution i s directly attributable to the Bank's consistent and effective supervisionacross
the spectrum o f health sector reform, public sector management, and fiduciary
management. Furthermore, the Bank continues to offer critical support to the M O H and
health sector as its fiduciary and other management practices establish new benchmarks
o fperformance for the public sector as a whole.

8.5      Inthe absenceofthe Bank,itis likelythat the KyrgyzRepublic would have
moved forward with health sector reforms, given the Government's commitment andthe
support from other donors. Without Bank resources, convening power, and technical
assistance, however, there would have been more geographically and institutionally
limited progress inrestructuring o fthe health sector; with less efficient use o f available
resources, there would have beeneven less progress inimprovements inaccess to health
care for the entire population, including the poor. Thus, it is likely that health outcomes
would have beenworse minusBank support. Further, healthreform efforts would have
had a substantially lower probability o f surviving multiple political assaults. The M O H
would not have undergone such a substantial institutional transformation, makingit
unlikelythat the sector-wide approach would have been adopted.
