institutional development impacts substantial, while both\n            the Bank, and Borrower performances are rated highly\n            satisfactory. The success of the project lies mostly, on\n            that the health reforms, however complex, addressed both the\n            imminent financing, and delivery of health services, which\n            simplistic solutions alone, only addressing one element of\n            the health sector could not have accomplished. Lessons\n            contributing to the success of the project feature a strong\n            government commitment, institutional capacity and high\n            technical skills (namely, a strong technical committee able\n            to negotiate with key players in the health system), and, a\n            well coordinated technical assistance, supported by timely\n            Bank interventions, with attention to institutional\n            development in the context of health reforms. However,\n            regardless of success, lessons address weaknesses and\n            challenges. Health outcomes were poorly defined, unclear for\n            planning a baseline, and follow-up survey, including limited\n            data to cross-validate findings, conducive to an ill-defined\n            project evaluation which would have allowed determining\n            impacts in terms of intermediate health indicators, and\n            outcomes. Nonetheless, identification of this issue during\n            implementation, allowed for stronger monitoring and\n            evaluation criteria in the follow-up operation. In addition,\n            allocation of counterpart funds was affected due to the\n            economic crisis in Russia, and budget management problems."}, "docdt": "2002-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
