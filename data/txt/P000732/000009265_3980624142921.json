    Education Sector Development Project, an expenditure program\n            to restructure and expand Ethiopia's educational\n            system, improves overall educational attainment while\n            achieving greater social equity. The project has six\n            components. Basic education, the first, builds, upgrades,\n            and renovates new primary schools, reforms curriculum,\n            upgrades teachers, and increases textbooks in order to\n            increase access and enrollment--especially in rural areas,\n            improve teacher quality and school proximity. It uses\n            non-formal education and radio programs. The second\n            component expands secondary schools, revises curriculum,\n            upgrades teachers, and increases instructional materials and\n            equipment. The third component consists of technical and\n            vocational education and training activities that encourage\n            private sector participation in order to tie training to the\n            job market, increase the availability of skilled labor, and\n            raise the employment rate. The fourth component upgrades and\n            expands teacher training institutes and colleges and uses\n            distance learning. The fifth component expands higher\n            education by encouraging private sector investment and\n            designing cost-sharing schemes to meet the country's\n            needs for educators, engineers, health workers, and public\n            administrators. The sixth component, institutional\n            development, improves planning, finance management, and\n            implementation, monitoring, and evaluation capacities of the\n            education ministries and agencies."}, "docdt": "1998-05-04T00:00:00Z"}
