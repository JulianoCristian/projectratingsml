A number of lessons convey the following,\n            particularly, given the post-conflict situation in the\n            country, and, reinforces previous lessons learned, including\n            built-in project flexibility, appropriate donor\n            coordination, and, provision of procurement and financial\n            management training. Early intervention is critical to\n            eliminating bottlenecks that could lead to lengthy delays in\n            procurement, and/or approval of plans. Guidance needs to be\n            specific and solution-oriented, not in the form of\n            additional critique. Clients must be encouraged to be\n            forthcoming upon encountering difficulties, which should be\n            rewarded with advice that moves the project forward, not by\n            criticism and threats. Concurrently, Supervision should be\n            seen as an on-going, not just a semi-annual process.\n            Frequent visits to the field reduce the\" threat\"\n            factor to clients, and should be viewed as a support\n            activity, not one where criticism is paramount. In addition,\n            sub-sector programs need to be developed as part of broad\n            systemic approaches - both in terms of financial\n            availability to the sector, and in terms resulting from the\n            contention forces between graduates within the system, and\n            the demand for their skills within the labor force. The\n            balance between expansion and quality is a difficult one to\n            achieve: at mid-term it became apparent that an imbalance\n            was in the making. While the Government took steps to\n            redress the problem, donors could have recognized that\n            over-emphasis on achieving enrollment targets at all costs,\n            may well be counter productive. Nonetheless, establishing\n            targets that are ambitious, may help preserve the validity\n            of sector development plans."}, "docdt": "2005-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
