Investments that cross\n            over different sectors as well as different elected\n            administrations run the risk of disenfranchisement by the\n            incoming administration in some of the participating\n            sectors. Successful projects are built on the foundation of\n            previous, smaller scale interventions. Effective\n            supervisions, looking at both the substantive parts of the\n            project as well as the fiduciary and governance aspects of\n            implementation, are key instruments to continually improve\n            the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation.\n            The early stages of Trust in Support of the System of\n            Occupational Standards and Certification (CONOCER) where\n            highly inefficient and costly as a result of its\n            supply-driven and untargeted approach.

The competency-based\n            scheme seems to work more effectively where there exists a\n            clear articulation between the upper technical secondary\n            (UTS) schools and the regional productive sectors,\n            especially the private ones."}, "docdt": "2004-10-15T00:00:00Z"}
