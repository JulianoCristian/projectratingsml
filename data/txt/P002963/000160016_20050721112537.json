sustainability is\n            likely; institutional development impact is substantial;\n            Bank performance is satisfactory; and Borrower performance\n            is satisfactory. These are among the lessons cited from this\n            project: 1) Political commitment is a strong catalyst for\n            mounting a broad-based national response to the HIV/AIDS\n            epidemic. It also influences program content. In this case,\n            the government was sensitive to the convictions of religious\n            groups and other facets of civil society, so that the\n            promotion of condoms and support to marginalized high-risk\n            groups received only modest support, and success was not\n            fully realized. 2) Even if it is provided for in project\n            design, monitoring and evaluation will not be carried out if\n            the incentives are not right. The setting of appropriate\n            targets requires knowledge of the right measures of success\n            and baseline data. 3) The failure to implement research on\n            the cost-effectiveness of various interventions is a missed\n            opportunity to learn from experience and to enhance program\n            impacts. 4) The reliable provision of relevant supplies\n            (such as condoms and drugs for treating sexually transmitted\n            diseases, tuberculosis, and opportunistic infections) is\n            critical to successfully implementing HIV/AIDS programs."}, "docdt": "2005-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
