MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
FOR A SEXUALLY TRANSMIlTED INFECTIONS PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Uganda for SDR 36.3 million, the
equivalent of US$50 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help
finance a Sexually Transmitted Infections Project. The Government, approximately 10
percent of total project costs or about US$ 7.4 million. KfW (Germany), ODA (UK) and
SIDA (Sweden) have agreed to suprort this project through cofinancing totalling US$16
million. Their respective contributions are KfW (US$6.8 million) ODA (US$4.2 million),
and SIDA (US$5.0 million). Other donor agencies providing support include WHO and
USAID.
Sector Background:
2.    The health status of Uganda's 16.5 million people is poor. Life expectancy at birth
is only 47 years; the crude death rate is 19 per 1000 population; the under-5 mortality rate
is 185 per 1000 live births (versus 100 per thousand in low-income countries); and about
23% of children in a survey were found to display low weight-for-age, reflecting
nutritional deficiencies. The leading causes of death are AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria,
for adults; and malaria, pneumonia, and diarrhea for children. Uganda's health problems
are compounded by a high total fertility rate (TFR) of 7.3, reflecting a contraceptive
prevalence rate of only 5%, and yielding a high population growth rate of 3.1%. Uganda's
maternal mortality rate of about 500 per 100,000 live births is more than twelve times
higher than in developed countries.
3.    Any discussion of the health sector in Uganda in the 1990s is dominated by STDs
and AIDS in particular. Although other health issues remain critical, they are dwarfed by
the magnitude and immediacy of an estimated 1.5 million Ugandans being infected with
HIV. This translates to one in every six to seven persons being infected with HIV. The
consequences of the AIDS epidemic are far reaching. First, the health and longevity of the
population is threatened. Gains in quality of life indices such as life expectancy and infant
mortality have been lost. Investments in educating Ugandans are being lost. And the
painstaking accumulation of critical human capital is being lost. Second are the severe and
long term economic implications for the country. AIDS affects mostly the productive
segmnent of society--the 15-50 year olds. Industrial and private sector growth, along with
development of institutional capacity, all need skilled workers and leaders. Loss of these
individuals to AIDS has significant consequences for the rebuilding of the Ugandan
economy. Third are the social consequences. It is difficult to measure the large scale
disruption to families and communities, the personal losses and the stigmatization suffered
by family members. Families and communities are faced with large numbers of children
and elderly who have lost the people who support and care for them. In brief, Uganda is



2
experiencing an epidemic that rivals the worst ever experienced by any nation. Without a
cure or vaccine for AIDS, neither of which is anticipated in the foreseeable future, even
the most optimistic scenario shows a devastating and far-reaching impact on the social and
economic fabric of the country.
4.    Uganda was among the first countries in Africa to realize the possible impact of
the epidemic. Up to June 1993 41,000 cases of AIDS have been reported to the Ministry
of Health. It should however be realized that due to under diagnosis, under reporting,
etc., this only represents a fraction of the cases that have actually occurred since the start
of the epidemic. It is estimated that currently 1. 5 million people are infected in the
country out of a total population of 16.5 million and that the actual number of cumulative
AIDS cases is over 300,000. The WHO HIV/AIDS EPI-model projects that the number
of HIV infected people could increase to more than 1.9 million in 1998. It also projects
that between 1993 and 1998 565,000 adults and 250,000 children will die from AIDS. By
1998 almost 900,000 children below 15 year will have lost their mothers due to AIDS.
The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) is high and the problem appears to
be growing. STDs, particularly genital ulcers, are important risk factors for the
transsmission of HIV. The Ministry of Health's planning unit report of 1992 stated that
4.5% of all Out-Patient Department (OPD) diagnoses were due to STDs. Since then
various reports have quoted an upward trend in STDs.
5.    The predominant mode of transmission in Uganda as elsewhere in Africa is
heterosexual with roughly equal numbers of women and men affected. Of the new
infections occurring in Uganda it is estimated that 84% are due to sexual transmission,
14% due to transmission from mother to infant, and less than 2% due to other routes of
transmission. The only way to achieve control of AIDS in the foreseeable future is
through prevention. There are two main strategies for prevention in Uganda:
*  promotion of safer sexual behaviors, which may include: abstinence before
marriage and faithfulness to one's partner after marriage - if there is any variation
at all from these requirements, a condom is essential and the only way to save
lives.
*  prevention and treatment of other STDs.
6.    Recognizing the severity of the AIDS epidemic, the Government established the
Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC) with a Secretariat in 1991. Unfortunately, the UAC
has had numerous start-up difficulties, including deinition of its role and responsibilities.
The staffing of the Secretariat has not been suitable to undertake coordination activities.
While there is a legitimate role for the UAC, the Secretariat needs restructuring and re-
defining to enable it to coordinate national level activities and disseminate information. In
1993, a National Operational Plan (NOP) was developed, providing the backbone for the
national efforts to prevent HIV infection and to mitigate the adverse health and socio-
economic impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The NOP calls for increased nationwide
concerted efforts. The main features of the plan are:



3
* Decentralization, AIDS activities will be planned, managed and monitored at the
district level. but activities will be decentralized further with responsibility for
imnplementation at the sub-county and villa ga/coinmunity levels.
*  Community mobilization, communities will be assisted to mobilize their own
resources to assess and deal with factors facilitating HIV transmission within the
community and to handle the health and socio-econromic impact.
*  Non governmental organizations, will be encouraged to work with communities
and to complement government activities.
7.    Project Objectives: The objectives of the proposed project are:
(i) To prevent sexual transmission of HIV by: Promotion of safer sexual
behavior; provision of condoms; promotion of STD care seeking
behavior; and provision of effective STD care.
(ii) To mitigate the personal impact of AIDS by: Provision of support for
community and home based health care and social support for people
with AIDS; briefing of staff and provision of drugs for opportunistic
infections and protective supplies for district health facilities
(government and non government); and, provision of TB diagnosis and
case management.
(iii) To support institutional development to manage HIV prevention and
AIDS care by: Strengthening the Districts capacity to plan, coordinate,
inplement, monitor and evaluate integrated AIDS related activities;
and, strengthening the national capacity to provide adequate te'mhnical
support on health issues related to AIDS.
Expected key outcomes by end of the project include:
- ability of 50 percent of the target population to cite at least two
acceptable ways of protecting themselves from HIV;
-  50 percent reported condom use among the target population,
-  a 20 percent decrease of reported non regular sexual partners; and
-  an increase of appropriate STD case management to 70% of those
individuals seeldng STD care.

Project Description:
8.    Prevention of Seiual Transmission of HIV (US$35 Omillion) would be achieved
through promotion of safer sexual behavior, increased condom availability and usage and
provision of care and treattnent of STDs. Promotion of safer sexual behavior would be
achieved through awareness and mass mobilization campaigns, community mobilization
campaigns and targeted behavioral interventions and services. Through an intense
behavior modification program the project is expected to influence changes in the sexual
practices of target populations. Increased use of condoms is expected and the project
would make them widely available. Condoins would be provided through multiple
channels including government and NCQO health facilities; NGO and CBO programs;
organized groups like the Army and Police; and, Social Marketing Programs. The proiect
supports the care and treatment of STDs, including behavioral change, drugs and
diagnostics and training for health personnel.
9.    Mitigation of the Personal Impact of AIDS (US$22.4 million). This component
finance drugs, protection supplies and health care services to mitigate the personal impact
of AIDS. The AIDS epidemic results in overstretching of existing hospital capacity to
provide health care in Uganda. Many AIDS patients need social and counseling services
that cannot be provided by government facilities. Numerous NGOs and CBOs are
involved in supporting HIV/AIDS patients, but they often lack fuids to meet the full
extent of the reeds or provide services which are not cost-effective and sustainable.
Famnilies providing care at home for their relatives, as well as other selected care providers,
will be identified by the District Health Team (DIT) and supported by this project. The
project would finance contracts between DHTs, NGOs and CBOs to imp.ement home and
community care of patients with AIDS. Patients with AIDS are immuno-depressed and
contract opportunistic infections easily. This component provides support for drugs and
clinical and protective supplies. From a public health standpoint, the most serious of the
many HIV related infections is tuberculosis. People who are immuno depressed contract
tuberculosis easily and in turn infect those with whom they are in close contact. Already
in Uganda, the number of tuberculosis cases has risen dramatically. The project supports
the diagnosis and care management of tuberculosis.
10.  Institutional Development (US$10.7 million). This comlponent will fnance
incremental salaries, local and overseas training, technical assistance, office supplies and
vehicle running and maintenance costs. The component would help develop the capability
of districts to plan and implement STD/AIDS activities thereby ensuring stronger local
commitment to disease control efforts. At the same time the role of the National level
would change from day to day program implementation to one of technical support and
training. The project will help evolve the new roles and responsibilities of the national and
district-levels. At the same time activities such as surveillance, operations research,
monitoring and evaluation are nationwide in scope and will be nationally implemented.
The results of these activities will enable the project to be responsive to the changing
patterns of STIs. Funds are also provided for innovative NGO cfivities. Often with small
sums of money NGOs are able to develop and try out new approaches



S
Project Financing:
11.   Total project cost is US$ 73.4 million, including US$5.2 million for contingencies.
The IDA credit of US$50 million (S;)R 36.3 million) would cover about 68% of the total
projvnt cost or 73% of the foreign exchange costs and 53% of the local cost net of duties
and taxes. In addition to donors cofinancing, as outlined para 1, WHO pal ticipated in the
design and appraisal of the project and is expected to continue its support through
implementation. USAID will provide technical assistance and training outside the project.
The Government, NGOs and CBOs contribution of US$7.4 million would finance about
10% of the total project cost. The project has been listed as "core" in the country's
development estimates. Counterpart funding is assured. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key prccessing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Uganda are shown in
Schedule C and D, respectively. More detailed information is provided in the Staff
Appraisal Report No. 12630.
Project Implementation:
12.   The Ministry of Health will be responsible for overall project coordination. The
Permanent Secretary (PS), MOH will be the Project Director in charge of coordination
and implementation. The bulk of project activities will be implemented through district
level organization, community groups and NGOs. The AIDS Control Program will
provide strong technical backstopping to the districts. The Director of ACP will have
responsibility for the technical aspects of the project. A Project Steering Committee,
chaired by the PS, MOH with representatives from the MOH, MOI, MOLG, MOFP,
UAC, NMS and ACP will be established to act as an advisory body to the implementing
parties. NGOs; other ministries and specialized divisions within the MOH (MCH, PHC,
etc.) will be invited to participate in the Committee whenever necessary. The Project
Coordinator will be the Secretary of the Steering Committee. The projec., which would
be coordinated by the Ministry of Health, would use government, NGOs, CBOs, private
sector contractors, training and research institutions to implement the proposed project.
13.   At the disti,-,t level, the District Medical Officer will be responsible for
coordinating project activities. In the decentralized districts he will work closely with the
DES who will be the accounting officer. He will work closely with NGOs active in the
district as well as with members of the District Health and Development Committees
(DHC and DDC), and community groups to ensure that services are provided to the
largest groups of peoples within the district that could play an active role in the control of
STIs.
14.   A project Coordinator, (a Ugandan national), has been appointed and will be
located in the PIU of the First Health Project. The Project Coordinator will work in close
cooperation with the Director of the ACP. Accountants, procurement specialists, and



6
other support staff already in place for the First Health Project will support this project as
needed. Depending on the need, financing of these will be taken over by the project when
the First Health Project comes to an end. An evaluation officer will be appointed for this
project. Short-term consultancies will be approved by IDA as required on an ad hoc basis.
The role of the PCU will be to facilitate the implementation of the project, including
handling the administrative requirements of IDA. Local and international contracting will
be utilized to the maximum extent for several implementation actions, e.g. procurement of
drugs and condoms. All project activities will be undertaken by existing units or offices of
the health system. No new government office will be created though provision does exist
for the expansion of successful NGOs. Supplies such as condoms, drugs, diagnostics and
protective items are to be procured by initially the NMS following procedures agreed on
with IDA. Supplies will be distributed according to the workplans of the respective
program offices.
Project Sustainability:
15.   The recurrent cost implications of the project are small. No new buildings are
being constructed, and no additional staff are likely to be hired. Government will finance
the maintenance costs of new equipment purchased, through the MOH budgetary
allocation. These costs are estimated at 5% of purchase price annually. The project will
be managed by staff already in place except for a project coordinator, secretary and driver.
Most ACP staff are already on MOH payroll. Other PIU staff are being funded through
the First Health Project. Given that the health sector has been seriously underfunded over
the past several years, the MOH has been unable to finance the purchase of drugs or pay a
living wage to its staff. It is expected that Treasury allocations for health will increase. At
the same time a number of cost recovery measures as well as decentralization of health
services are being introduced. These issues are being addressed through the proposed
District Health Services project currently under preparation and expected to be appraised
during this fiscal year.
16.   Expenditures on condoms and STD drugs are substantial and likely to remain high
over the medium term. Donor funding for these commodities will be necessary for the
foreseeable future. The cost of maintaining new equipment purchased through the project
is expected to be 5% of the purchase price annually. These amounts will be included in
the annual budgetary allocations of the MOH. At the district level there will be increased
costs of travel for health staff following up STD and Tuberculosis cases. With
decentralization, districts will be empowered to allocate their budgets in accordance with
health care priorities. It is also envisaged that, wherever possible, charges will be made
for condoms and STD drugs, The proceeds of these charges will be retained within the
district health budget.
17.   Many of the consumable items being funded are investments in human capital, and
will r.store good health or prevent illness. Condoms, drugs for TB treatment and gloves
for health workers are examples. Provision of these items reduces rather than incurs
recurrent costs in the health sector: every TB patient treated, or every HIV-infection



7
averted, reduces the number of future potential patients seeking health care. Left
unchecked, STD infections in men cause mild to severe genital or urinary tract problems
and can cause infertility. The consequences for women, who are often asymptomatic and
therefore unaware of the infection, include adverse outcorint- of pregnancy for mothers
and newborns, infections in newborns and infants, infertility, cervical cancer, and in some
cases death. These impose vastly higher costs than STD treatment. The direct drug costs
of presumptive treatment of the most common STD syndromes are US$2.91 (for Genital
Ulcer Disease), US$3.43 (for urethral discharge) and US$4.23 (for vaginal discharge).
Viewed another way, it has been estimated that at US$10/hour for clinic time, in a country
with an HIV seroprevalence rate of 5% (less than half the seroprevalence rate in Uganda),
treatment of a core group of high-risk STD patients costs between US 11 c and 96c per
healthy life year saved, and is an extremely cost-effective health intervention.
Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement and Linkages with Sector Policy:
18. IDA is financing an ongoing Fi'st Health Project which became effective in 1988.
The project had a slow start, l'ra' .  .. to shortcomings iri ;oject administration, many
of which are common to otlitt -.  *;; 3d rroject in Uganda. The initial difficulties
have been overcome and thoug' -. rie problems remain the project is expected to be
completed on schedule. Discuss:o., on health policy reform have resulted in efforts to
develop a new project. The proposed Community Health and AIDS Project (CHAP) was
to address health policy issues and to support efforts to contain the growing AIDS
epidemic. As preparation proceeded it was felt that the project as designed would be
extremely complicated. Accordingly a decision was made to split CHAP into 2 projects -
an STD/AIDS project and a District Health Services Project. IDA has been closely
involved in the AIDS sector since 1988. In 1990, IDA jointly with WHO and UNDP, led
a multi-donor mission to review the AIDS situation in Uganda. Since then, support has
been given for the establishment of the UAC by funding the post of Director-General.
More recently savings from the First Health Project have been committed for procurement
of STD drugs and condoms. The project is designed to be flexible and innovative so as to
encourage community initiatives. Hence, by its vety design, several activities will be
"pilot" in nature.
19.   An intensive dialogue with the Ministry of Health on health policy reform is
ongoing. In June 1993, several senior MOH officials attended a workshop in Washington
on the World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health. Subsequently the MOH
prepared a Policy Paper on Health Policy, incorporating several WDR recommendations,
which has been approved by the Cabinet. Parliament has also passed a Decentralization
Biil thereby providing a legal basis for the decentralization of health services. Further
work on the reform is continuing and wvill be a part of the proposed District Health
Services Project to be appraised later this fiscal year. A letter of Sector Policy is being
developed as part of preparation of that project. The proposed Sn project closely
follows the decentralized approach.



8
Rationale for IDA Involvement and Country Assistance Strategy:
20.   The AIDS epidemic is already having a severe impact on the economy, especially
since so many of its victims are just reaching the prime of their active economic lives. The
Government is keen to have the Bank play a kLy role. Expenditures needed for AIDS
interventions are substantial and it has been demonstrated over the years that the AIDS
Control Program has been severely underfunded. Other donors have previously been
reluctant to finance the costs of treatment of STDs despite the high payoff noted above.
IDA is willing to finance the operating unit costs of treatment as an investment in human
capital. IDA would also be able to ensure that appropriate policies such as
decentralization and palliative home care are adopted. Finally, IDA would play a highly
effective role in addressing the implementation problems of the AIDS program as well as
act as a catalyst to attract additional donor funding. The objectives of the proposed
project are consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for Uganda discussed by the
Board on May 20, 1993 which emphasizes poverty alleviation. The preventive component
will help the population avoid AIDS-related poverty, while the mitigation component will
assist those who are afflicted.
Agreed Actions:
21.   Prior to negotiations the Government implemented the following measures:
prepared and submitted to IDA sample tender documents for drugs, diagnostics and
condoms; appointed a suitably qualified and experienced project coordinator; appointed a
project steering committee; and submitted a draft implementation manual.
22.   During negotiations agreement was reached that: (a) a timetable for airing of TV
and Radio materials be submitted to IDA annually by March 31 each year; (b) the
production of TV and radio materials would be undertaken by through open competition;
(c) all biomedical research proposals be reviewed by an independent panel; (d) progress
reports and beneficiary assessment data be consolidated by the ACP and submitted to IDA
every 6 months; (e) work plans be submitted to IDA by March 31 annually; (f) the annual
district health plans include activities and earmarked funds for drugs to be distributed by
NGOs and CBOs; (g) a mid-term evaluation of the project be held in 1996 and that a
project completion report be prepared by the Government within 6 months of the closing
date of the project; and (h) all project accounts be audited by the Auditor General and that
all audited accounts, together with the auditors report, be submitted to IDA not later than
six months after the end of each goverment fiscal year.
23.   As conditions of credit effectiveness, the MOH would invite all broadcast media
entities to submit proposals to air programs for the first year of the project. The
Government would have contracted suitable organizations to distribute condoms to NGOs
throughout Uganda. A project implementation manual would be furnished satisfactory to
the Association. As a condition of disbursement, the Mnistty of Health would ensure that
district health teams include in their submission of the initial annual district health plan,
activities and earmarked funds for drugs to be distributed by NGOs and CBOs.

Environment Assessment:
24.   The project is classified as category C, with no adverse impact on the environment.
Benefits:
25.   The project would have an immediate impact by making STD care available
nationally. It would strengthen the Government's ability to deal with opportunistic
i.ifections such as TB. Through the provision of condoms, the project would have an
immediate effect on the transmission of STDs. In the medium term the project will
directly benefit 66500 tuberculosis patients and their families, fellow-workers and others
who would be at risk of infection through contact with them. It will provide condoms to
an estimated 4 million persons, thus protecting them and their sexual partners from the
risk of contracting HIV and STDs. The project will furnish sufficient diagnostics to test
every pregnant women who seeks care from syphilis during the life of the project,
benefiting them and their unborn children. More than 1.5 million people with FHV will
receive care for various infections. Protective supplies will safeguard an estimated 7000
health workers from the risk of HIV and tens of thousands of patients from nosocomiat
and iatrogenic infections.
26.   The TB control program will have received drugs and supplies needed to treat all
identified cases, follow-up patients to help ensure compliance with treatment, trace
contacts, and verify suspected cases and refer them for treatment. The project witl help to
avert a major resurgence of TB incidence. Prevention of STDs and HV will result in
large savings in sickness care expenditures. The drain on society by the loss of life from
AIDS is staggering in human, social and economic terms. Investment in reducing STDs
and HIV will produce savings and increased economic activity through carefully targeted
interventions. For instance a Nairobi program found that 6,000 to 10,000 new HIV
infections a year were averted at a cost $0.50 per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY)
gained. Palliative home care costs between $30 and $75 per DALY gained. Curing each
case of gonorrhea in a core group saves 120 DALYs, at a cost well below the $1 per
DALY gained if the benefits of fewer secondaiy cases and the reduced risk of HIV
transmission are included. Thus the project will be an effective means protecting large
numbers of Uganda's labor force against the disease, and their dependents against AIDS-
related poverty.
Risks:
27.   The principal risk for the project is that the incidence rates of HIV, STDs or TB,
all high already, may increase so quickly as to overwhelm even the integrated and
intensified effort of Uganda's STI program. The only way of averting this risk is to mount
the most inclusive, cost-effective program possible in the shortest time. A secondary risk
is that the health services may lack sufficient experience and capacity to implement an
effective STD screening and prevention program. The project provides for traiDing of



10
health workers in STD diagnosis and treatment. There is also some risk that sufficiently
broad Government support may not materialize. Public commitment to STI control is an
important aspect of program success, especially in spreading accurate and timely
information. Given the high public awareness about STDs, Government's forthright
treatment of the issue and integrated effort (including IEC) already underway, this risk is
regarded as small. Another risk is that the ACP capacity may prove inadequate to cope
with the complexity and size of the coordinating task involved. A project coordinator will
be appointed and short-term technical assistance provided as necessary. A final risk is that
the behavioral changes the STI program seeks to promote are likely to prove difficult to
achieve. Through annual work plans and a mid-term review a process of continuous
monitoring will be established to enable modification of strategies as appropriate. Limited
experience in other countries, however, suggests that the literal life-and-death choice
posed by the proliferation of STIs has proven compelling enough to override even the
inherent resistance to change.
Recommendation:
28.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

DISBURSEMENT ISSUES
1.    The active IDA portfolio for Uganda at the end of December 1993, consisted of 27
projects for a total commitment of US$1.09 billion, with US$674.6 million undisbursed.
This included 24 investment projects for a total of US$796 million committed and US$514
million undisbursed. Over the last five years, the investment portfolio has shown a trend
of rapidly increasing undisbursed balance, growing at an average rate of 17% per year,
whereas disbursements remained at about US$68 million per year on average - with
US$78.8 million disbursed in FY93. The corresponding disbursement factor (ratio of
disbursements to cumulative net undisbursed balance at the beginning of the FY) declined
from an average of about 20% for FY89-91 to about 15% in FY92-93. Meanwhile,
problem projects increased from 14% in FY92 to 19% of the portfolio in FY93.
2.    The portfolio's modest disbursement performance is due in part to its relatively
young age structure (average of 4.8 years). However, as suggested by the increasing
number of problem projects, there are also other issues which have undermined progress.
3.    The major issues are: (a) shortage of counterpart funds resulting from poor
mobilization of domestic resources and an excessive portfolio of externally funded
projects; (b) weakness in project management and initial delays in meeting conditions of
effectiveness; and (c) other deficiencies regarding procurement, management of special
accounts, and compliance with audit covenants.
4.    An in-depth Public Expenditure Review (PER) will be carried out in FY94,
following upon a similar exercise in FY93 to reach agreement on a core investment
program for which the Government will provide adequate counterpart fimding (even if this
means postponing or canceling non-core projects). Thereafter, the CPPR (Country
Portfolio Performance Review) will finahze restructuring of the Bank s portfolio on the
basis of the framework provided by the PER. At the same time, Govemment and the
Bank will review progress in overcoming generic implementation issues identified during
previous CPPRs. Other plans for FY94 include: (a) organization of Sector
Implementation Reviews in association with the responsible project managers; (b)
provision by the Resident Mission of greater support to project managers on procurement,
special accounts, disbursements, and auditing; and (c) continuation of the practice of
preparing implementation mamuals for new projects.
