    Diseases (STDs). The project will finance awareness, mass\n            and community mobilization campaigns using Government,\n            nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and community based\n            organizations (CBOs). It will finance targeted behavioral\n            interventions and services aimed at high-risk groups through\n            NGO and CBO programs. In particular, the project will\n            finance the provision of condoms, care and treatment of\n            STDs, including drugs and training of staff; and (2)\n            mitigation of the personal impact of Acquired Immune\n            Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The project will support\n            community and home based health care and provide social\n            support for people with AIDS. This will be accomplished\n            through NGOs and CBOs at the district and community levels.\n            The project will support the orientation of staff in dealing\n            with opportunistic infections and will provide drugs for\n            these infections. Also included are the provision of\n            clinical and protective supplies. Tuberculosis is the most\n            serious HIV related infection from a public health\n            standpoint and the project will support the diagnosis and\n            case management of tuberculosis; and (3) institutional\n            development. The project will support the development of\n            district and central capacity to plan and manage STD/AIDS\n            programs. It will also support surveillance, operational\n            research and monitoring and evaluation activities. Funds\n            will also be provided for innovative NGO and CBO activities."}, "docdt": "1994-03-09T00:00:00Z"}
