PROJECTS (TANZANIA -", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Project outcome is rated satisfactory,\n            and project sustainability is likely. Both the overall\n            performances of the World Bank and the Borrower are rated\n            satisfactory. Several key lessons have been learned: 1) The\n            success of an HIV/AIDS project depends very much on national\n            commitment and leadership. This project found a conducive\n            environment where the government was committed to the fight\n            against AIDS, a strong national AIDS control program, and a\n            large number of active civil society organizations already\n            involved in HIV/AIDS programs. 2) This project was\n            implemented at a time when Uganda had just embarked on an\n            ambitious decentralization agenda that sought to devolve the\n            responsibility for the planning and implementation of\n            essential public services, including health, to the district\n            administrations. Such devolution of power presents several\n            challenges for the design and implementation of\n            Bank-supported sectoral projects, that need to be recognized\n            and effectively managed, but that were significantly\n            underestimated by the project. 3) STIP was also implemented\n            at a time when various other public sector reform measures\n            were being implemented, some which had a direct impact on\n            HIV/AIDS programs. In these situations, it is critical that\n            the project requirements are appropriately harmonized with\n            other ongoing or planned public sector reform initiatives.\n            4) Capacity for public procurement of HIV/AIDS related\n            commodities needs to be assessed early and the necessary\n            agreements reached with government to ensure early\n            commencement of procurement activities. 5) Projects working\n            with multiple implementing partners, such as districts,\n            sub-district entities and community-based\n            organizations/nongovernmental organizations need to make\n            multiple advances to these implementing partners and thus\n            require a correspondingly larger Special Account. The\n            criteria for the selection of commercial banks for the\n            location of Special Accounts should also be scrutinized,\n            revised if necessary, and strictly adhered to. 6) The issue\n            of mutually agreed upon counterpart funding not forthcoming\n            has become a systemic feature of projects in Uganda, and\n            need to be equally addressed in a more systemic manner,\n            rather than on a project-by-project basis. 7) A viable and\n            effective monitoring and evaluation framework that is\n            mutually agreed upon at the time of project preparation is a\n            must for the effective implementation and evaluation of a\n            project. 8) A more targeted approach to gender-specific\n            behavior change communication; more stringent use of gender\n            disaggregated data (e.g., sexual debut, knowledge,\n            attitudes, beliefs, and practices on ways to prevent HIV) to\n            document project achievements, and enhanced support to women\n            as home based caregivers would have considerably\n            strengthened the gender dimensions of the project. 9)\n            Preventive strategies need continued support and need to be\n            better targeted to the un-reached population groups in order\n            to prevent a further stagnation of impact. 10) Finally, it\n            is clear that the single most important factor in the\n            success of Uganda was the rapid national movement from\n            denial to the acceptance of HIV as a major health and\n            socio-economic problem that needed to be confronted head-on.\n            Unfortunately, this may not be directly replicable, and,\n            therefore, the \"Uganda Model\" should not be\n            regarded as a \"silver bullet\". However, several\n            facets of Uganda's approach to AIDS control undoubtedly\n            contributed to this conversion from denial to acceptance,\n            such as the political commitment emanating from the very\n            top, the constructive collaboration between the political\n            and the religious establishments, and the active engagement\n            of civil society actors in the fight against AIDS. Looking\n            forward, these elements of Uganda's HIV strategy may\n            well be replicated in other settings."}, "docdt": "2003-06-23T00:00:00Z"}
