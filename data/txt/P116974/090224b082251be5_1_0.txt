                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is implemented by the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS) through its Coordination Unit for Programs and Projects with International
                         Financing that has served as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in coordination with theSAyDS Climate Change Directorate. The project became effective on July 27, 2012, after a
                         1-year delay. Following a slow project implementation start-up, the project closing date was extended by 18 months until November 13, 2014.

                         By Jan 14, USD 500,000 (20.5% of the total grant) has been disbursed. The following paragraphs present the principal advances achieved under the three main project components:

                         Component 1 on climate mitigation: Four major consultancy contracts for conducting a combined greenhouse gas emissions inventory and a study on mitigation potential and
                         measures on Energy; Agriculture and Land Use Change and Forestry; Industrial Processes and Product Use; and Waste have been successfully negotiated. Terms of Reference
                         (ToRs) for the next three studies: socio-economic scenarios that will complete the on-going climate modeling; mitigation options in the transport sector; and energy efficiency in
                         public, residential, and commercial buildings are currently under preparation.

                         Component 2 on climate adaptation: The project single biggest study on climate modeling has been carried out by the Research Center on the Sea and the Atmosphere (CIMA) since
                         Sep 2013 and is advancing well. Further, the first three ToRs for the sector-specific adaptation studies on the Argentine eco-regions and ecosystem services, fisheries, and labor
                         have been finalized, while ToRs for studies on water resources and the tourism sector are being reviewed.

                         Component 3 on institutional strengthening, capacity building, and information management: The project Steering Committee (SC) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) continue
                         to perform their duties as per their ToRs with the support of the component Coordinator that was contracted in Sep. A draft of the project communication strategy was prepared in Dec
                         2013.

                         The mid-term review (MTR) of project implementation carried out in Sep 2013 proposed revisions to the project results framework in order to better reflect the implementation
                         progress through the use of revised intermediate indicators. The MTR also highlighted how the complex procurement processes and administrative procedures within the SAyDS
                         remain a challenge for the project and put at risk the achievement of the project objectives within the existing time frame. An action plan was agreed on strengthening the PIU
                         procurement capacity and prepare the Argentine Republic First Biennial Update Report (BUR) to the UNFCCC as an additional activity under the project.
