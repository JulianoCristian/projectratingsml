Global Environmental Objectives

 Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objective of the Project is to strengthen the information base and institutional capacity of the key members of the Steering Committee, in
 order to integrate climate change priorities into the Recipient’s development strategies and relevant sector programs by providing financial and
 technical support to prepare the TNC

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

This is the final Implementation Status Report of the Project that has been implemented by the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable
Development (SAyDS) through a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in coordination with the SAyDS Climate Change Directorate. Following a slow
implementation start-up, the Project closing date was extended twice; first by 18 and then by 7.5 months, until June 30, 2015.

The Project continues intense implementation until the day of its closure. In mid-June, 2015 the PCU/SAyDS was reviewing final reports of the
majority of the financed studies and organizing the final dissemination events to complete visits to all of the six regions as organized through the
Federal Council of Environment (COFEMA) and the complete Project implementation by a bigger public dissemination event in Buenos Aires the
very June 30, 2015. These reductions imply that the project will not be able to complete key contributions to P&M in order to integrate climate
change priorities into the Recipient’s development strategies and relevant sector programs. However, the project and SAyDS are undertaking all
efforts to produce the studies needed for the Government to present its Third National Communication to the UNFCCC.

The principal results achieved under the three main Project components are as follows:

Component 1 on climate mitigation: Four major greenhouse gas emissions inventories and studies on mitigation potential and measures on Energy;
Agriculture and Land Use Change and Forestry; Industrial Processes and Product Use; and Waste, and three studies on mitigation options in the
transport sector; energy efficiency in industrial SMEs; and climate change related financing instruments. As an additional result of this component,
the Project delivers the substance material needed to prepare the first Biennial Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to the UNFCCC.

Component 2 on climate adaptation: The Project's biggest study on climate modeling has been successfully completed and disclosed by the
Research Center on the Sea and the Atmosphere (CIMA) and the related database is available for registered users at the CIMA website
(http://3cn.cima.fcen.uba.ar/index1.php). Further, nine studies on sector-specific impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation options are being finalized by
the Project closure on key labor markets, social vulnerability, agriculture, energy, tourism, the natural resources and ecosystem services of the
Cordillera ecoregion, the Patagonia ecoregion, the Argentine Sea, and a reduced version of the study on the semi-arid ecoregion, all conducted by
individual consultants coordinated by the PCU.

Component 3 on institutional strengthening, capacity building, and information management: The project Steering Committee (SC) and Technical
Advisory Committee (TAC) have continued participating in review of the ongoing studies' progress and final reports. Further, institutional
collaboration was established on specific topics with different Ministries such as Energy and Transport, as well as with the provincial focal points
nominated through the Federal Council of Environment (COFEMA). The Project's communication strategy has continued under implementation
through various channels, e.g. a website (http://www.ambiente.gov.ar/?idseccion=356) and newsletter available for interested public. Lastly,
presentations on the Project results were organized in the six COFEMA regions, and a final presentation in the City of Buenos Aires.

               The consultant work needed to produce the BUR subject matter is being finalized by the forthcoming Project closure, but there is not
               sufficient time to produce the actual BUR report. The same relates with the TNC report. The PCU/SAyDS continues in search of alternative
               financing sources in order to deliver the two reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the Project closure.

               Framework in the December 2014 Restructuring Paper under component 1 on mitigation. Three further final reports remained pending of
               submission, namely for the studies on mitigation options in transport sector and through improved energy efficiency, and for the study on
               climate change related financial instruments. By the Project closure, the final result will be 18. The only output that will remain pending is the
               above referred compilation of the final BUR report.

               study on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation options on key labor markets. By the Project closure, submission of eight further final reports
               remains pending for a final result of 11 studies, adding eight studies on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation options on 4) social vulnerability
               (these first four outputs were reflected in the restructured end target), 5) agriculture, 6) energy, 7) tourism, 8) the natural resources and
               ecosystem services of the Cordillera ecoregion, 9) the Patagonia ecoregion, 10) the Argentine Sea, and a reduced version of the study on

               The result reflects the level of participation by respective key agencies (defined in the Operational Manual separately for each study) on
               reviewing the progress/final reports of the mitigation studies. "Participation” is defined as a contribution with at least one relevant comment
               on the revised document.

               The result reflects the level of participation by respective key agencies (defined in the Operational Manual separately for each study) on
               reviewing the progress/final reports of the adaptation studies. "Participation” is defined as a contribution with at least one relevant comment
               on the revised document. The actual (as well as actual previous) result is higher than the end target, taken the additional adaptation studies
               that the Project was able to initiate, compared with the situation right after the Project restructuring in December 2014. At that moment, it
               was clear the Project could not conduct the studies that were planned to be carried out by consulting firms/universities and they
               were reduced from the revised target for this indicator. Afterwards, part of the studies were started with contributions by a group
               of individual consultants.

               Comments
               This indicator is constructed by comparing the number of initiated procurement processes with the number of processes expected to initiate
               each semester. The initiation of a process is defined as follows: in the case of goods, the date of the invitation to bidders to quote; for
               consulting services, the date of publication of the request for expressions of interest; and for individual consultants, the date of
               announcement of the position to be filled. To define the targets, all the processes covered by the SEPA (Procurement Plan Execution
               System) were considered, as in the SEPA in force at the time of the restructuring of the Project (December 2014). The final result of this
               indicator will be verified during the ICR preparation to make sure it reflects all the changes that took place in the SEPA during the second
               Project extension period.

               Comments
               This indicator is constructed by comparing the number of completed procurement processes with the number of processes expected to
               complete each semester. The completion of a process is defined as the signing of any type of contract between the parties. To define the
               targets, all the processes covered by the SEPA were considered, as in the SEPA in force at the time of the restructuring of the Project
               (December 2014). The final result of this indicator will be verified during the ICR preparation to make sure it reflects all the changes that
               took place in the SEPA during the second Project extension period.




 Overall Comments
 Taken the Project implementation continues intensively until the final day, all of the above reflected results will be verified and adjusted if pertinent
 during the ICR preparation.
