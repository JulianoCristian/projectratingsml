Global Environmental Objectives

 Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The objective of the Project is to strengthen the information base and institutional capacity of the key members of the Steering Committee, in
 order to integrate climate change priorities into the Recipient’s development strategies and relevant sector programs by providing financial and
 technical support to prepare the TNC

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

The project is implemented by the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS) through its Coordination Unit for Programs
and Projects with International Financing that has served as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in coordination with the SAyDS Climate Change
Directorate. The project became effective on July 27, 2012, after a 1-year delay. Following a slow project implementation start-up, the project
closing date was extended by 18 months until November 13, 2014.

A key decision during the current reporting period is the second project closing date extension that was approved by the Bank for additional 7.5
months until June 30, 2015. The main objectives of said extension were to (i) finalize ongoing studies under component 1 and 2 on climate
mitigation and adaptation, (ii) prepare a basic Biennial Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and (iii) conduct related dissemination work and provincial level workshops on related capacity building.

Along the closing date extension, a minor project restructuring was approved to reallocate funds between disbursement categories and the
components, as well as to revise the results framework. Said revision improved measuring of intermediate results and reduced the number of
targeted adaptation studies and excluded the final studies on mitigation and adaptation policies and measures (P&M). These reductions imply that
the project will not be able to complete key contributions to P&M in order to integrate climate change priorities into the Recipient’s development
strategies and relevant sector programs. However, the project and SAyDS are undertaking all efforts to produce the studies needed for the
Government to present its Third National Communication to the UNFCCC.

By May 12, 2015, USD 1,200,000 (49.2 percent of the total grant) has been disbursed. The principal advances achieved under the three main
project components are following:

Component 1 on climate mitigation: Four major consultancy contracts for conducting a combined greenhouse gas emissions inventory and a study
on mitigation potential and measures on Energy; Agriculture and Land Use Change and Forestry; Industrial Processes and Product Use; and Waste
are about to be finalized. The three minor studies on mitigation options in the transport sector; energy efficiency in industrial SMEs; and climate
change related financing instruments are being conducted and are expected to finish by the project closing date. As an additional result of this
component, the project is expected to deliver the substance material needed to prepare the first Biennial Update Report of the Argentine Republic to
the UNFCCC.

Component 2 on climate adaptation: The project's biggest study on climate modeling has been successfully completed and disclosed by the
Research Center on the Sea and the Atmosphere (CIMA) and the related database is available for registered users at the CIMA website
(http://3cn.cima.fcen.uba.ar/index1.php). Out of the 10 planned sectoral vulnerability and adaptation studies, the project is expected to deliver
seven: the study on impacts on key labor markets is under final review, and the studies on agriculture, energy, tourism, and social vulnerability, as
well as reduced versions of the study on ecoregions and human health are being conducted by individual consultants.

Component 3 on institutional strengthening, capacity building, and information management: The project Steering Committee (SC) and Technical
Advisory Committee (TAC) have continued participating in review of the ongoing studies' progress reports. Further, institutional collaboration has
continued on specific topics with different Ministries such as Energy, and Transport, as well as with the provincial focal points nominated for the
project through the Federal Council of Environment (COFEMA). The project's communication strategy continues under implementation through
various channels, e.g. a website (http://www.ambiente.gov.ar/?idseccion=356) and newsletter available for interested public. By the end of June,
2015, presentations on the project results will be organized in the six COFEMA regions. In the end, preparation of educational materials on project
results did not result feasible within the remaining implementation period. Further, development of software for presenting the project results and
related information updates after the project closing did not result feasible for availability of consultants.

               All the consultant work needed to produce the BUR subject matter is under way and is expected to be finished before the project closure.
               What remains to be seen is if it's feasible to produce the actual report by the project closure. In case not, the report delivery to the Ministry of
               Foreign Affairs will become responsibility of the SAyDS staff.

               The result reflects the level of participation by respective key agencies (defined in the Operational Manual separately for each study) on
               reviewing the thus far progress/final reports of the mitigation studies. "Participation” is defined as a contribution with at least one relevant
               comment on the revised document.

               reviewing the thus far progress/final reports of the adaptation studies. "Participation” is defined as a contribution with at least one relevant
               comment on the revised document. The actual current result is higher than the end target, taken the additional adaptation studies that the
               project has been able to initiate with individual consultants, compared with the situation right after the project restructuring in Dec 2014. At
               that moment, it was clear the project could not conduct the studies that had been planned to be carried out by consulting firms/universities
               and they were reduced from the revised target for this indicator. Afterwards, part of the studies were started with contributions by a group
               of individual consultants.

               Comments
               This indicator is constructed by comparing the number of initiated procurement processes with the number of processes expected to initiate
               each semester. The initiation of a process is defined as follows: in the case of goods, the date of the invitation to bidders to quote; for
               consulting services, the date of publication of the request for expressions of interest; and for individual consultants, the date of
               announcement of the position to be filled. To define the targets, all the processes covered by the SEPA (Procurement Plan Execution
               System) were considered, as in the SEPA in force at the time of the restructuring of the project (December 2014). While this number of
               processes may vary during project implementation, potential amendments are not expected to be substantial.

 Overall Comments
 This indicator is constructed by comparing the number of completed procurement processes with the number of processes expected to complete
 each semester. The completion of a process is defined as the signing of any type of contract between the parties. To define the targets, all the
 processes covered by the SEPA were considered, as in the SEPA in force at the time of the restructuring of the project (December 2014).
