                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project became effective on July 27, 2012 after a 1-year delay. Since then a Coordination Unit for Programs and Projects with International Financing has been formally
                         established within the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS) to serve as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in coordination with the SAyDS Climate
                         Change Directorate (CCD).

                         The project Steering Committee (SC) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) have been constituted and have been engaged in the preparation of the Terms of Reference (ToRs)
                         for the climate modeling study that is now ready to be carried out, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories, and other key sectoral mitigation studies that will begin shortly after.

                         Due to the effectiveness delay and slow project implementation start-up, the project closing date was extended by 18 months to November 13, 2014. By March 31, the project had
                         disbursed US$ 300,000 (12.3% of the total) with about US$ 41,800 (1.7% of the total) spent.

                         With the main studies ready to be contracted and key PIU positions filled, it is expected that project implementation will pick up steadily from now on. However, the accumulated
                         delays and the complexity of some of the contractual arrangement increase the risk of not achieving the project objective within the remaining timeframe. A Mid-Term review of the
                         project is scheduled for September 2013.
