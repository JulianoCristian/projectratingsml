objective of the Third National\n            Communication (TNC) to the United Nations Framework\n            Convention on Climate Change Project is to strengthen the\n            information base and institutional capacity of the key\n            members of the Steering Committee, in order to integrate\n            climate change priorities into the recipient's\n            development strategies and relevant sector program by\n            providing financial and technical support to prepare the\n            TNC. This project restructuring covers a second extension of\n            the grant's closing date of an additional seven and\n            half (7.5) months, from November 13, 2014 to June 30, 2015,\n            to (i) finalize ongoing studies under component one and two\n            on climate mitigation and adaptation, (ii) prepare a basic\n            Biennial Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to\n            the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n            (UNFCCC), and (iii) conduct related dissemination work and\n            provincial level workshops on related capacity building. The\n            restructuring includes reallocation of funds between\n            disbursement categories and the components, as well as a\n            revision of the results framework. Said revision reduces the\n            number of targeted adaptation studies and excludes the final\n            studies on mitigation and adaptation policies and measures\n            (P&M). Further, it improves measuring of intermediate\n            results. The reductions reflect that the project will not be\n            able to complete key contributions to P&M and\n            integration of climate change priorities into the\n            Recipient\u0092s development strategies and relevant sector\n            programs. However, the project will undertake all efforts to\n            produce a final report on the project results that could be\n            presented to the UNFCCC."}, "docdt": "2014-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
