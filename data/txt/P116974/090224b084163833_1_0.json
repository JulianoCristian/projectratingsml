Some lessons learned included: reassessing\n            the implementation period for a slow-starter project for\n            administrative and political reasons should be conducted\n            with particular care and strategic actions are needed to\n            avoid failing to achieve goals and targets. Once a delayed\n            or stalled project becomes effective and starts\n            implementation activities, the Bank team should secure full\n            buy-in by government and executing agency and team for the\n            approved project and its implementation strategy. Projects\n            with demanding procurement processes should invest in early\n            identification of restrictions to hire key personnel due to\n            government regulations and policies. Carefully planned\n            operational strategy for consultative and advising bodies\n            can greatly enhance prospects for successful implementation.\n            Restructuring requires careful balancing when combining\n            critical and necessary adjustment needs."}, "docdt": "2016-01-29T00:58:03Z"}
