by\n            providing financial and technical support to prepare the\n            TNC. The closing date of the project will be extended from\n            May 31, 2013 until November 13, 2014. The extension is\n            necessary given that the project design requires a\n            sequencing between different studies (i.e., results of a\n            study will be needed in order to prepare a policy recommendation."}, "docdt": "2013-02-12T00:00:00Z"}
