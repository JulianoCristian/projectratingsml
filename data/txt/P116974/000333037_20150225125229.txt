                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

This project restructuring covers a second extension of the grant's closing date of an
additional seven and half (7.5) months, from November 13, 2014 to June 30, 2015, to (i)
finalize ongoing studies under component 1 and 2 on climate mitigation and adaptation,
(ii) prepare a basic Biennial Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and (iii) conduct
related dissemination work and provincial level workshops on related capacity building.
The proposed restructuring includes reallocation of funds between disbursement
categories and the components, as well as a revision of the results framework. Said
revision reduces the number of targeted adaptation studies and excludes the final studies
on mitigation and adaptation policies and measures (P&M). Further, it improves
measuring of intermediate results. The reductions reflect that the project will not be able
to complete key contributions to P&M and integration of climate change priorities into
the Recipient’s development strategies and relevant sector programs. However, the
project will undertake all efforts to produce a final report on the project results that could
be presented to the UNFCCC.

B. PROJECT STATUS

The project was approved in February 2011, but became effective only in July 2012; just
10 months before the original closing date. After reaching effectiveness, the project took
additional six months to start implementation. The first project extension of 18 months
was granted in February 2013, after which getting ministerial approval of the first major
contract further slowed down implementation. As of November 11, 2014, the project has
disbursed US$800,000 (33 percent of the total grant) and executed US$528,948 (22
percent), and has commitments for an additional US$614,450 (25 percent).

The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) consists of a team of qualified and dedicated
technical consultants hired with grant funds and complemented by members of
Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS) staff, who are in
charge of the political liaison and provide technical and administrative/red-tape support.
In June, 2013, the project implementation was upgraded from moderately unsatisfactory
to moderately satisfactory, and said rating got improved to satisfactory in September,
2014. This improvement was due to the following key results: 1) the major climate
modeling study and related database were ready for use by the sectoral vulnerability and
adaptation (V&A) studies; 2) the four sectoral greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories and
mitigation studies had been advancing well; 3) the terms of reference (ToRs) had been
finalized for the V&A studies and their procurement processes advanced to the point
feasible within the framework of the November 2014 closing date; and 4) capacity
building and communication activities have created an increasing interest in and demand
                                              1
for project results, particularly at the provincial level, and key stakeholders have
continued active participation in reviewing and contributing to project documents.

Despite slower than expected implementation, the project remains technically sound and
strategic. Even when the remaining implementation period will not be sufficient to
conduct most of the planned adaptation studies, the participatory process applied to
prepare the respective ToRs in collaboration with the related Government agencies will
facilitate development of future studies in key sectors under the National Climate Change
Strategy.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Development Objectives/Results

      Results framework

The results framework is revised to reduce the targeted adaptation studies and exclude the
final studies on mitigation and adaptation P&M. Further, the revision will improve
measuring of intermediate results indicators. The revised intermediate result indicators
focus on tracking the advance of the studies and key stakeholders' participation in
contributing to their development. Overall, though work-intensive and time-wise
challenging, promoting active participation of key sectoral stakeholders is considered
crucial and worth the effort, as at the end the aim is to develop feasible proposals of P&M
for mitigation and adaptation. The revised results framework is presented in Annex I and
will be reflected in the project’s Operational Manual.

Financing

      Grant Closing Date(s)

The second project extension of seven and half (7.5) months, from November 13, 2014 to
June 30, 2015, is needed to allow the project to (i) finalize ongoing studies under
component 1 and 2 on climate mitigation and adaptation, (ii) prepare a basic Biennial
Update Report (BUR) of the Argentine Republic to the UNFCCC, in time for the UN
Climate Change Conference (COP21) to be held in Paris, France in December 2015, and
(iii) conduct related dissemination work and provincial level workshops on related
capacity building.

Even with the second closing date extension, progress towards reaching the GEO will
remain moderately unsatisfactory, as most of the V&A studies, the final study on
mitigation and adaptation P&M, and key training and dissemination activities cannot be
implemented. Consequently, the project will not be able to complete key contributions to
P&M and integration of climate change priorities into the Recipient’s development
strategies and relevant sector programs. However, the project will undertake all efforts to
produce a final report on the project results that could be presented to the UNFCCC.
Whether the Government will submit a reduced version of its originally planned TNC to
COP21 will depend on its discretion.
                                            2
After an exceptionally slow start-up and beyond an overly ambitious initial
implementation period of two years, expeditious project implementation has been
challenged due to (i) complex procurement processes; (ii) need to sequence studies as the
results of the first climate modeling study provides the basis for the sectoral V&A studies
and adaptation P&M, and the sectoral GHG inventories and related studies provide the
basis for the mitigation P&M; and (iii) time-demanding institutional collaboration needed
to collect inputs for and build ownership of the project results. In addition, the PIU
suffered of lack of capacity in procuring consultant services, and administrative
procedures within the SAyDS have slowed down implementation.

Currently, the PIU has been strengthened through lessons learnt and counts with a full-
time procurement assistant with earlier experience on a World Bank project. Once
extended and able to sign new contracts, the project is set to follow a carefully prepared
implementation plan to allow achievement of the above referred results. The SAyDS
authorities are aware of the project’s critical need to advance promptly, and related
coordination meetings have been and will be organized as needed.

The below table resumes the status of the project’s closing dates.

        Reallocations

During project implementation, the PIU has faced less need for procuring goods or
covering operating costs than originally projected. Instead, said savings are needed to
cover additional consultant services to cover the additional implementation period and a
couple of amended and additional consultant services that have been incorporated under
component 1. The latter contribute to preparing the basic BUR of the Argentine Republic
to the UNFCCC; a responsibility for all Non-Annex I (developing country) Parties to the
UNFCCC since late 2011. Said consultant services are fully aligned with the project
objective and synergistic with the four ongoing sectoral GHG inventory/mitigation
studies.

Components

        Components and Costs

Additional grant funding is proposed for component 1 in order to cover costs of preparing
the Argentine BUR presented under the previous section: As the Non-Annex 1 countries
are expected to submit their first BURs to the UNFCCC by December 2014, and the
requested content is fully aligned with the ongoing mitigation studies, the Government of
Argentina opted for incorporating the preparation of a basic BUR under the project. This
requires extending the contracts on the four sectoral GHG inventories/mitigation studies
and contracting of four minor consultant services; these processes are under way. Further,
additional grant funding is proposed for component 4 on project management, taken the

                                            4
cumulative additional implementation period of 25.5 months from the original closing
date. The revised amount for the project management is 8.6 percent of the grant.

Regarding the need to decrease funding for components 2 and 3, an important part is
absorbed by the “additional resources” that the project has gained during its active
implementation period due to beneficial exchange rates between the US$ and ARS. The
exchange rates have had the most beneficial impact under component 3 that finances
printing of final reports and dissemination activities whose value is not tight to the US$.
Overall, the greatest challenge the project has faced since its inception has been the
limited implementation period rather than available funding.

The following table presents the project components as per the Project Appraisal
Document, including their original/current and proposed budget allocations. The numbers
include a total of US$615,764 of the government in-kind counterpart funding allocated
across the components. The counterpart amount and allocations remain unchanged.

Intermediate Indicators

Indicators 3.1 and 3.2: Level of participation2 in the development of the mitigation/adaptation studies by the key agencies

The PIU sends each ToRs and consultancy reports for review by the project’s two institutional advisory bodies: the Steering Committee
(SC) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), and by the Federal Council of Environment (COFEMA) for provision of written
comments through a specially designed template3. The comments are grouped as “editorial”, “general”, and “technical”. Reviewers are
also invited to fill out their opinion on the relevance of the document content. Additionally, the SC has face to face meetings to discuss
with the PIU on provided feedback and PIU responses, usually combining review of a couple of documents per meeting. For both
indicators and each study, the PIU identified the key agencies within the SC and set the targets for their participation in the development
of the studies per semester. Each key agency identified for a particular study that contributes at least one relevant comment directly related
with the reviewed document, either in writing and/or orally during a SC meeting, qualifies for these indicators as having participated in
the review in question.

Indicator 4.1: Proportion of procurement processes initiated

This indicator is constructed by comparing the number of initiated procurement processes with the number of processes expected to
initiate each semester. The initiation of a process is defined as follows: in the case of goods, the date of the invitation to bidders to quote;
for consulting services, the date of publication of the request for expressions of interest; and for individual consultants, the date of
announcement of the position to be filled. To define the targets, all the processes covered by the SEPA (Procurement Plan Execution
System) were considered, as in the SEPA in force at the time of the restructuring of the project (December 2014). While this number of
processes may vary during project implementation, potential amendments are not expected to be substantial.

Indicator 4.2: Proportion of procurement processes completed

This indicator is constructed by comparing the number of completed procurement processes with the number of processes expected to
complete each semester. The completion of a process is defined as the signing of any type of contract between the parties. To define the
targets, all the processes covered by the SEPA were considered, as in the SEPA in force at the time of the restructuring of the project

    “Participation” is defined as a contribution with at least one relevant comment on the revised document.

     The World Bank and specialized SAyDS departments also review and comment each document.
