                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is implemented by the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS) through its Coordination Unit for Programs and Projects with International
                         Financing that has served as the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) in coordination with theSAyDS Climate Change Directorate. The project became effective on July 27, 2012, after a
                         1-year delay. Following a slow project implementation start-up, the project closing date was extended by 18 months until November 13, 2014. Currently, a second project closing date

                         extension is under consideration for additional 12 months to enable full implementation of the project activities and the achievement of the project development objective.

                         By August 31, 2014, USD 800,000 (32.8 percent of the total grant) has been disbursed. The principal advances achieved under the three main project components are following:

                         Component 1 on climate mitigation: Four major consultancy contracts for conducting a combined greenhouse gas emissions inventory and a study on mitigation potential and
                         measures on Energy; Agriculture and Land Use Change and Forestry; Industrial Processes and Product Use; and Waste have been advancing successfully and are expected to be
                         finalized before the project's current closing date. Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the remaining three minor studies on mitigation options in the transport sector; energy efficiency in
                         public, residential, and commercial buildings; and climate change related financing instruments have been prepared. As an additional result of this component, the PIU is working
                         towards delivering the first Biennial Update Report of the Argentine Republic to the UNFCCC.

                         Component 2 on climate adaptation: The project's biggest study on climate modeling has been successfully conducted by the Research Center on the Sea and the Atmosphere
                         (CIMA) and the related database is available for registered users at the CIMA website (http://3cn.cima.fcen.uba.ar/index1.php). Further, ToRs of the 10 sectoral vulnerability and
                         adaptation studies are ready, and the study on impacts on labor markets is under implementation.

                         Component 3 on institutional strengthening, capacity building, and information management: The project Steering Committee (SC) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) have
                         continued participating in preparation of the ToRs and review of the ongoing studies' progress reports. Further institutional collaboration has been consolidated on specific topics with
                         different Ministries such as Economy and Public Finance, Energy, and Transport. Regarding the Federal Council of Environment (COFEMA), the project has engaged in more overall
                         collaboration activities through nomination of thus far 20 provincial focal points, a special training event organized for the same in June, 2014, and participation in COFEMA's regional
                         meetings. The project's communication strategy is being implemented using various channels, e.g. a website (http://www.ambiente.gov.ar/?idseccion=356) and newsletter available
                         for interested public. Finally, the PIU has advanced the procurement processes for developing a software for presenting the project results and related information updates after the
                         project closing, as well as preparing educational materials on project results.
