1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The background of the project was a long-term collaborative initiative between the Republic of
South Africa (RSA) and the Kingdom of Lesotho (Lesotho) to protect the exceptional
biodiversity of the Drakensberg and Maloti mountains through conservation, sustainable resource
use, and land-use and development planning. The Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains are situated
along the 300 km eastern boundary of the Kingdom of Lesotho with the RSA. This area
encompasses distinct landscape and biological diversity. It is rich in species and high in
endemism. However, excessive livestock grazing, crop cultivation on steep slopes, uncontrolled
burning, alien invading species and human encroachment threatened this asset.

The project was consistent with the GEF Operational Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation and
specifically with O.P.4 (Mountain Ecosystems). The area is located within one of the 200 Global
Ecoregions proposed by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF); it has been designated as an
Afromontane Regional Center of Endemism. The uKhahlamba-Drakensberg Park has been listed
as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention, and a substantial part of
the project area was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Peace Park.

The project was consistent with `Conference of Parties' (COP) guidance to encourage
conservation and sustainable use of threatened habitats and endemic species within a vulnerable
montane ecosystem. It responded to COP3 and COP4 guidance through capacity building for
sustainable rangeland management. It fostered the ecosystem approach by promoting improved
management and sustainable use across national boundaries and an altitudinal gradient of
montane habitats under different management regimes, from protected areas to community
rangelands. The project further responded to COP4 guidance by promoting incentive measures
and community involvement in biodiversity management specifically to attain conservation
objectives. It was expected that conservation co-management initiatives developed for the project
area will prove relevant to other protected areas and community lands elsewhere. The project was
designed to support new and innovative institutional measures to promote regional cooperation
and exchange of expertise and to encourage sustainable livelihoods consistent with both
biodiversity conservation and poverty alleviation with a particular emphasis on sustainable
tourism. By building capacity for community conservation programs and alternative livelihoods
based on nature-related tourism the project promoted more equitable sharing of benefits derived
from biodiversity conservation and sustainable use.

While the ecosystem showed similarities on both sides of the border, there were considerable
legal, social, institutional and economic differences between the two countries, which the project
design recognized. Hence, a decision was made to design two separate projects following a
common objective rather than implementing one project jointly by both countries.

For South Africa the primary rationale of the Bank's assistance was to help reduce the apartheid
legacy of poverty and inequality. The Bank's work was guided by three subsidiary objectives: (i)
promoting growth and higher employment; (ii) social and environmental sustainability; and (iii)
regional development. The project was expected to contribute to the first by helping to capture the
economic potential of nature-based tourism, thereby creating jobs of which many will require
little formal schooling. Through active involvement of local communities, it was also expected to
contribute to break down traditional barriers of inequality and exclusion. The link to the second
objective was seen, in that environmental sustainability rests on the wise utilization of natural



                                               -1-
resources. As one of the most biodiversity-rich countries on earth, South Africa also has a global
contribution to make in this respect. The project was expected to contribute to the third CAS
objective by furthering collaboration between Lesotho and South Africa in the field of nature
conservation and tourism. It would engender positive collaboration between the two countries;
enable shared learning and facilitate the process of harvesting joint opportunities, e.g. by creating
a regional tourism destination.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The primary GEF objective was to conserve this globally significant biodiversity of the Maloti-
Drakensberg Mountains. The secondary objective of the project was to contribute to community
development through income generation from nature-based tourism.
The five key outcomes were:
    a) Globally significant biodiversity maintained and enhanced through protection for key
       habitats and indicator species.
    b) Expanded protected areas system in place with adequate buffer zones and community
       involvement.
    c) Sehlabathebe National Park in Lesotho formally established and conservation
       management and development plan agreed and under implementation (applicable in
       Lesotho only);
    d) Community initiatives in nature-based conservation financially viable and benefit
       transfers working; and
    e) Joint declaration by the Government of Lesotho and South Africa of a transfrontier
       conservation area incorporating Sehlabathebe National Park, the uKhahlamba-
       Drakensberg Park, and additional areas as appropriate.

1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
A revision of the original objective related to community development through income generation
from tourism was discussed during project implementation with the intention to widen the scope
towards the development of general livelihood opportunities and initiatives. This was seen against
the background of an already highly developed tourism industry in South Africa. However, the
original objective and indicators were not formally revised or adjusted and remained valid
throughout the project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The project was designed to target local communities as major beneficiaries. Benefit transfer
schemes were designed, so that a part of the increased tourism revenue would flow to surrounding
communities. Nature-based tourism development was intended to benefit those directly employed
in a diverse service industry as guides, hotel and restaurant employees, drivers, tourism agents,
makers and vendors of crafts and so on, and those indirectly engaged in supplying the tourism
industry with its goods and equipment. The conservation of globally significant biodiversity was
expected to benefit everyone concerned with the preservation of the natural heritage, in line with
GEF objectives. These would include international and national visitors to the conserved areas to
enjoy recreational and aesthetic use-values, while non-users would derive option and existence
value from their conservation. It was also expected that the project would generate insights into
successful models of community-based biodiversity conservation, which could be replicated in
other NRM projects, and hence benefit other target communities.

1.5 Original Components
Component 1 ­ Project Management and Transfrontier Cooperation: The component's objective
was to establish strong bilateral coordination mechanisms to support the ecosystem management
approach in the Maloti-Drakensberg area. A bilateral Steering Committee had been established
for this purpose. A bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was intended to define the
parameters of cooperation. The project planned to provide funding for: (i) a bilateral collaboration
forum; (ii) national Project Coordination Committees (PCCs); (iii) coordination offices in the
Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Lesotho with full-time coordination, financial management
and procurement staff (PCUs); (iv) Financial Management Committees (FMCs) attached to these
Units; (v) joint technical working groups to develop and implement action plans to focus on
topics and issues of common interest; (vi) joint workshops to present results and achieve
consensus work plans; (vii) communication linkages, including a GIS-based Knowledge
Management system served by trained staff; and (viii) joint management activities related to fire
protection, rescue service, staff training and nature-based tourism such as marketing, booking and
visitor planning.

Component 2 ­ Conservation Planning: The component's objective was to build capacity for
transfrontier conservation and development and allow for adequate planning, zoning, protection
and management. A vision and strategy were to be prepared following stakeholder consultation
and with the involvement of the relevant authorities on both sides of the border. Conceptual
proposals for compatible land-use zoning derived in the preparatory phase needed to be
negotiated and action plans needed to be prepared for implementation. This implied conservation
planning at the landscape level, and was designed to be facilitated by appropriate professionals,
and with the full involvement of the staff of the respective ministries and departments in both
countries. It was intended to harmonize the approaches and activities of the major nature
conservation management agencies and to establish a professional support team for biodiversity
conservation maintaining effectiveness beyond the project lifetime, including the continuation of
employment of specialist staff.

Component 3 ­ Protected Area Planning: The component's objective was to prepare detailed
plans for existing protected areas and proposed conservation areas. Planning was to be carried out
in phases, beginning with the overall development and zoning plans for each area, then preparing
detailed management programs and finally addressing business planning and sustainability.

Component 4 ­ Conservation Management in existing Protected Areas: The component's
objective was to develop strategies to intervene and address continuing threats and residual
impacts to protected areas (alien plant infestation, soil erosion, inappropriate fire management
regimes, inadequate security, over-grazing, poor waste management and poor management of
cultural resources).

Component 5 ­ Conservation Management outside of Protected Areas: The component's
objective was to improve conservation of natural resources on communal lands and promote
sustainable use for range management areas. Within new community conservation areas, the
community conservation program was planned to draw on local expertise and employment to
build capacity to implement similar conservation measures to those envisaged in Component 4,
but focusing mainly on range management and the rationalization and rehabilitation of eroded
tracks and paths. In KwaZulu-Natal, in addition to range management, substantial effort was to be
placed on the eradication of alien plants in the Upper Thukela area. Cultural heritage management
was part of this component. The Project was envisaged to provide incremental financing to
develop teaching materials and displays, restoration of sites and selective development to attract
visitors, staff training and community education related to cultural heritage, particularly rock art.

Component 6 ­ Community Involvement: The component's objective was to enhance community
involvement in the other components of the project by promoting stakeholder collaboration,
ownership and responsibility for decisions and activities related to the project. The component
was to build on the experience with community conservation programs in KwaZulu-Natal.

Component 7 ­ Nature-based Tourism: The component's objective was to promote local
economic development through ecotourism to assure increased commitment to conservation. This
was to be achieved through empowerment, development of tourism attractions and products, and
marketing and investment strategies.

Component 8 ­ Institutional Development: The component's objective was to assure
sustainability of other results by providing for an adequate institutional structure to inherit and
maintain them.

1.6 Revised Components
Project components remained unchanged during implementation. However, as a result of
experiences with the implementation of component 4 and 5 the implementing agency merged
both components into a joint Conservation Management Within and Outside Protected Areas
component. The large number of eight components made implementation of this Project very
complex to implement, however, a simplification was never formalized.

1.7 Other significant changes
The design, scope, and implementation arrangements remained largely unchanged. The Project
was affected by delays and cost changes. The Project was approved by the Bank Board in
September 2001 and became effective only in November 2002 mainly due to a number of
effectiveness conditions, which could not be met in-time. Weaknesses in managing procurement
activities added delays during implementation and the project's closing date needed to be
extended twice from December 31, 2007 to Dec. 31, 2008 and finally to December 31, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project identification coincided with an intensive phase of collaborative efforts between
Lesotho and the RSA in the highlands water sector, and the designers captured this unique
window of opportunity to extend this cooperation into the joint nature and biodiversity
conservation efforts for the globally important Maloti-Drakensberg transfrontier region. This
project was complementary and supportive to this on-going political environment. At the same
time the Bank's rural portfolio was increasingly being driven by interests in community
participation, and so this interest contributed to the concepts underlying participatory protected
area management planning and involvement of local communities. The strategy was to achieve
conservation through the recognition that biodiversity has a direct value and its conservation can
only be achieved, when local communities participate and benefit from some of the generated
value (e.g. thorough eco-tourism). The designers successfully captured these developments in an
innovative project concept.

At the preparation and appraisal stage the project had been planned and designed as one single
project to be jointly implemented by Lesotho and the RSA. A realistic assessment of policy and
institutional aspects resulted in a decision to separate the implementation into two individual
projects to be implemented in parallel. In hindsight this turned out to be an important decision


                                               -4-
with far-reaching positive implications for national ownership. The differences in size and level
of development would have otherwise posed major implementation challenges. However, when
the decision was made, the designers failed to adjust the project documentation accordingly
resulting in significant inconsistencies in the design documents and confusion during
implementation. For example the project costs and list of activities presented in the appraisal
document combine both projects and the log-frame shows the combined figures, rather than by
country. The grant agreement was similarly affected by some false assumptions, since it was
based on the same combined log-fame for both countries.

The large number of components created significant complexity. Many project activities could
not be logically assigned to specific components. Cost tables with clearly specified and costed
activities under each component were not made available to the implementers. The preparation of
a practical Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was delayed and the PIP finally produced was of
limited help to the implementers.

Due to these design shortcomings the quality at entry is rated as moderately unsatisfactory despite
the appropriate judgment of the favorable political environment at identification stage and the
conceptual innovation, which helped to overcome some design.

2.2 Implementation
Several important project preparation and design tasks were made effectiveness conditions or
were pushed into the early implementation stage including the preparation of a detailed PIP; final
agreement on a log-frame; the preparation of an M&E framework; and the establishment of a
Project Coordination Unit (PCU). While this is not uncommon in Bank lending, this proved risky
due to the complex counterpart situation in RSA and lack of funding available to finish
preparation works. With no PCU in place at the time of project appraisal the responsible parties to
carry out these tasks were not identified. A delay of about 20 months between appraisal and
Board approval and another 14 months between Board approval and project effectiveness was
thus not surprising. During early implementation significant efforts were made to finalize the
design, revise project indicators and targets, the log-frame and the contents and structure of
components. However, no final agreement on a clarified design was reached. A mid-term review
carried out in 2005 largely ignored these discussions and restructuring which would have
benefited the project was not carried out.

Apparently right from the beginning of project implementation different views were discussed
between the implementing agencies and the Bank team about the project design and objectives
with several design changes accepted by Bank supervision missions in a piecemeal approach.
Concluding from this process it must be assumed that the appraised design was either already
outdated or not fully agreed with the recipient Government and implementing agency. To cope
with the differences and shortcomings in the design an ad-hoc decision making and management
process was applied under the project. Over time the national steering committee, different
participating agencies and the PCU identified priorities and activities for the individual
components, which finally resulted in a partial redesign of the project. The original eco-tourism
and community activities proved inappropriate in the South African context and were replaced by
supporting the stewardship program and a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) as a new
benefit transfer mechanism. Local security issues related to cattle stealing, drug smuggling and
tourists' safety were identified as a key risk to conservation and economic development leading to
the establishment of the bilateral security working group. In this situation the technical strength
and conceptual thinking of the implementing agencies and their experience and conviction to do
the right thing at the right time were success factors during this stage of project implementation.
However, the project implementation was nevertheless affected by an apparent lack of a


                                               -5-
consistent design framework. This caused not only delays in the implementation of key activities
but important opportunities were also lost regarding: (a) better integration of project activities; (b)
better balance between conservation and development as aimed for by the two project objectives;
and (c) better balance between planning on one hand and implementation of plans delivering
tangible outputs on the other hand.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The Project was approved prior to the Bank's introduction of the Results Framework format. The
log-frame of the Project failed to provide a concise design tool with clearly defined outcomes,
indicators and measurable targets, which could have, in combination with an effective monitoring
and evaluation system, supported management decisions. The project design did not include an
M&E plan. The PAD stated that Component 1 (Project Management and Transfrontier
Cooperation) would address M&E through a six-monthly review of results. A short section on
M&E in the PIP referred to five key development impact indicators pointing out that "a major
task of the initiation phase will be the formalization of the logical framework of the project,
including all activities and the measurable indicators of performance". Following the mid-term
review a revised Results Framework was produced, showing revised targets. These revisions were
never formally endorsed by the Bank in a restructured project.

The Key Indicators outlined at appraisal were in many respects highly ambitious (not atypical for
GEF operations at the time). No baselines were identified at appraisal. Several of the Key
Indicators were extremely difficult to measure in the first place, and required systematic data
collection. For example, it was highly unlikely that changes in maintaining endemic species or
viable populations of threatened species (meaning changes in species endemism and size of
populations of species) were likely to be evident over the relatively short life of such project, and
the suggestion that this should be Key Indicators was entirely unrealistic.

A significant innovation in performance monitoring was introduced during implementation. The
so-called Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT) was originally
designed by the Bank to meet GEF's own concerns about performance monitoring. The METT
was designed to assess performance at the site-level against 6 criteria for protected area
management effectiveness identified by the World Commission on Protected Areas. The results
from the METT for eight PAs are summarized in Annex 9. For the purpose of internal
management the assessment tool was slightly modified and is used on a regular basis as a self-
assessment tool. Baselines have been established at all replication sites only after mid-term.
However, despite the short observation period the METT clearly confirms that protected area
management effectiveness has significantly improved as a result of the project in all but one PA.
Only the uMngeni Vlei Nature Reserve, which scored highest among all areas in the initial
assessment, shows a slight reduction of 2.8% in scoring, while all other PAs score higher with the
most significant improvement of 30% in the Matatiele Nature Reserve.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The project designers took a cautious approach by triggering a wide range of safeguard policies,
and the project was classified as a Category B. However, as the nature of the Project was to
enhance environmental quality and protect natural habitats and cultural heritage in the project
area, the entire project was expected to have supportive and significant positive effect in all of
these areas. In addition the full participation of local communities and specific benefit transfer
mechanisms was a crucial design element and was based on community consultations and a social
assessment. OP 4.36 (Forestry) and OP 4.09 (Pest Management) were triggered due to the
project's activities related to the clearing of invasive species in some areas. The use of pesticides
for the clearing of invasive species was guided by national standards. While these national


                                                 -6-
standards were considered satisfactory at appraisal, the lack of a formal pest management plan
following OP 4.09 posed a safeguard risk but was only stopped in the last year of project
implementation. Potential incidences of people's livelihoods affected by project activities (e.g.
restriction of grazing in Qwa Qwa Nature Reserve or the reported land claim for the Matatiele
Nature Reserve) should have triggered resettlement plans. No corresponding records could be
found by the ICR team.

Procurement was affected by low local capacity, difficulties to appoint a local procurement
officer and insufficient training leading to delays and a case of mis-procurement. Financial
management was affected by a lack of clearly identified and costed project activities by
components at the design stage. This made appropriate reporting of the use of funds against the
designed activities and costs impossible and affected management decisions and fund
management throughout project implementation. Regular audits were carried out indicating that
there were no cases of fraudulence in the use of funds.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Through a bilateral MoU, the Governments of South Africa and Lesotho are committed to
continue conservation and development operations in the Maloti-Drakensberg region through
implementation of a 20-year transfrontier conservation and development strategy developed
under Component 2 of the MDTP. At a national level, the signing of a revised Inter-Agency MoU
is one of the most important demonstrations by RSA agencies to their commitment to the
continuation of MDTP in a second phase. This agreement originally signed between the South
African National Parks (SANParks), the Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife (EKZNW), the Free State
Department of Tourism, Environment and Economic Affairs (FS-DTEEA) and the Eastern Cape
Department of Economic Development and Environmental Affairs (EC-DEDEA) is now joined
by three additional agencies: the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA), KZN
Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Development (KZN-DAERD) and the
Eastern Cape Parks (ECP). While these agencies are committed to provide support and funding
for the continuation of the project, at the time of the ICR not all agencies had released their
financial contributions for the next five years. However this is considered a temporary problem
linked to the local budgetary process and not a threat to sustainability. One of the key
requirements for phase II as stipulated in the Bilateral MoU between RSA and Lesotho is the
continuation with the national Project Coordination Unit arrangements. On the RSA side a
coordination unit is in place with a coordinator assigned and recruitment of two other professional
staff for tourism development and biodiversity nearly finished. Unfortunately on the Lesotho side
both funding and the establishment of a secretariat is less clear. The RSA PCC chair (co-chair of
BSC) has made a commitment to play an active role ensuring that coordination mechanisms in
Lesotho are maintained at appropriate levels at all times.

Other project activities such as implementation of the security strategy through the Bilateral
Security Working Group are well established. The working group which meets quarterly has
proved to be one of the most enthusiastic groups setting its meetings a year in advance with good
attendance to the meetings.

The management and business plans for the PAs are well received living documents and provide
a solid basis for the management of all project parks. Some of these management plans are not yet
signed by the respective government departments accounting for a difficult bureaucratic process,
but this has not affected implementation.

The management system for the Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Park (TFP) linking
Sehlabathebe National Park in Lesotho and the UKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage


                                               -7-
Site in South Africa is well established. At the 12th BSC meeting in November 2007 a Joint
Management Plan for the TFP was adopted and formal recognition within the ambit of the
Bilateral MoU was granted. The transfrontier Park is run by a Joint Management Committee
composed of representatives from EKZNW of RSA and the Ministry of Tourism, Environment
and Culture (MTEC) of Lesotho. The committee meets quarterly on a rotational basis for
meetings between the two countries.

One potential far reaching outcomes of the project is the process, which was launched related to
the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). The Project has generated an important momentum
within key stakeholders who participated in the development of the model, primarily the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) as a main custodian of the legal framework
necessary to accommodate implementation. Proof of their interest and commitment is that DWAF
provided additional funding to the study and indicated they are already incorporating some of the
study findings into their water pricing policies. On the other hand EKZNW is currently
developing a proposal for fundraising and benefit transfer mechanisms for the implementation of
PES schemes. The legal and institutional system in RSA is supportive for a PES scheme as the
National Water Act makes provision for levies to be charged for catchment management.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project has made a substantial contribution to natural resources protection and biodiversity
conservation in RSA and has helped to raise public awareness and understanding of the
importance of nature conservation as well as improved national and bilateral institutional capacity
and cooperation between RSA and Lesotho. The project's global objectives, design components
and implementation activities remained fully consistent with global, regional and national
conservation and management priorities. The Project reflected strategic objectives and activities
identified in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) at the time of preparation and
remained highly relevant for the actual Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) priorities for the
period 2008-2012 with regard to: (i) environment and natural resource management; (ii)
eradication of poverty; (iii) overcoming the legacy of the apartheid regime and the reduction of
inequality in South Africa and the region; and (iv) increasing the capacity and efficiency for
public service delivery. The project supported in particular the second pillar of the current CPS to
improve regional integration, sharing knowledge and building regional communities among the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
The Project objectives were both ambitious and optimistic about what could be achieved by a
five-year project; however, both of the original objectives were and remained relevant throughout
the Project. The appraisal design envisaged a project in which there would be a mixture of
planning, gazetting of additional protected areas, nature-based tourism development and
implementation of management on the ground. However, the project implementers in RSA
considered that the outputs of the design were outdated and impractical in South Africa, and that
this required consequential changes in activities and tasks. They concluded that the most effective
way of meeting the project objectives, of conserving the globally significant biodiversity in the
Maloti Drakensberg Mountains and realizing nature based (economic) development opportunities,
was to emphasize the planning components and produce a planning process and associated
procedures which could be implemented by the partner institutions. Given the relative strength of
South African conservation agencies which are considered to be some of the strongest on the
continent and the fact that the tourism industry was already quite advanced calling for new ways


                                                -8-
of benefit transfer mechanisms, this approach was a reasonable choice with a good chance of
achieving a much more profound and sustainable outcome from this project. In fact the project
has largely achieved this outcome by putting in place: (i) a functioning transfrontier conservation
mechanism for the Maloti Drakensberg area together with Lesotho; (ii) an improved conservation
management system for a significant number of protected areas in and around the Maloti
Drakensberg and for selected non-protected areas outside existing protected areas; and (iii) the
foundation for a far-reaching benefit transfer schemes through PES.

Transfrontier Conservation Mechanism: At project completion the cooperation between RSA and
Lesotho was well established; bilateral cooperation between both countries was in place as
evidenced through signing of the revised bilateral MoU and regular meetings of the Bilateral
Steering Committee, the Security Working Group and the Management Committee of the joint
uKhahlamba Drakensberg and Sehlabathebe National Park. A bilateral security strategy was
implemented to address cross border crimes. This strategy will continue to be implemented by a
security working group consisting of members of security forces and conservation agencies from
both countries.

The implementation of an overarching 20-year conservation and development strategy has started
and is linked to national and SADC policies developed during the lifetime of the project. The
strategy will be implemented through 5-year action plans until the year 2028 of which the first
has commenced. Following a biodiversity based sensitivity analysis completed in 2006, the
project area has been increased from 13,000 km2 to cover 24,306 km2 (planning domain) with
zoning into eight biodiversity implementation areas and a biodiversity and cultural heritage
conservation guiding mechanism put in place. Biodiversity and cultural heritage assessments on
both sides of the border, with development of the accompanying conservation strategies provide
important guidance in securing the natural and cultural heritage of the Maloti Drakensberg Area.

Improved conservation management system is built on four pillars: Firstly, the Project introduced
a Systematic Conservation Planning process supported by a number information layers to develop
a long-term management framework for the Maloti Drakensberg conservation area. The various
information layers included vegetation mapping, forests assessments, herpetofaunal data, small
mammal survey information and socio-economic information, among other information layers.
Secondly, for nine PAs covering a total of over 310,000 ha the project developed Integrated
Management Plans (IMP), Concept Development Plans (CDP), and Business Plans (BP). This
process has not yet been fully completed; however, this management system has notably
improved conservation of the globally significant biodiversity of the Maloti-Drakensberg
Mountains. Thirdly, trans-park conservation management and protection efforts were undertaken
such as the development and implementation of the joint vulture management plan with an
ongoing monitoring program undertaken by a vultures task force chaired by EKZNW. This group
monitors threats to bearded and Cape vultures in the MDTP area. And fourthly, communities
outside the established parks have been integrated in concerted conservation efforts by supporting
established conservancies and local groups outside the established parks. These groups have been
trained in protection and conservation measures and were engaged in eradication of alien species.

While there are no quantitative data available and the timeframe would also be too short to
measure the direct impact on biodiversity, the METT is used as an assessment tool to quantify the
indirect improvements in the biodiversity conservation. The results of this analysis show
encouraging improvements in management effectiveness for most PAs over a relatively short
observation period of only 4-5 years (see also Annex 9). The two PAs with international
(uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site) and national status (Golden Gate Highlands
National Park) for example have improved their performance by more than 6% and 9%


                                               -9-
respectively. Two provincial Nature Reserves, Malekgalonyane (Ongeluksnek) NR and Matatiele
NR have even improved their performance by over 17% and 29% respectively. This improvement
can be directly attributed to project interventions. However, it is also noticeable that three
provincial PAs, namely Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve, Coleford NR and uMngeni Vlei
Nature Reserve could only marginally improve or even slightly decreased in effectiveness. The
examples of these provincial NRs show that without an improvement of financial and human
resources performance improvements are difficult.

Significant additional conservation outcomes beyond appraisal expectation and with implications
reaching far beyond the project areas have been achieved through the development and
implementation of best practice guidelines for fire and grazing management. The Project's best
practice guidelines have been developed with involvement from a large number of stakeholders
and are widely adopted for natural grassland management all over South Africa with a good
chance to become recommended tools even outside the country. Again it is difficult to quantify
the impact, but best practice fire and grazing management has not only a significant impact on
biodiversity conservation, but has also far reaching benefits on carbon storage and watershed
management. South African grasslands with their organic subsurface carbon accumulation are a
major deposit of sequestrated carbon. At the same time these grassland areas constitute the
region's most important storage and supply of fresh water of unquantifiable value.

Benefit transfer schemes: The project implementers found that an exclusive focus on income
generation for local communities from eco-tourism was too narrow and not fully appropriate for
the local situation. At appraisal, tourism in South Africa, unlike the situation in Lesotho, was
already quite developed with marginal scope for further development and in addition growth in
tourism is subject to economic risks as evidenced by the recent downturn due to the global
financial crisis. In such situation a more rational and sustainable transfer of benefits was called
for following methods introduced already in other countries and regions by direct Payments for
Ecosystem Services (PES). Through intensive study work the Project has successfully launched a
process of discussion and understanding among major stakeholders in South Africa about the
benefits of paying communities in the Maloti-Drakensberg mountains for good land and water
management. Unfortunately the Project has not reached a stage where actual transfer schemes are
put in operation and concrete mechanisms for this are still under development. The Project was
also not quite successful in using its transfrontier mechanism to get Lesotho on board in the PES
discussions. Lesotho is a significant supplier of water for South Africa and provides significant
eco-system services in its water catchment areas, and its participation in the system would
valuable.

3.3 Efficiency
A quantitative efficiency comparison is not applicable. The Project was a stand-alone GEF
project with a GEF grant and counterpart funding from Government of RSA. At the time the
Project was designed neither financial nor economic analyses were prepared. No standard cost
benefit or cost effectiveness parameters were calculated, and would be extremely difficult to
calculate ex-post. However, cost effectiveness was likely sub-optimal accounting for the delays
and sub-optimal design of the project. Two years of extension have contributed to the high
percentage of management costs of about 25% of the total investment costs.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating1
Rating: moderately satisfactory
While the processes and emphasis attached under the various components of the Project diverted
to some extend from appraisal and design expectations, the Project has largely achieved its GEO
and in some regards even exceeded expectations. The profound conservation managements
systems put in place under the Project including both national as well as bilateral mechanisms
provide a solid foundation for the biodiversity protection of the Maloti-Drakensberg Mountains
and beyond. This was done in such a way that not only sustainability but further developments
and protection management improvements are likely; -- a process has been set in motion. The
second phase project entirely managed and financed by RSA local institutions is already well
under implementation. With a better design the Project could have been more focused and gone a
step further on the initiated benefit transfer mechanisms, which would also have improved cost
effectiveness of the project. Balancing some of the significant achievements beyond appraisal
expectations with the recognized shortcomings the overall project implementation is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory accounting for the fact that the project was not formally revised and
such rating is made against the original design expectations.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The Project was not designed as a targeted poverty alleviation project. However, one of the
design elements of the Project was to enable local communities to benefit from income generation
activities around nature protection through the development of eco-tourism and through
engagement in protection and conservation activities. The project implementers decided to shift
emphasis towards much broader and more fundamental benefit transfer mechanism in PES
schemes. While this has not yet resulted in actual transfer of funds, it has prepared the ground for
such income generation.

From a gender perspective, project operations have mirrored national conditions in RSA. Women
have been prominent in community related activities, and in training and institutional
development under the Project, and have a significant voice in local and national decision-making.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
South Africa's conservation agencies are regarded as the most advanced on the continent and are
relatively resistant to institutional instability. However, increasing social, political and economic
challenges put all land management agencies under increasing pressure. The Project has therefore
invested in the institutional strengthening of all involved agencies. This has resulted in a
strengthened cooperation between the national, regional and local agencies and improved their


1
  Outcome Definition: the extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating of Outcome should encompass the extent to which the operation's institutional
objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, efficiently. Shortcomings in the achievement of objectives
may have to do with either the number of objectives that are not achieved (or are not expected to be achieved) and/or
the extent to which one or more objectives are not achieved (or are not expected to be achieved).
Rating Scale Explanation: Highly Satisfactory-There were no shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its
objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance. Satisfactory-There were minor shortcomings in the operation's
achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance. Moderately Satisfactory-There were moderate
shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance. Moderately
Unsatisfactory-There were significant shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its objectives, in its efficiency, or
in its relevance. Unsatisfactory-There were major shortcomings in the operation's achievement of its objectives, in its
efficiency, or in its relevance. Highly Unsatisfactory-There were severe shortcomings in the operation's achievement of
its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance.

planning and monitoring capacity in PA management. Before the Project none of the PAs had
operational management plans in place, which they are all in possession of now or are under
adopting, with the corresponding human and financial resources for implementation. This
resulted in significant improvements in management effectiveness for most PAs (Annex 9).
Middle management benefited in particular from Project support and utilizes the management
skills and tools provided under the Project. The new management systems work towards set
objectives and targets, and identify risks and mitigation measures within each protected area,
define roles and responsibilities, determine and promote best practices, reduce liabilities, help
ensure legal compliance and provide a framework, which allows for regular monitoring and
continual improvement.

Nature reserves staff received training in biodiversity monitoring techniques, management plan
development and implementation, legislative framework, use of laboratory equipment,
information technology, Geographical Information Systems and map interpretation, video and
photo equipment, etc.

Nevertheless, the management of protected areas and their interaction with their immediate
surroundings remains a challenge. Most agencies are working under increased budget constraints,
while the Government is assigning them with new tasks related to: (i) the cultural heritage
protection; (ii) the formation of community conservation areas, community involvement and
benefit sharing in PAs; and (iii) communal biodiversity stewardship agreements, aiming to
establish and maintain a range of sustainable land uses. Communal development activities are a
complex challenge and require additional capacity meeting high expectations in terms of
economic and financial returns.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
An important unexpected outcome of the Project includes the development of new conservation
instruments for formally protected and communal areas such as PES. The study work conducted
under the Project as a collaborative effort between experts and a wide range of stakeholders
explores potential environmental services (clean water, carbon sequestration and biodiversity)
articulating the market partners perceptions and positions in such potential markets. Development
of concrete market mechanisms is on the way.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
No formal workshops were convened in conjunction with the preparation of this ICR. During the
course of the Project, many stakeholder workshops were supported on a wide range of topics
from discussions on resource management, legislation to zoning of particular conservation areas.
A wide range of stakeholders, from national and local government staff to tourism based
businesses and local communities benefitted from the Project. Meetings with stakeholder groups
during the ICR assessment work revealed a high level of community awareness with very active
local groups confirming the importance of the Project for these groups.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: moderate
For this GEF project, the Risk to Development Outcome is assessed in terms of the global
objectives, which comprise biodiversity, institutional and income benefits. The assessment is
based on the following criteria:

        Technical: negligible to low. Proven technical conservation and natural resource
        management interventions have been designed under the project.



                                              - 12 -
        Financial: moderate. Basic Government financing of conservation agencies is secured,
        but budget constraints are possibly in particular for the provincial agencies. The down-
        turn in tourism due to the financial crises has been moderate and is expected to be more
        than compensated by the 2010 soccer world cup event bringing additional visitors to the
        country.
        Economic: low. The economic benefits from conservation are well documented and
        particularly high for the project areas providing significant downstream environmental
        benefits.
        Social: moderate. Community income transfers through PES might still take some time.
        Government ownership/commitment: moderate. RSA Government shows a strong
        commitment to continue with the implementation of the 20-year conservation strategy.
        However, uncertainty is coming from the Lesotho taking slow action to put a functioning
        counterpart secretariat and budget in place.
        Other stakeholder ownership: moderate. The private sector is highly interested in
        ensuring that conservation efforts are sustained as this increases the attractiveness of the
        areas for tourism. Other important stakeholders such as the DWAF, depending on the
        project area as a major source of water, are equally committed. However, land owners in
        the surrounding areas might change production system towards less conservation
        supportive systems (crops, plantations)
        Institutional support: low. Strong interest of a large number of conservation agencies to
        join the inter-agency MoU and provide political and financial support for the second
        phase.
        Governance: moderate. Re-organization of conservancy agencies could cause disruption
        in their functions and effectiveness.
        Natural disasters exposure: negligible to low.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory
While the relevance and political environment for the Project was well recognized and concept of
the Project was innovative, there were shortcomings in the preparation, design and appraisal of
the Project as described in Section 2.1. These relate to the weakness of the logical framework, a
complex component structure without clear linkages between component outcomes and overall
project objectives, a lack of appropriate project cost estimates, and inconsistencies in the design
documents; -- all of this made project implementation challenging. A quality at entry evaluation
rated this project as marginally satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory
Bank staff provided regular (generally twice per year) supervision inputs during project
implementation. Findings and recommendations are documented in detailed aide memoirs
available for all years, with the exception of 2007, where there seemed to have been a gap in
supervision. The supervision support appears mixed reflecting several changes in task team
leadership over time. Project implementation shortcomings were identified during the supervision
process; however, many recommendations remained general and were not followed-up
consistently enough to resolve issues in a timely manner. The missions were relatively short
(from one day up to one week). This allowed only limited field work and problems identified
during missions were often not fully solved. Particularly at the beginning and main


                                               - 13 -
implementation phase of the project when the TTL was located in the country office a more
intensive supervision process could have helped keep the Project focused and moving. At the
critical investment phase restructuring was dragged on unnecessarily and finally not done and a
quicker responsiveness might have avoided some of the delays related to key investments. The
time between missions and the transmission of the aide memoires and management letters was
long occasionally exceeding several months. The momentum generated during mission was lost
due to such delays. The Bank recognized these issues and significantly improved supervision
support during the project extension phases providing timely responses and practical solutions not
only through formal supervision missions, but also through regular communication with the PCU
in between missions.

Fiduciary aspects of the Project were supervised partly in conjunction with routine supervision
missions and partly by regional procurement and financial management staff conducting separate
visits to the country. Fiduciary issues were identified, but not followed up satisfactorily, e.g., the
lack of regular FM reports or annual procurement plans. Social and environmental safeguarding
aspects were handled by the task team leaders with recommendations reflected in various aide
memoires, however again mostly in a relatively general way, while clearer guidance would have
been helpful.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: moderately unsatisfactory
Overall Bank performance overall is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory due to the described
weaknesses in project design and supervision. However, these shortcomings did not significantly
affect implementation to the extent that the project objective could not be achieved, but likely
opportunities were missed to work more proactively on evolving conservation strategies. During
the extension phase the Bank team worked more proactively with the Government and the PCU
to focus the Project on completing a number of key activities and on the consolidation of key
outcomes. At that stage a strong and highly responsive relationship with the PCU was re-
established, which strengthened project implementation.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: satisfactory
By launching this project the Government of RSA has given high attention to the bilateral
biodiversity conservation agenda between South Africa and Lesotho resulting in a first and
subsequently renewed MoU between both countries and the agreement on a 20-year conservation
and development strategy. To implement this Project a Grant Agreement was signed between the
World Bank and South Africa and a Project Agreement was signed between the World Bank and
Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife (EKZNW) as the Lead Implementing Agency for South Africa with a
Subsidiary Agreement signed between the National Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism (DEAT), now Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) and EKZNW. At the
national level an Inter-agency Memorandum of Understanding was signed by DEAT, EKZNW,
SANParks, and the departments responsible for conservation in the Free State and Eastern Cape
Provinces. This process ensured a broad involvement and ownership of all major Government
stakeholders and agencies in the Project. Notably the list of agencies has by now been enlarged
by the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA), KZN Department of Agriculture,
Environment and Rural Development (KZN-DAERD) and the Eastern Cape Parks (ECP), which
were not signatories to the original Inter-Agency MoU. Through EKZNW these agencies
provided and continue to provide the support for the PCU to adequately manage the Project and
to continue implementation of the second phase. A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) with
representatives from a wide number of Government agencies continues to provide the operational


                                                - 14 -
guidance for the PCU. The South African agencies have expressed their commitment to ensure
that the coordination mechanisms in Lesotho are maintained at appropriate levels at all times.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: satisfactory
Overall the performance of the implementing agency was very commendable. The EKZNW and
its PCU have compensated for many shortcomings in the design by taking various initiatives and
working extremely hard to make the Project's interventions relevant and timely. Recognizing the
weaknesses in the design, the implementing agency pro-actively made proposals for changes,
which were subsequently agreed to by the Bank team. This pro-activity and flexibility has
significantly contributed to making many project interventions more relevant to the South African
context. The PCU was staffed with technically competent and dedicated professionals, which
have established excellent relationships with their partners in Lesotho and a broader community
of conservation practitioners, including international organizations.

Mainly lack of experience, training and appropriate procurement planning caused some delays of
procurement processes with one case resulting in a declared mis-procurement.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: satisfactory
The performance of the borrower is rated Satisfactory accounting for the satisfactory
performance of Government and implementing agencies not only during project implementation
but also with regard to the next phase implementation and advancements of project achievements.

6. Lessons Learned
Some key lessons learned from the Project include:

Transfrontier cooperation in biodiversity conservation can be achieved through parallel
implementation that takes into account the uniqueness of the countries involved, while
maintaining synergies for cross-learning and collaboration. Such a design allows sovereign
decision making and sufficient freedom to choose specific implementation speed and processes,
while generating the necessary level of national ownership. While the transfrontier cooperation
was fully accomplished with significant transfer of knowledge from the advanced conservation
and tourism experiences in South Africa, Lesotho was able to deliver on its own achievements.
This appears a particularly suitable model in the context of countries that differ in size and
development status.

In countries with high local capacity it is of particular importance to closely involve local
institutions in project design and detailed preparation. In RSA the local capacity was high and
many project design concepts evolved and have been developed during project implementation by
the local institutions and implementers (e.g. PES schemes or stewardship mechanisms), while or
original design concepts proved inappropriate for the local situation (e.g. tourism development or
conservancies)..

A well prepared logical framework [monitoring framework] should be the backbone of project
design and should be fully agreed prior to project implementation. Such framework needs to
clearly show the linkages between components and their outcomes with the overall environment
objective.




                                              - 15 -
Objective, indicators and targets need to be realistic, helpful for management and take into
account the time-frame of project implementation. A baseline not only helps to measure success,
but also disciplines the designers to pay attention to realistic and measurable indicators.

Restructuring of the project should be done as soon as a need arises.

Frequent changes in task management during project design and implementation can cause
serious disruption, when task managers are leaving without finishing important milestone tasks.
Examples under this project were the finalization and agreement on the logical framework at the
design stage, the completion of the restructuring of the Project at mid-term or finishing the
complex and time consuming design and procurement process of the environmental centre at the
later stage of the Project.

Changes in task management require particular management oversight.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1 ­ Project Management and Transfrontier Cooperation

The component's objective was to establish strong bilateral coordination mechanisms to support
the ecosystem management approach in the Maloti-Drakensberg area. Key outputs under this
component have been:
      Signing of a Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
      Establishment of National Project Coordination Committees (PCCs).
      Bilateral Steering Committee (BSC).
      Joint security task force.
      Joint bearded vulture protection group.
      A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) with supporting units for financial management and
      procurement.

Rating: satisfactory.

In many regards the outcome of this component has exceeded appraisal expectations and has put
a well functioning transfrontier cooperative mechanism in place with high level political support.
MDTP has been adopted as a standing agenda item for the permanent Lesotho/RSA Joint
Bilateral Commission on Cooperation (JBCC). The JBCC is a permanent inter-ministerial/
departmental body headed by the ministries/departments of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
The JBCC focuses mainly on development related issues and MDTP has been adopted by the two
countries as one of the key areas through which cooperation between the two countries can be
enhanced.

A Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on the 11th June 2001 and
renewed and revised on December 1, 2008 to enhance cooperation between Lesotho and the
Republic of South Africa. The MoU committed an area of 15,000 km2 of which 6,000 km2 was in
Lesotho and 9,000 km2 in RSA. Following biodiversity assessments in 2006, the MDTP planning
area was increased to cover 24,305.6km2 in Lesotho and 27,694.4km2 in South Africa.
Subsequent to establishment of national Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and a Project
Coordination Committees (PCCs), a Bilateral Steering Committee (BSC) was constituted. The
former meets quarterly and when need arises, while the latter follows a six monthly schedule of
meetings. The transfrontier collaboration with Lesotho took place around the following issues: (i)
development of a transfrontier conservation and development strategy; (ii) development of the
Sehlabathebe-uKhahlamba Drakensberg Transfrontier Park as the prime transfrontier spatial
initiative; (iii) development and implementation of a transfrontier tourism strategy; (iv)
development and implementation of a joint security strategy; (v) addressing key threats to
biodiversity and conservation such as fire and safety in the project area; and (vi) supporting key
species conservation programs such as the bearded vulture program. The joint security task force
has become an important mechanism to address cross-border security issues such as smuggling,
cattle thefts or tourist protection. This task force consisting of members of security forces and
conservation agencies from both countries meets regularly or on special demand and is a valuable
mechanism for both sides to address security issues.

At a national level, the revision and signing of the revised Inter-Agency MoU is one of the most
important demonstrations by RSA agencies to their commitment to MDTP, as the revised MoU



                                              - 18 -
specifies the expected financial contributions for the second phase. A major milestone was the
inclusion of three new agencies, the South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA), the
KZN Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Development (KZN-DAERD) and the
Eastern Cape Parks (ECP), which were not signatories to the original Inter-Agency MoU. Eastern
Parks has, in fact, been one of the most enthusiastic participants to MDTP phase I even though
they were not a signatory to the original Inter-Agency MoU. For SAHRA efforts are underway to
look at ways of SAHRA being a signatory to the MoU without necessarily making any financial
contributions due to is known financial difficulties.

Mainstreaming of the MDTP was ideally expected to be a relatively easier process in South
Africa, which was already involved in five other Transfrontier Conservation Agreements
(TFCAs) with other neighboring countries. Organizations like the South African National Parks
(SANParks) and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife (EKZNW) already had a history of involvement in
other TFCAs. Indeed SANParks and EKZNW have been key champions leading by example
within MDTP. As expected, buy-in from the other agencies like the Free State Department of
Tourism, Environment and Economic Affairs (FS-DTEEA) and the Eastern Cape Department of
Economic Development and Environmental Affairs (EC-DEDEA) took a little longer as it took a
while to get the senior officials to understand the importance and implications of being part of the
MDTP. As a result DEDEA still has not signed the revised Inter-Agency MoU, which was signed
by the other agencies early in 2009. Fortunately DEDEA was one of the first to make its financial
contribution for the 2009/10 financial year and delays in signing the interagency MoU is thus not
seen as a major risk for MDTP's continuation.

On the bilateral side, one of the key requirements for phase II as stipulated in the Bilateral MoU
is the continuation of the national Project Coordination Unit arrangements as was the case in the
first phase. Whilst this has been endorsed and incorporated into the revised Inter-Agency MoU in
South Africa, there are concerns about Lesotho's decision to abolish the existing PCU and
incorporate its functions into existing units of the Ministry. It is yet to be seen how well the
existing unit will be able to cope with the additional and fairly demanding MDTP responsibilities,
but a loss in momentum in inevitable. The RSA PCC chair (co-chair of BSC) has made a
commitment to ensure that coordination mechanisms in Lesotho are maintained at appropriate
levels at all times.

The Project was supported by a communications strategy including a web-site and a quarterly
printed newsletter with alternate editions focusing on national aspects and bilateral aspects
respectively with a circulation in excess of 14,000 copies per issue. The MDTP received good
feedback indicating that the quality of the product was of a very high standard and the
information contained therein was satisfying the requirements of the stakeholders. The web-site
(maloti.org) is used to post copies of the newsletter as well as providing up to date information on
the project for public use.

Overall the component has achieved its objective to establish strong bilateral coordination
mechanisms to support the ecosystem management approach in the Maloti-Drakensberg area in
many regards beyond appraisal expectations. However, the generated momentum is somewhat at
stake at the Lesotho side.

Component 2 ­ Conservation Planning

The component's objective was to build capacity for transfrontier conservation and development
and allow for adequate planning, zoning, protection and management. Key outputs have been:

    20-Year Conservation and Development Strategy for the MDTFCA
    Cultural Heritage Assessment and Protection Strategy
    MDTP Transfrontier Security Strategy and Security Working Group

Rating: satisfactory.

A Systematic Conservation Planning process was implemented based on a number information
layers which included vegetation mapping, forests assessments, herpeto-faunal data, small
mammal survey information and socio-economic information. These layers were used to develop
a long-term management framework for the MDTP, which finally resulted in the "20-Year (2008
­ 2028) Conservation and Development Strategy for the MDTFCA" as the major and most
important output of the first phase of MDTP. The final 20-Year Strategy document was launched
by the two ministers in Lesotho and RAS responsible for environment in September 2007 at
Giants Castle at the occasion to celebrate the 10th Anniversary for the Giants Castle Declaration
towards the establishment of the MDTP. A simplified, abridged and glossy version of the
Strategy subsequently developed and printed for distribution to less technical audiences.

The implementation of the 20-Year strategy is broken down into 5-Year action plans. The action
plan for the years 2008 to 2012 has also been developed, finalized and printed for distribution.
Whilst implementation of the 5-Year Action ideally started in 2008, it is yet to get into full
implementation due to some overlap with the first phase project, which was extended by two
years. Implementation is expected to pick up in 2010. EKZNW has in fact almost completed the
process of developing their own annual action plan for 2010/11 derived from the 5-Year Action
Plan and other agencies are expected to follow.

Important aspects of the strategy included the cultural heritage and security, both of which
received limited attention in the design of the Project, but were considered important to achieve
the global environmental objective:

   Cultural Heritage: Soon after the start of the Project the PCU recognized the importance and
   opportunities to link biodiversity conservation with cultural heritage protection. This inclusion
   brought additional ownership to the process which had not been thought of and it expanded
   most participants' understanding of cultural heritage beyond the entrenched San Rock Art.
   The cultural heritage data were acquired through a combination of existing data sets in the
   possession of private enthusiasts, cultural heritage agencies such as the Rock Art Research
   Institute at Wits, the interpretation of aerial photos and the undertaking of specific surveys. An
   overall TFCA wide cultural heritage survey which had been planned for before the end of the
   project in 2007 was abandoned due to time constraints and was unfortunately never picked up
   again during the extension. Consequently the Eastern Cape known to be host to significant
   cultural heritage features has not been surveyed and remains a gap that will need to be filled in
   subsequent iterations of the process.
   MDTP supported Amafa AkwaZulu Natal, which is KZN's cultural heritage resources
   management agency, in developing Integrated Management Plans (IPMs) for 23 cultural
   heritage sites. The 23 sites include: Good Hope 1, Good Hope 2, Boundary Rock, Sipongweni,
   Ikanti shelter, Mystery Shelter, Game Pass Shelter, Waterfall Shelter, Main Caves, Rock 75,
   Brotherton, Procession Shelter, Lower Mushroom Shelter, Sigubu shelter, Cascades Shelter,
   Sangoma Shelter, Mnweni Shelter, Masakala Shelter, Mariazell Shelter, Malekhalonyane
   Shelter, Kholokweng 1, Kholokweng 2 and Machikong. Implementation of these IMPs
   remains the responsibility of Amafa.




                                               - 20 -
   Security: Like cultural heritage protection, the relevance of security for the achievement of
   the overall objectives of the project was not recognized at the beginning of the Project.
   Security threads could have affected project achievements in two major ways: (i) increased
   livestock theft was likely to force land owners to consider other land use options like crop
   production and plantations which, unlike appropriate livestock production, are not very
   compatible with the conservation objectives of the MDTP, and (ii) security issues posed a
   significant constraint to the development of transfrontier tourism. Addressing security issues
   under the project was thus an important change in the design and at the same time proof of
   flexibility and oversight of the project implementers. In agreement with the Bank's TTL the
   BSC recommended inclusion of the security issues and requested MDTP to address them
   within the context of the project. A joint process was initiated to compile a transfrontier
   security strategy in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders.
   In addition to the development of the security strategy, a Bilateral Security Working Group
   was established. The working group which meets quarterly has proved to be one of the most
   enthusiastic groups. The process has generated significant awareness and understanding of a
   wide range of stakeholders about the serious threats from security issues and that effort must
   be sustained in order to sustain the conservation program. It has also helped to create
   awareness amongst the security forces as to the strategic significance of their work in how it
   contributes to securing the "reservoir" of the country.

This component has fully achieved its objective to establish and build capacity for a transfrontier
conservation planning mechanism for the Maloti-Drakensberg area. In addition the component
has also addressed significant additional conservation planning elements in terms of cultural
heritage and transfrontier security beyond appraisal expectations. This has made the Project's
outcome more comprehensive with a higher likelihood of sustainability.

Component 3­ Protected Area Planning

The component's objective was to prepare detailed plans for existing protected areas and
proposed conservation areas including development and zoning plans, detailed management plans
and address business planning as well as sustainability. Key outputs have been:
    Integrated Management Plan (IMP) for nine protected areas based on Concept
    Development Plan (CDP) and Stakeholder Workshop (SH W/S) including Strategic
    Management Plan or Time-bound Action Plan (SMP/TBAP) and Business Plans (BP);
    Establishment of the Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Park linking Sehlabathebe National
    Park in Lesotho and the Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site on the South
    African side; and
    Management Plans for Non-statutory Protected Areas.

Rating: satisfactory.

It was originally envisaged that a Protected Area Management Program (PAMP) Facilitator
would assist each implementing agency with their planning process and that the agencies would
take responsibility for the compilation of the planning products. Due to capacity limitations only
EKZNW and SANParks were able to do this. Others agencies required much more outside
assistance and the process was affected by serious delays. Some of the completion work is still
incorporated into the 5-Year Action Plan. The status of completion of the various outputs for the
protected areas is shown below:

Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Park: One of the major achievements of the Project was the
establishment of the Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Park linking Sehlabathebe National Park
in Lesotho and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site on the South African side.
At the 12th BSC meeting in November 2007 the Joint Management Plan for the TFP was adopted
and formal recognition within the ambit of the Bilateral MoU was granted. The transfrontier Park
is run by a Joint Management Committee composed of representatives from EKZNW of RSA and
the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Culture (MTEC) of Lesotho. The committee meets
quarterly on a rotational basis for meeting venues between the two countries.

Management Plans for Non-statutory Protected Areas: The original plan under this sub-
component was to support the development of management plans for non-statutory protected
areas across the TFCA. The plan was identify and support was offered to willing landowners to
establish conservancies and then to assist them with the development of management plans. Two
potential conservancies, the Clarens Bioregion Conservancy and Pholela/Oribi Conservancy, had


                                                 - 22 -
been identified, however, could not be formally established largely due unclear land ownership.
When it became clear that none of the identified potential conservancies were going to be
formalized, support was provided to the just emerging EKZNW stewardship program and the
project supported a marketing strategy for this program.

A significant achievement, however, was the establishment of the 4,800 ha Matatiele Municipal
Nature Reserve. This began as a pilot project but has resulted in the formal proclamation of the
area as a formal protected area in 2007. The reserve is managed by the local Matatiele
Municipality. MDTP facilitated and supported the Local Municipality with the appointment of a
reserve manager, the appointment and training of six field rangers, the procurement of goods
related to the establishment of the reserve and clearing of alien plants within the reserve. A total
of 30 people from the neighboring communities were employed in the alien plant clearing activity.
Further support was provided for the design of a gateway complex to the reserve. Whilst it was
MDTP's intention to support the construction of the Gateway Complex, this never materialized
due to procurement difficulties. The RSA government, through the PCC, has, however, made a
commitment to raise funds for the construction of the complex.

Component 4&5 ­ Conservation Management

Components 4 (Conservation Management within Protected Areas) and Component 5
(Conservation Management outside Protected Areas) were combined on the understanding that
the conservation management aspects that were being addressed were common to both in and
outside of protected areas. The components' objectives were to improve conservation of natural
resources on protected areas and communal lands to address the key threats to biodiversity in the
conservation areas. The main focus of these combined components was to identify and promote
conservation management aspects that were compatible with the overall objectives of the MDTP.
In this regard specific efforts were made to develop of various policies and best practice
guidelines and also implementation of some key pilot activities throughout the MDTP. Key
outputs have been:
    The Development of Policies and Best-practice Guidelines for:
        o Management of Living Heritage Sites, and
        o Fire and grazing management;
    A number of Community Conservation Management Pilot Initiatives including the:
        o Greater Clarens Strategic Environmental Assessment,
        o Clarens Bioregion Conservancy,
        o Upper uThukela Community-Led Resource Management Project,
        o Hlatikhulu Vlei Land-use Zoning,
        o Hillside Community Tourism node,
        o Pholela/Oribi Conservation Area, and
        o Ntsikeni-Coleford Corridor Concept Development Plan;
    Bearded Vulture Protection through strategic habitat assessment and development initiative.

Rating: moderately satisfactory.

Policies and Best-practice Guidelines: Best-practice guidelines have been compiled in close
collaboration with those who are responsible for their implementation. This consultative and
participatory approach has achieved both buy-in as well as capacity building, both deliverables
that have not been quantified:

     Management of Living Heritage Sites: Support was provided to SAHRA for the
     development of a policy for management of Living Heritage sites. Amafa have integrated
     the policy into the management of 3 cultural tourism sites in the Kamberg Valley, i.e. the
     Inkanyamba Shelter, Game Pass Shelter and Waterfall Shelter.
     Fire and grazing management best practice guidelines: Fire and overgrazing have always
     been viewed as major potential threats to the integrity and conservation of the critical
     resources of the Maloti Drakensberg bioregion. Hence the development of best practice
     guidelines for the management of fire and grazing were a major priority for the MDTP. A
     participatory approach was used in the development of these guidelines to ensure that all
     agencies had a clear understanding of these guidelines. In this regard the guidelines have
     already been adopted and being applied by the implementing agencies.

Pilot Projects: In order to demonstrate implementation of MDTP principles and the achievement
of objectives on a local scale, a couple of pilot projects were initiated within the MDTFCA.
Below is a brief discussion of each of the pilot initiatives and the achievements thereof:

     Greater Clarens Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA): The small town of Clarens in
     the eastern Free State province is considered one of the fastest growing tourism nodes
     within RSA, as such property speculation and estate and resort developments have
     proliferated in this area and are not being subjected to an objective planning process and
     the local municipal officials are without robust information and guidelines to assist
     decision-making. An SEA was produced and adopted by the provincial and local
     authorities. Unfortunately local socio-economic and political dynamics have resulted in
     developments going through in spite of the SEA guidelines. Clearly implementation of the
     guidelines and recommendations out of the SEA still remains a challenge.
     Clarens Bioregion Conservancy: The MDTP supported four rural and two urban
     conservancies to come together under one umbrella thus coordinating their efforts to ensure
     the conservation of the area's natural and cultural heritage. The Project entered into a
     contract with the Conservancy to recruit, equip, train and deploy 12 previously
     disadvantaged people from the local community as field rangers. The field rangers were
     provided with bicycles. The Free State Department of Tourism, Environment and
     Economic Affairs (DTEEA) supported this work and provided the training. The field
     rangers still continue with their work with great enthusiasm and are now involved in
     broader environmental education and awareness in their communities and around the town
     of Clarens in general. However, the formal establishment of this conservancy was affected
     by land claim issues around a number of properties which are part of the conservancy and
     prevented a formal establishment of the conservancy.
     Upper uThukela Community-Led Resource Management Project: Six communities were
     involved in this initiative which was led by the Farmer's Support Group (FSG) in
     collaboration with Bergwatch and the Grassland Science Department of the University of
     KZN. It focused on developing capacity in sustainable resource use and management (land
     rehabilitation, grazing management, and fire management, among others), entrepreneurial
     skills development and other tourism related initiatives. Training and mentoring as part of
     this process was provided to more than 600 people. This activity was part of a separate
     impact evaluation that was carried out by an independent consultant and a full report is
     available with MDTP. The Upper uThukela Community-Led Resource Management
     Project was a significant intervention and has built the foundation for further work by
     EKZNW towards the establishment of a Community Conservation Area that will link the
     high-lying area between Royal Natal and Cathedral Peak. The area was also one of the two
     pilot areas for the Payment for Ecosystem Services initiative that will be discussed later in



                                             - 24 -
     this report. For EKZNW this area is an important buffer zone area for the UDP and as such
     EKZNW are continuing with further assessments of how key incentive measures can be
     used in the establishment of the buffer zone.
     Hlatikhulu Vlei Land-use Zoning. The Hlatikulu Vlei Valley (HVV) buffers the UDP and
     is a critical biodiversity and cultural hotspot that is subject to several development
     applications. Landowners have begun collaborating towards a holistic vision for land-use
     in the valley. MDTP funded the initial stakeholder process and baseline surveys leading
     towards the development of a valley-wide land-use plan agreed to by all stakeholders. This
     project will be used as an opportunity to develop public private partnership models and
     associated legal agreements that will lead to the consolidation of the land itself and
     thereafter possible incorporation into the UDP.
     Hillside Community Tourism node development. MDTP supported the development of the
     Concept Development Plan and Business Plan for this node for EKZNW.
     Pholela/Oribi Conservation Area (POCA). The POCA is an initiative between commercial
     farmers and communal landowners working towards integrated land-use plans and
     conservation management action. Whilst the idea of establishing a conservancy never
     materialized, again due to land claim issues, smaller projects within this initiative have
     been developed, focusing on: a) alien plants, and b) anti-stock theft fencing. The communal
     area of KwaPitela is highly infested by bramble, a highly invasive alien plant which can
     completely cover the whole ground taking away important pastures for communities.
     Community members were trained and involved in clearing of bramble funded by MDTP.
     Despite significant efforts undertaken by the project, the results are likely to be not very
     effective due to: (i) a lack of clearing in neighboring commercial farms which will lead to a
     re-infestation of the cleaned areas with bramble and (ii) the short duration of the cleaning
     measure, which would require cleaning of the areas for at least three consecutive years.
     The stock theft is major problem within the MDTP with particularly more serious
     consequences and implications on communal farmers with smaller heads of cattle. MDTP
     supported the erection of an anti-stock theft fence on the boundaries of UDP. The fence is
     not easy to cut, hence is a significant deterrent and a barrier to stock thieves who normally
     use the UDP as an escape route.
     Ntsikeni-Coleford Corridor Concept Development Plan And Feasibility Study. Ntsikeni
     and Coleford Nature Reserves are separated by a corridor of communal and private land in
     the Eastern Cape and KZN. An existing initiative, the Umgano Project, has examined the
     tourism feasibility in part of this corridor resulting in a proposal to extend the feasibility to
     the entire corridor. This initiative is very well supported by the community and
     stakeholders. The MDTP funded a broader feasibility study aiming at the production of a
     tourism development and land-use feasibility assessment. This process delivered the
     required products which are available for further application but revealed that tourism
     development options are unlikely to be feasible mainly due to access limitations inherent in
     the bulk infrastructure requirements and locality.

Bearded Vulture Protection: The Project supported a Population and Habitat Viability
Assessment (PHVA) that was coordinated by the Vulture Working Group of the Endangered
Wildlife Trust (EWT). This process has produced a management plan which has been adopted
and is being implemented by the implementing agencies. The MDTP supported the
implementation through covering the operational costs of aerial monitoring and the purchase of
containers and freezers for vulture restaurants. EKZNW for example are realizing revenues of
close to ZAR 250,000 annually from photographers paying to take photos at the vulture feeding
sites.

Despite the large number of initiatives taken under this component the overall component
outcome is rated as moderately satisfactory related to the fact that some of these activities have
been implemented in a largely disconnected manner, - some of them would have also benefited
from more attention to effectiveness and suitability. A consistent conservation management
framework was not provided in the Project design, but should have been developed during Project
implementation.

Component 6 ­ Community Involvement

The component's objective was to enhance community involvement in the other components of
the Project by promoting stakeholder collaboration, ownership and responsibility for decisions
and activities related to the Project. Key outputs under this component have been:
    A formal community liaison mechanism with six protected areas,
    Generation of environmental conservation and biodiversity awareness in communities and
    schools through the development and distribution of Environmental Education Tool Boxes.

Rating: satisfactory.

Community involvement has always been recognized as an over-arching support mechanism for
implementation. As such it has worked closely with the PAMP processes with the formation of
PA liaison mechanisms being an essential by-product and also separate and specific initiative on
Environmental Education Tool Box. The community liaison mechanisms that were established
and the tool box are briefly reported on below.

Liaison mechanisms: The main objective was to formally establish and institutionalize liaison
mechanisms for each statutory protected area within the MDTP; however, as indicated in the
table below, this was not possible in some areas. Where this was not finalized the responsible
agencies have an obligation, as specified in the 5-Year Action Plan, to conclude the process.

                                  DTEEA to conclude the process

Environmental Education (EE) Tool Box: The Environmental Education Tool Box is the
product of a highly successful contract that was managed in close collaboration with the EE
officials in each of the implementing agencies. An EE task team was established to manage and
to monitor the roll-out of the contract. An important output of this initiative was the EE Tool Box.
A picture building game that assists participants to develop a common understanding of their
environmental problem and develop common solutions has proved to be very popular with
various users. However, the extent to which implementing agencies themselves have used the EE
Tool Box still is less clear at this stage.



                                               - 26 -
An assessment of the achievements based on the outcomes under this component only would not
be appropriate as this component involved a large number of cross-cutting activities in the
planning and management process for statutory PAs and activities in surrounding areas
(components 3 to 5). As such the approaches under the Project have been largely successful even
if the outcomes did not always fully yield the expected results. However, this Project significantly
changed the nature of involvement of local communities in conservation activities from
previously heavy top-down planning into intensive interaction with local communities in the
vicinity of the Project PAs.

Component 7 ­ Nature-based Tourism/Development of Livelihood Opportunities

The component's objective was to promote local economic development through ecotourism to
assure increased commitment to conservation. This was to be achieved through empowerment,
development of tourism attractions and products, and marketing and investment strategies. The
focus under this component was changed from developing nature-based tourism to all sustainable
livelihood options. Key outputs under this component have been:
    Development of a Tourism Strategy dir the Maloti Drakensberg transfrontier area;
    Specific Concept Development Plans for:
        o Relocation and Development of the Sani Pass Border Post
        o Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge
        o Golden Gate Interpretative Centre
    Development of a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) system

Rating: satisfactory.

Tourism Marketing Strategy: In close collaboration with Lesotho the key tourism stakeholders
formulated a common branding for the MDTFCA and signed a MoU for a common brand and
joint marketing between the Lesotho Tourism Development Corporation, SANParks, Tourism
KZN, EKZNW, and the tourism marketing agencies in the Free State and Eastern Cape provinces.
Part of this MoU has been the agreement to expand the existing Maloti Route, to The Maloti
Drakensberg Route. Key priority activities out of the overall MDTP Tourism Development
Strategy included capacity building at KZN (not part of the previous route), the expansion of the
former Maloti Route Executive Forum to include KZN members, erecting new signage
throughout the route and the appointment of a tourism specialist to run with this process. The
process of recruiting a Tourism specialist is currently underway, but the Project did not complete
the new proposed signage.

A book, "The Maloti Drakensberg Experience" was produced to highlight the key attractions of
the MDTFCA. The book carries a strong conservation message in all of its sections and includes
a directory of tourism operators in the MDTFCA. However, sales of the book with only some 300
books yet sold remained behind expectations. To make full use of this publication both in terms
of its conservation messages and in promoting tourism the PCC is currently looking at options for
wider distribution of the book including giving it away for free to major tourism organizations
across in two countries. MDTFCA is also part of the broader Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) Boundless Southern Africa brand which showcases SADC TFCAs and
Transfrontier Parks (TFPs) as premier tourism destinations. The MDTP received significant
media coverage.




                                               - 27 -
Concept Development Plans:
The Relocation and Development of the Sani Pass Border Post: Recognizing the negative impact
of the existing location of the Sani Pass Border Post within the UDP the Project initiated the
relocation of the post to the eastern periphery of the World Heritage Site to improve the integrity
of the UDP. While no Project funds were actually used for this activity due to a procurement
issue related to the design of the new post, this initiative has resulted in leveraging a significant
amount of funds at a total of ZAR 130 million including ZAR 40 million from the African
Renaissance Fund not only for the relocation of the post, but also for extending and up-grading
the road through the pass connecting RSA up to Mokhotlong in Lesotho. Unfortunately, the
actual work is still delayed, since Lesotho has still not managed to meet the conditions for the
money to be released.

Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge: The original intention here was to focus on the broader spatial
planning issues around the Sentinel Car Park area including the Witsihoek Mountain Lodge on
the boundary between KZN and the Free State, and to produce a co-management agreement
between the relevant parties. Due to local political and traditional leadership dynamics this
process was abandoned and eventually only focused on the development of Concept
Development and Business Plans for the ailing Witsieshoek Mountain Lodge. This facility is
owned and managed by the local Batlokwa community and has become derelict and with other
management factors causing its popularity and occupancy rates to decrease significantly. The
CDP has now provided a clear idea of what is required to turn the situation around and was
showcased at the SADC 2010 TFCA investors' conference in October 2008 as an opportunity for
investors. In addition a MoU between a potential investor and the Batlokoa Tribal Council was
signed and the national Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) has, through its Social
Responsibility Program, approved an allocation of ZAR 20 million for the upgrading of the lodge
as a contribution of the Batlokoa Community.

Golden Gate Interpretative Centre: In recognition of the paleontological importance of the eastern
Free State and the discovery of fossilized Dinosaur eggs at the Golden Gate Highlands National
Park, MDTP funded the development of the Conceptual Designs, an Interpretive Strategy and a
Feasibility Assessment of a world class Interpretive Centre at Golden Gate. Despite a number of
procurement challenges, a high quality final report has been produced and DEA and SANParks
are now looking at a fundraising strategy for the construction of the centre. This interpretative
centre with its unique attraction has the potential to become one of the most attractive tourist and
educational facilities with widespread spillover effects for the entire region.

Payment for Ecosystem Services: From the outset the value of the Maloti Drakensberg
Mountains was recognized in terms of their ability to deliver a host of ecosystem services,
particularly those associated with catchment management. The MDTP was used to spearhead the
introduction of "Payment for Ecosystem Services" as a concept to South Africa. A baseline study
was commissioned to identify the full suite of ecosystem services in the MDTFCA with a view to
undertaking a more detailed study into the feasibility of the PES system. Unfortunately Lesotho
declined the offer to join in this process despite the fact the Lesotho Highlands Development
Authority (LHDA) is already involved in a PES scheme with South Africa, selling water to South
Africa through the Lesotho Highlands water transfer scheme.

The baseline study was completed and provided the desired information which was then used to
commission the additional work on the feasibility of PES in two pilot areas in equal partnership
with the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA). The upper uThukela and upper
Umzimvubu were used to develop a feasibility model which has shown that through the "sale" of
hydrological services, namely decreased summer flooding and associated soil loss and sediment


                                               - 28 -
yields, increased winter base-flows, as well as carbon credits for the carbon that is sequestrated in
the soil. Although very specific to the two pilot areas, the model has variables that may be altered
when applied to other areas.

Of great significance is the momentum that has been generated through this work within the key
stakeholders who were consulted and who participated in the development of the model,
primarily the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) who are the custodians of the
legal framework necessary to accommodate implementation. DWAF who came on board and
provided some additional funding have indicated that they are already incorporating some of the
study findings into their water pricing policies. On the other hand EKZNW is currently
developing a proposal for fundraising for the implementation of PES.

The design expectations under this component have been very vague in terms of tourism
development for South Africa and the implementers took initiative to use this Project for a
number of far reaching initiatives of strategic importance for both making this area more
attractive on the long-term for tourism and for development of different ways of benefit transfers.
These initiatives are important; however, this was done at the cost of achieving tangible results on
the ground. In retrospect this was a reasonable choice considering the use of GEF funds in a
strategic way, rather than providing direct support to a number of business operators.

Component 8 ­ Institutional Development

The component's objective was to assure sustainability of other results by providing for an
adequate institutional structure to inherit and maintain them.

Rating: satisfactory.

The major focus of this component was on ensuring appropriate institutional support and
adequate and appropriate structures and capacity for key agencies for the successful
implementation of MDTP. In this regard in addition to the training that was provided as part of
implementation of some of the Project activities, efforts were also made to identify and address
specific training needs among different agencies. Efforts were also made, though less successfully,
to facilitate collaboration through the formation of various working groups focusing specific
issues.

Training: The training reported on here is that which was implemented through the formal
training plan which emanated out of the situational analysis undertaken as part of the
Environmental Education contract. This training is easily quantifiable in terms of the numbers of
people trained, but throughout implementation of this phase capacity has been build where the
PCU have engaged certain stakeholder groupings. While these benefits are intangible and thus
unquantifiable, they are nonetheless significant in their influence on future implementation. The
four components of the formal training plan have delivered as follows:

Again an assessment of the achievements based on the outcomes under this component only
would not be appropriate, since human and institutional capacity building took place throughout
the Project. Implementing this Project and engaging in the countless interactions with
stakeholders and international agencies and developing an appropriate and relevant design was a
major capacity building activity by itself. Throughout the Project many national institutions have
been trained, an interagency mechanism was developed and bilateral institutions have been set up.
These institutions have proven to be capable to manage this Project and to set up a system for
continuation. This outcome in itself is proof of the satisfactory achievements under this
component.

Not applicable. The Project was a stand-alone GEF project with a GEF grant and counterpart

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A draft Borrower's ICR (40 page document) is available on file. The following sections are
extracted from the borrower's ICR un-shortened and unedited:

Project Objectives:

`The two main objectives of the Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and
Development Project were:-
    ·    To conserve the globally significant biodiversity of the Maloti and Drakensberg
         mountains bioregion, and
    ·    To contribute to community development in the bioregion through nature based tourism.
These two objectives were the overall objectives for both countries. The Project Coordination
Units (PCUs) of the two countries agreed to modify the first objective to include cultural heritage
resources of the bioregion, in recognition of the abundance of cultural resources within the
bioregion. The objective was therefore modified to focus on the conservation of the globally
significant biodiversity and cultural heritage of the Maloti Drakensberg bioregion. In most
instances the objective has been popularly stated as ­ "to conserve the globally significant natural
and cultural heritage of the Maloti Drakensberg bioregion."
While the Lesotho authorities decided to live the second objective unchanged, the South African
PCU decided to focus on the broader livelihood opportunities and initiatives rather than just
nature based tourism.
Whilst the main focus of the project was on conservation of the globally significant biodiversity
efforts were made to identify and implement any key livelihood initiatives that would enhance the
levels of community participation in conservation of the natural and cultural heritage of the
bioregion. The main focus of the project was on establishing and maintaining a long-term
cooperative and collaborative framework based on strong and sustainable stakeholder
relationships and identifying and implementing key livelihood initiatives as pilots for replication
in the longer term.'

Overall Outcome:

`In conclusion it is important to, in this report, record the government of South Africa's
appreciation for the financial and technical support from the GEF and the World Bank for the past
seven years of this project. I have no doubt that the same is true for the government of the
Kingdom of Lesotho.

We, as implementing agencies, might not have managed to achieve, during the past seven years,
to the satisfaction of the GEF/World Bank, some of the key goals and targets that were set-out in
the PIP and the PAD, but for us this process has helped us not only to establish an effective
collaborative framework but equally important to also define a common and long-term vision
(20-Year Strategy) and a road map (Action Plan) towards that vision for the Maloti Drakensberg
mountains bioregion. This is a vision that is based and guided by the common understanding of
the need and obligation to nurture the valuable resources that make the mountain region what it is
to the two nations.'

Critical factors that Affected Implementation of the Project:

`Whilst the project received satisfactory ratings from all the World Bank Supervision Missions
which were carried out at least bi-annually since the inception of the project, significant
challenges were encountered along the way and these related to:
Institutional Capacity and Staffing for the Project:
For starters, the recruitment of a Procurement Specialist proved to be a major challenge from the
beginning of the recruitment process and eventually became recurring problem as the project has
already had four specialists during its lifetime and these of course punctuated by long spells
without a procurement specialist at all. Whilst the major challenge was always identifying
suitable candidates, those that were eventually identified were in most cases quick to find greener,
more permanent and less challenging pastures. This problem in no doubt contributed significantly
to the declaration of mis-procurements during the course of the project and the significant delays
in the procurements for activities like the Golden Gate Interpretive Centre and the Matatiele
Nature Reserve Gateway Complex both of which, for various reasons had to be redone. At this
time the project was relying on the services of a part-time Procurement Specialist who was based
in Lesotho which in itself proved to be a major challenge.
The extension period and staff contracts could also have been better managed. The first year's
(2008) extension resulted in the PCC taking a decision not to renew most PCU staff contracts
early in the extension period. This left only the Project Coordinator and the Accountant to close-
off the project which instead was extended for another year (2009). This obviously resulted in
undue pressure on the two staff members. Delays in recruiting the other PCU members did not
help the situation at all.
Representation of key agencies in all the key decision making processes of the project like the
PCC and BSC proved to be a major challenge from the beginning throughout the first phase. As a
demonstration of their limited experience with TFCA issues and also limited capacity,
representation of the Eastern Cape and Free State representatives to the PCC and BSC has been
quite erratic most of the times. Only quite recently have we witnessed significant improvement in
their participation. The challenge with these two agencies, EC-DEDEA and FS-DTEEA is that
they are both represented by one person on the PCC and BSC unlike other agencies, like EKZNW
and SANParks who are represented by at least three people. A major challenge ahead is to get all
the agencies to be more active in the implementation of the 5-Year Action Plan which has very
specific requirements from each of the agencies. At this stage the challenge is now more of
addressing their capacity limitations as they now seem to have fully grasped the concept of
TFCAs with appropriate buy-in.
Support from the World Bank:
Support to the project from the World Bank was provided fairly constantly through direct
contacts with the TTL and through Supervision Missions which were conducted at least bi-
annually from the beginning of the project. Whilst one may not pinpoint any specific
challenge/problem associated with the changes in TTLship, the general view is that changing
three TTLs throughout the life of the project was a bit too much. The same goes for the Finance
Specialists which were also changed too frequently.
Given the challenge that the project had with identifying and retaining a Procurement Specialist,
for the World Bank to only conduct two Procurement Reviews for a project that has been under
implementation for seven years did not help the situation at all.'

Annex 9. Results of the Protected Area Management Effectiveness Tracking
Tool

To evaluate progress of protected areas achieving the objectives for which they were established
and to maximize their potential, and to improve management processes, strengths and weaknesses
of their management and the threats that they face need to be evaluated. The World Commission
on Protected Areas provides an overarching framework for assessing management effectiveness
of both protected areas, to give guidance to managers and others and to help harmonize
assessment around the world. Table 1 contains a summary of the elements of the WCPA
Framework and the criteria that can be assessed2.

The Maloti Drakensberg Transfrontier Project (MDTP) facilitated protected area (PA)
management effectiveness assessments for eight of the South African statutory PAs within the
Project area with the help of the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool (METT), developed
by Stolton et al, 2003 and 20073 which is based on the WCPA Framework and its criteria. The
assessment exercises were undertaken between 2004 and 2009 in collaboration with the different
conservation authorities responsible for each of the eight protected areas. The PAs for assessment
were:

Evaluation Results: It is encouraging to note that there has been a significant improvement in
management effectiveness for most PAs since their first assessments in 2004 (Table 2). The two
PAs with international (uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site) and national status
(Golden Gate Highlands National Park) for example have improved their performance by more
than 6% and 9% respectively since their first assessments. Two provincial Nature Reserves,
Malekgalonyane (Ongeluksnek) NR and Matatiele NR even improved their performance by over
17% and 29% respectively. On the other hand, it is disappointing to note that three provincial
PAs, namely Sterkfontein Dam Nature Reserve, Coleford NR and uMngeni Vlei Nature Reserve
have only marginally improved or even decreased in their effectiveness (Table 2). A general
factor that certainly has contributed to the progress reflected for most of the PAs is the fact that
all these PAs now have management plans or are in the process of compiling them ­ none of them
had operational management plans when originally assessed. This improvement can be directly
attributed to MDTP interventions. Generally, most comments associated with lack of further
effectiveness progress were associated with a serious lack of financial and human resources.

In addition to the total scores which were produced, the ICR team aimed to create a series of
radar diagrams, to illustrate the performance of each PA against each of the 6 WCPA criteria over
time. Unfortunately, the requested data capturing the performance baseline are only available for
one but the largest PA (uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park World Heritage Site). The results for this
area are summarized below in diagram 1.
