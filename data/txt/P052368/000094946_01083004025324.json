The components will:\n            1) finance bilateral collaboration through the establishment\n            of a Steering Committee, National Project Coordination\n            Committees, and coordination offices in South Africa and\n            Lesotho. Joint technical working groups will also be\n            established, to develop and implement action plans, focused\n            on topics such as nature-based tourism, marketing, and\n            management activities, while communication linkages will\n            include a knowledge management system; 2) plan a strategic\n            conservation, based on stakeholder consultation, and\n            conceptual proposals for compatible land-uses. Conservation\n            planning at the landscape level will be designed to\n            facilitate bilateral involvement, and, a participatory\n            bio-diversity monitoring system will ensure cross-boundary\n            conservation, supplementing resources of the nature\n            conservation agencies, to ensure sound planning, and\n            actions; 3) ensure protected area planning for existing, and\n            proposed conservation areas, through planning and zoning\n            development, area management, and business planning; 4)\n            manage conservation of existing protected areas, focusing on\n            the control of alien invading plant species, and supporting\n            through incremental costs, the rehabilitation of management\n            roads, improvement of flora and fauna conservation,\n            prioritizing on endangered species; 5) manage conservation\n            of planned protected areas, following strategies as devised\n            under component 4, prioritizing on the issue of overgrazing,\n            and loss of wetlands; 6) involve community participation,\n            emphasizing on targeted training in conservation,\n            nature-based tourism, craft production, etc.; 7) develop\n            nature-based tourism, emphasizing on community-focused\n            capacity building, with the private sector providing\n            managerial know-how, including capital for tourism\n            development; and, 8) strengthen institutional development,\n            supporting the emergence of local boards through the\n            establishment of a structural modus operandi, and capacity\n            building in the management of protected areas."}, "docdt": "2001-08-20T00:00:00Z"}
