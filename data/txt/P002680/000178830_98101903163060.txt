INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE
PRESIDENT

PROPOSAL TO AMEND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT NO. 142 TA
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR THE SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT

INTEITMATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSAL TO AMEND DEVELOPIvIENT CREDIT NO. 142 TA
TO THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
FOR THE SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
amendment to Development Credit No. 142 TA to the United Republic of
Tanzania, to increase the amount of the credit by the equivalent of $7.5
million to $15.5 million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        On February 18, 1969, the Executive Directors approved Bank
Loan No. 586 TA of $7.0 million and IDA Credit No. 142 TA of $8.0 million
to help finance a Second Highway Project in Tanzania comprising the
reconstruction of the Morogoro-Iyaya section (310 miles) of the Tanzania-
Zambia Highway. The Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)
participated in the financing of the project by extending a credit of
$15.0 million on IDA terms, of which half was intended as permanent
financing and half as interim financing in the sense described below.
3.        At the time of approval of the Bank/IDA financing for the pro-
ject, the Executive Directors were informed that a part of the Swedish
financing was being provided on the understanding that once the Second
Replenishment of IDA's resources or other arrangements providing the
Association with at least the equivalent of $500 million from contribu-
tions by member countries prior to December 31, 1970 became effective,
Tanzania would apply to the Association for a further credit in an
amount of $7.5 million for the Second Highway Project, and, if this
supplemental credit were granted by the Association, 39,000,000 kroner
(approximately $7.5 million) of the Swedish credit would be cancelled.
The Executive Directors agreed that such a further credit for this pro-
ject, on terms and conditions similar to those of the first credit, was
acceptable in principle, provided that the Association's usual lending
requirements were satisfied by Tanzania at the time the supplemental
credit was presented to the Executive Directors for final approval.
4.        Following the effectiveness of the Second Replenishment in
July this year and in accordance with the understanding reached between
the Bank, the Association and SIDA, the Government of Tanzania made a
formal request to the Association in September to replace the equivalent
of $7.5 million of the Swedish credit. Negotiations for the proposed
increase in the IDA Credit for the Second Highway Project have been
conducted by correspondence.

PART III - THE PROJECT
5.        An appraisal report entitled "Tanzania - Appraisal of the
Second Highway Project" (Report No. TO-690a) was circulated to the
Executive Directors on February 6, 1969. There have been no changes in
the project since that date. A supervision mission which visited
Tanzania in late September has reported that progress in implementing
the project is satisfactory. All contracts for the project have been let.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUIE TS AND AUTHORITY
6.        A draft Agreement Amending Development Credit Agreement No. 142 TA
is being distributed separately. The draft agreement provides for the
increase of the credit amount from $8 million to $15.5 million. All other
covenants of the existing Development Credit Agreement would remain in
