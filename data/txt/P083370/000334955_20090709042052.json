Public Sector\n            Capacity Building Project in Pakistan is to improve the\n            Government's capacity to implement its on-going\n            economic reform program. Focusing on strategic areas, the\n            project will have three distinct capacity building\n            objectives: 1) broad-based professional development of\n            public sector officers; 2) capacity enhancement in key\n            ministries and agencies at the forefront of design,\n            implementation and monitoring of policy reforms; and 3)\n            strengthening of regulatory agencies. The Civil Service\n            restructuring is a significant administrative feature of the\n            Civil Service Reforms under the Economic Revival Program of\n            1999. The first component will address the capacity, and\n            technical skills gap in the civil service, largely focusing\n            on the professional development of federal and provincial\n            civil service, and ex-cadre officers. It will be undertaken\n            through a professional training program, on priority areas\n            for degree programs abroad, and, in-country training\n            capacity through support of training institutions. The civil\n            service recruitment process will be improved through support\n            to the Federal Public Service Commission. The second\n            component will strengthen economic policy and management,\n            through capacity building of key federal and provincial\n            ministries and divisions, including finance, planning,\n            commerce, central board of revenue, etc., who are in the\n            vanguard of design and implementation of the reform agenda.\n            Finally, the third component will support capacity building\n            of the newly established regulatory agencies through a\n            specialized training of officers, and, specialized technical\n            consultancies for analytical studies, and, includes\n            procurement of equipment and related materials. An\n            unallocated amount will be disbursed to interested\n            ministries/agencies, once their individual proposals are\n            approved by the National Steering and Coordination Committee (NSCC)."}, "docdt": "2004-04-20T00:00:00Z"}
