          Building Project (PSCBP) for Pakistan were as follows:\n            outcomes were unsatisfactory, risk to development outcome\n            was high, Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: the project successfully completed a\n            series of human capital development activities, but as\n            intended outcomes were conditional on external actions that\n            were not forthcoming, the project was unable to meet its\n            overall objective. A project design developed from a\n            rigorous identification of the necessary and sufficient\n            conditions for increasing civil service capacity, with\n            activities structured around each of these conditions, can\n            have potentially avoided these pitfalls. To ensure that\n            project development objectives (PDOs) are appropriately\n            focused on outcomes which can be reasonably expected to\n            result from outputs delivered by the project. When projects\n            outcomes are dependent on the continuing commitment of the\n            government to inherently unpopular reforms, designs need to\n            make a realistic accounting of these risks and propose\n            components that effectively mitigate the attendant risk and\n            or directly support the continuation of commitment. A more\n            developed delineation of the manner in which officers\n            trained by the project were to be expected to serve as\n            reform champions should have been used to develop policies\n            and services necessary to ensure the effective utilization\n            of project beneficiaries. To avoid a dilution of\n            implementation and supervision resources, as well as project\n            impacts, across an excessively large number of participating agencies."}, "docdt": "2011-03-29T00:00:00Z"}
