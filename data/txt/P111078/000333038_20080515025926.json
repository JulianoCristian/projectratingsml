operation is designed to support the\n            Palestinian Authority (PA) as it implements the reform\n            program detailed in the Palestinian Reform and Development\n            Plan 2008-2010 (PRDP). This plan was developed internally by\n            the Caretaker Government, with limited input from the donor\n            community. The plan reflects the Caretaker Government's\n            belief that it must move aggressively to control the budget\n            and quit accumulating arrears. It takes advantage of the\n            goodwill and high level of donor support pledged at the\n            Paris Donor Conference in December 2007. To have the largest\n            impact, the project focuses on two specific areas: (i)\n            strengthening the PA's fiscal position; and (ii)\n            improving public financial management. These are critical\n            building blocks for the government of an independent\n            Palestinian state and are also crucial for attracting\n            continued international donor support. The Bank's\n            involvement in supporting and monitoring the reform agenda\n            described in the attached policy matrix will strengthen the\n            PA's capacity to achieve the desired reforms and also\n            help build the required support among donors. The Bank will\n            support the PRDP process in two complementary ways: (i) it\n            has established the PRDP Trust Fund as requested by the PA;\n            and (ii) will provide the proposed development policy grant.\n            The project can boost economic growth, establish good\n            governance, increase private sector development, and improve\n            social and public infrastructure. The PA has made\n            significant progress in building institutions, including\n            passing some of the most progressive economic and social\n            laws in the Arab world and conducting peaceful free and fair elections."}, "docdt": "2008-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
