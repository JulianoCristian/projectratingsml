    DEVELOPMENT PLAN", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Palestinian Reform and\n            Development Plan Development Policy Grant (PRDP DPG) Project\n            for West Bank and Gaza (WBG) were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the success of the PRDP DPG has provided a number\n            of important lessons for future Bank operations. First and\n            foremost is that for budget support operations to be\n            successful, they must support the Government's agenda\n            and not an agenda imposed from outside. The DPG directly\n            supported the PRDP that was formulated by the Palestinian\n            Authority (PA) after extensive consultations with a wide\n            variety of stakeholders including government agencies, civil\n            society and donors. Thus, there has been strong buy in from\n            all parties and the reforms supported by the DPG have been\n            successfully implemented. The success can be traced to the\n            realistic scope and timing of the reform agenda. The\n            Palestinians are attempting to build a state from scratch\n            while under occupation. There is an extensive agenda of\n            pressing reforms. However, the PA has only a limited ability\n            to implement reforms. Thus, the PA, in consultation with\n            donors, has narrowed their efforts to the most critical\n            reforms that are also attainable. As the reform process\n            progresses and the Government builds strength, the agenda\n            will become more ambitious. Reaching too far, too fast,\n            could doom the reform process. Thus, successful policy\n            lending must take into account the political realities faced\n            by the government and requires careful timing and targeting\n            of critical reforms. Another clear lesson has been the\n            importance of having the Bank's task team resident in\n            the WBG country office. In fragile and conflict states, the\n            situation is constantly changing and government priorities\n            shift rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a\n            constant dialogue with government counterparts, which\n            requires the task team to be present in the country. The\n            previous budget support operation in WBG suffered because it\n            was managed from headquarters."}, "docdt": "2009-06-11T00:00:00Z"}
