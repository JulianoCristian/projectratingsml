This strategy aims to support: 1) economic\n            stabilization; 2) structural reforms; 3) social protection;\n            4) improved portfolio implementation and the sustainability\n            of past and future investments; and 5) sustainable\n            development, with a focus on the management of water,\n            population growth, and human resource development. The main\n            objectives of this project are to: (a) support the\n            Government's stabilization and structural reform\n            program; (b) improve the incentives framework for private\n            sector development; and (c) ease the shortage of foreign\n            exchange needed to finance critical imports to facilitate a\n            supply response. The main reforms to be supported by this\n            credit relate to trade liberalization; privatization and\n            public enterprise reform; and improvement of the regulatory framework."}, "docdt": "1996-03-14T00:00:00Z"}
