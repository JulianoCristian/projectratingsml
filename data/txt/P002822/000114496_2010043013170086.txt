Sir:
TANZANIA: Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit (Cr. 3379-2-TA)
Second Agreement  Amending Development  Credit Agreement
(Amendment to SDR amount)
We refer to the Second Agreement Amending Development Credit Agreement (the 
“Agreement”) for the above-referenced Project, dated February 15, 2002, between the United 
Republic of Tanzania (the “Borrower”) and the International Development Association (the 
“Association”).
It has come to our attention that, by mistake, the Dollar amount was used instead of the 
SDR amount.  We would therefore propose to amend the Agreement as follows (all changes are 
indicated in bold):
1.
Paragraph (C) of the Preamble to the Agreement is amended to read as follows:
“(C)
the Borrower has requested the Association to provide additional assistance in 
support of the Program, by increasing the amount made available under the Development Credit 
Agreement by an amount in various currencies equivalent to 
four hundred fifty thousand
 
Special Drawing Rights (SDR 
450,000
); and”.
2.
Section 1.02 to the Agreement is amended to read as follows:
“Section 1.02. Section 2.01 of the Development Credit Agreement is amended to read as 
follows:
“Section 2.01. The Association agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and 
conditions set forth or referred to in the Development Credit Agreement, an 
amount in various currencies equivalent to one hundred forty-two million nine 
hundred eighty thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR 
142,850,000
)
(the Credit), 
which includes: (a) an original amount in various currencies equivalent to one 
hundred forty-one million eight hundred thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR 
141,800,000) (the Initial Financing); (b) an additional amount in various 
currencies equivalent to six hundred thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR 
600,000) (the First Additional Financing); and (c) an additional amount in various 
currencies equivalent to 
four hundred fifty thousand
 Special Drawing Rights 
(SDR 
450,000
) (the Second Additional Financing).”

The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Agreement is amended to read as set forth 
in Annex 1 to this letter.
All other provisions of the Agreement, except as amended herein shall remain in full force 
and effect.
Please indicate your agreement with the foregoing, on behalf of the Borrower, by
