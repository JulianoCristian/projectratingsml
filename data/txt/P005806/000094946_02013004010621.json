sustainability\n            is rated \"unlikely.\" This is because maintaining\n            the condition of the Harad-Huth Road over the long-term will\n            depend primarily upon regular and adequate routine and\n            periodic maintenance, as well as upon the security situation\n            in the area. Both World Bank and Borrower performances are\n            assessed as overall satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project included the following: Conflicts among tribes and\n            between tribes and the Government caused significant delays\n            in project implementation. For those projects that may raise\n            objections or are likely to incite opposition in tribal\n            areas, more emphasis should be placed on minimizing the\n            political ramifications during project design, and\n            beneficiaries should be consulted during preparation. the\n            use of force account to build roads and other transport\n            infrastructure should be carefully considered, and only used\n            under exceptional circumstnaces. Due to a lack of\n            understanding of Bank procurement procedures and the need to\n            follow them closely, the acquisition of works, goods, and\n            services suffered during the early stages of the project. To\n            avoid such problems, there should be at least one dedicated\n            counterpart professional with in-depth knowledge and\n            practical experience of Bank procurement procedures. The\n            lack of adequate financial records also was a shortcoming of\n            the project."}, "docdt": "2001-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
