MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A MU-LTI-MODE TRANSPORT PROJECT
The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development credit
to the Republic of Yemen for SDR 22.7 million (US$30.0 million equivalent) is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would help finance a multi-mode transport project.
IDA Strat=Q
1.    The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) and the People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen (PDRY) merged in May 1990 to form the Republic of Yemen. At the cabinet
level, the two administrations have been unified and the merger is working its
way through the lower echelons of the ministries. Nevertheless, the period up
to the end of 1991 will be a transition period during which some separate
institutions, policies and practices will co-exist at the sub-sectoral level.
The Government intends to introduce its first joint budget in 1991 and the
first joint development plan in 1992.
2.    The following paragraphs do not cover all eight )oints indicated in the
President's Memorandum to the Executive Directors of Jane 4, 1990 - Approaches
to Country Strategy Reviews of IDA Countries - because we are in the process
of combining the national accounts and other statistics. Later in FY91 we plan
to have a complete analysis of the economic situation, prospects and related
issues and we will report as appropriate to the Executive Directors.
3.    As indicated in the SAR section dealing with the macroeconomic context,
unification brings together two sets of resources that have greater
development potential when combined. The North has oil and gas reserves,
tourism potential and a dynamic market system. The South also has some oil
reserves, large fishery resources, a strategic location and the Port of Aden.
With appropriate policies, the country should be able to develop at a
reasonable pace. But unification also brings together two economies that are
faced with serious macro-imbalances that need to be addressed urgently.
Accordingly, IDA's foremost objective is to assist the Government in putting
in place a stabilization cum growth program. A Medium Term Economic Framework
paper is under preparation with IMF participation to assist Government in the
review of options and approaches. We expect this work to be completed in early
1991. Sector work in industry and export promotion, energy sector, agriculture
and livestock, education and training, as well as infrastructure, will be
directed to the needs of Yemen as an integrated country. As such, these
reviews planned for FY91 will provide inputs to the next development plan.
4.    Beyond the urgently needed stabilization, Yemen should emphasize ways
and means of generating foreign exchange earnings/savings other than oil
revenues and labor remittances. Its natural gas and mineral resources as well
as its agriculture (mainly fisheries) and industry and to some extent tourism



-2-
and services offer opportunities for diversification provided that the macro
economic amd sectoral policies are appropriate. Indeed, the development plans
of the Norti and South have espoused economic diversification, even though
under different approaches. The main thrust of IDA support would be to
encourage diversification under a market oriented approach.
5.    Lack of a broad educational base as well as technical and managerial
skills is one of the most important bottlenecks in Yemen's development in
almost every sector. From teachers to power technicians the country depends
heavily on expatriate assistance. The development of human resources is
therefor expected to remain in the center of IDA's strategy. A key objective
is zo increase access to and improve quality of education and training at all
levels, consonant with labor market needs. With health care available mainly
in large cities, another important human resource objective is to support
basic health care in rural areas, including planned and safe motherhood. The
limitations under which women live and work (widespread illiteracy, limited
medical care, low formal labor pa;ticipation) point out the need to support
women's development (WID) objectives in a coordinated multi-sectoral approach.
The recently completed WID sector review has assessed the results of past WID
specific components under IDA's ongoing projects. It has also identified
future directions which have been presented to the Government. At the
Government's request, IDA is planning a WID project identification mission
befor.a the end of 1990.
6.    Further development of the Agricultural, Industry and Energy sectors
will require changes in some of the past policies. Government regulations in a
number of areas such as interest rates, investment and import licencing, and
foreign exchange control, will need to be reviewed and liberalized in tandem
with the macroeconomic policy measures now und-r discussion. These reforms in
incentive policies are needed to unleash the full potential of private sector
development. Our industry projects are expected to pursue policy and
institutional reforms needed to support private sector led industrial growth.
Measures to encourage investment by non-resident Yemenis and foreign investors
are expected to have high priority. Privatization of public enterprises in the
South will receive close attention, although the Government has not yet
defined a specific course of action other than requiring financial viability.
Water and soil resources will require careful environmental management if
agriculture is to be sustained. IDA assistance is expected to continue to
support these objectives.
7.    The drive for diversification will require opening up the economic
potential of the entire country. Inadequate infrastructure on a very difficult
topography is still an obstacle to increased economio activity in many
regions. In such areas, relative poverty cannot be acequately addressed
without providing basic services and better transporc facilities. Future IDA
assisted transport and rural infrastructure projects will continue to address
those needs. High population increase coupled with migration to cities is
rapidly outstripping available urban services/infrastructure, water supply and
sewerage facilities with deleterious environmental consequences. These areas
are also expected to receive IDA support. Future power needs of the unified
country will be assessed within the framework of an energy sector update.



-3-
Meanwhile, compliance with revenue covenants under ongoing power projects has
emerged as an issue and will have to be resolved to clear the way for future
IDA operations in the power sector.
8.    We have assessed the environmental impact of ongoing IDA projects and
initiated a quick review of Yemen's environmental needs which will be taken
into account in project design. We have also identified projects In disposal
of chemical substances and solid waste management which will be addressed by
the agricultural and municipal projects under preparation.
9.    Future projects to be supported by IDA will assist industry,
agriculture, fisheries, power, water supply, teacher training, land and water
conservation, energy development and municipal environment. These operations
will be designed to support the objectives mentioned in the preceding
paragraphs. As in the past, through purposeful project design and project mix,
the proposed lending program seeks to have an impact on rural and urban
poverty. To this end, we will focus on provision of basic services and on
geographically balanced human resource development.
10.   The IDA portfolio in Yemen included 30 projects under implementation for
the former YAR and 14 for the former PDRY (as of end FY90). For YAR,
aggregate annual disbursements have been around $27 million in recent years
out of an undisbursed amount of about $190 million. For PDRY, while overall
project implementation has been satisfactory over the past few years,
disbursements in FY90 were about $10 million (down from $18 million in FY89)
compared with an undisbursed amount of about $88 million. During the last four
years, project implementation in YAR has been generally slow. Prolonged
ratification of credit agreements (on average one year), evaluation of bids
(6-9 months), licensing and custom clearance of project-related goods, poor
budgeting proc dures and the availability of counterpart funds all conspired
in generating implementation delays across the board. The bottlenecks are not
insurmountable; most of them could be alleviated through better organization.
We have proposAd assistance for method and organization reviews where
bottlenecks exist. Most project units have functioned adequately within these
broader limitations (although they would benefit from more autonomy). Our next
country implementation review will take place in the first quarter of CY 1991.
We will again discuss implementation constraints and suggested solutions.

Transport Sector
11.     Background.   The modernization of the transport sector in Republic of
Yemen started in early 1972 with the establishment of a Highway Authority in
the South; in 1972 a Highway Authority was also established in the North. The
two authorities have now merged to form the General Corporation f<.r Roads and
Bridges (GCRB), which is responsible for all matters related to the national
road system; GCRB is under the tutelage of the Ministry of Construction (MOC).
The municipalities were and still are responsible for the development of rural
roads. The Ports and Marine Affairs Corporation (North) anc. the Yemen Ports
and Shipping Corporation (South) merged into two new authorities: the General
Corporation of Yemen Ports (GCYP) and the General Corporation for Marine
Affairs (GCMA), which are corporations responsible for all matters related to
ports and coastal management. These two corporations P-swer to the Ministry of
Transport (MOT). The Civil Aviation and Meteorologica. Authority (North) and
the Department of Civil Aviation (South) merged to form the Civil Aviation and
Meteorological Authority (CAMA), which is responsible for all matters
pertaining to civil aviation and weather forecasting and is also under MOT.
Yemenia (North) and Alyemda (South) merged tco form YEMENIA, the Republic of
Yemen national airline.
15.     Four consecutive and parallel development programs in both the North
and the South, which were supported by significant external aid provided fc:
major expansion in the transport sector. Achievements have been substanti' .
In 1972 the road system consisted of only a few asphalted roads (226 km    m
Sana'a to Hodeidah, and 200 km of roads around Aden) and 6,000 km of pri   ive
tracks. Port facilities, except in Aden (65,000 dwt), were only suitable .or
8,000 dwt ships in Hodeidah and for some lighterage in Mukha. There was 4 air
service. In 1989, the main road network covered 6,500 km, of which 4,400 were
paved; there were also 40,000 km of local roads suitable for four-wheel drive
vehicles. The port of Hodeldah can now handle 25,000 dwt ships and has sevia
berths, with adequate facilities for containerization and storage. The Mukha
and Mukalla ports have two alongside berths and adequate storage facilities.
Five international airports at Sana'a, Aden, Hodeidah, Taiz and Riyan are open
to traffic. Institutional development was also high on the Government agenda,
although specific managerial reforms in GCRB, GCYP and CAMA have lagged behind
the physical development of the sector. The efficiency of the rural
associations has been strengthened through the establishment of a central
coordination agency, and YEMENIA is an efficient and profitable company.
16.     The transport sector, contributing 6 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), is central to the development of Republic of Yemen. Government
investment in the transport sector averaged 15 percent of total public
investment in the 1980s, which is adequate in the context of the state of
development of Republic of Yemen. The Association has recognized the sector's
importance by providing, since 1970, credits for two port and thirteen highway
projects. The two port projects have achieved important physical targets but
have not overcome certain institutional shortcomings. The Port Project, Credit
714-YAR, while instrumental in expanding port capacity, had little sustained
institutional impact because it was too ambitious (PCR/PPAR No. 5465 of



-5-
February 15, 1985). The Aden Port Rehabilitation Project, Credit 584-YDR,
helped to cope with an unforeseen increase in domestic traffic in the late
1970s and early 1980s but was less successful in enabling the port to
establish an adequate bunkering and ship services organization for
international traffic (PPAR No. 5982 of December 20, 1985). Institutional
targets in the establishment, organization and operation of GCRB have always
been reached although there have been some delays, particularly in the
training of local cadres and in the establishment of appropriate investment
priorities (PCR/PPAR No. 7312 of June 24, 1988; Third Highway Project, Credit
794-YAR). Physical components focussing on the improvement and maintenance of
the highway system have been achieved, generally within both the budget and
contractual period. The Association's flexible approach in the selection of
procurement and construction methods was commended in a special OEI) report,
No. 7911 of June 29, 1989. However, much still remains to be done in the
sector if the transport services required to support the country's development
objectives are to be provided. In particular, many areas with agricultural
potential need to be made more accessible. There is also an urgent need to
systematically analyze and address the problems of low productivity and
insufficient coordination in the civil aviation and port subsectors. The new
Ministries of Construction and Transport provide an adequate framework for
addressing these issues on an integrated, sectorwide basis.
17.     Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Government's strategy for the
transport sector in Republic of Yemen, which IDA supports, focusses on the
adequate maintenance of existing assets; the selective expansion of the road
network; the accessibility to areas with economic potential; and the
improvement of operational and financial management in the port and civil
aviation subsectors. The proposed project is designed to build upon the
success of IDA assistance to the highway subsector by making the transport
sector more self-sustaining, strengthening sectorwide planning through its
multi-mode approach and technical assistance couponents, and offering IDA its
first opportunity to be involved, in a coordinated fashion, in the operation
of all transport modes. IDA's involvement in these areas is particularly
opportune in view of the recent unification.
18.     Project Objectives.  Tne project is designed to strengthen the
operation and efficiency of the transport sector by (a) improving access to
the important agricultural areas between the northeastern highlands and the
Tihama coastal region; (b) addressing institutional needs, including
management strengthening in the ports and civil aviation subsectors; and (c)
supporting the training of local staff in key aspects of transport sector
management.
19.     Project DescriRtion.  To achieve these objectives, tne project would
provide (a) equipment and materials to improve the Harad-Huth Road (157 km),
which was assigned top priority in the 1986 North Highway Master Plan and is
part of the North Third Five-Year (1987-91) Development Plan; (b) technical
assistance (TA) to GCRB, including four highway engineers for the construction
of the road and consultants for the works supervision; and (c) TA through
management contracts to CAMA and GOCYP/GCMA for two strategic development
studies which would assess key areas for management improvements, and related



-6-
training and equipment needs. MOC and MOT would he the execut-ing agencies. A
six-year project implementation period is envis.-.ed. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$43 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$30 million or SDR 22.7 million equivalent (70 percent of total
project cost), which would be financed under the proposed IDA credit. The
Harad-Huth Road works, costing approximately US$36 million, would be carried
out using GCRB force account. GCRB labor and local materials (US$12.4 million)
would be financed entirely by the Government. Equipment and imported materials
(US$22.3 million) needed for the cxecution of the works would be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB), except for contracts not
exceeding US$100,000 each or US$1.6 million in aggregate, for which
international shopping would be applied. A breakdown of project costs and the
financial plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Republic of Yemen
(YAR and PDRY) are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map covering
the project area is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8528-YAR, dated
August 9, 1990, is being circulated separately.
20.     Actions Agreed Upon.  During negotiations, agreement was reached that
the Government would: (a) prepare and submit by June 30 of each year of
project implementation, for IDA's review and comments, the next year road
maintenance work plan and implement this plan, taking into consideration IDA's
comments; (b) prepare an enforcement program for truck overloading by March
31, 1992 and, following IDA app;oval of the program, apply strict enforcement
of the axle-load regulations by June 30, 1992; (c) implement an action plan
for the liberalization of the road-freight transport industry, by December 31,
1991; (d) recruit consultants for the supervision of road works by January 1,
1991; and (e) complete the CAMA and GCYP/GCKA studies by January 1, 1994 and
implement the recommendations of such studies by Jenuary 1, 1995. The
establishment of a project unit in HCC for the overall management of the
project would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
21.     Benefits.  The Harad-Huth Road improvements are estimated to yield an
economic rate of return of 32 percent. They would also yield important but
non-quantifiable environmental benefits. The asphalting of the road will
reduce dust in the environment and the construction of drainage structures
will prevent erosion in areas adjacent to the road. Three main groups would
benefit from these improvements: (a) the agricultural population living in the
area served by the road and in the Tihama Plain, through easier access to
markets (including Saudi Arabia) and social services; (b) the cities of Huth
and Harad, through increased economic activity generated by agriculture and
trade; and (c) road users in northern Republic of Yemen, who would experience
major distance savings on journeys to the port of Hodeidah, the Tihama and
Saudi Arabia. The Harad-Huth Road works would also provide employment for
about 600 local people during the three-year construction period.
22.     Risks.  The proposed project is not subject to any unusual risk. The
construction of the road is straightforward and does not pose any special
risk. However, the area where the road would be built has, in the past, knowr
some civil disturbance. In order to minimize potential implementation delays,



-7-
the GCRB labor force would continue to be used for road construction in the
area, since its work during the last two years has been of excellent quality
and well accepted by the local population. Although there is the risk that all
the institutional improvement objectives may not be met, the implementation of
the proposed GCRB, CAMA and GCYP/GCMA institutional strengthening is
anticipated within the project time frame and forms an integral part of the
Government's strategy. The project's technical assistance component would
also help in minimizing implementation delays.
23.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
