REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
MULTI-MODE TRANSPORT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
borrower:            Republic of Yemen
LPer.ef iciarv:      Ministries of Construction and Transport
Amount                SDR 22.7 million (US$30.0 million equivalent)
Terms:               Standard IDA terms, with 40 year maturity
Project Obiectives:  The proposed project would build upon the
and DescriDtion      achievements of fifteen IDA-financed transport
projects by assisting in the development of
sectorwide strategic planning and addressing
institutional issues in the civil aviation and port
subsectors. It would: (i) improve access to
important agricultural areas; (i)" address
institutional, financial and strategic development
needs of the Civil Aviation and Meteorological
Authority (CAMA), the General Corporation of Yemen
Ports (GCYP) and the General Corporation for Marine
Affairs (GCMA); and (iii) continue to support
transport sector training.
The credit would finance: (i) civil works and
construction supervision to improve the 157 km
Harad-Huth Road; (ii) about 150 man months of
technical assistance to the General Corporation of
Roads and Bridges (GCRB); and (iii) technical
assistance including strategic development studies
for CAMA, GCYP and GCMA and the training and
equipment identified under such studies.
Benefits and Risks:  The Harad-Huth Road improvements are estimated to
yield an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 32
percent. Three main groups will benefit: (i) the
agricultural population living in the area served
by the road; (ii) the population of the cities of
Harad, Huth and their vicinities due to increased
economic activity generated by improved agriculture
and lower transport costs; and (iii) road users in
north ROY, who will experience large distance
savings. Except for possibly not being able to
resolve all institutional issues in the civil
aviation and port sub-sectors, there are no major
risks associated with the project. The technical
assistance providing successful implementation
experience and Government's commitment to project
objectives shown during preparation should enable
implementation within the anticipated time frame.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
MULTI-MODE TRANSPORT PROJECT
I. THE MACRO CONTEXT
A. Economic Background
1.01        The Yemen Arab Republic (YAR or the North) and the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY or the South), merged on May 22, 1989 to
form the Republic of Yemer. (ROY). At the cabinet level, the two
administrations have been unified and the merger is working its way through
the lower echelons of the ministries. Nevertheless, the period up to the end
of 1991 will be a transition period during which some separate institutions,
policies and practices will co-exist at the sub-sectoral level. The Government
intends to introduce its first joint budget in 1991 and the ,irst joint
development plan in 1992.
1.02        With a population of about 11.0 million (1988), ROY occupies an
area of about 530,000 sq. km of largely mountainous and desertic terrain in
the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula, There are five distinct
geographic regions: the arid coastal plain along the Red Sea (the Tihama);
the Indian Ocean desertic littoral, with strategic centers of population and
commercial activity such as Aden; the rugged central and southern highlands,
rising to about 2,500 m, where the bulk cf the population lives; the eastern
plateau; and the Rub Al Khali Desert. Only about 3 percent of the land is
arable, mainly in the central and southern highlands where rainfall is
highest. Land is also available in the wadis of the eastern plateau, the
Tihama, and in pockets of terraced mountain slopes throughout the central and
southern highlands. This terrain is the reason that both the demand for
transport and the cost of providing transport services are high.
1.03        Since North and South Yemen introduced their first development
plans in 1973 and 1974, substantive progress has been achieved in modernizing
and unifying the country. The transport sector, which contributed about 6
percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1988 and is an important catalyst
in socioeconomic development, has contributed to this progress. However,
despite the country's limited oil reserves, ROY remains a poor country with a
per capita Gross National Product (GNP) estimated at US$610 in 1988 and an
economy in difficulty.
1.04        The economy of the North grew at nearly 14 percent in 1988, due to
increased oil extraction, but it slowed down to under 5 percent in 1989. Oil
extraction has begun to substantially change the export structure. The



-2-
North's share of industrial output rose to 25 percent of the GDP in 1989,
compared to 18 percent in 1986. Total merchandise exports went up from $16
million in 1986 to $1,186 million in 1989, as oil exports increased from nil
to $1,119 million. Despite these dramatic changes, the northern economy
continues to display some of its former characteristics. Virtually all
production still goes to consumption, and gross domestic savings have been
largely negative over the last decade. Fixed investment, despite the
substantial amount going into oil development, remains low, at 12 percent of
GDP in 1989; it '.s still financed totally by external resources, mainly in the
form of workers' remittances and borrowing. The budget deficit has widened in
recent years, to 15-20 percent of GDP in 1987/88; however, in 1989 it dropped
to about 9 percent through reduced expenditures. Last year's oil exports also
boosted the trade balance of payments so dramatically that the current account
deficit improved from 12 percent of GDP in 1987/88 to about 8 percent in 1989.
The deficits, however, were financed largely by short-term borrowing, adding a
serious short-term debt. As a result, debt service has sharply increased from
only 7 percent of foreign exchange earn'ngs in 1985 to 23 percent in 1989.
Th3 Government has been rescheduling debt to the USSR, which accounts for two-
thirds of all public debt (1989).
1.05        Before unification, the Government of the Forth recognized that
oil was not the panacea to their problems. The Third Five-Year Plan (1987-
1991) maintains a longer-term perspective, projecting the needs of the economy
into the next century. Its programs and policies support the market
orientation of the economy, by shifting development priorities from
infrastructure toward the traded goods sectors; by favoring projects with
shorter gestation periods; and by emphasizing both the agricultural and
industrial sectors. Although the effects of the unification on the economy
are far from clear, IDA's recommended policy agenda for the North includes
reducing the budget deficit as a top priority, allowing adjustments in the
exchange rate to permit the economy to regain its competitiveness and stop
recourse to short-term borrowing.
1.06        During the past two years, improved economic activity in the South
has made up for many of the losses sustained in 1986 due to the civil war and
the sharp decline in workers' remittances; GDP grew about 3 percent in 1989.
However, the financial situation remains precarious. Workers' remittances
have continued to drop, and foreign borrowing has increased. Foreign exchange
reserves have been drawn down to about two months of imports. Long-standing
centralized controls over production, investment, distribution, and prices
have created pervasive rigidities and distortions which, in turn, have
undermined efficiency. The current account deficit increased from 17 percent
of GDP in 1987 to about 60 percent of GDP in 1989, reflecting a sharp increase
in imports; the budget deficit reached 45 percent of GDP in 1989; and
inflationary pressures are mounting, fueled in part by expansionary domestic
bank borrowing. The South's debt service payments are at 16 percent of the
foreign exchange earnings for 1989, reflecting both the concessional terms of
the debt as well as the rescheduling of principal and interest payments to
socialist countries. Service payments have more than tripled over the last few
years reflecting a rapid increase in external debt. However, in the medium
term, prospects for a sustained recovery in the South are reasonable because



-3-
of recent oil discoveries. Extraction at a very limited scale has begun. It
is expected to increase through 1992.
1.07        Unification brings together two sets of resources that have
greater development potential when combined. The North has modest oil and gas
reserves, tourism potential and a dynamic market system. The South also has
some oil reserves, large fishery resources, a strategic location and the Port
of Aden. With appropriate policies, the country should be able to develop at
a reasonable pace. But unification also brings together two economies that
are faced with serious macro-imbalances that need to be addressed urgently.
IDA has provided advice on how to restore a viable balance to both the North
and the South, befort. unification; this economic dialogue will continue with
the new Republic of Yemen.
B. Experience with Past IDA Lending
1.08        Since 1970, IDA has contributed to the development of ROY's
transport system and institutions through. one port and seven highway projects
in the North; and an engineering credit, one port, five highways and one Roads
Flood Reconstruction project in the South. The first four highway projects in
the North (Credits 315-YAR, 558-YAR, 794-YAR and 1267-YAR), and the
engineering credit, first three highway and the Roads Flood Reconstruction
projects in the South (Credits 512-YDR, 240-YDR, 560-YDR, 1144-YDR and 1295-
YDR) have been satisfactorily completed. The remaining th ee highway projects
in the North (Credits 1413-YAR, 1726-YAR and 1848-YAR) and the two highway
projects in the South (Credits 1617-YDR and 1823-YDR) are still being
implemented. Thanks to decisive management by both former Highway
Authorities, supported by well planned technical assistance and training
programs, the implementation of the highway projects has gone well.
Institutional targets have also been reached, although there have been some
delays. Physical components focussing on the improvement and maintenance of
the highway system have been achieved, generally within both budget and
contractual period. The achievements of both the North and the South during
the last fifteen years, and the success of the procurement and construction
methods applied, have been the subject of an Organization for Economic
Development (OED; study (Procurement and Construction of Highway Civil Works
in Small Countries, Report No. 7911, June 29, 1989>.
1.09 The First and Second Highway projects in the North (joint PCR/PPAR No.
2737 of November 12, 1979) and the First (PCR/PPAR No. 1089 of March 27, 1978)
and Second (PCR/PPAR No. 5439 of January 30, 1985) Highway projects in ths
South assisted in the establishment and consolidation of the respective
Highway Authorities. These projects revealed the need for better training in
road maintenance and for improved investment selection. They also established
and consolidated two construction units which implemented the road
construction works after international competitive bidding failed to produce
acceptable bids (the Al-Beida Road in the North and the Wadi Hadramawt Road in
the South). The Third Highway Project in the North (PCR/PPAR No. 7312 of June
24, 1988) developed a Vocational Training Center in Taiz as the anchor for all



-4.
road maintenance programs; it included a Highway Master Plan (February 1986)
which defined investment priorities up to the year 2000. During
implementation a lack of coordination among the different transport modes was
also identified. This situation improved slightly under the Fourth Highway
Project (PCR of June 8, 1989) and would be fully addressed under the proposed
project. Under the Third Highway and Roads Flood Reconstruction projects
(joint PCR/PPAR No. 7311 of June 24, 1988), the construction unit, due to
exorbit3nt bids, hai to be employed again; considerable improvements were made
in its o?eratior (since 1986 as the autonomous Public Corporation for Road
Construction) through the assistance of foreign engineering management
consultants. Ttie Roads Flood Project included a Transport Sector Study (June
1984) defining investment and institutional needs up to the year 2000.
1.10        The two port projects, also completed, have achieved important
physical targets but could not overcome institutional shortcomings. The
PPR/PPAR No. 5465 of February 15, 1985 for the Port Project in the North
(Credit 714-YAR) acknowledges that the project was instrumental in expanding
port capacity but that it had little sustained institutional impact because
its physical (construction) targets were too ambitious. Similarly, the
PCR/PPAR No. 5982 of December 20, 1985 for the Aden Port Rehabilitation
Project in the South (Credit 534-YDR) acknowledges that the project equipment
and technical assistance components helped to cope with an unforeseen increase
in domestic port traffic in the late 1970s and early 1980s; however, due to
changes in shipping patterns worldwide and strong competition from Red Sea
ports, these components were less successful in enabling the port to provide
bunkering and ship services to international traffic after the reopening of
the Suez Canal in 1975. Manpower training, maintenance and management issues
in the port and civil aviation subsectors would be addressed under the
proposed project.
1.11        The three ongoing highway projects in the North are experiencing
substantial savings due to increasing competition in construction and
consultancy. These savings have been used to enlarge road construction, and
implement environmental master plans, technical assistance and training
components. Physical and institutional achievements will, therefore, exceed
those envisaged at appraisal. The two ongoing highway projects in the South
are proceeding satisfactorily, within estimate costs, although with some
implementation delays due to slow procurement procedures. The proposed
project costs have been established on the basis of the most recent contract
awards for road construction in ROY; all the bidding documents are already
ava4lable, and the procurement process is underway.  Therefore, neither
significant savings nor implementation delays are expected.
1.12        Since the ROY primary road network is approaching completion, the
IDA transport sector strategy in ROY focuses on the adequate maintenance of
existing assets; the selective expansion of the road network providing access
to areas with economic potential; and the upgrading of operational and
financial management in the port and civil aviation subsectors. The proposed
project strictly adheres to this strategy.

II. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Overall Organization
2.01        The administration of the transport sector .s primarily the
responsibility of the Ministry of Construction (MOC) and the Ministry of
Transport (MOT). It is carried out by four semi-autonomous agencies: (i) the
General Corporation for Roads and Bridges (CCRB) under the MOC which replaces
the former Highway Authority in the North, and the High Authority and the
Public Corporation for Road Construction in the South; (ii) the Civil Aviation
and Meteorolegical Authority (CAMA) under MOT, which replaces the Departments
of Civil Aviation in both the North and the South; (iii) the General
Corporation of Yemen Ports (GCYP) under MOT, which replaces the parts dealing
with the ports of the Ports and Marine Affairs Corporation in the North and
the Yemen Ports and Shipping Corporation in the South; and (iv) the General
Corporation for Marine Affairs (CCMA) which replaces the parts in (iii) above
dealing with Marine Affairs. In addition, there are severr' semi-public
enmnanipi resnonpible for the planninv and operation of spccific transport
operations. These include: (i) YEMENIA, the profitable national airline
jointly owned by the Government of Saudi Arabia, and including the former
ALYEMDA in the South; and (ii) the General Transport Corporation (GTC) which
provides urban and interurban bus services. Annexes 2 to 5 present the
Organization Charts of MOC, GCRB, CAMA and GCYP.   The Organizational Charts
of MOT and GCMA are not yet available. All these agencies are already
established and operating on a regular basis. However, since their
establishment is still pending ratification by the Parliament, the Draft
Development Credit Agreement would still mention and consider, until
ratification laws are available, the former agencies with the proviso land any
successor thereto".
B. Transport Sector Investment
2.02        Investments in the transport sector contained in the Third Five-
Year plans (1987-91, North; 1986-90, South) have been planned in anticipation
of foreign financing allocations. Most projects are, therefore, subject to
feasibility studies at the behest of the lenders, and most investments have to
pass tests of economic viability. The quality of investment planning should
further improve now that the transport agencies cover the entire ROY
territory. To assist in the planning and supervision of these agencies, the
proposed project would provide technical assistence to CAMA, GCYP and GCMA, as
well as strategic development studies for these organizations (paras. 3.03).
Highway projects are based on the February 1986 Highway Master Plan (North)
and on the June 1984 Transport Sector Study (South). The level of investment
on these projects has reached about 65 percent of the amounts proposed under
the Third Five-Year plans; this is similar c the rate of achievement under
the previous plans. Table 2.1 presents planned versus actual investments in
the transport sector.

C. General Corporation for Roads and Bridtes
2.03        GCRB is a semi-autonomous government agency with independent
budget and salary scales; it employs about 5,000 staff. The Board of
Directors is chaired by the Minister of Construction. IDA's participation in
thirteen highway projects (para. 1.08) has helped GCRB establish and develop
into one of the Government's most efficient agencies in terms of
implementation performance. Annex 3 presents the GCRB Organizational Chart.
Staff,tui and Training
2.04        The majority of staff at professional and support levels are
qualified Yemeni nationals capable of performing most of the tasks required of
the corporation. The assumption of most tasks by Yemenis has been achieved
through an effective technical assistance program and through the successful
development of the Taiz Vocational Training Center, financed by IDA. However,
some technical assistance personnel are still required to address complex
engineering matters and introduce new technologies. Financing for such
assistance has been included under the proposed project (para. 3.03) and'will
supplement ongoing assistance provided under the Fifth and Seventh Highway
Projects (Credits 1413-YAR and 1848-YAR).



-7-
2.05        Since the start of operations at the Taiz Vocational Training
Center (VTC), Yemenis have been trained as vehicle mechanics, vehicle
electricians, plant mechanics, road supervisors, machinists, welders and plant
operators. Under the overall supervision of a Training Chief, classes are
given by expatriate and Yemeni instructors. The latter are themselves
graduates of the training program. The program includes a follow-up
monitoring and evaluation system. By the end of 1989, 600 trainees had
graduated from VTC; 450 of these graduates were GCRB staff.   About 90 percent
of those trainees hired by GCRB are still working there. The training center
is now well known among private sector employers, who have started enrolling
their own staff in various training programs. By the end of 1995, VTC is
expected to be entirely staffed by Yemenis. It must be mentioned that a
second training center in Aden has contributed notoriously to the preparation
of mechanics in the South although at a lower level and without the assistance
of expatriate trainers.
Administration and Planning
2.06        GCRB is responsible for the planning, administration and
maintenance of the main and secondary road network (about 4,500 km of paved
roads and 2,000 km of gravel roads Annex 6)1'. The North Highway Master Plan
(HMP) prepared in 1986 and the South Transport Sector Study of 1984 cover up
to the year 2000 and provide the strategy for highway investments focussing on
improvement and maintenance rather than new construction. One of the priority
components of HlMP is the improvement of the 157 km Harad-Huth Road.
Consultants are still employed by GCRB to undertake major road studies and
supervise works, but the GCRB Planning and Construction Department, which has
been strengthened under the Fifth Highway Project (Credit 1413-YAR), is
becoming increasingly able to carry out planning, design and supervision with
its own resources.
The Maintenance and Im2rovement of the Road System
2.07        The standard of maintenance on the GCRB-supervised network is
generally good. In 1987, the Government agreed to a covenant under the
Seventh Highway Project (Credit 1848-YAR) to increase the road maintenance
budget by 5 percent p.a. in real terms. Since 1987, the budget and actual
expenditures have been increasing at an actual nominal rate of 8.3 percent
p.a. In the absence of a reliable price index for the cost of maintenance
operations, it is not possible to calculate how this compares with the
it    Rural or agricultural access roads are administered by Local Councils
for Cooperative Development, which are independent entities financing
their operations through contributions from the local population and
migrant workers and from a one percent agricultural sales tax. Their
coordinating body, the Confederation of Local Councils for Cooperative
Development, maintains a limited technical staff. The total length of
the rural roads network is estimated at 40,000 km.



-8-
covenanted real increase of 5 percent p.a. However, unit rates in civil works
contracts during the same period show only limited price variations and,
consequently, indicate that the Government is complying with the covenant.
The cost accounting of maintenance operations has been improved under the
Fifth Highway Project (Credit 1413-YAR), such that the adequacy of the
maintenance program and budget can now be assessed. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with the Government that starting in 1991 (i) GCRB would
provide IDA, by June 30 of each year until completion of the project, with the
annual work plan (including analyses of costs and budgetary allocations) for
road maintenance operations; and (ii) each year thereafter, GCRB would carry
out said annual work plan, taking into consideration IDA's comments thereon.
2.08        The legal limit for single-axle loads in ROY is 13 tonnes.
Weighing equipment has been installed at key points in the road system, and
GCRB also possesses some portable weighbridges. However, the legal limit is
not being fully enforced, and only in exceptional cases is the extra load
discharged; even then, no fine is applied. A recent feasibility study of the
Sana'a-Hodeidah road included an axle-load survey, which indicated that about
60 percent of trucks had one or more axles over the legal limit. In some
cases the overloading was severe. This situation can cause serious
deterioration to important highway investments. During negotiations agreement
was reached with the Government that GCRB would (i) identify by March 31, 1992
the most frequently overloaded cargo (e.g., low-value bulk commodity) and
those trucking organiz.ations where overloading usually takes place; and (ii)
introduce a strict and selective axle-load enforcement program by June 30,
1992.
2.09        Construction and improvements on GCRB's network are mainly carried
out by foreign contractors, but GCRB still maintains a small and efficient
force-account construction unit, the result of a merger of the former North
and South force-account construction units. This unit satisfactorily
completed the Marib-Safir Road (Credit 1726-YAR), ahead of time and below cost
estimate. The unit continues to be used on relatively straightforward
construction and improvement projects at remote locations. Assistance in
developing the domestic contracting industry is being provided under Credit
1848-YAR, and eventually domestic contractors should replace GCRB's force-
account construction unit, which should be fully incorporated into GCRB's
maintenance work force by 1995.
Expenditures and Financing
2.10        Since 1970, over 70 percent of ROY's road construction, road
improvements and road maintenance have been financed from international and
bilateral sources. The need for external financing is likely to continue,
despite the growing income from oil production. Routine maintenance is
financed from government general revenues; road-user charges, described in
detail in Annex 7, are adequate to cover both the maintenance and construction
of the GCRB-administered network. Fuel prices are not subsidized: petrol and
diesel retail prices are 53 percent and 25 percent higher than their economic
costs. The following taole compares GCRB's investment and maintenance



-9-
expenditures with road-user revenues during the period 1984-88. Government
revenues, import duties, and total revenues earmarked for the highway sector
have steadily decreased as the result of a reduction in worker remittances due
to the slowdown in economic activity in the Gulf States; however, available
resources for road maintenance are still adequate.

2.11        Accurate i-formation on traffic flow and vehicle population is not
readily available. Plans are currently being made,and equipment procured, to
implement a 70-point permanent traffic census for ROY's main road system. This
should lead to a significant improvement in planning information. The 1988
ROY vehicle fleet, excluding motorcycles, is estimated at 375,950, indicating
an average rate of increase of about 4 percent p.a. from 1984 to 1988 (Table
2.3). However, studies recently carried out indicate that only 75 percent of
all vehicles were registered.

2.12     Prior to the development of the oil industry in 1987, statistics on
fuel consumption were unreliable, mainly because large amounts of oil products
were being smuggled in from Saudi Arabia. Consequently, trends in traffic
growth cannot be derived from these statistics. The 1988 consumption figures
are estimated at 670,000 tonnes of petrol (95 percent for motor vehicles) and
630,000 tonnes of diesel (70 percent for motor vehicles). These figures
indicate that trucks are probably underutilized, compared with other
countries; the truck fleet averages 25,000 km p.a. per vehicle.
Road Transport Industry
2.13          The road-freight transport industry is primarily operated by the
private sector, and there is free entry into the industry. However, most of
the long distance transport, especially that originating in ports, is
controlled through the "ferzah" system, which is a type of regional cartel.
Although this system has some value in regulating the transport industry, its
main purpose is to protect owners' interests; consequently, it inhibits
competition. The Government has, for some time, recognized the deficiencies
of the ferzah system. However, the system's socioeconomic roots, and the
powerful economic and political interests involved, have made it very
difficult to institute reforms. The 1986 report, "Review of Structure and
Functions of the General Secretariat of Transport Affairs", financed by the
Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1267-YAR), recommended three alternatives for
reducing the ferzahs' control over transport prices:
a)    abolishing, through parliamentary action, the ferzah system or
any other transport restrictive practice; or
b)   placing the system under the control of a government agency, with
that agency setting and monitoring operating regulations and
tariffs; or
c)   introducing a system whereby the Government controlled the issue
and renewal of operating licenses, with licensed vehicles allowed
to operate at market-determined rates.
The Government has recently taken a number of steps to ensure the proper
organization of land transport in Yemen. It has opened an office in the city
of Hodeidah, which handles more than 50 percent of the imports of the country,
to control freight rates. Furthermore, during negotiations the Government
agreed to meet with the Association by December 31, 1991 to discuss a plan for
the gradual reduction of restrictive practices in the road-freight transport
industry. The Government also agreed that, on the basis of said meeting it
would implement a plan under a time schedule acceptable to the Association.

D. The Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority
2.14        The country's rugged and vast terrain makes communication
difficult and frequently slow. Moreover, land routes to other countries in
the Arabian Peninsula are long and not always reliable. Consequently, the
Government has increasingly emphasized air transport for both domastic and
international communications. A network of airports, an air traffic control
system and navigational aids have been developed to support civil aviation;
the maintenance and effective operation of this infrastructure is a priority
objective in the transport sector.
2.15        The Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) is a semi-
autonomous agency under the tutelage of MOT. On financial matters, however,
CAMA reports to the Ministry of Finance. CAMA is responsible for the
operation of five international airports located in the largest cities in the
country -- Sana'a, Aden, Hodeidah, Taiz and Riyan (Mukalla)-- and for twelve
domestic airports. CAMA's headquarters are in the capital city of Sana'a, and
it employs about 1,300 staff. CAMA (Annex 4) is responsible for all matters
pertaining to civil aviation, including airport construction, maintenance and
operation, safety standards, air traffic control, crew and equipment
licensing, and the administration of civil aviation rules and regulations;
these duties are in addition to meteorological data collection and weather
forecasting.
2.16        The bulk of the country's air traffic is concentrated at Sana'a
Airport, which, together with the Aden, Hodeidah, and Riyan airports, has
relatively modern passenger and aircraft handling facilities. The passenger
facilities at Taiz Airport are inadequate, though the airport complies with
safety regulations. Consolidated data on air traffic for the country's five
main airports are presented in Table 2.4.

Airport traffic is forecast to grow about 5 percent annually during the next decade.
This is a conservative estimate, given the 8 percent annual growth which occurred
during the 1984-89 period, the developing tourist industry, and the growing increase
in traffic within a unified Yemen. Annex 8 provides a more detailed description of
CAMA and the country's main airports.
Oganization and Management
2.17        Though CAMA was created as a semi-autonomous agency deriving its income
from user fees, it operates as a government agency whose administrative and
financial structure is typical of government ministries and their departments. CAMA
is managed by a Board of Directors which includes the Chairman and the Deputy
Chairman. However, decision-making has generally rested with the Chairman, and the
overcentralization of authority has impeded effective and efficient operations.
There has also been a rapid turnover in top management positions in recent years.
In 1987 CAMA designed, with the assistance of the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO), a new organizational structure, suitable to a unified Yemen,
which includes recommended staffing levels and responsibilities; however, the plan
has yet to be developed or implemented. Through the proposed project, technical
assistance in the form of a management contract would be provided to establish an
appropriate management, organizational and administrative structure for CAMA to
function as an autonomous corpoeation, with emphasis on departmental, operational
and individual efficiency and productivity. The project would also assist in
identifying CAMA manpower development needs and provide on-the-job training,
specialized training abroad, and improvements to the National Aviation Training
Schools in Sana'a and Aden.
Ooerations and Maintenance
2.18        There are maintenance problems with electronic equipment (navigation
aids, ground-to-air communications, etc.), as well as with crash/fire/rescue (CFR)
equipment at each of the airports. CAMA has depended heavily on ICAO technical
assistance programs in the past, but these programs may not continue. The problems
are a lack of qualified technicians and inadequate management. The proposed project
would address the matter through technical assistance for management and for design
of a manpower training program, together with the provision of critical equipment.
Finance and Accounting
2.19        Financial management is limited to the recording of cash receipts and
expenditures. Revenue receipts are passed on to the Government as part of general
revenue, and expenditures are drawn from government budgetary allocations. There is
no real cash flow or financial management undertaken, except for the adherence to
budgets for which quarterly reports are produced. Accounting procedures also
include the calculation of notional depreciation at year-end, which is outside the
scope of budget activities. In addition to an unstructured cost recovery policy,
preventive maintenance is largely outside the budget process, and procurement
and inventory management are not linked to needs. Debt service obligations
are also inadequately reflected in CAMA's accounts. Annex 8 provides an
overview of CAMA revenues and expenditures for 1986-89.



-16-
2.20        Technical assistance for the CAMA strategic development study
would include the development of CAMA financial management practices through
the introduction of accrual accounting methods, budgetary and cost controls,
and improved management information systems. A main objective would be to
help CAMA become a dynamic organization and a reliable source of revenue for
the Government, rather than a civil service-oriented entity.
E. Ports and Marine Affairs Cornorations
2.21        The General Corporation of Yemen Ports (GCYP) and the General
Corporation for Marine Affairs (GCMA) are two semi-autonomous agencies with
full administrative and financial authority to operate the port subsector's
facilities (para 2.01). GCYP, the largest of the two, is responsible for all
port-related activities, which include the maintenance and the operation of
port infrastructure, cargo transit and storage, vessel handling, dredging,
etc. GCMA, which has a much smaller range of action and is still in the
formative stage, handles all marine affairs activities such as vessel
registration, pollution controls, pilotage, safe navigation and certain
maritime security tasks. Both corporations are headquartered in Sana'a with
important operational branches at all ports. GCYP's Board of Directors
consists of seven members, including a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman appointed
by the President and the Prime Minister, respectively. GCMA operates under
the authority of a Chairman and a Vice-Chairman, but its Board is still
undefined. GCYP employs about 2,500 staff and operates the ports of Hodeidah,
Aden (including Little Aden oil refinery port), Mukha, Mukalla and Nishtun in
addition to the deep-water facility at Al Salif which is used for salt export
and special cargoes and Ras Al Katib, a complementary port facility of
Hodeidah port. The floating-storage crude oil loading terminal at Ras Isa is
operated by 'he Yemen Hunt Oil Company on behalf of GCYP. Traffic flows
through the ports of Hodeidah, Mukha, Aden and Mukalla are provided in Table
2.6 below.

2.22        About 54 percent of the country's general cargo traffic is handled
through the centrally located port of Hodeidah and 24 percent through the port
of Aden. The small port of Mukha is well-located to serve the prosperous Taiz
region and handles over 10 percent of total cargo traffic, whereas the port of
Mukalla, serving the Hadramawt region, handles about 9 percent. The 3 percent
balance of traffic flows through Al Salif and Nishtun.   During the past six
years, port traffic has declined by about 15 percent despite the construction
at Hodeidah of 2 container berths and the acquisition of modern container
handling equipment. The decline in traffic may have been caused by the
slowdown in economic activity in the Region following the fall in oil prices,
which reduced workers' remittances from abroad. The ports of Hodeidah, Aden
and Mukha are currently operating at only about 60% of existing capacity
utilization. The fuel movement is considerable in Aden (little Aden) due to
the refinery, although it has been decreasing about 5 percent per year since
1984. In 1989, 2.9 million tons were imported and 2.5 million tons exported.



-18-
GCYP's Corporate Structure and Manage-lent
2.23        The task of managing and operating ROY's ports has grown
substantially during the past 10 years. GCYP's organization structure and
management practices have not kept pace with the expansion of port activities
and the increased complexity of present day port operations. Annex 9 provides
more detailed information on GCYP's management and operations. Technical
assistance in the form of a twinning arrangement or a management contract to
address GCYP's (as well as GCMA's) organizational needs would be provided
under the proposed project. These needs are primarily in the areas of
manpower development, equipment maintenance and financial planning and
control.
GCYP's Current Financial Situation and Financial/Accounting Systems
2.24        The port system in ROY is the country's major route for trade;
hence, the efficient operation of all ports is essential to the country's
development. Over the past decade, GCYP has generated profits that have been
more than sufficient to cover operational expenditures and debt service
obligations (Annex 9). GCYP's financial position has been good and is
projected to remain satisfactory over the medium term, even at current
depressed traffic levels, notwithstanding the fact that, apart from the 1988
increase in container handling tariffs, port tariffs and charges have
generally remained the same since 1982. However, rperation and maintenance
expenditures during 1986-89 have averaged only around 5 percent of annual
revenues, while the general benchmark for port maintenance is in the range of
nearly 25 percent of gross revenues. In the medium to long term, this
deferred maintenance may hinder the ability of GYCP to handle existing or
increased port activity and could impact negatively on the corporation's
financial viability. Since 1986, GCYP's working and operating ratios,
indicative measures of the corporation's efficiency, have continuously
declined.
2.25        Although GCYP maintains its accounts on an accrual basis, the
growth in port development and the acquisition of modern equipment have not
been matched by appropriate managerial or financial policies, particularly in
planning, budgeting and control. A cost and management accountant was
recruited in 1982 to establish a cost accounting system. However, the system
is not yet operational, with the result that the collection and analysis of
statistical and cost-related data is limited. Corporate planning needs to be
strengthened, and management information systems are needed to assist in the
evaluation of operational and financial performance and for appropriate
inventory control and cash management.
Technical assistance under the project would be provided to develop and
implement adequate financial management and accounting systems and procedures.



-19-
Operations and Maintenance
2.26        The expansion in port infrastructure has not been coupled wit'i
adequate maintenance management. Poor maintenance practices have impede_ the
operational efficiency of the container terminal. It is only because the
present traffic volumes are very low, and partly because some shippers prefer
utilizing their own handling equipment to clear cargo, that GCYP is able to
provide port services.   There is a shortage of skilled staff in container
terminal management and operations, particularly in engineering. The main
port workshops at Hodeidah and Aden have inadequate separation of activities
e.g., welding grinding and forge work is being carried out alongside major
engine overhaul work, without protection for dust and abrasive particles.
With the acquisition of modern cargo handling equipment, improved port
workshops, as well as storage facilities for an appropriate inventory of
essential spare parts, are needed. Through the proposed project, technical
assistance would be provided to develop a proper maintenance policy and
strategy; to make recommendations on workshop design, equipment and spare
parts; and to assist in designing a manpower development plan.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Setting
3.01        The proposed Harad-Huth Road improvements are a high priority item
in the Third Five-Year Plan (1987-91) and represent about 12 percent of all
proposed main road rehabilitation. The program of road investments under the
Third Plan is based on the North Highway Master Plan (para. 2.06), which
itself is based on sound economic principles already discussed and agreed to
with IDA. The project represents a continuing response to both the government
and IDA priority objectives in the highway subsector. These focus on
improving existing infrastructure and on training. In addition, the project
would address, under the overall coordination of MOC, the most urgent needs of
the civil aviation and ports subsectors by providing both with technical
assistance to develop and implement restructuring programs, and critical
equipment and spare parts.
B. Project Objectives
3.02        The project's main objectives include (i) improving access to
important agricultural areas; (ii) addressing the institutional needs and
improving the management of CAMA, GCYP and GCA; and (iii) supporting
transport sector training.



-20-
C. Descrigtion
3.03        To achieve its objectives, the project would include highway,
civil aviation and port components:
Highway Subsector
Civil works and construction supervision would be provided to improve
the 157 km Harad-Huth Road (para. 3.04); this would facilitate access to
important agricultural areas and create significant distance savings
between the northern regions of ROY and the port of Hodeidah, the Tihama
plain and Saudi Arabia. About 150 manmonths (4 engineers) of technical
assistance would be provided to GCRB to assist its staff in resolving
complex engineering problems, as well as to provide on-the-Job training
in modern road rehabilitation techniques. A team of two engineers
(construction and pavement specialists) would be assigned to each of
both working fronts (Harad and Huth).
Civil Aviation Subsector
Technical assistance (TA) in the form of a management contract with CAMA
would be provided to carry out a strategic development study which would
concentrate on writing job descriptions, improving cost accounting,
analyzing user charges, and improving airport efficiency. Funds
allocated to TA would cover the study (about 15 percent) as well as the
training (about 20 percent) of CAMA staff and the identification and
procurement of most urgently needed safety and meteorological equipment
(about 65 percent).
Port Subsector
Technical assistance in the form of a management contract or twinning
arrangement with GCYP would be provided to carry out a strategic
development study which would concentrate on establishing training
needs, improving port maintenance operations and policies, improving
GCYP's cost accounting system, and reviewing the linkages between port
and road traffic to ensure complementarity of transport needs.   Funds
allocated to TA would cover the study (about 20 percent), as well as the
training of GCYP's and GCMA's staff (about 15 percent) and the
identification and procurement of most urgently needed tools, spare
parts and equipment for maintenance (about 65 percent).
D. Engineering and Status of Project PreRaration
3.04        Detailed engineering of the Harad-Huth Road was originally carried
out in 1978 by the former North Highway Authority, with the assistance of
consultants (Sweden). The design and cost estimates were reviewed and updated
in end-1989 by a consultant financed under the Fifth Highway Project (Credit



-21-
1413-YAR). The road, which is presently a simple track (except for the 55 km
already upgraded to gravel level by GCRB), passes through sandy flat terrain
(Harad-Km 40) at sea level, followed by a granitic undulating section (km4O-
km85) and a rugged and basaltic section (km85-kml57) ending in Huth (kml57) at
an altitude of 1900 m. Good construction materials are easily available along
the alignment. Rainfall varies Crom 200 mm/year at Harad to 300 mm/year at
Huth. The maximum altitude reached by the road is 2,200m (km9O). The average
daily traffic is about 550 vehicles, mostly light 4 WD vehicles as road
conditions do not permit trucks except on the graveled 55 km. Once upgraded,
the road would have a 7.0 m wide paved carriageway with stabilized gravel
shoulders of 1.5 m. The pavement would consist of 15 cm of gravel sub-base,
15 cm of crushed rock base course, and 5 cm of asphaltic concrete wearing
course. The design standards for the road are satisfactory (Project File,
Annex l). The terms of reference for supervision of construction (Annex 10)
and the bidding documents for imported materials and equipment for the Harad-
Huth Road works have been completed by GCRB and were discussed and agreed to
at the negotiations. Drafts of the terms of reference for the CAMA and GCYP
strategic development studies were also discussed and agreed to at
negotiations (Annexes 11 and 12).
E. Cost Estimates
3.05        The estimated cost of the project, including contingencies,
amounts to US$43.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of about US$30.0
million or about 70 percent of the total cost. The costs of the different
project components are given in Table 3.1 below.

3.06        Construction cost estimates are based on quantities from final
engineering designs and on consultant's and GCRB's estimates of July 1990 unit
rates, checked against recent contract prices. The foreign cost component is
estimated from a breakdown of cost elements. The local costs include
estimated taxes and duties of about 2 percent of total costs. The project is
exempt from taxes and import duties.
3.07 Costs of technical assistance to GCRB (150 manmonths) are based on an
average cost of US$5,000 per mazmonth, while costs of supervision (180
manmonths) of the Harad-Huth Road works are based on an average cost of
US$7,200 per manmonth. These costs are in line with those of similar ongoing
operations in ROY. Costs for the technical assistance to carry out the CAMA
and GCYP/GCMA strategic development studies, as well as related training, are
based on an average of US$10,000 per manmonth. All technical assistance,
training and equipment costs are exempt from taxes and duties.
3.08        A physical contingency of 5 percent has been included for all
components, to cover possible increases in quantities. This amount is
appropriate given the precise engineering designs available for the Harad-
Huth Road works and the less than one percent deviation in quantities
experienced for ongoing works. Price escalation has been estimated assuming
rates of inflation for local and foreign costs for the period 1990-96 as
follows: local costs 20 percent p.a. during 1990-1992 and 15 percent p.a.
thereafter; foreign costs 3.6 percent p.a. for 1990-1996.
F. Project Financing
3.09        The Association would provide a credit of US$30.0 million
equivalent, leaving about US$13.0 million equivalent to be financed by the
Government. The proposed financing plan is shown in Table 3.2 below.

would be responsible for the overall management of the project through a five-
member Project Management Unit (PMU) within MOC and under the chairmanship of
H.E. the Minister of Construction. The members of the PMU would include the
aforementioned Chairman, the Vice-Minister of Transport, the Assistant Deputy
Minister for Planning and Project Programming of the Ministry of Planning and
Development, the Deputy Chairman of GCRB and the Deputy Chairman of CAMA. The
members would review and follow up procurement procedures and bidding
documents related to the project, monitor and coordinate project
implementation in every subsector, assemble in a quarterly report all
information related to project implementation, and establish direct contact
with IDA supervision missions. All these functions are compatible with and
related to the unit members' current functions, and, therefore, the Unit would
not represent any additional cost. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government on the establishment of PMU as a condition of credit
effectiveness.
3.11        Roadworks would be carried out under force account by GCRB with
the Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD) acting as executing agency, as
required by government regulations (MPD Organizational chart in Annex 13).
Consultants would be emp.oyed to assist MPD and GCRB in construction
supervision under terms And conditions acceptable to the Association. The
terms of reference for the supervision of works are presented in Annex 10.
Two contracts, MPD/GCRB and MPD/consultants would be signed for the
construction and supervision of road works. The CAMA and GCYP/GCMA studies



-25-
described in para 3.03 would be carried out by consultants. These studies, as
specified in the terms of reference presented in Annex 11 (CAMA) and Annex 12
(GCYP/GCMA), would not start before June 1991 in order to integrate possible
changes in scope resulting from the recent unification of Yemen. During
negotiations, agreements were reached with the Government on (i) the terms of
reference for the supervision of road works and the selection of respective
consultants in accordance with IDA Guidelines for the Use of Consultants; (ii)
the signing of the MPD/GCRB and MPD/consultants contracts by January 1, 1991;
and (iii) the completion of the CAMA and GCYP/GGMA studies by January 1, 1994
and the implementation of any recommendations by January 1, 1995.
3.12        Based on the transport sector implementation profiles in ROY and
on consultant estimates, it is expected that project roadworks would start in
January 1991 and would be completed by December 1993. The CAMA and GCYP/GCMA
technical assistance and training components would be implemented over a
period of six years.   The implementation schedule for individual project
activities is shown in Annex 14. The project completion date would be
December 31, 1996, and the proposed credit would be closed on June 30, 1997.
PMU would submit quarterly progress reports to the Association detailing the
implementation of the GCRB, CAMA and GCYP/GCMA project components; proposed
progress monitoring indicators are described in Annex 15. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Govern,ent on the project
implementation schedule, monitoring criteria and reporting arrangements.
H. Procurement
3.13        Procurement arrangements are siummarized in Table 3.3 below.
Procurement would be made in accordance with the Association procurement
guidelines for all IDA-financed components.

3.14        The construction of the Harad-Huth Road would be carried out by
GCRB under force account (para 3.11). This is the most efficient method of
construction due to the security problems in the area; it also takes advantage
of GCRB's experience with this type of work. Labor and local materials
(US$12.4 million) for the force account work would be entirely financed by the
Government (table 3.3). Equipment and imported materials (US$22.3 million)
needed for the execution of works would be procured through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with IDA procurement
guidelines. Contracts for equipment and materials, not exceeding US$100,000
each, would be procured through international shopping procedures based on the
comparison of three price quotations from at least two countries. The total
aggregate value of such contracts would not exceed US$1.6 million ($1.1
million for GCRB and $0.5 million for CAMA and GCYP).
3.15        Consultants' services for construction supervision (US$1.4
million), technical assistance to GCRB(US$0.8 million), and technical
assistance to CAMA and GCYP/GCHA(US$5.0 million) would be carried out by
qualified and experienced consultants selected and appointed in accordance



-27-
with the Association's Guidelines for the Use of consultants. The equipment
for CAMA and GCYP (para. 3.03), tentatively estimated at US$1.6 million each,
would be procured by the consultants providing technical assistance to these
organizations, in accordance with IDA procurement guidelines.
3.16        All contracts exceeding US$100,000 would be subject to prior
review and approval by the Association. During negotiations, agreement was
reached with the Government on all procurement arrangements.

3.18        Withdrawal applications would be fully documented.  Disbursement
contracts valued at US$100,000 or less (totalling about 20 percent of the
credit amount) would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE).
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that
documentation to support expenditures financed under SOEs would be maintained
by the Borrower and made available for review by IDA supervision missions, in
iddition to being audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Association.
3.19        To facilitate disbursements, the Association's share of the
project would be financed through a Special Azcount which would be opensd in
the Central Bank by the Borrower.  The authorized allocation for the Special
Account would be US$2.0 million, equivalent to about three months of project
foreign expenditures during the construction of the road. Funds for equipment
and materials would be withdrawn by the Borrower from the Special Account
after the approval of the ICB and/or international shopping procedures and
related contract awards by the Association. Replenishment for technical
assistance and for consultants for construction supervision would le made on
the basis of appropriate documentation. Replenishment of the Special Account
would follow IDA procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report would be submitted
to the Association for review and approval within six months of the end of
each fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government on the establishment, operation and auditing of the Special
Account.
3.20        A schedule of disbursements, based on a December 1990 projected
effectiveness date, is given in Table 3.4 below. While the regional
disbursement profile for highway projects indicates an eight-year disbursement
period, and the average disbursement period for all sectors in ROY is nine
years, the experience in the highway subsector in ROY has been far better.
The implementation of civil works under the Fourth and Sixth Highway Projects
(Credits 1267-YAR and 1726-YAR) was ahead of schedule by 2 years and 18
months, respectively. The two-year delay in completing civil works in the
Fifth Highway Project (Credit 1413-YAR), from three to five years, was due
almost entirely to the contractor's financial problems. However, the CAKA and
GCYP/GCMA components would need a longer implementation period, since IDA's
experience in these subsectors in ROY is limited. Given the above, it is
anticipated that the proposed project would be physically completed in six
years, or by December 31, 1996, and fully disbursed six months later, or by
June 30, 1997 (para 3.12).

J. Project Supervision
3.21        Two IDA supervision missions per year during the six years of
project implementation (January 1991 through December 1996) would suffice to
supervise all project activities. The missions would be staffed by a civil
engineer and one economist, responsible for all engineering and economic
aspects of the project. A financial analyst and a management expert would
join the missions during the implementation of the CAMA and GCYP/GC&A
components (1992-96).  The management expert and financial analyst would
advise the mission, MPU and MOT on the reforms identified in the CAMA and
GCYP/GCMA studies and on how to implement them. During 1995 and 1996, the
only project items to be supervised are the CAMA and GCYP/GCMA components.
Therefore, the engineer and the economist would reduce their participation to
one mission per year. One mission in 1997 would prepare the Project
Completion Report. At an average cost of US$5,000 per staff member per
mission, excluding salaries, and taking into account that two to three
projects would be supervised on average during each mission, the total IDA
cost for supervising the project (38 staff member missions) would be about
US$200,000. Detailed supervision forecasts and mission compositions are
presented in the project supervision plan of Annex 16.
K. Environment
3.22        Civil works are primarily confined to upgrading an existing
track/road. This should lead to a cleaner environment for the population
living in settlements along the road, as well as improve the delivery of
social services. The project would protect the areas adjacent to the road
from erosion through the construction of side drains, cross drainage
structures and retaining walls. No population resettlement would be necessary
since the right of way of the new road is clear of housing construction.
Furthermore, the road would be built within the public right-of-way for which
the Government has full ownership. The project will not affect any
archeological or historical sites. In recent years, the authorities have shown
a keen awareness of the need to protect the environment (the Sixth Highway
Project, Credit 1627-YAR, includes works to protect archaeological remains at
Marib).
L. Accounting and Auditing
3.23        GCRB keeps individual accounts for its construction and
maintenance divisions, and expenditures are recorded separately for each
project. In 1986, a new financial and cost accounting system to monitor
planned and actual expenditures was implemented. The most recent Project
Agreement (Credit 1848-YAR) provides for GCRB to submit an annual audit report
and financial statements within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
This arrangement, which is being complied with, would continue to be followed
under the proposed project. Annual audits would be carried out by independent
auditors acceptable to the Association.



-31-
3.24        Improving CAMA's accounting and financial procedures is one of the
objectives of the proposed project (para 3.03). Annual audits of CAMA's
accounts are carried out by the Central Accounting and Supervision
Organization of the Government. During negotiations, agreement was reached
with the Government that each year GAMA's accounts would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA and that annual financial statements
and audit reports would be submitted to IDA within six mon.hs of thte close of
each fiscal year.
3.25        GCYP and GCMA maintain their accounts on a commercial basis.
Accounting procedures for recording revenues, expenses, assets and
liabilities, are generally satisfactory. Some deficiencies exist (para 2.25),
but these would be addressed under the proposed strategic development study.
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that each year
GCYP's and GCMA's accounts would be audited by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA and that annual financial statements and audit reports would be
submitted to IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Introduction
4.01        The proposed project focuses on promoting economic activity
through road improvement and on making CAMA's, GCYP's and GCMA's operations
more cost-effective through studies, technical assistance, training and the
procurement of spare parts, tools and urgently needed equipment. The economic
rates of return (ERR) of technical assistance and training to GCRB, CAMA, GCYP
and GCMA, amounting to 5 percent of total costs, have not been determined
since their benefits are for the most part not quantifiable. However,
investments in technical assistance and training would enable the transport
sector agencies to raise the quality of their staff and operations, which
should result in lower operating costs and more reliable services.
B. Harad-Huth Road Imnrovement
4.02        The Harad-Huth Road is in the east-west corridor of the country,
connecting the Sana'a-Saada highway in the east at Huth and the Hodeidah-
Jizan international highway in the west near Harad. The road, which is 157 km
long and passes through rich agricultural areas in the Sana'a and the Hajjah
governorates, serves about 0.5 million people and constitutes a link
connecting the northern part of the country to the major port of Hodeidah.
4.03        The North Highway Master Plan (para. 2.06) has identified the
Harad-Huth Road as a top priority. About 55 km of the road have been
developed to gravel standards; the remaining parr is an earth road/track. It



-32-
is of interest to note that after the 55 km had been developed to gravel
standards, agricultural production alongside the road increased significantly
while the value of the land more than doubled. Regional ecGnomic activity is
based on agriculture. Qatv is the main cash crop at higher altitudes while
in the lower elevations, corresponding to the flat and rolling sections of the
road, cereals, vegetables and fruits are cultivated. The proposed road
upgrading would further promote and improve agriculture by providing better
market access and facilitating the delivery of inputs, including agricultural
extension services.
4.04        Available data for the traffic on the road near Huth show that the
average daily traffic (ADT) increased from 409 in 1986 to 469 in 1988, or an
average annual growth rate of 7 percent. According to three 24-hour traffic
counts in December 1989, the ADT on this road section jumped to 712. Such
traffic counts were also taken near other villages alongside the road and are
presented in the following table.

4.05        The majority of vehicles using the existing road are four-wheel
drive light trucks and pick-ups; with the proposed road improvement, a switch
to larger, more cost effective vehicles is expected to take place. For the
ERR calculations, it has been assumed that 25 percent of the four-wheel drive
light trucks/pickups would be converted into trucks at the ratio of one truck
for every five light trucks/pickups over a period of three years. Although
the aforementioned ADT statistics over the period 1986-89 indicate high growth
rates, the average annual growth rate of normal traffic is assumed to be 3

percent. This growth rate is based on an established relationship (verified
under the Highway Master Plan) between the growth of Gross National Product
(GNP) and that of traffic.
4.06        The project road runs east-west with no parallel asphalt road in
the north till the border with Saudi Arabia.  lTere is, therefore, the
possibility that some traffic would be diverted to the project road. However,
any estimation of the amount of diverted traffic may be subject to serious
error, particularly because of the difficult terrain ard the absence of
origin/destination matrices. 't is thus mere conservative to ignore the
possibility of diverted traffic for the purpose of establishing the ERR.
4.07        The increase in real estate values along road sections already
improved to gravel standards (para 4.03) indicates that generated traffic can
be expected. It is estimated that generated traffic would amount to
30 percent of normal traffic at the end of the third year, after the opening
of the new road.
4.08        In the feasibility study, benefits are limited to savings in
transport costs; no provision has been made for vehicle occupant journey-time
savings. Also, to be conservative, shadow pricing has not been applied to
foreign exchange or the cost of labor. The effect of road improvement on
economic activity has been evaluated through the proxy of traffic generated as
a result of reductions in vehicle operating costs; no additional benefits have
been included concerning increases in agricultural value added or increased
real estate values alongside the road. Vehicle operating costs have been
estimated using the methodology developed in the Highway Master Plan (para
2.06). This methodology assumes that vehicle operating costs are a function
of four primary factors: terrain, vehicle characteristics, price information,
vehicle running history; and one intermediate factor, speed.
4.09        The cost stream is based on the costs of construction shown in
Table 3.1 and includes technical assistance to GCRB, an annual maintenance
cost of about YR 4.0 million, and a periodic maintenance cost of about YR 64.0
million every three years. The costs of construction are about equally spread
over a period of three years, the time it takes to complete the construction
works. Assuming a salvage value of 50 percent of the original cost of
investment (at the end of the 15th year after the opening of the road) results
in an ERR of about 32 percent.



-34-
The first year rate of return (FYR) is approximately 29 percent. Several
sensitivity tests were applied to the results:
ERR         FY R
*      RWthout generated traffic         30%          28%
-     WiWh generaedW traffic,
20% hacease in costs, and 20%
decrease in beneft               26%           21%
-     Without generated traffic,
20% increase in costs
and 20% decrease in
benefits                          19%          23%
Economically, the investment is clearly viable.
4.10        Three main groups would benefit as a result of road investment:
(a)   The primary agricultural population living in the area
directly served by the road would not only profit from
improved and cheaper access to markets but would be better
placed to take advantage of agricultural extension services.
Furthermore, the population would also benefit from
improvements in the delivery of administrative and social
services.
(b)   Businesses in Huth would benefit from the increased economic
activity generated by the agricultural area; from a decline
in prices due to the cheaper transport of goods from
Hodeidah; and from the increase in the volume of traffic to
and from Saudi Arabia.
(c)   Road users in the northern regions of ROY would experience
very significant distance savings on journeys to Hodeidah.
The road investment would also have a positive impact on employment, providing
about 600 jobs during the 3-year construction period.
C. Project Risks
4.11        The proposed project is not expected to be subject to any unusual
risks.  The security risk of the road construction crew has been minimized
through the use of GCRB's labor force.  About half of the Harad-Huth Road is
in non-rugged terrain and presents few problems. The remaining 50 percent of
the road may contain some unforeseen difficulties, but any problems should
easily be covered by the physical contingencies and very detailed engineering
designs already available. There is a risk that not all the institutional
improvement objectives proposed for CAMA, GCYP and GOCA will be achieved.
However, the project's technical assistance component and the Government's



-35-
commitment to project objectives, as shown during preparation and
negotiations, should permit the implementation of proposed institutional
strengthening of CAMA, GCYP and GCMA within the project time frame. In
addition, proposed IDA supervision missions (para 3.21) would attempt to
minimize any such risk.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01        During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following:
(a)   GCRB would provide to the Association, starting in 1991, for its
review and comments by June 30 of each year until the completion
of the project, the annual work plan for road maintenance
operations. Each year thereafter, GCRB would carry out said
annual work plan, taking into account the Association's comments
thereon (para. 2.07);
(b)   GCRB would provide to the Association, by March 31, 1992, an
analysis of the type of cargo and trucking organizations in which
overloading of vehicles most frequently occurs and would discuss
with the Association recommendations for a program to enforce
axle-load limits. The Borrower would implement, by June 30, 1992,
or such later date as the Association established, a program
satisfactory to the Association for enforcing axle-load limits
(para 2.08);
(c)   The Borrower would exchange views with the Association, by
December 31, 1991, on a plan for the gradual reduction of
restrictive practices in the road-freight transport industry.
Thereafter, on the basis of said exchange of views, the Borrower
would implement such a plan in accordance with a schedule agreed
to by the Borrower and the Association (para. 2.13);
(d)   (i) the terms of reference for the supervision of road works, the
CAMA study, and the GCYP study, as well as the selection of
respective consultants in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants; (ii) the signing of MPD/GCRB and
MPD/Consultant contracts by January 1, 1991; and (iii) the
completion of the CAMA and GYCP/GCMA studies by January 1, 1994
and the implementation of their recommendations by January 1, 1995
(para. 3.11);
(e)   a project implementation schedule,, monitoring criteria and
reporting arrangements (para 3.12);
(f)   procurement arrangements (para 3.16);
(g)   documentation to support expenditures financed by SOE (para.
3.18);



-36-
(h)   the establishment of the Special Account and its operation; audit
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; and submission of the
audit report for IDA review and approval within six months of the
end of each fiscal year (para. 3.19); and
(i)   the audit of GCRB's, CAMA's and GCYP's annual financial statements
and accounts by independent auditors acceptable to the Association
and the submission of the audit reports within six months of the
close of each fiscal year (paras. 3.23, and 3.24 and 3.25).
5.02        The establishment of a five-member Project Management Unit in the
Ministry of Construction under the chairmanship of the Minister of
Construction would be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed credit
(para. 3.10). The five members would be Chairman, the Vice-Minister of
Transport, the Assistant Deputy Minister for Planning and Project Programming,
the Deputy Chairman of GCRB and the Deputy Chairman of CAMA.
5.03        Agreements having been reached on the issues presented in Chapters
II and III of this report, (and sumarized in paragraph 5.01 above), and
subject to the condition of effectiveness set forth in paragraph 3.10, the
project is suitable for a credit of SDR 22.7 million (US$30.0 million
equivalent) to the Government of the Republic of Yemen at standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
MULTI-MODE TRANSPORT PROJECT
CIVIL AVIATION AND METEOROLOGICAL AUTHORITY
Introduction
1.01        The Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) is a semi-
autonomous organization under the overall control of the Ministry of
Transport. On financial matters, however, CAMA reports to the Ministry of
Finance. The headquarters of CAMA are in Sana'a. CAMA operates five
international airports (Sana'a, Aden, Hodeidah, Taiz and Riyan), twelve
domestic airports, provides meteorological facilities and information and is
also responsible for civil aviation regulation, security, certification and
licensing. Although CAMA was established as a financially autonomous body
deriving its income from user fees, it operates very much as a government
department. CANA has suffered in recent years from a rapid turn over in top
management positions. CAMA employs about 1,300 staff.
1.02        The country's rugged mountainous terrain, the desert and the long
distances make surface transportation time consuming and difficult.
Consequently, the Government has placed increased emphasis on air transport
for both domestic and international communications. During 1984-88 air
traffic to the capital city of Sana'a increased by 8 percent annually. Since
1973, the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has
provided two permanent Advisor/Project Managers to CAMA, in Sana'a and in
Aden, and there have been a series of projects covering many aspects of civil
aviation.
The Airports
2.01        The five international airports are in the capital city of Sana'a,
Aden and Hodeidah (the two main seaports and most populated cities after the
capital), Taiz and Riyan. The Riyan Airport serves the city of Mukalla, 25 km
to the West and the Hadramawt Region.
2.02        Sana'a airRort:  The single runway is 3,252m long by 45m wide (no
shoulders) at an altitude of 7,237 feet. There is a 23m parallel taxiway with
two high speed turn offs and other access taxiways with no holding bays.
There are four separate apron areas for passenger, freight, airline
maintenance and the military.  The pa&senger apron is 920m by 150m and has
floodlights. The flexible asphalt runway is in good condition but excessive
rubber deposits require urgent removal and markings need renewing. Category
1, ILS approach lighting is installed on runway 18 with high and low intensity



- 46-                         ANNE  8
Page 2 of 6
runway edge lights. Some of the taxiways show cracking but the aprons are in
good condition. During the rainy season, there is extensive flooding and
drainage work is required to alleviate the problem.
2.03        The terminal building was originally constructed in 1977.  The
basic structure is a two storey prefabricated steel frame building which has
been extended several times. Although still in good condition, during peak
periods the baggage retrieval/customs and check-in/departure areas become very
congested. A 400 slot car park was recently completed. The control tower is
34.5m above ground level and is a combined military/civil aviation facility.
The consoles are in good operating condition and reliable. Associated with
the terminal building are: a crash/fire/rescue station; a meteorological
facility; two VIP buildings; a maintenance complex; a freight hangar; an
airline maintenance hangar; and a fuelling facility.
2.04        Most of the electronic equipment is in good condition.  Approach
control is adequately equipped with HP, VHF, AFTN, and direct speech
communications. There is an excess of radio navigation equipment since
Category 1 ILS, DME and VOR will satisfy requirements, though the TACAN and
NDB may be required for military use. Uninterruptable power supplies are
provided for essential navigation, VHF communication and other equipment. For
general airport use, there are two stand-by generators (500 KVA each)
operating satisfactorily.
2.05        Aden Airgort:  The single runway is 3,100m long by 45m wide at an
altitude of 4 meters. There is a parallel taxiway. The apron (1,000 feet x
1,000 feet) is made of bitumen and concrete and has floodlights. The flexible
asphalt runway has been strengthened with an overlay but has shown in the last
three years signs of cracks and unevenness. The apron capacity is sufficient
to cope with present and future traffic but has problems of drainage in some
parts.
2.06        The airport is efficient from an aircraft operating point of view
within the confines of generally old Air Traffic Control building and
communication equipment. The terminal building has been recently inaugurated
and has adequate capacity to cope with future traffic. The passenger terminal
is new and equipped with good passenger facilities. However, crash, fire and
rescue equipment is barely minimum. The air traffic building and
communication aids are old. A new technical building has been designed but is
awaiting funds for execution.
2.07        Hodeidah Airport:  The runway is 3,000m by 45m wide with 10m
shoulders and is equipped with high and low intensity edge lights and a VASI
system at both ends. A link taxiway of 400m by 23m leads to a floodlit apron
of 220m by 220m. All of the pavements are in good condition but markings need
renewing and the edge lighting needs considerable work. The two storey steel
frame terminal building is almost new and has a 180 slot parking area.
Associated with the terminal building is: a control tower built in 1978
(which needs renovating and air-conditioning in addition to the consoles which



- 47 *                        AMN  at
Page 3 of 6
are obsolete and should be replaced); a CFR station and adjacent electrical
station; a freight hangar; and a VIP building.
2.08        Electronic equipment at Hodeidah suffers from the effects of the
harsh climate and is difficult to maintain. The VOR/DIE antenna is
functioning marginally. The NDB and VHF primary and stand-by communications
are functioning satisfactorily. Adequate stand-by electrical power is
provided by two 330KVA generators.
2.09        Taiz Aixrort:  The runway is 3,000m by 45m wide with no shoulders.
A link taxiway of 200m by 23m, which does not have shoulders, leads to an
apron of 150m by 90m. All of the paved surfaces are in good condition but the
runway has approach obstructions and the orientatio-n is poor. CAMA plans to
construct a new runway at some point in the future. The two storey concrete
structure terminal building, which was built in 1967, has been extended
several times and a further extension of the building is planned. There is a
new parking area with 80 slots. Associated with the terminal building are:
a control tower with consoles that need replacing; a CFR station with two
separate buildings; a freight hangar built in 1981; and, an electrical station
built in 1967, in poor condition, equipped with 3 250 KVA each and 2 100 KVA
each generators. However, despite the high installed capacity due to
switching the available output is limited to 185 KVA.
2.10        Electronic equipment consists of a VOR/DME in good condition which
could be upgraded, an NDB which requires repair, VHF primary and stand-by
communications.
2.11        Riyan Airport:  Riyan airport is located 23km east of Nukalla city
and it was opened in May 1982. The runway is 3,049m by 46m with stopways of
61m at each end. A link taxiway leads to a flood lit concrete apron. All the
pavements are in good condition. Communication and navigational equipment are
relatively sufficient. The fire vehicles are barely to minimum requirements.
The terminal building is insufficient to cope with present traffic. Any
substantial increase in traffic would require an extension to the terminal
building.
2.12        Domestic Airports:  There are twelve domestic airports managed by
CAMA in the ROY namely: Saadah, Al-Boqa, Marib, Al-Jawf (Al Hazm), Al Beida,
Sayun, Qishn, Al-Gheidha, Ataq, Beihan, Mukayras and Suqatra.  With the
exception of Al-Gheidha and Attaq, all the runways, taxiways and aprons at the
domestic airports are unpaved. None of the airports possesses a lighting
system. No communication or navigational or fire vehicles exist at Ataq,
Mukayras and Qishn. Most of the terminal buildings are in sound condition but
roof maintenance is required on a few buildings.

Management and Operations
3.01        CAMA's activities include:  air traffic services, aeronautical
communications and operations, aeronautical information services, aviation
security, aerodrome emergency services, technical services, aerodrome
engineering contracts, flight operations, airworthiness, air transport,
international and domestic airports and meteorological services.
3.02        Decision making has generally rested with the chairman.  The lack
of decentralization of authority has impeded effective and efficient
operations and has resulted in many needs remaining unfulfilled. CAMA's
organizational structure needs to be revised to reflect appropriate
operational departments, their responsibilities and reporting requirements.
CAMA has already designed a new organizational structure but the plan has yet
to be developed or implemented. A major problem in CAMA is over-staffing,
particularly in the clerical and services side coupled with inadequately
skilled and experienced staff. In line with normal public service recruitment
policies, it is -irtually impossible to dismiss employees, which poses
managerial and efficiency problems.
3.03        Aviation operations are fairly well managed by CAMA both in Sana'a
and at the other airports. Airport maintenance still remains a major problem.
The maintenance of civil works, buildings and similar infrastructure has been
deferred in many instances. However the problem is more critical for the
maintenance of electronic and CFR equipment which in many cases cannot be
deferred for safety and other reasons. Fortunately, much of the air
navigation electronic equipment is maintained through contractors and
suppliers that have typically been financed by foreign aid. CAMA needs to
strergthen its ability to carry out adequate maintenance of electronic
equipment and CFR vehicles. In general, maintenance staffing is adequate
(though there are too many electronic staff at Sana'a) and most have received
at least basic training. Additional specialized training is needed but the
lack of an overall maintenance management approach is more important.
National Avlation Training Institute
4.01        CAMA operates two staff training schools which are located at
Sana'a and Aden airports. A number of courses such as English, air traffic
control and CFR operations are held from time to time on an ad ho basis.
CAMA intends to strengthen the schools' curriculum to provide a much wider
range of basic training needs for its staff. An extension of the existing
buildings to include a library and additional teaching space is planned during
1991. Currently, the schools lack the necessary cadre of instructors and
staff, as well as equipment to be able to expand its operations. Moreover,
there is neither a specific operating budget nor has a comprehensive training
program been developed. The concentration of training in one school is also
being considered in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of facilities.

Financial Status
5.01 Financial management is limited to the recording of cash receipts and
expenditures. Revenue receipts are passed on to the Government as part of
general revenut, and expenditures are paid from Government budgetary
allocations. There is no real cash flow or financial management undertaken
except for the adherence to budgetary guidelines for which quarterly reports
are produced. Although the accounting procedures include the calculation of a
form of notional depreciation on an annual basis, this is not part of the
budgetary process. In addition to an unstructured cost recovery policy,
preventive maintenance is largely outside the budgetary process, and
procurement and inventory management and control are not linked to CAMA's
needs. The table below provides an overview of CAMA's revenues and
expenditures fer 1986-89.

On the face of it, CAMA (North) appears to just about break even. However,
there are large, overdue accounts receivables totaling some YR 25 million.
Secondly, debt service obligations are not adequately reflected in the
accounts. Airport related long-term debt is administered by the Central Bank,
including foreign loans. CAMA (South) has been incurring losses.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
MULTI-MODE TRANSPORT PROJECT
PORTS AND MARINE AFFAIRS CORPORATIONS
Introduction
1.01        The General Corporation of Yemen Ports (GCYP) and the General
Corporation for Marine Affairs (GCMA) are two semi-autonomous and complementary
agencies with full administrative and financial responsibilities operating under
the Ministry of Transport (MOT). The headquarters of GCYP and GCMA are in Sana'a
with operational branches in all the ports.   GCYP is responsible for the
operation of the principal ports in the country: Hodeidah, (including Ras Al
Katif, navy port), Aden (including the oil port), Mukha, Salif, Mukalla and
Nishtun.   Since their recent separation from the GCYP under the former Ports
and Marine Affairs Corporation, the GCMA is responsible for the provision of
navigation aides, maritime pollution control, marine safety and other related
tasks. The responsibilities, scope of operations and assets of GCYP and to a
lesser degree of GCMA, have increased manyfold since their inception,
particularly since the unification of Yemen, and it is evident that the
establishing acts need to be revised in the light of present day needs.  In
addition, the structure of the board and management of GCYP needs to reflect
the users of the ports and the need for efficient management of the various
activities.    Major  strengthening  is required  in management,  operations,
maintenance and financial control to improve the capacity of the ports and the
quality of service. In particular, equipment and infrastructure maintenance is
seriously inadequate.
The Ports
1.02        Hodeidah is the main port of the North.  It handled about 2 million
tonnes of traffic (dry cargo) in 1989. It has seven berths, two of which form
a container terminal equipped with two quayside gantry cranes and six straddle
carriers.   Cereals imports are discharged from the general cargo berths to
adjacent silos. Waterdepths alongside vary from 7.6m to 10m. Within the port
area is a small petroleum products import terminal with a depth of 10m which can
handle ships of 16,000dwt max. The port is approached through a 9km dredged
channel of 10m depth and 100m bottom width. Vessels turn using tugs within the
port area which is constricted by the petroleum terminal. The port has general
cargo transit sheds, a cold store, a general purpose and a straddle carrier
workshop and an administration building. Other facilities include a 500 ton
slipway, a 24 inch cutter-suction dredger (undergoing rehabilitation), two tugs,
pilot boats and mooring boat.   Some 5km south of the commercial port is a
recently completed major fishing port.

ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 5
1.03        Aden is the main port of the South and handled about 900,000 tonnes
of traffic in 1989.   The port consists of an outer and inner harbour both
sheltered.  The outer harbour offers good anchorage for vessels waiting to berth
in the inner harbour. The inror harbour, enclosed by breakwaters, is dredged,
to depths between 5.5m and 12.8m. The port is approached through a 5km dredged
channel with a depth of ll.9m and 180m bottom width. Vessels may secure to a
total of 32 buoys and dolphins.   Additional wharfage of 244 m with depth
alongside of 5.5m is also available.   There are also four berths available
capable of accommodating tankers up to 55,000dwt. The port includes a covered
storage of about 35,000 sq.m. and open storage over 100,000sq.m. The equipment
mainly consists of lx3Ot floating crane, lx25t floating crane, 18 mobile cranes
of up to 20t and various other handling equipment. Seven tugs of 1,500hp are
available. Most of the equipment is old and inefficient with availability of
less chan 40 percent. An ongoing Aden Port Extension Project totalling about
US$60 million includes among others, a Ro-Ro berth, berths 1,2 for containers
and two additional berths 3,4 for general cargo, all close to completion. The
project will also finance considerable amount of new equipment including two
containers gantry cranes, six mobile cranes and about fourteen for forklifts.
1.04        Mukha comprises a breakwater, two berths and buoy berth for tankers.
Siltation of the port area has occurred since construction in 1979, limiting its
use. The port is very important to the rich Taiz region, but because of lack
of facilities, Taiz is mainly served through Hodeidah port. No bunkerage is
available at Mukha.
1.05        Port development in Al Salif comprises a bulk salt export facility
currently being rehabilitated. When operational, 50,000dwt vessels can load at
1,000 tons per hour in 16m of water - a potential annual throughput capacity of
about 1 million tons. There is a 300 foot general purpose berth which has been
used for vehicle and other imports in the past. Just to the north of the bulk
facility is a private installation for the import of cement in bulk consisting
of a floating pontoon, ship unloader and adjacent silos. Recently, the Yemen
Hunt Oil Company has installed a floating storage and crude oil export facility
in deep water at Ras Isa near to Al Salif.   The facility is based on a
permanently moored 650,000dwt VLCC coupled to the shore via a submerged pipeline.
GCYP has a small office on the shore near to the facility. All operations are
managed by the oil company including tug service and pilotage, though the
facility is the responsibility of GCYP. Berthing problems have arisen due to
swell which results in ship waiting.  The facility may be relocated to more
sheltered water.
1.06        Mukalla port includes two alongside berths for vessels up to
17,000dwt. Development of the port is underway with the construction of transit
sheds and offices. Water and bunkering facilities are not available. The port
includes a large anchorage area within one mile from shore for discharging into
lighters which is highly used. The port also has some facilities for fishing
vessels, including a fish processing plant and cold store. Equipment includes
14 mobile cranes of 3t to lot capacity.



- 53 -
ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 5
1.07        The Nishtun port is a small port mainly for the service of fishing
vessels. It includes a commercial quay 220m long of which 125m is suitable for
vessels up to 3,000dwt and Sm deep. The remaining part of the quay is allocated
exclusively to fishing vessels and dhows. Two small mobile cranes and five fork
lifts are available.
Management Operations
1.08        The growth in port development and the acquisition of equipment have
not been matched by appropriate developments in management, staffing, training
and financial control. It is only because the present traffic volumes are very
low that GCYP has been able to provide an adequate service.   It would be
impossible for Hodeidah and Aden to develop their potential capacities today
because of very poor equipment and infrastructure maintenance management and
practices. The low level of productivity is linked to inadequate management and
the absence of clearly stated objectives and accountability. There is also a
shortage of technical staff, particularly in engineering.   A major manpower
development plan is needed with a progressive implementation to address the
entire organization. It will be essential for foreign technical assistance to
assist GCYP in the short term and to develop and implement a comprehensive
training program.
Infrastructure and Eauipment
1.09        The two main ports of Hodeidah and Aden have adequate capacity in
terms of berths and equipment, provided they are fully operational. In Hodeidah,
the newly completed container terminal (berths 6 and 7) is equipped with two
quayside container gantry cranes, six straddle carriers, fork lifts, tractors
and trailers and has a workshop building specifically designed for straddle
carrier maintenance. There are ample paved areas for stacking full containers
and unpaved areas for stacking empty containers. However, generally throughout
the port, there is evidence of poor maintenance: the port working surfaces are
potholed and strewn with debris, the roofs of sheds and stores have sheeting
missing, and the coping of the older berths is fractured and dangerous. In Aden,
the recently completed Ro Ro berth, the container terminal (berths 1 and 2), and
the additional berths 3 and 4 for general cargo will be equipped with two
containers gantry cranes, one heavy lift mobile crane, four straddle carriers
and fourteen fork lifts, some of them already delivered. However, the workshops
are dirty, disorganized and dangerous, and management control virtually non-
existent.
1.10        The entrance channel and the port of Mukha require frequent dredging
to maintain navigation depths. GCYP has a 24 inch cutter suction dredger in poor
condition; however, this dredger is unsuitable for GCYP needs and 500m3 trailing
suction hopper dredger is being purchased from the Netherlands. Similar to the
cargo handling equipment, maintenance of floating craft is poorly managed and
GCYP presently lacks expertise in dredging. Technical assistance is essential
in this field.



- 54 -
Page 4 of 5
1.11        The infrastructure in the port of Iukalla and in the small port of
Nishtun is adequate to the needs. However, the operational management of the
cargo handling in both ports and the fishing operations in Nishtun need of
considerable improvement.
Other Activities
1.12        GCHA is currently undertaking a major program for the establishment
of navigation aids along the ROY coastline. The increased maritime activity
associated with the Ras Isa crude oil export terminal has led to a need for more
lights,  especially on the offshore  islands.   Some  17 lights are under
construction or completed. The Ras Isa terminal, although operated entirely by
the Yemeni Hunt Oil Company, is the responsibility of GCMP and GCKA and
substantial revenues are derived from the users. The Government is concerned
at the possibility of a major oil spill and GCMA is considering how to provide
equipment and a trained crew to be on standby for such an emergency.
Accounting and Finance
1.13        GCYP maintains its accounts on an accrual basis.  Accounts are
generally kept in an orderly manner and produced within a reasonable amount of
time. At prescnt, all accounting and financial systems are on a manual basis.
A cost and management accountant was recruited in 1982 to establish a cost
accounting system. However, the system is not operational, with the result that
the collection and analysis of statistical and cost-related data is limited.
The position of Finance Director has been vacant for some time though an Acting
Director has been appointed.
1.14        The adoption of modern port managerial and financial/accounting
policies and practices, particularly in the areas of planning, budgeting and
control have not kept pace with the rapid expansion of port operations. This
is particularly evident in the lack of adequate corporate planning and management
information systems to assist in the evaluation of operational and financial
performance, and in appropriate inventory control and cash management. Technical
assistance and training is needed to: (i) strengthen general accounting methods
and procedures; (ii) develop and implement a cost accounting system; (iii)
establish management information and inventory control systems; and (iv) assess
training requirements and develop a comprehensive training program in financial
management over the medium term.

I.    Introduction
Recent studies by the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority
(CAMA), a semi-autonomous ager-ay of the Ministry of Transport, have
highlighted the need for improving the skills of its staff and of upgrading
certain practices, particularly the managing and controlling of the budget.
CAMA is responsible for the operation of five international and twelve
domestic airports, as well as administering civil aviation regulations and
providing weather forecasts. CAMA has, therefore, decided to engage a
consulting firm to review, recommend, and install systems for the effective
and efficient conduct of its financial management related to the operation of
the aforementioned airports and civil aviation regulation. Particular
attention should be paid to the determination of job descriptions related to
financial management, the establishment of cost centers and the review of
tariffs with a view to covering the costs of operations, maintenance and debt
service or depreciation (whichever is greater) by revenues within a realistic
time frame.
II.   Objectives
The consultancy services would, for the operation of the seventeen
airports and activities related to civil aviation:
(a)   review existing management job description and prepare
financial management job description;
(b)   establish the principles of accountability and financial
goals through linking budgets with improvements in
productivity, more efficient operations, cost analyses
results and cost recovery methods;
(c)   establish a pricing policy for various services rendered by
CAMA that would lead within a realistic time frame, to (i)
the full recovery of the cost of operations, maintenance
(including training), and debt service or depreciation
(whichever is greater); and (ii) satisfactory levels of
profitability through a system of competitive tariffs/user
charges;

(d)   provide on the job training to financial staff;
(e)   assist CAMA with the implementation of the study's
recommendations;
(f)   assist CAMA in arranging in-house and out-house training for
its staff; and
(g)   assist CAMA in the procurement of equipment.
III. Scope of Work
A.    General
The consultants would perform all studies, economic, statistical
and financial analyses, and operational investigations and related works
herein described to achieve the objectives set forth in Section II above. In
the conduct of this work, the consultants would cooperate fully with CAMA, and
the Ministry of Transport of the Government of the Republic of Yemen (ROY) and
other relevant authorities. CAMA would provide the data, studies and reports
available, transportation and office facilities. The consultants would review
in detail the foregoing data, studies and reports, and make use of them as
deemed necessary. The consultants would be solely responsible, however, for
the analyses and interpretation of all data received; for the findings,
conclusions, and recommendations made by them; and for the implementation of
approved plans, programs, systems, methods and procedures. Since accounting
and statistical data are maintained by CAMA in the Arabic language and also
since discussions within CAMA are normally held in Arabic, it is important
that some members of the consultants' team assigned to the field work be
proficient in Arabic. The study would be financed by a credit from the
International Development Agency (IDA).
B.    Organization
Consultants would analyze all available data on the objectives,
organization and responsibilities of CAMA and would:
(a)   review functional authority and responsibility for each
level of management and make recommendations for
decentralization, where necessary, of the management
process; and
(b)   compile financial management, and accounting job
classifications and job descriptions, identifying the duties
and responsibilities of each position and the minimum
qualifications required.



- 62 -
Page 3 of 5
C.    Flnancial Planning and General and Cost Accounting
The consultants would conduct detailed studies of the financial
planning, controls, and cost accounting, and would in particular:
(a)   develop and implement the concept of financial goals and the
setting of operational objectives in the form of operating
expense budgets (both annual and multi-year) and related
policies, procedures and analytic techniques to stimulate
improvements in productivity, cost recovery and
profitability through effective task management methods and
cost controls;
(b)   develop and implement capital expenditure budgets (both
annual and multi-year) and related analytical techniques to
ensure proper justifications of construction programs and
other physical assets acquisitions;
(c)   establish guidelines to distinguish between capital and
recurrent items;
(d)   develop and implement (i) a cost accounting plan and cost
accounts classifications, detailing departmental accounts,
cost center layouts, allocation methods, etc.; and (ii)
related policies, procedures, and definitions such that a
clear identification and allocation of costs and revenues by
location and activity is provided;
(e)   implement the use of analytical techniques for the proper
evaluation of operational performance in terms of units of
activities and financial goals;
(f)   based on existing user charge system, make recommendations
for its improvement and related pricing and leasing policies
so that within a realistic time frame the resultant revenues
would be enough to cover all operating and maintenance
costs, overheads (administrative expenses) and the larger of
depreciation or debt service in addition to making a
contribution to future expansion from CAMA's own funds!/;
(g)   recommend and install an organization structure for the most
efficient conduct of the accounting and finance functions;
and
This would entail monitoring in detail the level of structure and
competitiveness of user charges such as landing fees, fuel tax,
departure tax, building space rentals for airline and commercial
occupants, concession fees, lease rentals, poster advertising space
rentals, etc.; and the level of profitability of each item, including a
study of the scope for possible revisions of the structure, and levels
of user charges and other possible forms of new revenues, such as, for
example, air safety tax, etc.



- 63 -
ANX11
Page 4 of 5
(h)   recommend and install personal computers for financial
management, collection of statistics and inventory control.
D.    Training and D6velopment of Staff
The consultants would:
(a)   Review and comment on the in-house and outside training
programs identified by CAMAV;
(b) identify additional skills required for the implementation
of the program for the coordination of activities identified
in the Organizational and Financial Planning studies
(Sections B and C above); and
(c)   Assist CAMA in arranging in-house and out-house trainiAg
programs for its staff. The selectioni and appointment of
consultants for training will be in accordance with IDA
guidelines.

safety and meteorological equipment. This procurement will be in
accordance with IDA guidelines.
It is envisaged that the contract to be signed vith the
consultants will include a certain amount of money necessary for this
procurement as well as the training of CAMA staff (section D above).
About 15 percent of the financing made available by IDA is for carrying
out the studies described under sections B and C, about 20 percent for
training (in-house training by consultants and training abroad), and 65
percent for the procurement of safety and meteorological equipment.
F.    Time Schedule for Consultancy Services and Reports
The consultants would prepare and submit the following reports
within the time limits indicated below:
(a)   an Inception Report, in English, within two months of the
starting date summarizing the initial findings of the
consultants, and listing the proposals, plans, programs and

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
MULTI - MODE TRANSPORT PROJECT
PORT SECTOR STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT STUDY
TERMS OF REFERENCE
I.    Introduction
Since the unification of the Republic of Yemen, the eight ports of Aden,
Little Aden (oil harbor), El Mukala, Nishtun, Hodeidah, Mukha, Ras El Kathib,
Al Salif, and the Ras Isa oil terminal, located on the Red Sea coast, are
operated under the General Corporation of Yemen Ports (GCYP), a semi-
autonomous agency of the Ministry of Transport. The General Corporation for
Marine Affairs (GCMA), a semi-autonomous agency under the Ministry of
Transport, is responsible for the mar.agement of the Yemeni littoral including
safety of access to ports and of navigation (light towers), and management of
the marine environment. The main ports are at Hodeidah which has seven
berths, two of which form a fully equipped container terminal, and Aden with
one long berth.
The rapid development of these ports - particularly Hodeidah - and the
acquisition of additional berths and stacking areas, container quayside gantry
cranes, straddle carriers, a 75 ton floating crane, forklifts, various tugs
and a 200 ton slipway has not been matched by the development of the two
agencies of the port sector (GCYP and GCMA) technical, operational and
financial/accounting staff needs through adequate recruitment. The Ministry
of Transport proposes to employ consultants to (a) undertake a study of
staffing needs and development program, (b) to undertake an equipment
maintenance study, (c) to undertake a GCYP economic/financial study and (d) to
assist the port sector with the procurement of maintenance tools/equipment.
II.    Manpower Development Program:
A two-tiered manpower development program over a two year period is
proposed. In a two-tiered system, an overall training specialist is employed
to identify the needs, design , supervise, control and manage specialist
firms, port authority personnel or other experts engaged under contract to
provide the training and advisory functions. In this way, there is a much
greater chance of the program being successful and achieving the manpower
development required.
Scoge of Work:
The task can be divided into four distinct phases.



-66-                         AM    12
Page 2 of 9
Phase
The tasks to be carried out within this phase are:
(a)   Through discussion with officials of the port sector and
with the consultants' experience, identify the most
appropriate organizational structure for the port sector,
i.e. GCYP and GOHA, in all their fields of activity. This
structure would present the numbers of staff required today
for each activity and the numbers that are estimated to be
required by the year 2000.
(b)   Based on (a) above, establish the total recruitment and
training needs, showing the numbers of persons to be
recruited and/or trained in each category, the length and
location of the courses, the number of courses needed and
overall time framework within the two year period.
The main activities for which the port sector requires manpower
development are:
-     Container terminal management, control, documentation
and operations.
-     Stevedoring/cargo handling equipment operations,
compilation of statistical and productivity data.
-    Administration, computer operation, record keeping,
personnel management.
-     General and cost accounting procedures, financial
planning and budgetary control.
=    The development of a management information system
(MIS) for operations and maintenance activities,
inventory control.
-     Port infrastructure maintenance and equipment.
-     Signalization installation, operation and maintenance.
(c)   Based on (a) and (b) above, establish the need for technical
assistance for the port sector, showing the extent in terms
of specialization, time periods and the timing in the
overall program period.
(d)   To identify Yemen schools, technical colleges or vocational
training centers (Aden) which can be used to provide part of
the training needs and to show how these institutions can be
made to fit with the overall training program.
(a)   To make recommendations concerning the need for the port
sector to create a simple training facility for in-house
training purposes.
(f)   To present estimated costs for the entire program broken
down into appropriate contract packages to be costed
separately.



-67-                          ANNEX 12
Page 3 of 9
(g)   To prepare reports:  on completion of the Phase 1 tasks, the
consultant will submit a report on the findings and
recommendations to the Chairmen of the GCYP and GCNA, and
IDA. This report shall be submitted within two months from
the start of the assignment, and a final report, including
an executive summary and incorporating the comments from the
Yemen authorities and IDA, shall be submitted within three
months of the start of the assignment.
Phase 2:
Once the Phase 1 report has been agreed upon and the manpower
development program approved, the following work is to be carried
out as phase 2:
(a)   To prepare a detailed plan of the training (TRG) and
technical assistance (TA) needs for each course or
intervention in terms of:
TRG   Entry requirements for course participants
Course location
Course duration
Number of participants per course
Course level and content
Testing or evaluation procedures
TA    Qualifications of experts required
Task and location
Task length
Evaluation procedures to assess the success of the TA
intervention.
(b)   To prepare a detailed plan of the training (TRG) and
technical assistance (TA) needs for each course or
intervention. Costs to include fees, estimated travel and
subsistence costs in both local and foreign currencies.
(c)   To prepare the necessary documents to enable the port sector
to invite priced proposals from suitable firms , port
authorities or other organizations suitably qualified to
carry out each course or intervention. The proposals should
attempt to package similar types of courses or interventions
whenever possible. IDA guidelines concerning the
appointment of consultants should be followed in the
preparation of these documents.
(d)   On behalf of the GCYP and GMCA, to issue invitations to
selected firms, port authorities or other organizations,
using the documents prepared in Phase 2 (c) above. The
selection process to be in accordance with IDA guidelines.
(e)   To evaluate the proposals received in terms of ability,
staffing, organization and costs, and other relevant
criteria; and in a report to the officials of the port
sector, to make recommendations on the appointment or award



-68-                         ANNEX 12
Page 4 of 9
of contract to the various firms or organizations to carry
out the implementation of the manpower development program.
(f)   To prepare reports:  on completion of the Phase 2 task, the
consultants should re-submit their estimated costs of the
entire program based on the priced proposals received and
their recommendations concerning award. Any changes in the
manpower development program resulting from the evaluation
process of the proposals should also be indicated and a
revised program submitted.
Phase 3:
Once the recommendations and final manpower development program in Phase
2 have been agreed upon by GCYP, GCMA and IDA, the consultants should assist
in drawing up the necessary contract documents to enable GCYP and GCMA to
engage the firms and organizations to implement the program.
Once the implementation commences, the consultant will supervise and
control the activities of these firms and organizations on behalf of GCYP,
GCMA and IDA to ensure that:
(a)   the firms or organizations implementing the program are
performing satisfactorily;
(b)   their methods and staff are appropriate;
(c)   there is a real transfer of skills or technology;
(d)   during the TRG courses, the recruited or selected staff
participants are making satisfactory progress and where
unsatisfactory, recommend their rejection and replacement;
(e)   testing or evaluating procedures are imposed at mid-term
and/or at the end of TRG courses or TA interventions to
determine the numbers of successfully trained participants,
or the adequacy of the TA intervention; and
(f)   certificates are prepared in order to make timely payments
to the various firms and organizations in accordance with
the terms of the contracts.
Reports: the consultant will submit a progress report to the Chairmen
of GCYP and GCNA at the end of quarter on the manpower development
program covering Phase 3 (a) through (f) above. This report must also
include any changes in the program that the consultant feels necessary
in view of the program implementation experience and/or changing
circumstances such as changing needs or difficulties in recruitment.



-69-                         ANNEX 12
Page 5 of 9
Phase 4:
On completion of the entire manpower development program, the consultant
will submit a detailed report to the concerned officials, outlining the
following:
(a)   the numbers of staff trained in each category and how this
matches the numbers originally envisaged and the need and
scope for further training;
(b)   the success of the TA interventions and the need for further
interventions;
(c)   the overall success of the program and how this has affected
the organization and capability of GCYP and GCMA;
(d)   the lessons learned from the implementation process; and
(e)   recommendations on the need for a sustained training and
technical assistance program.
It is estimated that Phase 1 will take three months, Phase 2 a further
two months, Phase 3 eighteen months to implement. Phase 4 is expected to be
completed within one month from the completion of the manpower development
program.
1II.   Eguipment Maintenance
The Task
The main tasks of the consultants will be as follows:
(a)   there may be constraints which make effective maintenance
difficult for GCYP and GCMA to achieve. The consultants are
to review and consider these:
Recruitment policies3; setting of salaries and rates of pay;
incentive schemes; overtime policies; benefits; pension
plans and housing allowances/provision.
Restrictions on access to foreign exchange for the regular
flow of consumable and spare parts and for the time to time
use of expatriate technical assistance.
The availability of trained people from vocational training
institutes or schools. Numbers and standards of
training/education.
The need for GCYP and GCMA to become more aware of the
importance of effective maintenance management.
The availability of adequate budgetary procedures to
realistically cover the full costs of maintenance.



-70-                 ~~~~~ANNEX 12
Page 6 of 9
Access to a maintenance management information system so
that GCYP and GCMA are aware of the maintenance situation at
all times, providing information of the availability of
equipment and how much it is costing to maintain.
The availability of land and/or buildings for maintenance
activities in each port.
The climatic conditions in the Yemen ports which create
maintenance difficulties not normally encountered which
require special conditions.
The manner in which the very different maintenance needs of
each port should be integrated into a common system.
(b)   Study the port equipment resources of each port, assess its
condition, the availability of spare parts, its current use
pattern and its age. Recommend which items should be
replaced, rehabilitated or maintained.
(c)   Assess the adequacy of GCYP's and GCMA's existing
maintenance facilities/buildings and equipment/tools.
(d)   Assess the present maintenanee workforce from general
manager downwards and determine the capabilities of each
with regard to the position that he is currently holding.
(e)   Develop a maintenance management strategy and policy for
GCYP and GCMA.
(f)   Develop the costs of the investments required to create an
effective maintenance management and operational structure
to include facilities, equipment, spare parts, technical
assistance, recruit,ant. training and re-training expressed
in local expenditure and foreign exchange.
It is estimated that this study will require about 10 months of one
specialist.
Reiports
The consultant would prepare and submit the following reports in English:
(a)   An Inception Report, within 1-1/2 months of the starting
date, summarizing the initial findings of the consultant and
listing the proposals, plans, programs and recommendations
and a schedule of the work program for their implementation,
(number of copies end their distribution to be determined).
(b) a Draft Final Report, within 8-1/2 months from the starting
date summarizing (i) all work performed; (ii) the findings,
recommendations and action plan for their implementation;
and (iii) a list of outstanding or priority issues to be
addressed (number of copies and their distribution to be
determined).

Page 7 of 9
(c)   a Final Report, incorporating all revisions deemed
appropriate by GCYP, GCMA, IDA and the consultant submitted
within 30 days (or as otherwise agreed) after receipt of
comments on the Draft Final Report from port sector
management (number of copies and their distribution to be
determined).
IV. Economic/Financial Study (GCYP only)
The objectives of the consultancy are to: (a) establish the
principles of accountability and financial goals through linking budgets with
improvements in productivity, more efficient operations, cost analyses results
and cost recovery; (b) determine economic priorities for the rehabilitation of
port infrastructure, maintenance equipment, machines, tools, etc; and (c)
achieve an optimal distribution of imports and exports through the country's
ports.
Scope of Work
The consultants would carry out detailed analyses of the financial
planning and controls, general and cost accounting, and management information
needs of the ports. Specifically, they would:
Mij      review the financial statements for 1986-89 (income statement and
balance sheets) prepared by port sector management and the
auditor.
(ii)      recast the financial statements for 1986-1989 in line with
generally accepted international accounting methods and
classifications and prepare cash flow statements. Particular
attention should be paid to: (i) the treatment of profit
remuneration to the Government and federal and local income tax;
(ii) the provision of foreign exchange differences on current
maturities and on the valuation of long-term debt obligations;
(iii) the justification of long-term debt outstanding and current
status of service repayments; and (iv) reviewing and regularizing
the line items for equity on balance sheets of the ports.
(iii)      develop and implement:
(a)   (i) financial goals and operational objectives through
annual and multi-year expense budgets; (ii) analytical
procedures to help in improving productivity; (iii)
cost recovery based on cost centers; and (iv) task
management methods and cost controls;
(b)   capital expenditure budgets and related policies,
procedures and analytic techniques to ensure the
evaluation and control of investment programs and the
acquisition of assets;
(c)   guidelines to distinguish between capital items and
items chargeable to operating expenses;



-72-                         ANNEX U
Page 8 of 9
(d)   a standard accounting plan and general accounts
classification, detailing balance sheet accounts,
profit and loss accct.nts etc., and supporting
policies, system, procedures, analytical techniques,
definition and monitoring procedures;
(e)   a cost accounting system which would provide for the
clear identification and allocation of costs and
revenues by cost center, together with an analysis of
the productivity of the various cost centers;
(f)   guidelines for determining economic priorities for the
rehabilitation of port infrastructure, maintenance
equipment, machines, tools, etc.; and
(g)   recommendations for the optimal distribution of
imports/exports through the country's ports, taking
into consideration the existing road network.
The recommended accounting system would provide for full activity based
accrual accounting, the monthly closing of accounts, and the extraction of
trial balances and proof sheets. From these monthly management reports the
following would be prepared: (i) balance sheets; (ii) income statements;
(iii) budget monitoring; (iv) the status of capital expenditures; (iv) cash
flow forecasts; (v) a standard system and depreciation policy for fixed assets
accounting; and (vi) internal control systems, through internal audit
procedures and built-in checks for the handling and accounting of cash,
payroll, purchasing and inventories. It is estimated that this study will
require about one year and 20 man-months.
The consultants would prepare and submit the following reports in
English, within the time limits indicated below:
(a)   an Inception Report within 1-1/2 months of the starting
date, summarizing the initial findings of the consultants
and listing the proposals, plans, programs and
recommendations and a schedule of the work program for their
implementation, as envisaged in the "Objectives" (number of
copies and their distribution to be determined).
(b)   Brief Progress ReRorts, at two-month intervals, commencing
two months after submittal of the Inception Report and
giving (i) a statement of all work performed and progress
made in the scheduled work program during the period; (ii)
the schedule of the work program for the next reporting
period; (iii) forecast completion stages of the work
programs covering the implementation of approved
recommendations; (iv) a list of the proposals, plans,
programs and recommendations awaiting approval; and (v) a
summary of interim findings (number of copies and their
distribution to be determined).



-73-                         ANNEX la

(c)   a Draft Final Report, within 9-1/2 months from the starting
date summarizing (i) all work performed; (ii) the findings,
recommendations and action plan for their implementation;
and (iii) a list of outstanding or priority issues to be
addressed (number of copies and s.heir distribution to be
determined).
(d)   a Final Report, incorporating all revisions deemed
appropriate by concerned management, IDA and the consultants
submitted within 60 days (or as otherwise agreed) after
receipt of copies and their distribution to be determined).
V. Assistance with Procurement of Eguipment
Tasks/Eguipment
In the studies described in sections II, III, and IV above, the
consultants are asked to formulate recommendations for training and urgently
required maintenance tools, equipment, and spare parts. It is envisaged that
one (lead) consultant organization will be responsible for all studies and the
contract to be signed with this consultant organization will include a certain
amount of money necessary for training, and the procurement of tools, spare
parts and equipment.
About 20% of the financing made available by IDA is for carrying
out the abovementioned three studies, about 15% for training and about 65% for
the procurement of tools, equipment and spare parts. The selection of
consultants and the procurement of tools, equipment and spare parts shall be
in accordance with IDA guidelines.
The consultants would perform all studies, economic, statistical
and financial analyses, and operational investigations and related work herein
described to achieve the stated objectives. In the conduct of this work, the
consultants would cooperate fully with the management of the port sector, and
the Ministry of Transport and other relevant public authorities. The port
sector would provide data, studies and reports, transportation and office
facilities. The consultants would review in detail the foregoing data,
studies and reports and make use of them as deemed necessary. The consultants
would be solely responsible, however, for the analyses and interpretation of
all data received; for their findings, conclusions, and recommendations; and
for the implementation of approved plans, programs, systems, methods and
procedures. Since most internal reports, accounting and statistical data,
etc, are maintained in the Arabic language, and since discussions within port
management are normally held in Arabic, it is important that some members of
the consultants' team assigned to the field work be proficient in Arabic.
