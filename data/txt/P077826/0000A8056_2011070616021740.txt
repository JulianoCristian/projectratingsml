                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project supported the draft microfinance law, which the National Assembly passed in June. This law creates a new national public-private commission to regulate and supervise
                         microcredit institutions to increase transparency and help the sector to recover its image and soundness after the scandals and the "no payment" movement. The Bank, the IMF,

                         other donors, the national microfinance association ASOMIF, the Superintendency, and others worked together to provide detailed technical inputs to the draft law. The project team
                         has offered all support required by the new Commission to help it develop quickly to meet the challenges of its role. Component 2 (strengthening Banco Produzcamos) has led to

                         some key investments with the new state bank, which remains focused on second tier lending and provides technical assistance to microfinance institutions and cooperatives.
                         However, BP has to take several legal and internal steps to meet requirements of the Bank amendment under development (such as formal asset transfer from FNI). Component 3
                         (helping MFIs transform) continues to progress, with FDL requesting assistance. Finally, the Bank obtained a grant from FIRST for $217,000 to promote financial services consumer
                         protection, and this work will be launched during summer of 2011.
