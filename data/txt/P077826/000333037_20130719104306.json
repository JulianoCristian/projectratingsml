{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Broad Based Access to\n            Finance Project for Nicaragua were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: this operation\n            highlights that in a highly changing institutional\n            environment, such as Nicaragua, it takes time and patience\n            to make an impact. It is important to ensure that Bank\n            project teams and their country counterparts understand well\n            project implications in terms of expected output and\n            outcomes. In addition, Bank teams should timely restructure\n            monitoring indicators to reflect the evolving realities on\n            the ground. Project monitoring should be an integral\n            component of supervision and Implementation Status and\n            Results, or ISRs, with key performance indicators helping\n            guide execution and decisions. Strong ownership of this\n            Technical Assistance Lending, or TAL helped to make sizable\n            progress following decisive policy actions by the Government\n            and the National Assembly or when Micro-finance institution\n            or MFIs saw clear advantages in their modernization and\n            transformation. Commitment on the part of Superintendence of\n            Banks and Other Financial Institutions, or SIBOIF is also\n            worth noting, in contrast with the deficiencies at the\n            Borrower's second-tier investment financial company, or\n            FNI. The fact that Bank projects in Nicaragua, as those of\n            other international organizations, need to be cleared at the\n            National Assembly implies that there has to be a broad\n            political consensus that includes also the implementation\n            details of any initiative."}, "docdt": "2013-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
