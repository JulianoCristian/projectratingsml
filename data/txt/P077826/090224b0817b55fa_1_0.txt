                         Recently, implementation with SIBOIF has focused on the requirements of the new microfinance law and building supervisory capacity to oversee transformed MFIs and commercial
                         banks with microfinance portfolios. The project has also been helping the safety of network and data of SIBOIF, developing an off-site center to protect the data from major disasters.
                         With CONAMI, the project provides support to build supervisory capacity, increase transparency, and help the microcredit sector recover from a recent decline. The Bank is

                         coordinating closely with the IADB and other donors the support for CONAMI. In addition, the project continues to support systems development in Banco Produzcamos (BP) related
                         to second tier lending to microfinance providers. Specifically, the project is helping improve BP’s risk managing tools (such as MFIs evaluation tools, internal risk manuals, and new
                         credit manuals). With the National Institute of Cooperatives (INFOCOOP), the project has supported the cooperatives census, a diagnostic of technological and accounting needs of
                         savings and credit cooperatives, and the transition to the new Ministerio de Economía Familiar, Comunitaria y Cooperativa which will operate INFOCOOP. Finally, in terms of
                         microcredit institution transformation, the project is supporting initial steps by FUNDESER to meet SIBOIF requirements.
