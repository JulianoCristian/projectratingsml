                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
The main reason for the proposed restructuring is to make Banco Produzcamos the
implementing agency for the Project, replacing the Nicaraguan Finance Institution (FNI)
for Parts B, C, D, and E of the Project and coordinating with SIBOIF for Part A of the
Project. Law 640 of 2007 created Banco Produzcamos as the only specialized entity in
Nicaragua to receive, channel and perform financial and credit management of the funds
of the international community for the granting of credits for the promotion and
development of national production in its various expressions and stages of production.
Law 684 of 2009 provided that Banco Produzcamos would be capitalized with the
totality of assets of various institutions, including Financiera Nicaraguense de
Inversiones (FNI). The proposed restructuring would also: (i) reallocate funds under the
existing categories of disbursement; (ii) update the reference to the new procurement law
and the corresponding applicable special provisions; (iii) eliminate the need for a
Technical Assistance Facility Management Agreement under Part C of the Project and
the Support Service Provider Agreement under Part C.3 of the Project; (iv) update the
Operational Manual to reflect the new implementation agency and to include the
monitoring and evaluation indicators; (v) update the original monitoring and evaluation
indicators; and (vi) replace an activity under Part D of the Project.

The Project was approved by the Board on May 18, 2004 and was signed on June 15,
2004. It became effective on August 22, 2005. The delays were caused by objections
from the Nicaraguan Office of the Presidency to the share of funds to be used for
technical consultancies. The Office of the Presidency preferred a larger share of funds be
used for hardware and other investments. The project costs and plans were adjusted
accordingly and the project was quickly approved by the Nicaraguan Presidency, the
National Assembly, and the Ministry of Finance, and the Project was declared effective.
The first amendment was on May 18, 2005 (prior to effectiveness of the Credit) and
adjusted the cost tables to lower the credit proceeds dedicated to consultant services, in
accordance with a Ministry of Finance request. It also added two activities under part A
of the Project. The second amendment, dated November 27, 2007 and countersigned on
December 10, 2007, replaced the Secretariat of the Office of the presidency (SECEP) and
the Vice President’s Office (UCRESEP) with FNI as implementing agency for both
programmatic and fiduciary responsibilities for Parts B, C, D and E of the Project. The
second amendment also: (i) increased the disbursement percentages for disbursement
categories 1, 2 and 3 to 100%; and (ii) moved an activity from Part A of the Project to
Part B of the Project. On April 3, 2009, IDA approved an additional reallocation of
credit proceeds among existing categories of disbursement. On September 8, 2010, IDA
agreed to extend the Closing Date from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012.

PROJECT STATUS
The Project Development Objective continues to be achievable and relevant. Some key
indicators of overall project success have been achieved, including (i) an increase in the
number of accounts in supervised financial institutions and (ii) an increase in the number
of points of service for supervised financial institutions. A specialized private credit
registry (Sin Riesgos) has been established and is largely covering its operational costs,
and has become the largest credit registry in the country. SIBOIF has established a
specialized unit for microfinance supervision, with trained supervisors and dedicated
equipment. Three non-government organization microfinance institutions have
transformed into specialized regulated microfinance institutions, under supervision of
SIBOIF. Finally, in the marginalized Atlantic Autonomous Regions, investments have
been made in training and equipment to small microfinance institutions. However, due to
a national financial crisis that directly affected several microfinance banks and non-bank
financial institutions and a longstanding legal vacuum for microfinance, the project can
make an important contribution to the recovery and continued growth of the microfinance
industry in the country.



PROPOSED CHANGES
The following specific changes are proposed as part of this restructuring:

•       The newly created state bank Banco Produzcamos which, inter alia, assumes the
responsibilities of FNI, should take over coordination and implementation responsibilities
for the Project, coordinating with SIBOIF for Part A of the Project.

•     A Subsidiary Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua, through MHCP and
Banco Produzcamos and an Implementation Agreement between Banco Produzcamos
and SIBOIF (for Part A of the Project) will be required, replacing the previous
agreements with FNI.

•       Banco Produzcamos would replace FNI in the Micro-Finance Technical
Assistance Agreements with Micro-Finance Institutions under Parts C.1 and C.2 of the
Project. The Technical Assistance Facility Management Agreement for Part C of the
Project and the Support Service Provider Agreements for Part C.3 of the Project will no
longer be required, because FNI took over this responsibility and completed the most
important tasks that such service providers would have offered. Banco Produzcamos has
confirmed its intention to also provide these services and has the capacity required to do
so.

•      The Operational Manual will be updated with the new implementation
arrangements and to include the Project’s monitoring and evaluation indicators, which
were previously included in a side letter.


                                             5
•        The Project’s monitoring and evaluation indicators would also be updated to
reflect the new institutions.

•       The Credit proceeds will be reallocated in the disbursement table. Due to the
extension of the project approved on September 2010, it is necessary to reallocate funds
to increase Category 3B (to cover the costs of consultants in the implementing agency)
and Category 2, while decreasing the allocation for Category 4. as shown in the table
below.

•       In Part D of the Project, the strengthening of the Financial Services Access Policy
activity will be replaced with the implementation of the Inclusion Strategy to ensure the
participation of beneficiaries with limited or no access to financial services, including
women.

•      Financial management
BP will manage the designated account used for eligible project expenses and is
responsible for the timely contracting and completion of audits and other financial
management activities. The staff remains in place and has been approved by the IDA
experts in financial management as having the requisite experience and skills.

•      Procurement
The procurement section will be amended to recognize the new procurement law in
Nicaragua and the updated Special Provisions. BP replaces FNI for procurement
purposes. The staff remains in place and has been approved by the IDA experts in
procurement as having the requisite experience and skills.

                                     recommendations of the FSAP of March 2010 in line
                                     with international best practices.

                                     Close donor coordination on the strategic and operational
                                     levels is ongoing, with the Bank working with the Inter-
                                     American Development Bank and COSUDE (Swiss).
Implementing           Significant   The Bank conducted and presented a detailed

                                     as carrying out a legal review. Banco Produzcamos has
                                     already made some important changes based on the
                                     institutions assessment (including internal audit,
                                     separation of key positions, and a decision to avoid a
                                     large retail presence).

                                     A review of procurement and FM systems and staff
                                     found that BP has the necessary capacity to manage the
                                     project.
Project risks          Modest        The new law on microfinance (June 2011) could be
(design, safeguards,                 difficult to implement, given the new institution to be
donor, delivery                      formed and the regulatory framework that must be
quality)                             established. Investors may delay decisions due to the
                                     2010 “no payment movement” and the Moratorium Law.
                                     On the other hand, leading microfinance institutions may
                                     decide that the new law provides sound incentives to
                                     transform into fully regulated, supervised financial
                                     institutions. The project will support the new
                                     Commission established to develop norms and regulate
                                     the sector.

1.           Project implementation progress has been satisfactory.

2.      The proposed reallocation is necessary to cover future consultant expenses which
are the result of the extension of the closing date of the project for two additional years
(approved by IDA on September, 2010). In addition, there is a decrease in funding for
training       and        an       increase       in       the       goods        category.
