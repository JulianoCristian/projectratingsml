                         The supervision mission in mid-November found that Component 1 (regulation and supervision, SIBOIF) continues to perform strongly, and SIBOIF has led an effective consensus-
                         building exercise with a project-financed international consultant to draft a MicrofinanceAssociations Law in line with the FSAP recommendations. Component 2 has not moved

                         operations only, and this was agreed to in the case of BP during the mission. Component 3 (outreach, transformation of MFIs) progresses slowly due to the MFIs' focus on recovery

                         of portfolios destroyed during the last 2 years by the "no payment" movement and the forced rescheduling by the Natioal Assembly. The supervision mission reminded BP to use the
                         annex to the midterm review as a guide for transformation support. Component 4 is also not moving forward, although the census on access to financial services is about to begin.
