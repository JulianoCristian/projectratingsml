The closing date for the project will be\n            extended from December 31, 2010 until December 31, 2012, to\n            enable the project to assist the government to develop a\n            legal and regulatory framework for microfinance, strengthen\n            the capacity of Superintendence of Bank and Other Financial\n            Institutions (SIBOIF), and support the transformation of\n            microfinance institutions into regulated financial\n            institutions.
