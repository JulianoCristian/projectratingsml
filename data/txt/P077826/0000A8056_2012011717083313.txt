                         The project supported the draft micro finance law, which the National Assembly passed in June. This law creates a new national public-private commission to regulate and supervise
                         micro credit institutions, increase transparency, enhance conditions for external funding and help the sector to recover from a recent decline. The Bank, IDB, IMF, other donors, the

                         national micro finance association ASOMIF, the Superintendency, and others worked together to provide detailed technical inputs to the draft law. As part of the Project's support, the
                         team has offered project financing required by the new Commission to help it develop quickly to meet the challenges of its role.
                         Component 2 (strengthening Banco Produzcamos BP) has led to some key investments with the new state bank, which remains focused on second tier operations/lending and
                         provides technical assistance to micro credit institutions and cooperatives.

                         Component 3 (helping MFIs transform) continues to progress. Technical assistance is being provided for two leading micro credit institutions to launch their transition efforts to
                         become micro finance institutions supervised by the recently created regulatory commission (CONAMI).

                         On September 19, 2011, the Bank launched the FIRST initiative which encompasses a $217,000 grant to promote financial services consumer protection. The initial mission
                         presented a preliminary diagnostic report and possible action plan and is waiting for feedback from Government authorities. Following the review of Government institutions, the
                         FIRST team will start preparing a full diagnostic and action plan with key stakeholders for this Consumer Protection and Financial Literacy work.
