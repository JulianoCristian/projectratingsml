PETROLEUM PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT)
Guarantor:         Hungarian People's Republic
Amount             US$90.0 million equivalent, including capitalized front-end
fee.
Terms:             Repayable in 15 years, including three years of grace at
the standard variable interest rate.
Project
Descrintion:       The main objective of the project is to support the
Government's strategy for the development of the petroleum
sector, which is aimed at arresting the decline in domestic
oil and gas production through a series of priority
investments in exploration, field development and
rehabilitation and enhanced oil recovery. The project
would also assist in strengthening OKGT's capabilities in
the overall management of the petroleum sector. The
project consists of: (a) an exploration component
including exploratory deep well drilling; (b) an enhanced
oil recovery component including four pilot tests and a
semi-commercial field demonstration; (c) rehabilitation of
one, and development of two gas fields; and (d) technical
assistance and training.
Project Benefits
and Risks:         The only project component with certain revenue producing
capability is the gas field development and rehabilitation
component. It would yield estimated cumulative net foreign
exchange savings of about $3.9 billion or $205 million
average per year for about 19 years, the estimated produc-
tive life of this component. The extent of quantitativa
benefits to be derived from the exploration and enhanced
oil recovery (EOR) components can only be estimated statis-
tically due to the wide range and uncertainty of the
results.  On the basis of statistical exploration risk
analysis there is a high probability of discovering about
14 MTOE.  With respect to the EOR component, only one field
is being operated on a semi-commercial scale and if
expected results are attained it could provide about $195
million in net foreign exchange savings over its 16 year
estimated productive life or $12 million per annum on
average. Non-quantifiable benefits of the project are

equally important in that they would strengthen the
country's capability in more fully exploiting its petroleum
resources and further improving the efficiency of its
petroleum industry. The main risks of the project are the
geological and technical risks inherent in all petroleum
exploration and development projects which can be
substantial. Adequate safeguards have been designed into
the project which make these risks acceptable in normal
industry practice.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Government of Hungary (GOH) has requested Bank financing for a
petroletm project consisting of an integrated package of investments, studies,
institution building measures and technical assistance directed towards
increasing the efficiency of oil and gas exploration and production and
slowing down the decline of natural gas production in Hungary.
1.02     The project will be implemented by the National Oil and Gas Trust
(OKGT) and consists of four components: (i) an exploration component
comprising regional and detailed geological studies and geophysical surveys,
upgrading of existing geophysical, drilling and logging equipment and drilling
of exploratory wells; (ii) an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) component including
field demonstration and pilot tests; (iii) the development of two undeveloped
gas fields and the rehabilitation of one producing gas field; and (iv)
technicr.l assistance, training and studies. Physical implementation of the
main components of the project will begin in early-1984 and will be completed
at the end of 1988.
1.03     The Government attaches the highest priority to petroleum exploration
and development, since domestic energy supplies fall far short of national
requirements and a significant proportion of Hungary's import bill is for
imports of crude oil and natural gas. The proposed project fits well within
the Bank's lending strategy to Xungary, since it addresses four major country
needs and objectives which the Bank supports and considers as among the
primary objectives for Bank lending to Hungary, i.e., (a) enhancing Hungary's
access to state-of-the-art technology; (b) reducing foreign exchange
expenditures through production of indigenous energy; (c) providing efficient
technology transfer through technical assistance and training; and (d)
mobilizing external co-financing.
1.04     The financing requirements of the project, including physical
contingencies, price escalation, interest during construction and front-end
fee are estimated at about US$520 million including about US$244 million in
foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan of US$90 million would cover about
17% of total financing requirements and 37% of foreign exchange costs. The
balance of US$430 million (or about 83% of total financing required) will be
provided from internally generated funds of OKGT, from resources of the
Government of Hungary (GOH) and from funds raised from foreign commercial
sources which the Bank will attempt to secure using the new co-financing
instruments.
1.05     The proposed project was appraised in October 1983 by G. Yuksel
(Mission Chief), J. Schweighauser, (Geologist), D.T. Carpio, (Financial
Analyst), J. Koch (Economist), and T.P. Russo (Financial Analysi) of the
Energy Department and P. van Keulen (Geophysicist, Consultant) _.
/f      The Hungarian authorities first raised the possibility of Bank
assistance to OKGT in June 1982 during the course of a Bank economic
mission. A project identification mission then visited Hungary in
February 1983, which was followed by a project preparation mission in
May 1983 and a pre-appraisal mission in September 1983.



II. ENERGY SECTOR
2.01     The Hungarian energy economy is modest in size, with annual
consumption of primary energy totalling about 32 million tons of oil
equivalent (MTOE). Of this, oil presently constitutes about 32X, natural gas
25%, coal 27%,,and hydro, wood, geothermal and imported electricity the
remaining 16X. Domestic resources supply about 54X of Hungary's energy
requirements. Although Hungary has been successful in maintaining energy
consumption at present levels and reducing net oil imports by about 1.9
million tons since 1978 when rigorous policy measures were instituted to
reverse the rapid growth trends of the 1970s, net imports still constitute
about 73X of the oil consumed, 40% of the gas, and 27% of the electricity.
Thus, net energy imports, at about US$1.0 billion in 108l, claimed 12X of
Hungary's export earnings and were 238% of its trade deficit. In the face of
increasing prices for energy imports and uncertainty as to quantities
available on concessionary terms after 1985 from its primary supplier (the
USSR), the Governtment's energy strategy calls for containing consumption of
petroleum (particularly oil), increasing exploration for and production of
domestic resources, and augmenting energy conservation efforts and efficiency
of use.
A.  Energy Supply and Demand
2.02     Like most of Eastern Europe, Hungary developed its energy economy
based largely on its primary domestic resource, coal, which as recently as
1970 accounted for 48% of energy consumption. In Hungary's drive toward
modernization and greater efficiency beginning in the early 1960s, energy
consumption grew rapidly and the shift toward a petroleutm-based (first oil and
later gas) economy continued through most of the 1970s. While energy
consumption grew at an average annual rate of 4.1% during 1970-78, dependence
on petroleum increased from about 40% of the available energy supply to 59%.
Having only modest supplies of domestic hydrocarbons, however, Hungary began
importing increasing quantities of oil, gas, and electricity from the USSR;
dependence on imports for domestic consumption thus increased from about 34%
in 1970 to 43% by 1978. Long-term fixed-price contracts initially protected
HIungary from the 1973 oil shock, but in 1976 the USSR implemented a system of
annual price adjustments whereby energy exports were increasingly tied to
international oil prices (Bucharest formula) and the volumes available for
export to Hungary at concessionary prices were restricted. This contributed
to Hungary's serious balance of payments difficulties in the late 1970s.
2.03     Since 1979 Hungary has been in a period of austerity, entering a new
phase of its economic management system whereby greater reliance on
international market signals and increased enterprise autonomy are being
emphasized. An energy management program, including such measures as economic
pricing of energy, financial incentives to conservation and interfuel
substitution, and regulation of energy consumption (type and quantity) through
a mandatory permit system for all enterprises, as well as an action program
for their implementation, was subsequently approved in 1980 for the sixth 5-
year plan (1981-85).  A series of price incryses have already brought
domestic energy prices close to world levels_ . These measures, as well as
1/       With some important exceptions, namely consumer prices for basic
necessities (e.g, fuel for home heating and household use of heat and
power) and to a lesser extent producer prices for fuels which could
substitute for oil (e.g., coal and natural gas).



moderation of economic growth patterns and reduced production of energy-
intensive goods, resulted in energy consumption in Hungary remaining stable at
about 32 MTOE during 1978-81. The share of oil in domestic consumption
actually fell to about 32% (from 37%). While coal production remained
constant, production of oil and gas and imports of oil declined, being offset
by increased imports of natural gas and electricity from the USSR upon comple-
tion of a gas pipeline and 750-kV transmission line between Hungary and the
USSR. As a result, net energy imports have increased somewhat, to about 47%
of domestic consumption in Hungary. Energy balances for Hungary since 1970
are summarized in the table below and given in greater detail in Annex 2.01.

B. Consumption of Energy
2.04     The average energy consumption/GDP growth coefficient for the period
1970-78 was about 0.70, and decreases only marginally to 0.66 if the period is
extended to 1981. Per capita consumption of energy in Hungary, 3.0 TOE in
1981, while substantially below the average for Eastern European economies
(4.4 TOE in 1980), is near the lower end of the range of industrial market
economies at about the level of Italy and Japan. The growth in energy
consumption in the seventies was accompanied by a sustained decline in the
intensity with which it was consumed, reaching ab.out 41 TOE per million
Forints GDP in 1981 (1.4 TOE per US$1000 GDP). nSevertheless, Hungary's
intensity of energy consumption, like that of mest of Eastern Europe,
continues to be substantially higher than that of most industrial market
economies (in the range of 0.3-0.6 TOE per US$1000 GNP). While this suggests
,hat considerable potential remains for improving efficiency through
rationalizati.on of consumption and conservation, it should be noted that
industr- typically accounts for 50-60% of GDP in Eastern European countries
(48% in Hungary in 1981), as compared with 30-40% in industrial market
economies. Moreover, the relatively low per capita consumption suggests that
overall energy intensity may be overstated as a result of difficulties in
establishing GDP for non-market economies on a basis comparable with that for
market economies.
2.05     The sectoral mix of energy consumption has changed little over the
period 1970-81, with power generation and heat production representing about
40% of primary energy consumption, the industry and household/communal sectors
each nearly 20%, and all other sectors the remaining 20%. Where there have
been significant changes is in the structure of fuel use by these various
sectors (Annex 2.02). Power and heat production have shifted their primary
dependence from coal (at 54%) in the early 1970s to oil and natural gas (49%)
today, with the relative emphasis on oil in the mid-to-late 1970s switching to
gas by 1981. With power generation con.idered by the Government as the lowest
priority for gas utilization, future plans call for the first two nuclear
power units (440 MW each) to be operational by the end of 1984 and the third
and fourth in 1986 and 1989 respectively, for eleccricity imports to increase
somewhat, and in the longer run for increasing the use of coal in power and
heat production. In the case of industry, coal and gas in 1970 provided, in
equal proportions, about 70% of the sector's fuel requirements, while by 1981
the primary fuels were oil and gas. Finally, in the household and communal
sector, coal (at 69%) served as the primary fuel in 1970 and although still
significant, has increasingly been displaced by oil and gas (56%); connection
of communities to the natural gas network is in the interests of both
increasing efficiency of energy use and upgrading the nation's standard of
living.
C. Resource Base
2.06     Coal is Hungary's most plentiful domestic resource with reserves
totalling some 2.8 billion tons or 750 MTOE (lignite 32%, brown coal 40%, hard
coal 28%). While the life of these reserves is more than sufficient to
support major power investments in the 1990s, the low quality, high sulfur and
ash contents, and difficult mining conditions (except for lignite which is
open-pit) severely constrain coal's development and use. The reserves of oil
and gas are rather limited, about 105 MTOE in total, enough to continue



production at present levels only into the next decade.  However, with
extensive and intensive exploration and production programs following along
the lines being initiated under the proposed project, there is a good chance
these might ultimately be increased by 4-500 MTOE, mostly in the form of gas.
Nuclear energy is to take on an increasing role as 4x440 MW units come on
stream by 1990. Although the quantity of Hungary's domestic resources of
uranium are unknown, there is an open-pit mine in the south which is mined for
export to the USSR. Among the other resources available to Hungary are 880 MW
of hydro (48 MW developed to date) in multipurpose sites in the north near the
Czechoslovakia border and a few smaller sites; abundant but unquantified and
generally low enthalpy reserves of geothermal water (with some calcium
problems); and about 1 MTOE per year of biomass (firewood, crop residues,
other wood). A project was prepared for exploiting the hydro potential but it
has been postponed indefinitely due to shortage of funds. The geothermal
water is mainly used in swimming pools/spas and greenhouses, although its
further use for agricultural applications is under study.
D. Institutional Framework
2.07     The National Energy Authority (OEGH) under the Secretary of State for
Mining and Energy, a deputy minister in the Ministry of Industry (IpM),
supervises and coordinates energy sector activities (Annex 2.03). Outside the
Ministry but subject to its jurisdiction are the main energy supply
institutions, including the National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT), coal mining
companies, Hungarian Electric Power Trust (MVMT), and municipalities engaged
in district heat supply (for technical matters). Five additional agencies
under IpM are responsible for various aspects of energy planning, design,
research and development, and safety.
2.08     Other agencies reporting directly to the Council of Ministers and
playing a key role in the energy sector include: (a) National Planning Office
(NPO) responsible for coordinating/ integrating the plans of the various
sectors and reviewing/monitoring major projects; (b) National Bank of Hungary
(NBH) functioning both as the central bank of Hungary and as a commercial and
development bank providing short and medium-term financing; (c) State
Development Bank (SDB) providing financing for large-scale investments
initiated by the state; (d) National Board for Materials and Prices (NBMP)
responsible for setting prices for certain essential goods including energy
supplies; and (e) Central Geological Office (KFH) with responsibility for
assessing the nation's reserves of natural resources, issuing permits/licenses
for their exploration, and approving exploration programs.
E. Energy Development Strategy
2.09     The Government's strategy for the energy sector calls for: (a)
continued reduction of the share of crude oil and petroleum products in the
country's energy balance to about 30%, through increasing production of
natural gas for the near term, developing nuclear power and increasing
electricity imports in the near-to-long term, and increasing production of
coal in the longer term; and (b) containing growth in primary energy demand to
an annual average of 1-1.5%, by improving overall efficiency of energy use
especially in the energy-intensive industrial sector and including some
restructuring of production toward more higher-valued, less energy-intensive
goods.



- 6 -
2.10     On this basis, the Gover.ment forecasts domestic consumption of
primary energy to increase to 33.4 MTOE by 1985 and 35.5 MTOE by 1990 (table
after para. 2.03), the intensity of consumption to continue declining to about
38 TOE per million (1980) Forints GDP by 1990, and the energy coefficint for
the period to be about 0.5. The composition of fuel use anticipated to meet
this forecast demand is not too unlike the present make-up, although as
discussed above (para. 2.05) the sectoral mix of fuelts is expected to change
somewhat.  The overall picture to 1990 is one of nuclear power, and to a -oh
lesser extent coal, substituting for a relatively small decline in oil and gas
production. With energy production targetted to grow somewhat faster than
consumption, the share of imports in Hungary's domestic energy consumption is
expected to continue to be about 45%.
2.11     Hungary is now in the initial stages of developing its investment
program for the seventh plan period (1986-90). The economics of coal, most
probably lignite, and nuclear for power and heat in the 1990s require careful
examination, as does the future role of natural gas in Hungary. In this
connection, it is important that Hungary develop least-cost programs for coal,
power, and heat, and undertake a gas utilization study. Moreover, increased
investment in petroleum exploration and exploitation is required if production
is to continue through the end of the century. On the conservation front, the
Government's plans to maintain growth of consumption at 1-1.5% per year
through 2000 would appear to be rather optimistic, unless economic growth is
lower than the anticipated 2-3% per year. The two major sectors of concern
are industry (including power and heat) where some restructuring of r -rduction
as well as improvements in energy efficiency of existing operations :e
required, and the household/communal sector where consumption has continued to
increase in recent years and a more accelerated program of consumer price
increases may be in order.
III. PETROLEUM SUBSECTOR
3.01     Oil and natural gas together constitute about 57% of the primary
energy consumed in Hungary. Domestic production of oil, always in rather
small quantities, dates back to the late 1930s, while gas production in
somewhat larger quantities began in the mid-1960s. Domestic production of
petroleum today contributes about 44% of domestic energy production and
fulfills 24% of the country's energy needs. Net imports of oil and gas,
almost exclusively from the USSR, comprise about 72% of net energy imports and
58% of petroleum consumption. Reduction of the country's dependence on
imported petroleum, particularly oil, through enhancing domestic production
and rationalizing the use of oil and gas, is a primary objective underlying
Hungary's energy resource development strategy.
A. Trends in Petroleum Supply and Demand
3.02     Supply of Petroleum.  Hungary's petroleum production over the years
has come from several small discoveries and a few more major ones, the most
recent in 1965 (Algyo). These allowed production of oil to increase to a peak
of 2.2 million tons yearly in 1977-79, from which it has since declined to the
present level of about 2.0 million tons per year. Natural gas production msre
than doubled during 1970-78, reaching a peak of 7.2 billion cubic meters tm );
with the completion of the Federation pipeline (with USSR) in 1979, however,



-7-
domestic production was reduced as imports were increased, resulting in
production falling to 6.0 billion m (4.8 MrOE) in 1981. Pro4uction of
natural gas liquids contributes an additional 0.7 million tons yearly.
Slightly more than half of the oil and gas production is obtained from the
Algyo field which has already passed its peak and is rapidly declining.
Waterflooding is routinely used to maintain production levels and increase the
recovery faccor of known oil fields, and accounts for 25-30% of total oil
production. Other enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques such as carbon
dioxide injection are being tested and applied as production from existing
fields declines, but their contribution to production La still rather small
(about 2.5% in 1981).
3.03     Imports of oil also increased throughout the 1970s reaching a peak of
10.3 million tons yearly in 1978-79 and since declining to 8.5 million tons in
1981. To the extent possible, Hungary imports crude oil (80-85% of oil
imports) rather than products in order to maximize the utilization of its 14.5
million ton per year refining capacity. Although connected to the Middle East
through the Adria crude oil pipeline (via Yugoslavia) completed in 1979,
Hungary relies upon USSR for its oil imports under an agreement negotiated in
1980 for the 1981-85 plan period. In part to balance refinery throughout with
domestic consumption and to serve certain convertible currency markets (mainly
non-energy products), Hungary exports 0.5-1.0 million tons of products
yearly. Net imports have therefore been reduced to about 73% of domestic
needs in 1980-81 (from 84% in 1979). Imports of natural gas to Hungary, orn
the other hand, have more than tripled since 1978, accounting for aboit 40% of
the country's domestic requirements in 1980-81. Of the 3.8 billion in per
year imported from the USSR (another 0.2 billion m3 comes from Romania), 2.8
billion m3 is as compensation for Hungary's contribution to the Federation
pipeline and transit of up to 2.5 billion m3 of gas per year from the USSR to
Yugoslavia through the same pipeline. Annex 3.01 gives the petroleum balances
for 1970-81.
3.04     Petroleum Consumption.  Consumption of petroleum in Hungary more than
doubled during 1970-78, reaching a peak of 18.7 MTOE (59% of domestic energy
consumption) in 1978 and declining to 18.3 MTOE (57%) in 1981. While
consumption of oil also peaked in 1978 at 12.3 million tons and fell to 10.6
million tons (10.3 MTOE) by 1981, consumptios of natural gas grew steadily
from 3.8 billion m3 in 1970 to 9.9 billion m (8.0 MTOE) in 1981. Consumption
of the three major petroleum products, gasoline, gasoil and fuel oil (88% of
domestic oil consumption in 1981), increased sharply over 1970-78; fuel oil
consumption then fell by 30% over the next 3 years as it was replaced by
natural gas. As for sectoral consumption of these three products and natural
gas, the percentage distribution for 19RO is shown below (see also Annex
3.02). The Government's present priorities for gas use are first as an
industrial feedstock or fuel where there is no economic alternative, second as
an oil substitute in household, commercial and industrial uses, and third as
fuel for power generation and heat production. A net importer of gasoil,
gasoline and kerosene and with plans for further displacement of domestic fuel
oil consumption, Hungary has begun construction of a fluid catalytic cracker
scheduled for completion in 1984.

B. Petroleum Resources
3.05     Petroleum Geology.  Hungary covers an area of 90,000 square
kilometers, of which 70,000 are considered prospective for oil and gas. The
country's particular geological setting has had a number of significant
effects on oil and gas exploration: (a) except for the youngest formations,
oil and gas exploration is very manpower intensive and costly; and (b) as a
rule, hydrocarbon deposits are small and strongly faulted, rendering
development difficult and expensive. For this reason, international oil
companies have shown little interest in exploring in Hungary. Despite these
severe geological complexities, Hungary offers good prospects for finding
additicnal oil and gas reserves. The geological parameters which determine
the prisence of oil and gas deposits are generally well developed although
with wLde variations in quality/quantity. While these parameters are best
developed in the southeast and southwest where the oil and gas fields are
concentrated, hydrocarbons have been proven in most of the remaining
sedimentary areas albeit in much smaller quantities. Annex 5.01 and 5.02 give
a more detailed treatment of Hungary's petroleum geology and expectations.
3.06     Exploration History.  Although petroleum exploration in Hungary
started in 1910 and two oil fields were discovered by the late 1930s,
systematic exploration commenced after 1948 when the industry was nationalized
and the National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) was entrusted with the conduct of
oil operations in Hungary. At first, the search for oil centered in the
southwestern part of the country where the two discoveries were being followed
up. Seismic information soon revealed the presence of additional prospective
areas. It became apparent that there are basically two prospective realms in
Hungary, the younger Tertiary section, consisting of alternations of sands,
shales and marls, and the pTe-Tertiary section with a much more varied rock



-9-
sequence. Having identified the relatively simple younger Tertiary realm,
OKGT concentrated its exploration efforts on it and structures immediately in
contact with it, spending relatively little time and money on the more
difficult areas.
3.07     Substantial areas of Hungary, ther,fore, have been evaluated only
sketchily, if at all, due to both geologica. complexities and technical
hazards such as severe overpressures and vexy high temperatures. In any
event, the geophysical tools and methods to explore such complex structures as
those prevailing in Hungary, have become available only very recently in a few
producing areas, mainly in the U.S. and Western Europe. Equally, there have
been significant advances in drilling technology, and high pressures and
temperatures can now be successfully overcome. This is a very timely
development for OKGT which is forced to explore these more difficult
prospective realms in order to arrest the decline in reserves in the existing
producing areas.
3.08     Resource Base and Geological Prognosis.  OKGT has successfully
explored the relatively simple prospective realms. About 200 trapping
structures remain to be evaluated which can be tested with equipment presently
in operatAon.  Reserves now stand at about 20 million tons of oil and about 90
billion m3 of gas. In addition, there are about 30 billion m3 of low-calorie
natural gas containing up to 83% of inert gases (mostly CO ), which are now
beginning to be produced (for mixing with pipeline gas and70r local power/heat
production and industrial uses).
3.09     In order to sustain the present petroleum production levels into the
next decade, it is critical that the deeper and more complex geological
structures be explored aggressively and diligently. Bank staff, with OKGT,
have evaluated the potential of all such known prospects.  The results
indicate that there is an 80% shance that up to 130 million tons of producible
oil reserves and 400 billion m of gas can be added to Hungary's resource base
(Annex 5.02). An analysis of the shape of the expectation curves indicates
that there are several areas where additional exploration efforts can make
inmediate additions to reserves. Several areas have lower, but still
realistic chances, for finding very significant reserves. Invariably, some
key parameters such as structural definition, presence and quality of source
rocks and reservoirs are not fully understood or evaluated. A primary
objective of the proposed project is to enhance the amount and quality of data
having a bearing on the lesser known parameters, and thereby to assist OKGT in
determining an optimum exploration program for raising the expectations into
the probable and proven reserve category.
3.10     Hungary's EOR Potential.  The prospects of discovering new oil
reserves in the medium and long-term notwithstanding, the application of
advanced EOR techniques offers one of the best opportunities to maintain
Hungary's oil production at the current level.  The ultimate recovery of oil
from all fields under the primary and secondary methods presently employed is
expected to be about 34%. Application of modern EOR methods could increase
this to about 40%, resulting in an incremental recovery on the order of 15
million tons of oil. Due to the high quality of the Hungarian oils (low
specific gravity and viscosity), miscible displacement methods using carbon
dioxide or enriched natural gas and improved water flooding (polymer and
micellar solution flooding) are most likely to find the widest application.



- 10 -
However, immisaJble gas injection as in the Nagylengyel field and thermal
recovery methods as in the Demjen field also offer good prospects.
3.11     Assuming a concentrated and systematic EOR effort during the next
five years and an economic life of about ten years for the average EOR
project, the application of advanced EOR methods could yield up to 1.5 million
tons of oil per year after 1990. However, as many of the oil reservoirs in
which these processes will be applied will by then have reached the end of
their primary production periods, the rates of production mentioned above
would not be additional to but would substitute for the current production.
Moreover, Hungary's approach to EOR to date has been rather fragmented and has
relied primarily on local resources and know-how due to its limited exposure
to the international petroleum industry and state-of-the-art technology. An
important objective of the proposed project is to assist OKGT in formulating a
long-term EOR strategy, as well as alleviating some of its resource
constraints in the field.
C.  Development Prospects
3.12     Investment Plan.  Through the operations of its 23 enterprises, OKGT
controls virtually the whole oil and gas subscetor, including petroleum
exploration and production, refining, marketing and distribution, facilities
and equipment design, construction and manufacture, oil field services, and
technical research and development. Its investment program is summarized

3.13     In the area of petrolcum exploration and development, the
Government's primary objective is to arrest the anticipated decline of oil and
gas production through a series of priorit:y projects aimed at (a) continuing a
constant and systematic exploration effort in conventional producing areas to
maintain current production, while aggressively expanding exploration
activities into deeper, more complex geological horizons and new, unexplored
geological provinces where the ultimate rewards couid be sizable; (b)
developing in an optimum sequence marginal oil and gas pools and increasing
the use of low-grade natural gases; (c) rehabilitating existing oil and gas
fields in order to prevent too rapid a decline in their production rates; and
(d) developing a rationalized EOR strategy, and implementing it by means of
initiating new EOR tests and extending the application of existing successful
pilot EOR tests in order to increase the ultimate recovery of oil reserves.
To achieve this program will require OKGT's access to state-of-the-art
technology, equipment an: expertise to which Hungary's capable, though
somewhat ingrown, national oil industry has had limited exposure (para. 3.25).
Assistance to OKGT in each area of its investment program is planned under the
proposed project, with primary emphasis on those aspects most affected by the
technology and foreign exchange resource constraints of recent years and where
the Bank's technical assistance efforts would have the greatest impact in
rationalizing Hungary's hydrocarbon exploration, production and utilization
strategies and in strengthening the country's (primarily OKGT's) capability to
execute the resulting programs successfully. Over the 1984-88 period,
expenditures for the project represent nearly 30% of OKGT's planned
investments in petroleum production. Significantly higher than the previous
plan period (1976-80), OKGT's petroleum production investment figures have
been adjusted upward relative to plan figures originally given to the mission
to reflect the more aggressive and technically difficult, and hence expensive,
program which OKGT intends to pursue both during the proposed project and
beyond. For similar reasons, the share of foreign exchange is also expected
to increase, from about 14% in 1976-80 to 21% in 1981-85.
3.14     The second, and justifiably smaller part of OKGT's investment program
concerns its downstream petroleum activities. Hungary's petroleum-related
infrastructure is well developed.  OKGT's primary objective, therefore, is to
rationalize these operations in light of the Government's national energy
strategy through projects directed toward (a) continuing to extend the natural
gas pipeline and distribution network to connect additional towns, villages,
households, businesses, etc.; (b) installing secondary processing units in its
refineries to improve the balance of production and consumption; and (c)
continuing to maintain and upgrade as appropriate its existing infrastructure.
A portion of the ongoing Bank loan in industrial energy diversification and
conservation (Loan No. 2317-HU) pertains to several of OKGT's investments in
this area.
3.15     Petroleum Production Outlook.  Oil production is targetted at about
2.0 million tons per year through 1991, and thereafter to decline to 1.0
million tons by 2000. Production of natural gas liquids would add another
0.5-0.7 million tons. Gas prodXction in targetted to continue increasing in
the near term to 7.25 billion m by 1985, due to accelerated gas field
rehabilitation and development while awaiting the start-up of She nuclear
power plants; it is then planned to stabilize at 6.5 billion m through 2000,
although the increased proportion of low-calorie gas planned for the period to
1990 will reduce its energy content. Existing fields by 1990 are expected to



- 12 -
supply less than 70% of the crude oil and 50% of the natural gas produced in
Hungary. The difference will be made up for the most part with production
from known fields under delineation/ development and to a lesser extent from
new discoveries. The contribution of EOR processes is expected to comprise
about 15% of total oil production over the period 1983-90. Annex 3.03 gives
further details of forecast petroleum production. Based on past experience,
the estimates to 1990 are considered to be realistic; moreover, OKGT has
consistently reached its production targets in the recent past. As for the
targets beyond 1990, these should also be attainable, and in fact may even be
exceeded, provided OKGT diligently pursues the more ambitious exploration and
production strategies develcped in the course of preparing/implementinig the
proposed project.
3.16     Strategy for Petroleum Imports and Utilization.  It is the
Government's objective to maintain oil and gas imports at about 1981 Ievels
for as long as possible, as the price for these is based on the Bucharest
formula and can be paid for through a basket of goods agreed annually; any
amounts over this can only be imported with convertible currency at world
prices. Based on OKGT's forecast oil and gas production (pa.a. 3.15) and
IpM's forecast demand for energy (para. 2.10), imports of natural gas and oil
in 1985 are expected to be 10-15% below 1981 levels, while in 1990 they would
be significantly above, particularly the natural gas because of the reduced
quality of domestic production. Hungary is thus expectee to continue to be
dependent on imports for about 75% of its oil and just over 30% of its gas
supply in 1985, with the latter climbing to over 45% by 1990. At the same
time, it should be noted that the oil/gas mix of imports has some flexibility;
for example, ig the capacity of the Fed ration pipeline becomes a constraint
(7.0 billion m , of which 2.5 billion m is for transit gas to Yugoslavia),
imports of gas from Romania may be possible or a small increase in oil imports
could offset any necessary reduction.  On the other hand, 3there is also
effectively a lower limit on gas Imports of 2.8 billion m (para. 3.03).
While oil and gas import prices under the Bucharest formula are fast
approaching world prices, Hungary's trade situation with the USSR still
appears to be reasonably favorable (Annex 3.04). However, the quantities of
oil and gas to which this will apply after the next contract negotiations in
1985 remain uncertain. The exploration and production programs initiated
under the proposed project as a central part of OKGT's investment plans could
help Hungary make significant progress toward reducing its import dependence
in the medium and long-term particularly in regard to gas.
3.17     Oil's share in Hungary's energy supply is targetted to stabilize at
about 30% by 1985, while the share of natural gas is expected to remain at 25%
through 1985 and then decline slightly to 23% by 1990. On the basis of
Hungary's performance during 1981-82 (Annex 3.02), it would appear that the
shifts in consumption patterns (e.g., increasing gas and decreasing oil
consumption to 1985) required to achieve these targets should be attainable.
OEGHi's forecasts of petroleum product and gas consumption to 1985 and 1990
(Annex 3.02) show the primary emphasis to be reducing fuel oil use in
power/heat production in the near term to 1985 (replacing it with nuclear) and
in industrial applications in the longer term (potentially through greater
reliance on coal and power/heat by NVMT); at the same time natural gas would
continue to replace gasoil for heating purposes in the household/communal
sector. After further processing, the fuel oil and gasoil thus released could
help reduce import requirements and meet increases in non-substitutible demand
for gasoil and gasoline.



- 13 -
3.18     Natural gas represents about 80% of Hungary's remaining recoverable
petroleum reserves and is expected to be the major proportion of any future
discoveries. The Government's gas 3trategy has to date mainly focused on the
priorities for gas utilization (para. 3.04) and to a lesser extent on the
development of a market for the low-calorie gas which is just beginning to be
commercially exploited (pa-a. 3.08). In connection with the proposed project,
the Government has agreed to undertake a study with the objective of
rationalizing gas use in Hungary. It is recommended that the review include,
among other subjects, an assessment/ranking of the various oil substitution
roles of natural gas, evaluation of direct use of gas in households and/or
combined cycle heat and power plants in urban areas as compared with its
present use in district heating, investigation of economic uses of low-calorie
gas, and review of gas utilization options in the event sizable gas reserves
were discovered.
D. Petroleum Pricing
3.19     The Hungarian Government has successfully raised the domestic prices
of petroleum, particularly oil, toward world levels over the last decade
(Annex 3.05). Following the first major international oil price increase in
the early 1970's, the Government initially doubled domestic petroleum prices
between 1974 and 1979. Since then, the Government has also implemeRted a
series of increases f7 internal energy prices. As a result, between 1979 and
1983 producer prices-.~ of individual petroleum products have risen by 100-300%
and those of natural gas by 150-400% (depending on the type of gas user).
Thus, petroleum prices in Hungary today are not only significantly higher than
the average cost of produytion or imports, but are also comparable to world
levels. Consumer pricesl- of energy, while higher than the average cost of
production or imports, have generally not risen as much as preducer prices.
This is due to the Government's policy of only gradually increasing wages to
ensure an orderly adjustment of the economy to a more decentralized and open
system. However, in the case oil products, consumer prices are set only for
LPG and gasoil used for home heating and cooking, which together represent
just slighly over 10% of total oil consumption. In the case of natural gas,
the consumer price also applies to only about 10% of total gas consumption.
3.20     The table below shows the prices of petroleum products in Hungary
today. Based on the refinery throughput and consumption patterns of 1982 and
domestic prices of 1983, a refined ton of crude oil sells for about US$250 in
Hungary, or US$15 more than a similar product mix at international prices,
this is partly due to the very high gasoline price, which is more than twice
the world price.
1/      There are two sets of prices in Hungary: (a) producer prices, i.e.,
prices paid by all enterprises involved in the production and
delivery of goods and services; and (b) consumer prices, i.e., prices
paid by households and some small commercial enterprises.

3.21     The Government's long-term policy calls for increasing gas prices to
a level comparable with the price of the most likely oil substitutes. For the
time being, the natural gas producer and consumer prices range, in energy
terms, from 60% to 80% of the domestic prices of their most likely oil
substitutes (Annex 3.05). Using 1982 quantities and 1983 prices as in the
case of oil, the final sales price of gas in Hungary today is about US$85 per
1000 m3 (about US$100/ton of fuel oil equivalent). This is to encourage the
substitution of gas for oil products which is an important element of the
Government's energy policy. The Government further reinforces energy
efficiency and conservation through specific administrative measures designed
to regulate oil and gas use. These include the Government's established
priorities for gas (para. 3.04), mandatory energy permit system which applies
to all enterprises, and Governmental review of interfuel substitution and
conservation projects.
3.22     In financial terms (Annex 3.06), netting out the cost of the crude
oil and taxes at today's petroleum product prices leaves OKGT with a
sufficient refining/marketing margin, and. at the same time the Government
collects revenues of US$145-150 per ton of oil sold. In the case of natural
gas, however, OKGT is left with barely enough to cover its costs of
distribution and marketing unless the revenues from the natural gas liquids
are also includgd; still the Government manages to collect taxes of about
US$45 per lOOOm of gas sold at today's prices. While Hungary's exploration
and production costs can be expected to increase significantly in the future,



- 15 -
they are presently only 10-15% of international reference prices (e.g., Saudi
Light oil). OKGT's margins and the sector's revenue-generating capability,
however, are very sensitive to the price of oil and gas imports, and the
presently, somewhat artificially depressed import price from the USSR (Annex
3.04) tends to overstate the sector's revenue generation.
3.23     Present Government policy calls for using the international price of
Saudi Lig'it oil as the basis for setting domestic petroleum prices, and
correlating prices of other fuels to this (with certain exceptions as noted in
paras. 3.19, 3.21) through the price proportions in the world market (e.g.,
posted prices in Italy, monthly average spot prices in Rotterdam, fuel oil
equivalent, etc.). The Government authorities confirmed during project
appraisal and again during loan negotiations the intention to continue this
policy. The question of the economic price of goods imported from CMEA
countries, such as oil and gas, is also very relevant, particularly in
evaluating various conservation and interfuel substitution proposals. In the
case of both oil and gas, for which import levels under the Bucharest formula
are limited to 1981 quantities until 1985 and potentially less thereafter*
world prices would apply at the margin. Both this and the Government's future
plans regarding natural gas pricing in Hungary will be important in carrying
out the gas utilization study under the proposed project (para. 3.18).
3.24     Finally, consumer prices apply to only about 10% of both oil and -aa
consumption in Hungary and are not only higher than the average cost of
production or imports, but are also structured so as to encourage, for
example, substitution of coal, gas, electricity for household use of oil. In
the case of gasoil and LPG used for home heating and cooking, the Government
reimburses OKGT for the difference in the lower consumer prices and the
producer prices. In 1983, this reimbursement amounted to about US$118 million
or about 3% of OKGT's gross revenues. Although there appears to be a trend of
increasing household consumption of energy there is no evidence of wasteful or
inefficient energy use in the household sector particularly considering the
fact that a significant proportion of household income is spent on energy.
Nonetheless, under the terms of the Standby Agreement with the IMF, the
Government has already agreed to further reduce subsidies to both consumers
and producers; elimination of the few remaining petroleum subsidies is
expected by the end of 1987. The Bank will also continue an active dialogue
with the Government on these various points through both the proposed project
and the energy subsector reviews.
E. The Hungarian Petroleum Industry
3.25     Industry Operation.  The development of Hungary's petroleum sector
has, since 1948 when the industry was nationalized, been in the hands of OKGT.
Over the past 35 years OKGT has not only been responsible for the discovery
and exploitation of almost all of the country's known crude oil and natural
gas reserves, but has also developed into a capable national oil company in
its own right, superior in technical competence, 'rganizational efficiency,
and project implementation capability to most of the Bank's borrowers in the
sector. While the experience and technical expertise of OKGT's professional
staff is of a high order, there have been drawbacks, as in other East European
countries, from an undue emphasis and focus on developing a national
capability in all facets of the petroleum industry; this in turn has resulted
in a relative lack of exposure to and operating familiarity with the latest



- 16 -
technological developments of the international petroleum industry. These
developments are rapidly becoming the determining factors as to whether
Hungary will be successful in arresting the forecast decline in its oil and
gas production. Chapter IV discusses more fully OKGT, its overall operational
procedures, technical capability, and financial soundness.
3.26     Private Sector Involvement.  Prewar Hungary had a long tradition in
cooperating with foreign oil companies. Shell, a major refiner and marketer
in the prewar period, has now resumed its operations and has established its
own distribution network; Shell, BP, and AGIP accounted for about 17% of
gasoline sales in 1982 and some lubricants. However, there has yet to be any
foreign participation on the exploration/production side, although the legal
framework exists for joint operations with OKGT. The existing laws/decrees
allow OKGT to enter into joint operations with foreign oil companies in
exploration/production activities but they do not stipulate any specific
terms. In recent years the Government has encouraged OKGT to form joint
ventures with selected major international companies capable of bringing in
the necessary technology and presence in a broad area of petroleum
operations. Although two major oil companies have shown tentative interest,
no tangible results have ensued. This is attributed to the companies'
perception that Hungary's petroleum prospects are modest by international
company standards, that much of Hungary is gas-prone and that Hungarian
exploration is extremely manpower and capital intensive due to the
preponderance of small to medium-sized prospects. Until Hungary can prove
that expectations are much higher than presently perceived, the burden of
exploration falls on OKGT, compelling it to undertake exploration in the
deeper and lesser explored realms itself. In the meantime, OKGT will have to
rely on{ consultants for technology transfer. A potentially more attractive
alternative would be a management contract with a large oil company whereby a
group of high level technical staff would be seconded to OKGT to jointly
manage part of its more technically difficult operations. Generally, however,
large companies are unwilling to make available their manpower on a cost plus
basis, although industry response might be more positive if there were a
possibility that such a management contract could lead to a future joint
venture.
F. The Bank's Lending Strategy and Role in the Sector
3e27     The Bank's lending in the energy sector in Hungary to date has
comprised one loan in industrial energy diversification and conservation (Loan
No. 2317-HU of 1983). In addition, an energy sector survey is planned to
integrate the Bank's knowledge of the major energy subsectors (studies of
petroleum, coal, and power are underway), provide an opportunity to review the
developments and prospects for the sector as a whole, examine the linkages
with the overall macroeconomic framework, and provide the basis both to
comment on Government investment proposals and to help the Bank make decisions
regarding possible projects for its support. The proposed petroleum project,
comprising a substantial proportion (nearly 30%) of OKGT's 1984-88 petroleum
exploration and development prow-am, would be the Bank's first lending
operation in the petroleum subsector in Hungary.
3,28     The broader ro:.e of the Bank in Hungary is directed at assisting the
Government in the pursuit of its structural adjustment objectives, not only by
alleviating the shortage of investment funds and augmenting scarce foreign



- 17
exchange (both through its own resources and through cofinancing), but also by
upgrading Hungarian technology through developing closer liukages with Western
markets. Four specific country needs/objectives have been identified and the
Bank's leading strategy is aimed at responding to these needs: (a) export
generation/import substitution; (b) technology transfer; (c) institutional
reform and technical assistance; and (d) resource mobilization. The proposed
petroleum project fits well with the aforementioned country goals as it
addresses directly a key objective of Hungary's petroleum subsector
development strategy, namely arresting the anticipated decline in oil and gas
product.ton, through a series of projects in exploration, field development and
rehabilitation, and EOR, designed to increase domestic hydrocarbons production
in the near, medium, and longer term and hence to reduce the country's
dependence on imported energy. To achieve this, the proposed project would
further assist in the introduction of advanced technology and in the provision
of technical assistance to strengthen the capability of OKGT in implementing
both the project and its overall investment program and in planning future
programs. Specifically, the Bank's involvement would (a) assist in the
formulation and periodic review of a balanced exploration/production strategy
and in the development of a more systematic approach to evaluating and ranking
exploration prospects as well as EOR applications and techniques; (b) improve
the technical design of individual projects; and (c) assist in designing
appropriate technical assistance and in mot.kizing adequate equipment,
technology and expertise so critically needed to support OKGT's petroleum
operations. Finally, one of the project components (gas fields development
and rehabilitation) provides an excellent vehicle for assisting Hungary in
mobilizing cofinancing, possibly through a syndicated loan from commercial
banks.
3.29     During the course of project preparation and appraisal, the Bank has
evaluated in depth the petroleum prospects of Hungary and OKGT's technical
performance. As a result, the project concept and design has been
substantially modified and improved. Instead of the package of subprojects
originally proposed by OKGT for Bank assistance, the project now consists of a
balanced exploration program with emphasis on deep prospects in producing
areas and on prospects in hitherto lightly explored and unexplored areas, and
a production strategy with emphasis on EOR. In order to successfully
implement this program, the Bank has pointed to the need for, and OKGT and the
Hungarian authorities have agreed to make use of, a substantial amount of
technical coasultancy and contractor services, as well as to import a
substantial amount of advanced equipment. The Hungarians have further agreed
to establish a project-oriented central coordination and monitoring group,
somewhat similar to the "task groups" of the international petroleum industry,
to ensure effective project implementation and, in particular, an effective
interdisciplinary approach to exploration and EOR. In addition, OKGT has
substantially modified the scope and reduced the cost of the Nagylengyel EOR
scheme included in its investment program as a result of discussions with Bank
staff. The new scheme is expected to achieve essentially the same goal as the
original OKGT project while costing approximately 60% less. OKGT has also
agreed to expand its seismic processing capabilitier in order to reprocess a
large amount of old data and to cope wjth an increased amount of new seismic
information which will become available during the next five years; at the
same time, OKGT will utilize foreign contractors for processing seismic data
beyond its capabilities.  Finally, the Government has agreed to initiate a gas
utilization study as part-of the proposed project.

IV. THE NATIONAL OIL AD GAS TRUST (OKGT)
4.01     The borrower and beneficiary for the proposed loan would be the
National Oil and Gas Trust (OKGT) with the guarantee of the Government of
Hungary. OKGT which was established in 1948 consists of 23 enterprises
organized on both geographical and functional bases, covering the full
spectrum of activities in the petroleum industry, including exploration and
production, crude oil refining, petroleum products marketing, gas
transportation and supply, design and fabrication of pipelines and oil and gas
installations, manufacturing of specialized equipment, and research and
development (Annex 4.01). Primary supervision of OKGT's operations is
exercised by the National Energy Authority (OEGH) of the Ministry of Industry
(IpM). Important aspects of OKGT's organization, management and performance
are summarized in the following sections.
A. Organization and Management
4.02     OKGT bears a strong organizational resemblance to integrated
international oil companies in that it serves as the controlling organization
for a group of subsidiary companies engaged in specialized petroleum
activities. These enterpriBes are separate legal entities, forming
independent profit centers and enjoying a high degree of autonomy on
operational matters. Nevertheless, the trust centralizes marketing, planning
and investment decisions, sets internal transfer prices, and arranges
financing, effectively making the individual enterprises operating divisions
of the trust. Decision-making with regard to major projects, moreover,
remains highly centralized and the trust exerts close technical and economic
control over the implementation of projects entrusted to its subsidiary
companies.
Organization
4.03     OKGT's organization chart is given in Annex 4.02.  Its General
Manager is appointed by the Secretary of State for Mining anld Energy of IpM
and is assisted by two boards: the Board of Directors comprising the top
managers of the various enterprises (appointed by the General Manager), and
the Trade Union Board comprising elected trade union officials. In addition,
a Supervisory Board, made up of representatives from NPO, SDB, OEGH, etc.,
reviews the operations of OKGT from time to time to ensure that the trust is
fulfilling its supply obligations and is being operated and developed in
accordance with regulations. Although the non-technical central departments
of OKGT have no direct link to the individual enterprises other than through
the Deputy General Manager for Economic and Financial Affairs, daily
operations are carried out efficiently by means of direct contact with the
functional department(s) concerned. The enterprises themselves are grouped by
area of responsibility under five Directors, with the exception of the Supply
Subsidiary of OKGT (AGEL) which was made financially independent as of
January 1, 1983.
4.04     The enterprises responsible for oil and gas exploration and
production in Hungary are the Geophysical Exploration Company (GKV), Lowlands
Petroleum Exploration Company (KV), Lowlands Hydrocarbon Production Company
(NKFV), and Transdanubian Petroleum Company (KFV). These enterprises come
under the supervision of the Mining Department of OKGT and are the primary



- 19 -
entities which will be involved in implementing the proposed project. CiKV'
fulfills the geophysical exploration needs of the national oil industry.*is
and NKFV are entrusted with exploring for and developing hydrocarbons '  the
area east of the Danube River. RV is responsible for drilling and logging
activities, while NKFV handles field development including undergroutnd gas
storage facilities, oil and gas production, gas imports and supply tc. large
consumers and OKGT supply companies, and facilities and equipment upkeep and
repair. KFV combines the exploration/development drilling and production
responsibilities of KV and NKFV in the area west of the Danube where the level
of activity is substantially less and is focussed more on exploration than
production. These enterprises have more than 35 years' operating experience
in the Hungarian petroleum industry. KV and KFV have also drilled oil, steam,
and water wells abroad in, for example, Iraq, Tunisia, and Greece as well as
various CMEA countries.
4.05     The Gas and Oil Transportation Company (GOV) is in charge of the
operation and maintenance of the country's natural gas trunkline system,
liquid hydrocarbons pipeline network, gas products transport by railway
tankwagons, and OKGT's telecommunications system, The Pipeline Construction
Company (KVV). carries out all pipeline construc.ion in Hungary and also works
abroad. In addition to the enterprises involved in the downstream operations
(4 in refining, 1 in products marketing, 6 in gas supply), there are 3
enterprises in machine manufacturing (AKG, BKG, DKG - OKGT manufactures about
50% of the oil field equipment it uses) and 2 in technical development
(OLAJTERV, SZKFI). OLAJTERV, the General Contracting and Designing Company
for the Oil Industry, is responsible for feasibility studies, engineering
design, and construction supervision of OKGT's investments, as implied by its
name, and is working toward extending its operations abroad. Finally, SZKFI,
the Hungarian Hydrocarbon Institute, with a staff of 1000, carries out
theoretical and applied research, trial manufacturing, pilot scale and/or
experimental production, etc. in the fields of hydrocarbon mining, petroleum
processing and petrochemistry, and gas development and utilization. Although
SZKFI's foreign contacts have mainly been with institutes in other CMEA
countries, it has also done some work with such well-known Western institutes
as Institut Francais du Petrole. OLAJTERV and SZKFI will also be involved in
the proposed project in their respective areas of responsibility.
Planning
4.06     OKGT is responsible for preparing and working within arnnual, five-
year, and 20-year plans. Although the plans are prepared at t.he trust head-
quarters, the enterprises are actively involved in their preparation.
Individual companies prepare their own annual programs and submit them to OKGT
for approval and consolidation. The representatives of the Central Geological
Office (KFH), which ultimately approve all exploration plans on behalf of IpM,
are also involved in the preparation work.. The approved program is then
returned to the enterprises for implemer_ation, where detailed quarterly
implementation programs are prepared; and these, along with the well drilling
programs, are approved by OKGT. Although closely supervising the
implementation (para. 4.07), OKGT does not normally interfere with the
activities of its subsidiaries. Any modification in the approved exploration
program has to be cleared through KFH, altbough this does not generally pose
any problem. In the case of the development plans, the decision of IpM is
needed for any modifications involving large expenditures. Although somewhat
cumbersome, the planning process in OKGT appears to be working well.

Supervision and Evaluation
4.07     Projects are supervised jointly by the Mining Department and
Investment Department of OKGT. The Mining Department's focus is mainly on the
realization of the planned objectives, while the Investment Department
supervises all aspects of project implementation from design and engineering
to costs. Detailed designs are submitted to the Investment Department
including technical specifications, detailed cost estimates, and
implementation schedules. Every item included in the investment program is
reviewed quarterly and cost estimates and implementation schedules are
updated. Cost control is strict and the project entities are authorized to
incur cost overruns of only 5% without prior headquarters approval.
4.08     Upon completion of a project, two project evaluation reports are
prepared.  A technical evaluation report is prepared soon after completion
analyzing implementation problems, schedules, and project costs. About one
year after start-up, an economic evaluation report is prepared analyzing
project results and achievement of project z>jectives.  OKGT's supervision and
project evaluation practices are generally satisfactory; they provide a sound
basis for an effective management information system.
Procurement
4.09     As the local goods and services are supplied by state enterprises
many of which are OKGT subsidiaries, project implementing agencies do their
own local prc^urement. However, the contracts have to be approved by OKGT's
Investment Department. The enterprises must refer to OKGT's Supply Subsidiary
(AGEL) for all foreign procurement and local procurement of important items
subject to standardization or to strict stock control, such as oil field
tubular materials. Presently OKGT/AGEL are not authorized to directly import
their requirements and have to use specialized foreign trade enterprises under
the Ministry of Foreign Trade as intermediaries. Contracts are signed in the
name of the foreign trade enterprise but have to be approved by OKGT.  The
responsibility for ensuring proper delivery of contracted goods, including
inspection, rests with the foreign trade enterprise. For their services the
foreign trade enterprises charge OKGT a fee corresponding to 1.5-2.0% of the
delivered price. In addition to being rather time consuming, OKGT's foreign
procurement under the present system costs somewhat more than it would if OKGT
handled it on its own; moreover, OKGT is deprived of the benefit of direct
contact with the manufacturers of the equipment.
Management Information System
4.10     OKGT has a good management information system enabling its management
to supervise the activities of 23 enterprises and meeting the information
requirements of IpM which oversees its operations. In addition to periodic
operational reports, quarterly progress reports are prepared on all ongoing
projects and implementation schedules and cost estimates are updated.
Projects are routinely evaluated both technically and economically upon
completion. Quarterly financial statements are prepared to keep the
management and national authorities abreast of operating results.

Staffing and Training
4.11     OKGT has about 46,600 employees, of which 14,600 come under the
supervision of the Mining Department. About 85% of the Mining Department's
staff are involved in petroleum exploration and production under GKV, KV,
NKFV, and KFV, and 15% in trunkline transmission of oil and gas (under GOV).
The central office of the Mining Department has 43 staff divided among three
sections, Exploration (geology/geophysics), Drilling, and Production
(including transportation). Although OKGT's staffing appears to be too large
compared to international petroleum industry standards considering its
production, this derives mainly from the fact that OKGT is also inrolved in
auxiliary activities, such as oil field services and equipment development and
construction, which the international petroleum industry normaliy leaves to
independent contractors. The professional and educational make-up of OKGT's
staff is shown below.

4.12     In OKGT about 75% of the higher level staff in the 4 enterprises
involved in exploration and development are university graduates or
technicians and 63% of the laborers are skilled, as compared to about 60% and
52%, respectively, for OKGT as a whole. OKGT's staff in this area are found
to be generally well-qualified and capable of carrying out the proposed
project. The importance of proper training and education is well-recognized
by OKGT. The bulk of the personnel have received their education at
universities in Hungary, although several of the high level specialists have
also obtained degrees at Soviet universities under Governmental scholarsl'ips.
OKGT itself has also been involved in designing some of the postgraduate
programs offered in the universities, and individual enterprises routinely
carry out apprenticeship training as well as some specialized training not
offered in the vocational schools.  The primary shortcomings of 0KGT's
technical staff are that their training tends to be focussed more on
theoretical applications than on practical experience and their exposure to
Western technologies and approaches is limited.

B. Current Operating Practices and Performance
4.13     OKGT is a well organized and efficient national oil company with 35
years of oil industry experience and a competent staff. OKGT's management
encourages decentralized management to the extent possible and appears to be
tolerating rivalry between operating companies sometimes at the expense of
operational efficiency. Company-wide there is a strong emphasis on cost
saving and labor reduction through automation. As in other Eastern European
countries, very high priority is placed on developing a national capability in
all facets of the petroleum industry, including manufacturing. This emphasis
on indigenization has resulted in OKGT technical staff's relative lack of
exposure to and operating familiarity with the latest technological develop-
ments in the industry. However, the awareness of this relative weakness is
there, as is the desire to learn from the experience of others and to catch up
with the rest of the world. This aspiration is also encouraged by the
Hungarian authorities as attested by the large volume of training and
consultancy services included in the present project.
Exploration
4.14     In both geological and geophysical exploration, OKGT possesses a
highly competent and motivated staff and in the past has been reasonably
successful in exploring for conventional oil and gas prospects. During the
1981-82 period, it has been able to add 40 TOE per meter drilled in new
recoverable reserves. This is a good record. However, its past efforts to
explore for deep prospects have be-r. hindered by the lack of proper
geophysical and drilling equipment and exposure to and competence in modern
techniques. As a result OKGT has failed in developing a prospect inventory
which would enable it to follow a balanced long-term exploration strategy.
Another area where improvement is called for is an interdiscipli-ary approach
to exploration. The very difficult geological conditions encountered in
Hungary cannot be successfully overcome unless the various professionals
engaged in exploration and petroleum engineering work as an efficient team.
Drilling
/ 15     OKGT operates an average of 24 drilling rigs and an equal number of
ampletion/workover rigs. At roughly 350,000m per year, the average annual
.1terage per rig (14,600 m/rig-year) is low by international standards. This
is due mainly to (a) low rotating times which average 33X of the total time
against an industry average of about 45%-: (b) the high proportion of
exploratory wells (nearly 60%) in the total drilling program which take longer
to drill and complete; and (c) lack of adequate equipment and materials. Some
40% of the drilling rigs are older than seven years and are in need of
improvement in solids control equipment, tubular materials and blowout control
systems. In order to save foreign exchange for mud materials and additives,
local substitutes are used often with less-than-satisfactory results.
Nevertheless, OKGT's drilling personnel are generally of a high caliber and
experienced, although lacking in practical operating experience in modern deep
drilling techniques. With reasonable assistance in deep well planning and
supervision, drilling fluids formulation and control and access to modern
equipment (to be provided under the project), they are expected to be capable
of overcoming the extremely difficult drilling problems encountered in deep
wells drilled in Hungary.



- 23 -
Production and EOR
4.16     OKGT's performance in production is good to excellent.  Field
facilities are well planned, built and maintained. There is a strong emphasis
on safety and environmental protection. Production parameters such as oil,
gas and water rates, reservoir pressures, fluid compositions are regularly
measured and reserve reports are periodically updated. There is a
conscientious effort to keep production costs down and to maximize the profits
of the enterprise.
4.17     In the Eastern European tradition, strong emphasis is placed on
secondary methods of production, especially waterflooding. Oil fields lacking
a strong natural water drive are waterflooded very early in their lives and in
some cases, such as some Algyo oil reservoirs, water is injected both from the
water/oil and gas/oil contacts. The tendency in producing gas reservoirs which
do not require new and large infrastructure in the form of transmission pipe-
Lines, gas plants, etc. is to produce them to capacity, without regard to
obtaining a sustained plateau production. Those that require new
infrastructure are normally produced in such a way as to obtain a sustained
plateau production during the economic life of the pipelines and gas plants.
These practices, although somewhat different from the normal approach adapted
in the international industry, are justifiable in view of the existence of an
extensive and largely amortized oil and gas infrastructure and a ready market.
4.18     On the other hand, OKGT's approach to EOR has many shortcomings.
A.lthough strong on the theoretical aspects, OKGT has not been successful in
following a systematic approach to EOR; projects have been initiated as quasi-
scientific research projects without a long-term development strategy aimed at
optimizing the results and focusing resources on those processes offering the
largest potential for economic application. Field pilot tests could not be
implemented efficiently due to extreme reliance on indigenous technology and
equipment, and lack of contact with the international petroleum industry which
would enable OKGT to benefit from practical operating know-how developed
abroad.
4.19     To summarize, OKGT is an experienced and well managed institution
endowed with capable staff in sufficienc numbers. During appraisal, the Bank
carried special assessment of the drilling and geophysical capability of OKGT
and found them generally satisfactory. The shortcomings identified in OKGT's
technical performance stem mainly from its lack of contact with the
international petroleum industry. This, along with access to state-of-the-art
technology is essential if OKGT is to perform satisfactorily its assigned
function. The proposed project with its emphasis on technology transfer is
designed to address these issues.
C. The Hungarian Industrial Financial System and OKGT's Financial Practices
Overall Industrial Financial Framework
4.20     The Government has regularly reviewed and modified the financial and
fiscal regulations affecting State enterprises. The most recent major change
was in January 1980 when the "New Economic Regulations" were introduced. The
basic principles underlying these regulations are to: (a) immediately reflect
in the domestic prices the international price of imported commodities,



- 24 -
particularly energy, and eventually bring most domestic prices in line with
world levels; (b) minimize the number of commodities under direct Government
price regulation; and (c) encourage efficiency and give more autonomy in
investment decisions to the enterprises. In this context the Hungarian
authorities have limited direct Government price regulations to three basic
industrial inputs and outputs: energy prices, wages as well as the cost of
credit. For all other commodities, the Government has issued guidelines that
industrial enterprises should not sell their output below costs and should
earn profits before income taxes within some range of proportion to the
resources the enterprises employ (para. 4.26). For commodities whose
international price levels are very much higher than the cost of domestic
production, such as crude oil and natural gas, the Governme-it uses fiscal
instruments (i.e., production taxes) to keep the profitability of the
enterprises within the guidelines and to prevent inflationary excess
industrial investment in the economy, which could result if enterprises have
surplus funds.
4.21     The Government hae also introduced the employee profit sharing scheme
whereby the enterprise management decides on a certain proportion of after tax
profits to be distributed tc the employees as an incentive. However, the
Government discourages a high level of profit sharing in relation to existing
wages primarily to prevent excess consumer purchasing power (i.e., consumer
demand) which could also be inflationary. Thus, a very high and progressive
tax surcharge is imposed on employee profit-sharing distributions. Finally,
interest rates on loans for working capital and investments have been set in
line with international levels, i.e., 12% to 16% per year. These interest
rates ensure positive real rates given the expected level of general price
inflation (7% to 8% per year) in recent years and e;rpected for the next few
years.
OKGT'S Financial Practices and the Effect of the Industrial Filancial
System on OKGT
4.22     OKGT's financial and accounting practices are described in Annex 4.03
and the salient features that affect the presentation of financial statements,
the profitability and the internal cash generation are discussed below. These
features are: consolidation of financial statements, accounting treatment of
exploration and development expenditures, production and import taxes on
petroleum, the determination of profits, and distributions frco  profit after
taxes.
4.23     All Government enterprises prepare financial reports in accordaace
with standard formats and procedures prescribed for various economic sectors
(e.g., industry, agriculture) by the Ministry of Finance. All enterprises
under OKGT, as well as OKGT itself, prepare these financial reports.  In
preparing its consolidated (trust-wide) financial statements, however, OKGT
does not generally follow the typical US or UK accounting ccnsolidation
practice of netting out intra-company transactions (e.g., sales and accounts
payable/receivable) in arriving at the consolidated financial statements. The
OKGT consolidated statements are simply the line by line addition of the
income statement and balance sheet items for all the enterprises under the
trust. During the project appraisal, however, the historical and projected
financial statements of OKGT were re-stated substantially in line with
generally accepted Western accounting consolidation principles; the re-stated



- 25 -
statements are the ones used in this appraisal report. Similar consolidation
principles will be applied in the financial reporting requirements (para.
6.11).
4.24     In its accounting treatment of exploration and development
expenditures, OKGT charges against current income a provision for the
replacement cost of the petroleum reserves being extracted. Under this
concept, the replacement cost of reserves covers all costs needed to discover
and to bring the new reserves to a producible state and includes geological
and geophysical surveys, as well as all drilling costs for both exploration
and development wells, but excluding the surface equipment, such as well heads
and flowlines. The replacement cost of reserves is referred to in the
financial statements as the "exploration and field development (i.e.,
drilling) allocation or provision." The amount of the provision is not
determined automatically from OKGT's costs but by the Ministry of Finance
based on the recommendation of the Ministry of Industry and OKGT. The
provision is generally revised every few years and can therefore be
interpreted as a standard cost type of valuation. In 1982 the provision was
equivalent to a total of Ft 480 per TOE (US$ 1.55/barrel of oil equivalent)
extracted. As a consequence of OKGT's more expensive and expanded exploration
and drilling program and the recommendations of the Bank, OKGT and the
Ministry of Industry discussed the need for increasing the provision with the
Ministry of Fina-,ce. In December 28, 1983, the Ministry of Finance issued a
directive stating the principle that the provision will be adjusted annually
to reflect OKGT's expanded and more difficult exploration and drilling
operations as well as rising costs. Furthermore, the production taxes will be
reduced to the same extent as the increase in the provision so that OKGT's
profitability will not deteriorate. A specific formula for calculating the
provision for 1983 (retroactive) through 1985 was included in the directive.
The reserve replacement cost method being used by OKGT is satisfactory.
4.25     OKGT's oil and gas selling prices to industrial, commercial and
household consumers are regulated by the Government. The petroleum product
prices are generally comparable to international levels with few exceptions
(para. 3.20). On the other hand, the natural gas selling price of OKGT varies
according to the users and ranges from about 60% to 80% of he most likely
fuel substitute, e.g., fuel oil and gas oil (para. 3.21). 1   Since OKGT's
final selling prices of petroleum are generally in line with international
prices, with the few exceptions noted earlier, and since these prices are very
much higher than domestic oil and gas extraction costs, the Government has
imposed a very high production tax of about Ft 6,62O/ton (US$ 20.74/barrel) of
oil and about Ft 2,860/1,000 m3 (US$ 66.51/1,000 m ) of natural gas.  In
addition, an import tax of about Ft 4,100/ton (US$ 14.14/barrel) of oil and
about Ft 400/1000 m3 (US$ 9.30/1,000 m ) of gas is imposed to bring the cost
to OKGT of imported Soviet petroleum, which is less than international levels
at present, in line with international costs. In the case of crude oil,
therefore, the production tax and the import tax account for about 79% and 55%
respectively of the transfer price from the extraction enterprises to the
1/      The internal transfer prices between the subsidiary enterprises are
determined by OKGT although it has to follow the Government's
profitability guidelines.



- 26 -
refining enterprises of OKGT. The extraction enterprises Wherefore have only
modest profits; most of the profits of OKGT are generated by the refining and
petroleum product marketing enterprises. In the case of natural gas, the high
level of production and import taxes coupled with lower price of gas relative
to its oil substitutes, have also left only a modest profit margin for the
extractioii enterprises. As a result of the Ministry of Finance's recent
directive described above (para. 4.24) OKGT's profitability will improve
significantly starting in 1984 (para. 6.06).
4.26     The Government established profitab lity guidelines in 1M'0 for
enterprises whose prices are not regulated 1 The measure of profitability is
the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of profit before income taxes to the sum
of the values of net fixed assets (at historical costs), raw material and
finished good inventories, and total wages. This ratio can be referred to for
convenience as the "before-tax return on total resources employed." For min-
ing and petroleum enterprises, this ratio is supposed to be abeut 10% (com-
pared to 15% for the chemical industry) although for OKGT, the ratio has
ranged from 6% to 8% in recent years. In reporting after tax profits, how-
ever, the Hungarian enterprises also deduct some portion of the Stat'o Develop-
ment Bank (SDB) loan repayment from income as a Cost, thus understa+:ing their
true profitability since loan repayments should not be considered as a cost
against income. In this appraisal report, profits have been re-stated to
include these SDB loan repayments. This latter convention will be followed in
the financial reporting requirements as well as for purposes of the financial
covenants under the proposed project.
4.27     A part of the after tax profit  is generally distributed by enter-
prises as profit sharing benefits to employees. The employee profit sharing
distribution is determined by the enterprise managemen  and is discretionary.
In the case of OKGT, the employee profit sharing has ranged from 20% to 30% of
after tax profit equivalent to about 25% to 35% of the cost of labor and
wages.  However, if the profit sharing distribution exceeds 2% of the total
employee wages, the Government imposes a very high progressive surtax, and in
the case of OKGT, about 65% of the profit sharing distribution is paid as
surtax to the Government.
4.28     Hungarian enterprises transfer funds or pay dividends to the Govern-
ment.  However, these transfers or dividends to the Government are not calcu-
lated on the basis of after tax profits, but rather, on the depreciation
charges. In general, 40% of the depreciation charges are transferred to the
Government. However, for purposes of determining the amount of the transfer,
part of the SDB loan repayments could be deducted from the depreciation
charges before the 40% formula is applied. In the case of OKGT, these trans-
fers have in fact ranged from 25% to 35% of the total depreciation charges
(equivalent to 25% to 45% of after tax profits) in recent years. The employee
profit sharing and the transfers to the Government together have therefore
1/       Regulated prices are maximum prices.
2/       The marginal income tax rate is about 53% covering both municipal and
national income taxes. However part of the SDB loan repayments could
be deducted from income for national income tax purposes,



- 27 -
ranged from 45% to 70% of OKGT's after tax profit in the last few years.
Starting in 1983, the Government imposed, as a temporary measure, a surtax of
9% on the profits and depreciation retained by public sector enterprises.
This rate was raised to 22% for 1984 and the surtax will most likely continue
until 1986 or 1987. The purpose of the surtax is to reduce overall investment
in the economy as part of the adjustment process.
4.29     Although it appears that the proportion of proftts retained by OKGT
is relatively moderate due to the employee profit sharix.g and transfers to the
Government, the fact lhat a provision for exploration and field drilling is
charged against revenues provides a substantial source of financing for
exploration and drilling which are typically considered as investments (and
therefore amortized over several years), rather than being immediately
expensed. In a conventional sense, therefore, OKGT finances a major
proportion of its investment program from internally generated functs. This
proportion has been in the 60%-70% range in the past several years with the
exception of 1980, a year of change and transition in the financial systems.
The proportion declined to about 47% in 1983 but is expected to range from 50%
to 60% during the remainder of the decade.  OKGT has performed in a
financially responsible manner within the industrial financial and fiscal
system described above. Its financial situation is expected to remain sound
in the future particularly in view of the financial undertakings it has agreed
with the Bank as part of the proposed project (para. 6.09).
V. THE PROJECT
A. Objective and Scope
5.01     The major objective of the proposed project is to support the
Government strategy in the petroleum sector, which aims at arresting the
decline of domestic oil and gas production through a ssries of priority
projects in exploration, field development and rehabilitation and enhanced oil
recovery (para. 3.13). The proposed project has been designed to assist OKGT,
the Borrower, in (i) defining an exploration strategy for the country; (ii)
developing a capability to delineate, rank and evaluate Hungary's petroleum
prospects; (iii) providing a framework for the evaluation of promising
exploration prospects which have so far remained undrilled due to difficult
drilling conditions and lack of adequate equipment and technology; (iv)
rationalizing its enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategy and improving its
capability to design ane implement complex EOR processes; (v) improving its
overall seismic exploration, drilling and production capability by equipment
upgrading, technology transfer through expatriate consultants, contractors and
training of its technical staff outside of Hungary; and (vi) enhancing its
access to investment funds both through Bank resources and through co-
financing.
5.02     When successfully completed, the project should enable OKGT (i) to
explore systematically and expeditiously for deep and ultra-deep prospects
where most of Hungary's remaining undiscovered hydrocarbon reserves are
believed to exist (para. 3.09); (ii) to institute a long-term EOR program
which is essential for maintaining Hungary's crude oil production at the
current level (paras. 3.10 and 3.11); and (iii) to meet its natural gas
production target in the medium- term (para. 3.15). In case the exploration



- 28 -
program included in the project results in major oil and gas discoveries, it
is expected that the international oil industry, which is already familiar
with Hungary's geology and conditions, will spontaneously generate proposals.
The need for assistance, if any, in handling these proposals would be decided
at that time.
5.03     The project is a time slice of OKGT's petroleum exploration and
development program, and has evolved from a series of discussions between OKGT
and the Bank. It aims at achieving the aforementioned objectives and has four
main components: (i) an exploration component comprising regional and
detailed eeological, geochemical and geophysical studies, seismic surveys,
exploratory well drilling and equipment upgrading; (ii) an EOR component
including EOR studies and one semi-commercial field demonstration scheme and
four pilot tests; (iii) the development of the Ulles and Endrod gas fields and
the rehabilitation of the non-associated gas production facilities in the
Algyo field; and (iv) technical assistance and training in the areas of
exploration, drilling and BOR and related studies.
B. Background
5.04     Despite severe geological complexities Hungary offers good prospects
for finding additional oil and gas reserves (para. 3.09). However, explora-
tion in Hungary faces considerable technical difficulties and substantial
efforts are required to realize the country's productive potential.
(Hungary's petroleum geology and hydrocarbons expectations are described in
Annex 5.01 and Annex 5.02 respectively).
5.05     So far OKGT concentrated its exploration on the relatively simpler
younger Tertiary realm and on structures immediately in contact with it.
Substantial areas have been only sketchily evaluated or not at all. However,
in order to sustain the present petroleum production levels into the next
decade, OKGT is now forced to explore the deeper and more complex geological
structures, This in turn requires access to state-of-the-art technology in
exporation and drilling (paras. 3.07 and 3.09). The exploration component
focusses on deep prospects in producing areas and on those areas (northwest
and southeast of Bakony Mountains) which, although presenting reasonable
hydrocarbon potential, still remain virtually unexplored due to serious
technical problems and lack of adequate technology. Besides geological,
geophysical and geochemical utudies, it includes seismic surveys and
exploratory well drilling. In addition, OKGT's seismic, well logging and deep
drilling equipment will be upgraded to enable it to cope with the difficult
geological conditions encountered.
5.06     Hungary's remaining recoverable oil reserves correspond to roughly 10
years' production at the current level of 2.0 million tons per year (para.
3.08). Recent exploration has resulted in the discovery of more gas (about 80%
of all hydrocarbon discoveries) than oil, and the trend is expected to
continue as deeper prospects are drilled. The application of advanced EOR
techniques is therefore essentidl to maintain Hungary's oil production at the
current level (para. 3.15). However, to realize the full poterLi'al of
Hungary's EOR prospects, OKGT will have to remedy its shortcomings in this
area, namely, (i) lack of a well-defined strategy and (ii) lack of access to
state-of-the-art technology (para. 4.18).



- 29 -
5.07     Due to the high quality of Hungarian crude oils (low specific gravity
and viscosity), miscible displacement methods using carbon dioxide or enriched
natural gas and improved waterflooding (polymer and micellar solution
flooding) are most likely to find the widest application. However, immiscible
gas injection in the Nagylengyel field and thermal recovery methods in t.le
Demjen field also offer good prospects because of the large amounts of
residual oil remaining in these fields. The EOR component of the project
focusses on formulating a long-term EOR strategy, providing much-needed
operating know-how and carrying out one field demonstration test and four
field pilot tests to investigate the feasibility of EOR processes which show
promise of important amounts of incremental oil recovery.
5.08     All the major gas producing areas in Hungary have passed their peak
productive years and require extensive rehabilitation in the form of
installation of field compressors, infill drilling and improvement of surface
production facilities. To slow down the decline of production from existing
gas fields, OKGT has formulated a gas field rehabilitation program
encompassing the 1981-90 period. However, despite extensive rehabilitation of
old fields (e.g., Algyo, Hajduszoboszlo and Sarkadkeresztur), the yeasly gas
production of existing fields is exNected to decline to 3.0 billion m /year in
1990 from the current 6.6 billion m /year.  In addition  21 undeveloped gas
fields with reserves ranging from 0.1 to 13.9 billion m are scheduled for
development during the same period (para. 3.15). Their total contribuiion to
Hungary's natural gas production is expected to be about 3.0 billion m (44%)
in 1990. Ulles and Endrod are the two largest among the gas fields to be
developed.
5.09     The gas field development and rehabilitation component of the project
comprises the 1Q84-88 time-slice of the development of the Ulles and Endrod
gas fields and the rehabilitation of Algyo non-associated gas reservoirs, all
located in southeast Hungary. The remaining recoverable non-associated gas
reserves of these three fields are estimated at 40.3 billion m . In 1q90
these three gas fields are expected to supply about 32% (2.1 billion m ) of
Hungary's total gas production.
5.10     Although well-trained, capable and experienced in conventional
petroleum industry operations, OKGT's technical staff lacks opeirating
experience in the state-of-the-art petroleum technology. Therefore, in order
to cope with the difficult exploration and drilling conditions encountered and
to 3uccessfully introduce and implement complex EOR processes, they require
outstde technical assistance and training. Tne technical assistance component
of the project is based on detailed assessments of OKGT's exploration,
drilling and production capabilities by the Bank staff and Bank-appointed
consultants (drilling and geophysical prospecting), and aims at providing
consultancy and training in the areas where deficiencies exist (paras. 4.14-
4.18).
C. Project Description
5.11     The main components of the project are:
-    Exploration, including (i) approximately 9,200 km of seismic
surveys; (ii) the drilling of 11 exploration wells 3,500-6,000 m
deep; and (Mi) the rehabilitation of OKGT's seismic, drilling
and well logging equipment;



- 30 -
Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Tests, comprising (i) field
demonstration of immiscible carbon dioxide injection in the
Nagylengyel field; (ii) two thermal recovery (one steamflood and
one wet in-situ combustion) pilot tests in the Demjen field; and
(iii) one improved waterflood (micellar solution injection) and
one enriched gas injection pilot test in the Algyo field;
Gas Field Development and iehabilitation, comprising the 1984-88
time slice of (i) the development of the Ulles gas field; (ii)
the development of the Endrod gas field; and (iii) the rehabil-
itation of the non-associated gas production facilities in the
Algyo field;
-    Consultancy and Technical Assistance in exploration, seismic
data acquisition, processing and interpretation, deep well
planning and supervision and the design and implementation of
advanced EOR methods;
-    Studies, including exploration, drilling and production studies
and a general gas utilization study; and
Training, comprising 59 training programs abroad in modern
petroleum industry practices in exploration, well drilling and
EOR.
5.12     The technical description of the main project components (exploration
and EOR) appears in Annex 5.03. A more detailed project description is
included in the Project File. Production forecasts with anid without the
project of the three gas fields to be developed/rehabilitated are reproduced
in Annex 5.04.
D. Project Implementation
5.13     The project will be implemented by the exploration and production
subsidiaries of OKGT (para. 4.04) under the overall supervision of OKGT. The
Geophysical Exploration Company (GKV) will be responsible for the seismic
exploration program; the Lowlands Hydrocarbon Production company (NKFV) will
be in charge of the Ulles and Endrod development, Algyo rehabilitation and
Demjen and Algyo EOR tests; the Transdanubian Petroleum Company (KFV) will be
responsible for the Nagylengyel field demonstration project and the
exploration wells located in its area of operation (Alpar, Kiskunhalas No. 1
and No. 2 and Szentgyorgyvolgyi); the Lowlands Petroleum Exploration Company
(KV) will be responsible for the remaining seven exploration wells.
1. Project Management
5.14     OKGT's Deputy General Manager for Technical Affairs will have overall
project management responsibility. His responsibility will include the
coordination of the subsidiary companies (GKV, KV, NKFV, KFV, OLAJTERV and
SZKFI) in charge of project implementation, consultants and expatriate service
companies, monitoring of implementation and various studies and evaluating and
reporting the progress of implementation. The day-to-day management of
drilling, seismic and construction activities will be the responsibility of



- 31 -
the subsidiary companies in whose areas of operation the projects are
located. This arrangement reflects the normal procedure of project management
in OKGT. The subsidiary companies enjoy a relatively high degree of
independence in operational matuers and are endowed with sufficient material
and human resources to accomplisb thetr tasks (para. 4.02).
5.15     A project task group in which major implementing subsidiaries/depart-
ments would be represented aL a sufficiently high level to ensure effective
project supervision, coordination of project entities and ar interdisciplinary
approach to petroleum operations, necessitated by the very complex exploration
and drilling conditions, will be set up at trust headquarters to assist OKGT's
Deputy General Manager for Technical Affairs In project management. This
group will be responsible for (i) taking decisions on technical aspects of the
project; (ii) supervising and coordinating the work of foreign consultants and
contractors; (iii) allocating resources provided under the project among
various project entities in order to ensure their efficient use; and (iv)
supervising and coordinating project-related activities of OKGT subsidiaries.
OKGT has set up a project task group with a composition and terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank in January 1984.
2. Engineering and Design
5.16     The design and engiheering of gas field surface facilities including
gathering lines, treatment facilities, compressor stations and pipelines have
been prepared by the General Contracting and Designing Company for the Oil
Industry (OLAJTERV), an OKGT subsidiary specializing in the dcsign,
engineering and construction of oil and gas production and processing
facilities. This is an experienced company with several foreign projects to
its credit. OLAJTERV's designs for the gas fields proposed for development
and rehabilitation have been scrutinized by the Bank staff and found up to the
standards of the international petroleum industry.
5.17     The exploration studies will be conducted by OKGT's Exploration
Section with the help of international consultants. The EOR studies and tl.s
design of the field pilot tests will fall under the responsibility of the
Hungarian Hydrocarbon Institute (SZKFI) which will be assisted by
international consultants, the staff of the engineering departments of
operating companies and OLAJTERV. These arrangements are satisfactory.
3. Project Execution
5.18     Seismic Surveys.  With the exception of 600 line-km of 3-D seismic
where the services of an experienced foreign co,itractor will be utilized for
field acquisition, processing and interpretaticn, all seismic surveys will be
conducted by the Geophysical Exploration Company (GKV) which operates 12
crews. GKV will be assisted by expatriate consultants in field data
acquisition, processing and interpretation and iks equipment will be
modernized by the addition of improved recording instruments for three crews
and the expansion of its seismic data processing facilities. GKV's capability
has been assessed by the Bank appraisal team and has been found adequate.
About 1,000 line-km of seismic data will be subjected to special processing by
international contractors.



- 32 -
5.19     Well Drilling, Completion and Logging.  Wells included in the project
will be drilled and completed by OKGT's subsidiary companies (KV and KFV) with
the assistance of international consultants in the areas of well planning and
supervision, drilling fluids engineering and completion, and the assistance of
international oil field service contrpc;.ors in the areas of formation
stimulation and logging of deeper sections.
5.20     Currently, OKGT operates 24 drilling rigs and drills approximately
350,000 m per year. Generally, OKGT's drilling personnel are well-trained and
experienced in conventional drilling operations (para. 4.15). OKGT's deep
well drilling capability has been assessed by a Bank-appointed consultant and
has been found satisfactory in general. OKGT has at least three deep drilling
rigs and a sufficient number of experienced drilling personnel capable of
drilling the eleven deep exploratory wells included in the project with a
reasonable amount of help from foreign experts with practical experience in
modern deep drilling technology, strict adherence to the established operating
norms of the international petroleum industry and access to state-of-the-art
equipment, materials and technology.
5.21     In view of this, OKGT should be able to drill the project wells
without increasing its drilling force and at a substantially lower cost than a
foreign drilling contractor whose success cannot be a priori assumed. (For
the nine deep wells whose locations and drilling programs are determined, the
cost differential between force-account drilling and contract drilling is
estimated at US$22.2 million or 38.6% of the base cost). Moreover, OKGT would
use the improved drilling equipment procured under the project and the
technological know-how acquired in project wells to continue its exploratory
drilling program beyond the end of the present project which represents but a
small part of OKGT's long-term exploratory drilling program. In view of the
above, force-account drilling of the project wells is deemed to be the most
suitable arrangement.
5.22     In order to ensure the implementation of this arrangement swhereby
OKGT's drilling activity is assisted by expatriate consultants and oil field
service companies, assurances have been obtained at negotiations that OKGT
will hire on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, specialized
foreign consultants and/or firms to perform the following services: selection
of major drilling equipment and materials, drilling fluids engineering, design
and supervision of drilling, completion, testing and stimulation operations
and other specialized drilling services such as well deviation, fishing and
blow-out control, etc. as required.
5.23     Construction.  The facilities in the fields, such as roads, gathering
lines, wellhead facilities, etc. will be built by the construction and
installation crews of operating companies (KFV and NKFV) in whose areas of
operations the projects are located. Major oil and gas pipelines and
separators will be built by the Pipeline Construction Company (KVV). The
installation of compressor stations and gas processing facilities will be
entrusted to Petroleum Machine Works, Budapest (BKG). Major construction
activities will be coordinated by OLAJTERV. Facilities built by these
organizations have been visited by the Bank staff and have been found to be
well designed and built. These arrangements are satisfactory.

4. Implementation Schedule
5.24     The project would be implemented over a period of approximately five
years starting from late 1983 and ending in late-1988. Annex 5.05 shoWs the
proposed implementation schedule. This schedule is prepared on the basis of
OKGT's recent performance and is achievable.
E.  Project Cost Estimate
5.25     The total financing required for the project is estimated at US$519.7
million (Ft 22,348 million) including customs duties, physical and price
contingencie.3, interest during construction and the front-end fee on the
proposed Bank loan. The foreign exchange component is estim9ted at US$243.6
million equivalent, or 47% of the total financing required.i' Detailed
project cost estimate appears in Annex 5.06 and are summarized below:

5.26     The estimate of project costs is based on detailed lists of
equipment, materials and services prepared by OKGT and mid-1983 prices. A
physical contingency of 2S% was applied to the base cost of exploratory wells
and EOR projects and takes into account the difficult drilling conditions as
well as the experimental character of the field EOR tests. Physical
Indirect foreign exchange requirements are estimated at US$67.2 million
(included in the US$243.6 million).



- 34 -
contingencies of 15% on field development projects and 10% on all other cost
items are considered to be adequate. For local engineering and consultancyp
the rates prevailing between OKGT group of companies (Ft 4,600 or US$107 per
man-month) were used. The expected average cost per man-month for the various
consultancy services required (142 man-months) is US$22,000 including foreign
travel and subsistence. Price contingencies were calculated assuming annual
escalation rates of 8.5% in 1983, 8.0% in 1984, 7.5% in 1985 and 7.0%
thereafter for local csts and 8.0% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7.0% in 1985 and
6.0% thereafter for foreign costs. These rates reflect the current estimates
for price increases in Hungary and major petroleum equipment and service
supplying countries. The phasing of expenditures appears in Annex 5.07 and
can be summarized as follows:
US$ Million
Calendar Year           1984      1985      1986       1987       1988       Total

P.  Financing Plan
5.27     OKGT will provide 40% of the financing requirement through
internally-generated funds (i.e., provisions for exploration and development
drilling, delceciation and profit). The balance will be coverll by the
proposed World Bank loan and funds supplied by the Government.   Depending on
market conditions, a "B" loan type of co-financing operation will be pursued
in conjunction with the Industrial Export and Restructuring Prrject also being
proposed for World Bank assistance. The ceo-financing operation will be on the
order of US$200-300 million for both projects and, once available, will
substitute for part or all of the Government funds. The project financing
plan will be as shown below.
Project Financing Plan
Ft            US$            % of

Total Financing             22,348.0          519.7       100.0
OKGT's expected contribution to the project's financing plan would represent
about 18% of its internal cash generation and 8% of its total financing
requirements during 1984-88. The financial forecasts (paras. 6.07 and 6.08)
indicate that unless the Government increases the unit provisioni for
exploration and field drilling, reduces the production and import tax rates,
2/  In the financial projections, the Government funds are assumed to be
provided through a loan from the State Development Bank (SDB).

and raises the gas prices of OKGT, it could experience a substantial financing
gap for its overall investmenLs. Furthermore, should the expected co-
financing operation be delayed or be unable to provide sufficient foreign
exchange needed for the timely implementation of the project, OKGT will need
access to other foreign exchange resources. During negotiations, therefore,
agreement has been obtained from the Government that it will ensure that: (i)
OKGT could generate from its own operations a substantial proportion of the
financing requirements for the project; and (ii) OKGT will be provided with
sufficient funds, inciuding funds from external co-financing sources if
available, to meet the financing requirements of the project.
5.28     The proposed Bank loan of US$90.0 million would finance about 17X of
the total and 37% of the foreign exchange financing needed for the project.
The loan would be made to OKGT which would bear the interest rate and foreign
exchange risk. The loan would be guaranteed by the Government, and OKGT would
pay the Government the equivalent of 10% of the Bank interest rate. Assuming
a Bank lending rate of about 10.1% per annum, the total cost of funds to OKGT
would be about 11.1%. This would be in line with the current cost of SDB
funds (14%) after adjusting for the interest and foreign exchange risks borne
by OKGT under .the proposed loan.

5.30     The equipment, materials and services proposed for Bank financing are
suitable for international competitive bidding (ICB). Worldwide there exist a
large number of companies which are capable of supplying these items and
eligible to bid under the Bank guidelines. In the current depressed condition
of the oil field supply industry, competition is expected to be keen.
5.31     Procurement of items proposed for Bank financing will be through ICB
according to Bank guidelines with the exception of approximately US$4.0
million (4.4%) of goods and services which will be procured through limited
international bidding (LIB) with quotations being solicited from at least four
suppliers from three different countries. Limited international bidding will
be restricted to imported items estimated to cost less than US$300,000
equivalent each (CIF basis), as well as items in limited international supply
whose delivery periods are critical to the timely completion of the project,
such as high-pressure and temperature valves, control equipment, special
packers and bottom-hole assemblies. For internationally bid items to be
financed by the Bank, the list of goods and services will require prior Bank
approval and bidders will be pre- or post-qualified in accordance with
criteria acceptable to the Bank which would be specified in the bidding
documents in the case of post-qualification. Consultants will be selected
according to the Bank guidelines. There are no qualified local suppliers
capable of providing the goods and services selected for Bank financing.
5.32     Oil field equipment and materials worth US$170.2 million will be
procured by OKGT under its own procurement regulations. Among those, locally
produced goods will be procured from the Hungarian suppliers which are the
sole sources for the items under consideration. Those that are to be imported
will be procured by limited international tendering through Hungarian foreign
trade enterprises (para. 4.09). US$31.6 million worth of oiL field and
exploration services, US$9.6 million worth of civil works, US$38.6 million
worth of construction, installation and testing services and US$8.6 million
worth of engineering will be supplied by OKGT subsidiary companies (paras.
5.16 - 5.23). Drilling and completion services estimated to cost US$43.1
million will be done on a force account basis (paras. 5.19 - 5.21).
Consultancy and training services costing US$4.5 million will be procured
under the Bank guidelines for the use of consultants.
5.33     It is estimated that the number of bid packages for Bank financing
will approximate 100. Prior Bank review of the bidding and contract documents
of all packages estimated to cost more than US$300,000 CIF (approximately 45%)
will be undertaken. Packages costing less than this threshold value will be
s'.bject to post review by the Bank.
5.34     The procurement of the items to be financed by the Bank will be the
responsibility of the Hungarian Trading Company of Machines and Equipment for
the Chemical Industry (CHEMOKOMPLEX) which is also handling the procurement
under the Loan No. 2317-HU on behalf of OKGT.  At the request of OKGT and on
the basis of technical specifications prepared by it, CHEMOKOMPLEX will
prepare the bidding documents for approval by the Bank and all further
procedures until the final contract award will be processed through
CHEMOKOMPLEX. Bids will be evaluated jointly by OKGT and CHEMOKOMPLEX. In
order to ensure close cooperation and enhance the efficiency of procurement,
CHEMOKOMPLEX will establish a special office (staffed in part by personnel to
be seconded from OKGT) to be responsible solely for the procurement under the



- 37 -
project. This office will be supervised by a joint corimittee formed of the
representatives of OKGT and CHEMOKOMPLEX. These arrargements are
satisfactory.
H. Disbursements
5.35     The proposed allocation of the Bank funds is shown below.
Disbursements are expected to be completed by December 1988. The loan closing
date would be June 30, 1989, six months after the expected project completion.
The estimated schedule of disbursements for the Bank loan appears in Annex
5.08). The schedule is based on the following assumptions: (i) oil field
service charges will be disbursed three months after the services have been
performed; and (ii) materials and equipment will be procured six months prior
to actual use in the project. These assumptions reflect the experience gained
under recent petroleum projects.

I. Reporting Requirements
5.36     Agreement has been obtained during negotiations that the Bank will
receive monthly and quarterly progress reports from OKGT according to agreed
forrmat and content. All reports will be submitted within 45 days after the
end of the relevant period, with the exception of monthly reports which will
be submitted within 10 days. 0KGT will also prepare a Project Completion
Report within aix months after the loan closing date.
J. Ecology and Safety
5.37     In Hungary the use of land for industrial projects is governed by
strict laws and regulations. Any industrial enterprise requiring the use of
agricultural and forest land is obliged to obtain authorization from relevant
government authorities. After usage, that portion of the land not required
for production such as access roads to construction or drilling sites and
locations of abandoned wells has to be reclaimed by or at the expense of the
project beneficiary. In accordance with its established practice, OKGT will
keep new land requirements for the above projects at a minimum.



- 38 -
5.38     The main sources of pollution attributable to project related
activities are well effluents (oil, gas and produced formation water),
chemicals used in production operations (methyl alcohol, surfactants and
ammonia) and drilling fluids while drilling. The well effluents, except
during well testing operations, are handled in closed systems to minimlze
losses by leakage. After treatment the produced formation water and the waste
chemicals resulting from production operations are injected into deep wells to
prevent the pollution of fresh water sources. All necessary precautions will
be taken during design and construction of surface production fa-ilities to
minimize the chances of overpressurization and corrosion. Installations where
well effluents are collected and treated will be provided with safety valves,
containment walls, drain basins and drain removal pumps. Flares will be
provided for burning excess gases. During well tests, the relatively small
amounts of oil and water produced are dumped into special pits where the oil
is disposed of by burning and the water let to evaporate. The produced gas is
burned at a flare to minimize fire and explosion hazards.
5.39     To minimize the chances of a blow-out during drilling, rigs will be
equipped with dual blow-out preventers and remote control systems. Regular
fire and blow-out control drills are carried routinely on all OKGT rigs.
Surface installations will be designed and constructed according to
established safety standards and will be provided with adequate alarm and fire
fighting facilities. All production wells will be equipped with down-hole
safety systems to prevent blow-outs or oil spills which could result from
damaged wellhead equipment or flow lines. These arrangements conform to
normal petroleum industry practices and are satisfactory.
K. Project Risks
5.40     The risks associated with the project are those inherent in petroleum
exploration and production. In the proposed project these can be summarized
as follows: (i) geological risks; (ii) drilling risks; (iii) uncertainties
associated with gas fields' reserves and productivities; and (iv) failure of
the EOR methods to result in economic incremental oil recovery. These risks
are further discussed and evaluated quantitatively in Chapter VII, Economic
Justification.
5.41     In order to minimize che geological risks, the following provisions
are included in the design of the proposed project: (a) seismic programs have
been so selected as to evaluate typical problem areas in each basin which
should help reduce the number of dry holes; (b) drilling would be focussed on
prospects which carry high geological ranking; (c) the entire exploration
program would be reassessed by the Bank and OKGT on an annual basis;
significant data that might alter the program could be reviewed as they become
available; and (d) all well locations would be evaluated with detailed infill
seismic and fully mapped before drilling was approved and the locations,
depths and drilling programs for Bank-financed wells will be submitted to the
Bank for approval on a no-objection basis.
5.42     The risks associated with drilling are minimized by the introduction
of high-grade equipment and materials and foxtign expertise in well planning
and supervision. The reserves and productivities of the gas fields to be
developed and/or rehabilitated are determined on the basis of a large number
of delineation wells and, in the case of Algyo, fifteen years' production



- 39 -
history. Yet there is the risk that the gas reservoirs may not live up to
expectations, a risk inherent in all petroleum development projects. However,
in view of the large data basis and the conservative approach of SZKFI to
reserve determination, this risk is small. The BOR field tests are planned on
the basis of past experiments which were encouraging. However, given the
heterogeneity of oil reservoirs, the results obtained may preclude field-wide
application of processes to be investigated due to economic reasons. To
minimize the economical and physical risks associated with the EOR component,
the proposed designs will be reviewed by foreign experts who will assist OKGT
in implementing, monitoring and evaluating them. Overall project risks are
acceptable.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Scope of Financial Analysis
6.01     The financial analysis of OKGT and the proposed project focusses on:
(i) the trend in OKGT's petroleum exploration and production costs; (ii) the
effect of the project on OKGT's overall investment financing requirements;
(iii) the ability of OKGT to earn reasonable profits and self-finance a
substantial proportion of its investment program; (iv) the debt servicing
ability of OKGT; and (v) the financial rate of return of the revenue earning
components of the project.
B.  Trends in OKGT's Petroleum Exploration and Production Costs and
Investments
6.02     OKGT's costs of petroleum extraction (excluding the production taxes)
have increased sharply in the last five years. The average crude oil
extraction cost is estimated to be about Ft 1366/ton (US$4.29/barrel) in 1983
compared to an average of only Ft 756/ton (US$2.38/barrel) in 1979, reflecting
an average annual cost increase of about 16%.  Similarly, the 3average cost of
gis extraction in 1983 is estimated to be about Ft 7i0/l00O  m  (US$16.74/1000
m ) compared to about Ft 379/1000 m3 (US$8.81/1000 m ) in 1979, an average
cost increase of about 18% per year (Annex 3.05). These rapid rises in costs
are not due to inefficiencies. Rather, they reflect the increasingly
expensive operations inherent in producing from petroleum fields that have
passed their peak productive years, as well as the more expensive exploration
required to replenish petroleum reserves given that the relatively easier
areas to explore have been almost fully covered and new exploration efforts
are increasingly conducted in more difficult and expensive to explore areas
(para. 3.09). As mentioned earlier, the higher cost of exploration and field
development is more or less imuediately reflected in OKGT's cost of production
through the provision for exploration and field development (para. 4.24).
Furthermore, advanced EOR methods >s well as field rehabilitation investments
will be increasingly needed in the existing petroleum fields thereby
increasing both depreciation charges and operating costs. Thus, the rising
trend in OKGT's extraction costs is expected to continue through the end of
the decade although at a somewhat lower rate of about 11% per year compared to
the recent past.



- 40 -
6.03     The investments of OKGT for petroleum exploration and development
averaged Ft 740 per TOE produced in 1976-1980. This amount of investment per
unit of petroleum extracted is expected to increase to Ft 1015 per TOE
(US$3.19/1:arrel of oil equivalent) produced in 1981-1985 and forecast to sach
Ft 1619 per TOE (US$5.09/barrel of oil equivalent) produced in 1986-1990
OKGT's investment levels are in line with the expenditures of the Western
petroleum industry and reflect the intensive nature of OKGT's investment
program which is designed to rapidly assess the potential of new geological
provinces as well as to develop sophisticated technologies aiming at
increasing recovery rates from existing reserves.
C.  Recent and Projected Financial Forecasts
6.04     The table below summarizes OKGT's recent (1979-83) and projected
(1984-88) income statement and indicates the structural changes in the income
statement that are expected during the project implementation period. The
assumptions used in the financial forecasts are described in Annex 6.01 and
the detailed income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets are
shown in Annex 6.02. The main assumptions used in the financial forecasts
are: (i) the provision for exploration and field development will be adjusted
each year to practically equal expenditures by 1985; (ii) the production taxes
will be reduced to the extent the exploration and field development provision
is increased, while the import tax rates on oil and gas will remain at their
present levels; (iii) the wage rates will increase at an average of 5% per
year but the cost of the other operating items (excluding provisions,
depreciation, taxes and wages) will remain at current levels; and (iv) the
selling prices for petroleum products will remain at current levels. The
rationale for these particular cost and price assumptions is that changes in
OKGT's revenues as a consequence of changes in international prices of oil,
which will be reflected in OKGT's selling prices, would be largely offset by
changes in the cost of petroleum imports from the USSR as well as changes in
the other operating costs. Thus, the operating margin of OKGT would more or
less be the same whether the forecasts assume that selling prices will remain
at current levels in combination with import costs also remaining at current
levels, or whether the forecasts assume that selling prices and import costs
both change with the international price of oil.
/ 1976-80 investment figures are in current terms. Values fur 1981-85 and
1986-90 are in constant 1983 Ft (para. 3.12).

a/  Gross revenue less sales taxes on gasoline which OKGT collects on behalf of the
Government.
6.05     As indicated by the table above, operating costs as a proportion of
net revenue is expected to fall slightly from 93¢5% during the last five
years, to about 91.1% in the next five years. Within the operating costs, the
share of production and import taxes would remain substantial. The share of
the provision for exploration and field development will increase from 3% to
4.6% of revenues, as a consequence of the assumption that the unit provision
would be increased to practically match actual expenditures by 1985. If the
unit provision for exploration and field development remained at the 1983
level of Ft 48 per million kcal of petroleum extracted, the total provision
during the forecast period (1984-1988) would only be about one-half (Ft 19
billion) the amount shown above. The decline in the proportion of operating
cost to revenue is however slightly more than offset by the rise in the share
of interest expense, from 1.5% to 3% of revenues respectively. The rise in
interest cost is due to both larger loans and higher interest rates on recent
loans. With income taxes also taking a marginally larger share of revenue
(from 2.0% to 2.7%), net proftt after taxes improves only slightly from 3.0%
to 3.2% of revenues during the two five-year periods. As discussed below
(para. 6.06), OKGT's profitability will improve starting in 1984 as a
consequence of the Ministry of Finance action described earlier (para. 4.24).
6.06     The year-to-year trenda in OKGT's financial ratios and indicators are
shown below. These indicators show that given the assumptions used in the
financial forecasts: (i) the debt service coverage ratio of OKGT will stay
above 1.5; (ii) the profits (before taxes) will be at least 8% of resources
used and (iii) the internal cash generation as a proportion of investments and
increases in net working capital will range from 50% and 60% which is
satisfactory. As mentioned earlier in para. 4.26, the Hungarian enterprises
use a profitability measure relating profit before taxes to the values of net
fixed assets, inventories and annual wages paid by the enterprise. This
measure is referred to in this report as the return on resources used (para.
4.26) and correlates well with the conventional return after taxes on net
assets usually used by the Bank in its financial evaluation of projects shown
below. In the financial covenants (para. 6.0)), the concept of return on
resources is therefore used since it is familiar to OKGT and the Government.

b/ Profit after taxes plus interest expenses as a percentage of net fixed assets

c/ Profit before taxes as a percentage of net fixed assets in operation plus
inventories plus wages. This is the profitability measure presently used by
Hungarian enterprises.
d/ Internal cash generation is derived in the table following para. 6.07. Net
working c.pital is current assets less current liabilities exclusive of the
current portion of long term debt and incentive sharing fund provisions. The
low parcentage in 1980 is due to a large increase in net working capital for the
buill-up of gas and petroleum stocks.
6.07     OKGT's financing requirements for both investments and increases in
net working capital during 1984-88 (Ft 102 billion) will be about two-thirds
more than during 1979-83. Slightly more than one-half of this increase in
financing requirement is due to the proposed project, which will account for
about 22% of the total financing requirements during the next five years.
There is also a marked difference in the financing requirement for increases
in net working capital. During 1979-83, there was a very sharp increase in
net working capital, by almost Ft 13 billion, accounting for 21% of the total
financing required. This increase was due to the build-up of natural gas and
petroleum stocks in 1980. In contrast, during 1984-88, increases in net
working capital are expected to be less than Ft 1 billion, or 1% of the total
financing required. The balance of the financing requirements, about Ft 101
billion, will be investments. This level of investuents is about twice that
for the 1979-83 period. The financing requirements and financing sources are
summarized in the following table.

All enterprises are required to maintain reserves (which are deposited at the National Bank
of Hungary) up to a maximum equal to 6% of next fixed assets in operation plus inventories
plus wages (i.e. resources employed). To build up this reserve, about 20% of after tax pro-
fit each year is set aside for this purpose. The reserve can be used by the enterprise for
financing investments, debt repayment and permanent increases in working capital with the
permission of the Ministry of Finance.
6.08     The pattern of financing sources in 1984-88 is expected to be
different from that of the previous five years in three major respects.
Firstly, while total internal cash generation is still expected to between 50%
and 60% of the financing required in 1984-88 as in 1979-83, the contribution
of retained profits and depreciation could decline slightly from 18% of total
financing required in 1979-83 to 16% in 1984-88, while the share of the
provisions for exploration and field development could increase from 35% to
42% respectively. This shift is a direct result of the assumption in the
financial forecast that the unit rate of import taxes will remain at present
levels, while the unit rate of the provision for exploration and development
will increase to practically match actual expenditures by 1985. Should this



- 44 -
latter assumption be dropped, then the provision for exploration and field
development will only be about one-half the amount forecast for 1984-88,
creating an additional finari,~iei   grp of about Ft 20 billion, equivalent to 20%
of the financing requirements. Secondly, the forecasts for 1984-88 assume the
minimum level of new Government equity infusions, thereby reducing the share
of L'Iis source from 21% in L979-83, to only 2% in 1984-88, of the total
finai cing required.

6.09     To ensure that OKGT's financial position will be satisfactory, during
negotiations agreement was obtained from OKGT that it will take the necessary
actions to ensure it: (i) earns reasonable profits before taxes in relation
to the resources it uses (i.e., 8% or more); and (ii) adjusts the provision
for exploration and field development annually to at least equal 80% of its
actual t.nxpenditures for such activizies.  Agreement was also reached with OKGT
that it will take all necessary actlons to ensure that its long-term debt
service coverage ratio and its current ratio will be at least 1.5 and that its
long-term debt/equity ratio will be at most 60:40.
E. Financial Rate of Return of Project Components
6.10     The rehabilitation and development of the three gas fields, namely
Algyo, Endrod and Ulles, as well as the CO2 enhanced oil recovery field
demonstration at Nagylengyel, are the revenue earning components of the
proposed project. IA financial evaluation of these components on the basis of
incremental costs- and benefits expressed in constant 1983 Forints, has been
undertaken (Annex 6.03). Sensitivity tests are shown in Annex 6.04. The base
case financial rates of return are all satisfactory. In the case of the gas
components, the satisfactory financial returns are due to the natural gas
liquids (NGL) produced with the gas. NGL are highly profitable but natural
gas sales alone are barely profitable. Without the NGL, the base case
finaneial rate of ret'irn of the gas components drops to less than 3%. In the
case of Nagylengyal EOR component, OKGT has requested the Government to review
and determine an appropriate level of production tax for the oil to be
recovered through EOR mechods. In 1983, the production tax on the
conventionally produced Nagylengyel oil was Ft 6,595 per ton, which was 96% of
the selling price (Ft 6,890 or US$160 per ton) for the somewhat hedvy oil from
this field.  In general, oil produced through EOR techrinues should not be
taxed as highly as oil extracted by conventional (primary) methods because of
the relatively higher capital and operating costs associated with EOR
applications. The Government is expected to decide on this particular
production tax issue shortly.  Tn the meaitime, the base case financial
analysis without any production tax yields a financial rate of return of 8%
after income taxes. With a production tax of Ft 1,500 per ton (similar to the
1983 tax on NGL), the return drops to 5%. A ten percent increase in the
Nagylengyel oil price would raise the return to about 10%. The general level
of production taxes has been addressed by the Ministry of Finance directive of
December 28, 1983 (para. 4.24) and by the proposed financial covenants.
/  Incremental financial costs exclude the provisions for exploration and
field development.

F. Auditing and Reporting
6.11     The financial information and control system within OKGT is
satisfactory. There is an internal auditing group. In addition, OKGT is
subject to financial auditing by the Ministry of Finance. However, the
frequency and scope of this particular external audit does not meet the
min!mum requirements of the Bank. The audit is primarily concerned with tax
collection and is generally carried out every two years. During each audit,
one or two special areas or major accourte, such as sales and marketing or
inventories, would be investigated in depth in addition to the tax
liabilities. All enterprises, OKGT included, also submit to the Ministry of
Finance at the end of the second, third and fourth quarters of the year income
statements and balance sheets for routine review as well as for general
statistical compilation. During negotiations, agreement was reached with OKGT
that it will submit to the Bank: (i) within six months of the end of the
fiscal year, short form annual audit re 'orts on its consolidated financial
performance and situation, consistent in scope and content with Bank  I/
guidelines and audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,_  In
this context the principles of consolidation and the concept of profit (para.
4.26) generally accepted in the Western accounting profession will be used;
and (ii) within 45 days of the end of each six-month period, unaudited income
statements and balance sheets as of the end of the period covered.
G. Insurance
6.12     Hungarian enterprises are not -equired to insure normal business
risks with outside insurers. A company can act as its own insurer and support
major risks/losses primarily through its reserves. OKGT however has chosen to
insure all its inventories and fixed assets with the State Insurance
Company. OKGT's insurance policy provides for indemnity equivalent to 100% of
the replacement cost of the assets. This arrangement is satisfactory.
/  The Bank and the Hungarian authorities have identified an acceptable
independent auditor (a Hungarian enterprise) for this purpose.

VII.   ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. General Economic Considerations
7.01     The medium and long-term supply of adequate quantities of energy, and
more particularly oil and gas, at reasonable cost is one of the most critical
economic issues facing Hungary today. The country is presently dependent on
imports for nearly 75% of its oil consumption and 40% of its gas consumption
(equivalent to nearly 60% of its total petroleum consumption). Remaining
recoverable petroleum reserves are equivalent to only about :wo years of oil
consumption and about ten years of gas consumption (or an average of about six
years of total petroleum consumption). The country is presently trying to
stretch for as long as practical the period over which these proven reserves
will be depleted to avoid being almost completely dependent on imported
petroleum in the 1990's. This would mean continued reliance on imported
petroleum for an increasing proportion of consumption in the forseeable
future. Such an eventuality would have serious adverse repercussions on the
balance of payments and the economic structural adjustment now underway in the
country. To reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports Hungary has taken
steps to promote energy conservation, including large increases in the price
of petroleum products which are now at international levels. The government
and the national oil company have also decided to increase exploration efforts
and to experiment with enhanced oil recovery methods to increase the recovery
rate from existing reserves. These efforts are justified by the existence of
currently unexplored prospective areas as well as by the likelihood of
producing additional volumes of oil and gas economically through enhanced
recovery.
B. Economic Justification for Exploration Component
7.02     Most of Hungarian sedimentary basins are prospective, and many areas
are still under-explored or unexplored. Even in the producing basins
important oil-bearing horizons are seriously under-evaluated due to lack of
structural definition and adverse drilling conditions. Hungarian geologists
estimate the 5emaining recoverable oil and gas reserves at 55 million tons and
300 million m , respectively, on the basis of volumetric calculations applying
uniform recovery factors per unit volume of prospective formation. Little
account is taken of the strong variations in oil geological parameters.
During appraisal an alternative evaluation was carried out by OKGT and Bank
staff using an improved statistical method which takes into account these
variations. (For details see Annex 5.02). This evaluation showed that the
remaining recoverable gil and gas potential could be as high as 130 million
tons and 400 billion m , respectively. While these estimates are subject to
wide variations due to ranges of individual parameters, they are indicative of
a large potential for additional exploration and are a reasonable basis for
developing the programs included in the project. (The differences between the
two evaluations, particularly regarding oil, is attributed to the fact that
the statistical method is more advanced and fully takes into account localized
geological variations, while the volumetric method previously used considers
only historical proportions of oil and gas discovered). The technical
conditions are such that a carefully designed exploration program is expected
to result in an average economic finding cost (exploration and appraisal) for
petroleum of about US$16 (1983 prices) per TOE. The related economic field
development and production costs are estimated to average about US$20 and US$6



- 47 -
per TOE respectively. Thus the total average economic cost for exploration,
development and production is estimated at about US$42 per TOE, which is to be
compared to the average economic value 5  the additional recoverable reserves
of about US$185 per TOE at 1983 prices.-
7.03     The exploration component included in the proposed project, which
accounts for about 47% of the total estimated project cost, has been carefully
designed to meet specific objectives (paras. 5.01 and 5.02), one of which is
to attain a reasonably high probability of discovering substantial recoverable
reserves within the next four years while still maintaining a wide mix of
prospects including those in areas that so far have been only lightly
explored. Specifically, eight of the eleven exploratory wells included in the
project will be drilled in the five basins considered to be most prospective
while the other three will be drilled in two lesser explored basins that are
viewed as promising. The minimum petroleum discovery that would make the
exploration component of the project, together with the subsequent field
appraisal, development and production, earn an economic rate of return of
about 20% was determined (Annex 7.01) to be about 10 million TOE. This
evaluation took into account the slightly lower development and production
costs in most of the basins to be explored under the project given that the
basic infrastructure (i.e., roads, pipelines, oil and gas terminals) is
already present. Furthermore, the discoveries were assumed to average 25% oil
and 75% gas, the same expected hydrocarbon distribution in the seven basins.
This would yield an economic value of about US$182 per TOE in 1983 prices.
The corresponding cumulative net foreign exchange savings in this case would
be about US$1.5 billion (1983 prices) over the productive life of the
discovery through 2007.
7.04     On the basis of statistical exploration risk analysis, there is a
high probability that the seven basins where the exploratory wells included in
the project will be drilled could contain recorerable reserves of at least
about 70 million tons of oil and 265 billion m of gas, together equivalent to
about 280 million TOE. So far, about 234 prospects suitable for exploratory
drilling have been identified in these seven basins. Given that the
exploratory wells included in the project will be drilled in the best
prospects identified so far, and that these eleven prospects represent about
5% of the identified prospects, it would be reasonable to assume that the
exploration program would lead to the discovery of about 5% of the expected
recoverable reserves in the basins. In this situation, the exploration
component of the project could lead to the discovery of about 14 million TOE,
which would be more than sufficient to yield a 20% economic return when the
discoveries are developed and produced. The corresponding economic cost of
discovery, appraisal, development and production would be about US$32 per TOE
and compares favorably with the economic value of about US$182 per TOE.
The economic yalue of oil is taken as US$ 215/ton and of gas as
US$139/1000 i  (fuel oil parity) in 1983 prices.  Based on discfveries
which are expected to yield 70% gas and 30% oil on average, the average
economic value of the discoveries would be about US$ 185 per TbE.



- 48 -
C.  Justification of Pilot EOR Ccmponent
7.05     OKGT estimates, and the Bank technical staff accepts as reasonable,
that appropriate EOR methods could increase the ultimate oil recovery from
existing oil fields from an average of about 34% to one of about 40%. This
will result in additional recoverable reserves of about 15 million tons of oil
(para. 3.10), equivalent to about 75% of the present remaining recoverable
reserves. Such magnitude of additional reserves would have a substantially
favorable impact on the Hungarian economy. The various EOR techniques being
evaluated in laboratories and small field pilot tests are promising and
indicate investment costs in the range of US$30 to US$90 per ton (1983 prices)
of additional recoverable oil for the advanced techniques (e.g. CO2 injection,
in-situ combustion, steam injection and ethane-rich gas injection). This
range of capital cost is comparable to that in the US and generally implies a
satisfactory economic return (i.e, 20% or more).
7.06     Five enhanced oil recovery pilot schemes are included in the
project. One of the schemes, the Nagylengyel CO2 pilot, is a semi-commercial
scale operation and is considered a revenue-earning component although it is
still very risky. An economic rate of return evaluation was carried out for
this particular scheme (Annex 7.02) based on conservative assumptions as to
the expected results. The evaluation showed a base case expected economic
return of about 19% which is satisfacti'ry. The cumulative net foreign
exchange savings of the EOR scheme would be about US$195 million (1983 prices)
through 2003. But more importantly, the success of this scheme wou'.d lead to
a full-scale commercial application of the CO2 EOR process which would add two
to seven million tons of recoverable oil reserves. This full-scale commercial
application is also expected to have at least a 20% economic rate of return.
7.07     The other four pilot EOR schemes, namely the two Demien thermal
recovery pilot tests (in-situ combustion and steam-flood), and the two Algyo
pilot tests (micellar solution flood and ethane-rich gas injection), are small
scale field experiments designed to test the technical feasibiliry of the
various techniques. Thus, it would be premature to estimate an expected
raturn from these specific EOR methods. However, the additional recoverable
reserves in these fields are expected to be sufficiently significant (i.e., 5%
or more of the initial oil in place) that a systematic search for the most
economic EOR process can be prima-facie justified.
D. Economic Rate of Return of Gas Field Development and
Rehabilitation Component
7.08     The economic rates of return for the gas field development and
rehabilitation components included in the proJPLt have been estimated for each
gas field separately as well as for all gas fields together (Annex 7.03). The
main assumptions (base case) are that: the economic value of the gas is about
US$139 per 1000 m based on fuel oil parity and the economic value of the natural
gas liquids is about US$215 per ton, the economic value of light crude oil since
the NGL will be mixed with oil. On this basis, the base case economic return for
all three gas components together is about 149% and the return for the individual
components range from 125% to 163%.  The cumulative net foreign exchange savings
for all three components would be about US$3.9 billion (1983 prices) through
2003. The returns are satisfactory.

(b)  Endrod Gas Fteld                    125
(c)  Ulles Gas Field                     145
Sensitivity tests (Annex 7.04) indicate that even under rather adverse
conditions, such as a 30% increase in costs, a 20% decrease in benefits (e.g.,
prices or recovery), a two-year delay in project implementation, or a combination
of all three, the economic rate of return would still be over 47%. The
satisfactory returns are primarily due to the low incremental investment per
unit of additional production in the gas field rehabilitation and development
components of the project given that the infrastructure (roads, pipelines, gas
treatment facilities) are already in place. In addition, the replacement cost
for the gas reserves being produced (or depletion allowance) has not been
included in the rate of return calculation. Finally, a significant quantity
of valuable NGL is extracted with the gas and a portion of the incremental
production is realized within a short-period (one to two years) since the
project components are a time-slice of an on-going rehabilitation program.

HUNGARY
Oil and Gas Trade Arrangements
1.       Hungary imports all of its oil and 95% (soon to be 100%) of its gas
from the USSR under contracts which are negotiated every five years to
coincide with the 5-year planning cycle; the last negotiations were in 1980
for the 1981-85 plan period. The price Hungary pays is determined yearly on
the basis of the Bucharest formula which is a 5-year running a-vr=-R based on
Saudi Light oil, dropping out the high and low years. This price applies for
oil and gas iTports during 1981-85 up to 1981 levels (8.5 million tons of oil,
4.0 billion m of gas); any amounts over this can only be imported with
convertible currency at world prices.
2.       The present price under the Bucharest formuia is 140 Transferable
Rubles/ton of oil and 110 Transferable Rubles/1000 m of gas; converting
directly into US Dollars at 0.70 Transferable Rubles/USl.00, this is
US$200/ton of oil (about US$27/barrel) and US$157/lOOm of gas (about
US$4.45/1000 cubic feet or US$185/ton of fuel oil equivalent), yielding an oil
price somewhat below world prices (Saudi Light at US$29/barrel) and a gas
price very comparable to that in Northwest Europe. Applying the same formula
for 1984 indicates an oil price of about US$30/barrel.  It should be noted,
however, that payment is in goods and/or compensation for the gas pipeline.
If the intermediate exchange rates of 26 Fts /Transferable Ruble and 43
Fts /US$1.00 are used, the prices are more like US$85/ton of oil and
US$67/1000 m3. The Ft /Transferable Ruble exchange rate, which is more or
less fixed through 1985, appears to be depressed on the one hand because of
the generally favorable trade terms among CMEA countries and may in part
reflect the tradability of the goods in the West, and on the other hand
because Hungary wants to encourage exports to convertible currency markets.
3.       Hungary's trade situation with the USSR for oil and gas imports,
therefore, still appears to be reasonably favorable. However, the quantities
of oil and gas to which the Bucharest formula will apply after contract
negotiations in 1985 reaain uncertain.

ANNEX 3.06
HUNGARY
Fiscal Implications of Domestic Oil and Gas Prices
1.       In financial terms, netting out the cost of the crude oil and taxes
(on crude production and imports and gasoline sales) from today's average
selling price of US$250 per ton of oil in Hungary, OKGT is left with a
refining/marketing margin of about US$30 per ton (USS4/barrel) which is about
in line with that achieved on average in the US in early 1983 and
significantly better than that in Europe. At the same time, the Government
collects revenues amounting to US$145-150 per ton (net of the US$13 subsidy it
pays to OKGT for the low consumer prices on LPG and gasoil). In the case of
natural gas, netting out the cost of the natural gas and ta es (production and
import), OKGT is left with barely enough (US$2-3 per 1,000m ) to cover its
costs of distribution and marketing, although addition of its revenues from
the LPG and natural gasoline extracted from the domestically produced gas
would3improve the situation significantly (LPG alone would add US$1.5 per
1000m ). The taxes collected by the Government on the gas amount to about
US$45 per lOOOm , and there are no subsidies to OKGT to cover the low consumer
price.
2.       Costs of exploring for and producing oil and gas in Hungary in the
future may be expected to increase significantly due to more difficult
exploration and more expensive EOR methods. Nevertbeless, the present costs
of US$32 per ton (US$4.3/barrel) and US$17 per 1000 m" (US$0.5/1000 cubic
feet), respectively, are very low compared with the reference prices of Saudi
Light oil of US$29/barrel and gas sales to NW Europe of US$4.0-4.5/1000 cubic
feet. OKGT's margins and the sector's revenue-generating capability, however,
are very sensitive to the price of oil and gas imports. This, in turn, is
dependent on Hungary's trade arrangements with the USSR which are relatively
firm through 1985 (Annex 3.04). At the same time, it should be noted that the
presently, somewhat artificially depressed Ft /Transferable Ruble exchange
rate tends to overstate the sector's revenue generation.

HUNGARY: PETROLEUM PROJECT
The Hungarian Industrial Financial System and
OKGT's Financial Practices
A.       Overall Industrial Financial Framework
1.       The Government has regularly reviewed and modified the financial and
fiscal regulations affecting the public sector enterprises. The most recent
major change was in January 1980 when the "New Economic Regulations" were
introduced. The basic principles underlying these regulations are to:
(a) immediately reflect in the domestic prices the international
price of imported commodities, particularly energy, and eventu-
ally bring most domestic prices in line with world levels;
(b) minimize the number of commodities under direct Government price
regulation; and
(c)  encourage efficiency and give more autonomy in investment deci-
sions to the enterprises.
In this context the Hungarian authorities have limited direct Gov!rrnment pri'.e
regrlations to three basic industrial inputs and outputs: energy prices,
wages, as well as cost of credit. For all other commodities, the Government
has issued guidelines that industrial enterprises should not sell their output
below costs and should earil profits before income taxes within some range of
proportion to the resources the enterprises employ (para 11). For commodities
whose international price levels are very much higher than the cost of domes-
tic production, such as crude oil and natural gas, the Government uses fiscal
instruments (i.e., production taxes) to keep the profitability of the enter-
prises within the guidelines and to prevent inflationary excess industrial
investment in the economy, which could Tesult if enterprises have surplus
funds.
2.       The Government also introduced the employee profit sharing scheme
whereby the enterprise management decides on a certain proportion of after tax
pru'its to be distributed to the employees as an incentive. However, the
Government discourages a high level of profit sharing in relation to existing
wages primarily to prevent excess consumer purchasing power (i.e., consumer
demand) which could also be inflationary. Thus, a very high and progressive
tax surcharge is imposed on employee profit-sharing distributions (para 13).
Finally, interest rates on Loans for working capital and investments have been
set in line with international levels, i.e., 12% to 16% per year. These
interest rates ensure positive real rates given the level of general price
inflation (7% to 8% per year) in recent years and expected for the next few
years.
B.       OKGT'S Financial Practices and the Effect of the Industrial Financial
System on OKGT
3.       The main features that affect the presentation and interpretation of
OKGT's financial statements, its prof4.tability, and internal cash generation
are described in the following paragraphs and presented in the chart at the
end of this Annex.



- 67 -
ANNEX 4.03
Page 2 of 10
a.   Consolidation Practices
4.       All Government enterprises prepare financial reports in accordance
with standard formats and procedures prescribed for various economic sectors
(e.g., industry, agriculture) by the Ministry of Finance' All enterprises
under OKGT, as well as OKGT itself, prepare these financial reports. However,
the incorae tax liability is assessed on a Trust-wide basis and not on the
individual enterprises belonging to the Trust. In addition, the profit shar-
ing benefits to employees are also determined on a Trust-wide basis. Finally,
all long-term bank loans are made to the Trust rather than the individual
enterprises although loans earmarked for investments of an enterprise are
carried in the books of that enterprise. Because of these factors, the enter-
prisr:s under OKGT prepare only partial income statements and balance sheets;
only OKGT, as a Trust, preparea a complete and consolidated income statement
and balance sheet. In preparing its consolidated (Trust-wide) financial
statements, however, OKGT does not generally follow the typical US or UK
accounting consolidation practice of netting out intra-company transactions
(e.g., sales and accounts payable/receivable) in arriving at the consolidated
financial statements. The OKGT consolidated statements are simply the line by
line addition of the income statement and balance sheet items for all the
enterprises under the trust. During the project appraisal, however, the
historical and projected financial statements of OKGT were restated substan-
tially in line with generally accepted Western accounting consolidation prin-
ciples; the restated statements are the ones used in this appraisal report.
Similar consolidation principles will be applied in the financial reporting
requirements.
b.   Provisions and Depreciation
5.       One of the most important financial practices of an oil company is
the accounting treatment of exploration and development expenditures. The
accounting treatment of these expenditures have significant impact on both
profits and the pattern of internal cash generation through amortization
charges. The two generally accepted alternative treatments, with minor varia-
tion, are the "successful efforts" method and the "full cost" method. Under
the "successful efforts" concept, only those exploration and development costs
resulting directly in identifiable future benefits through the discovery,
acquisition, or development of specific, discrete petroleum reserves are
capitalized; costs that do not provide identifiable future benefits (non-
productive costs such as dry holes) are generally charged to expense as
incurred or are written off as a loss. Under the "full cost" concept, all
exploration and development costs within a large cost center (such as a coun-
try) or for the entire company, are initially capitalized and subsequently
amortized (charged to expense) as the petroleum reserves deemed to be related
to those costs are produced from those cost centers or by the company. Under
both methods, historical costs, rather than costs expressed in constant pur-
chasing power, are used. OKGT does not use either of these accounting treat-
ments for exploration and development costs. The concept utilized by OKGT is
to charge against current income a provision for the replacement cost of the
petroleum reserves being extracted. Under this concept, the replacement cost
of reserves covers all costs needed to discover and to bring the new reserves
to a producible state and includes geologic and geophysical surveys, as well
as all drilling costs for both exploration and development wells, but exclud-
ing the surface equipment, e.g., well heads and connections. All development
costs not associated with drilling, such as surface facilities (e.g., oil
tanks, oil treatment facilities, pipelines, etc.) are amortized or depreciated



- 68 -
ANNEX 4.03
Page 3 of 10
over the expected useful life of the asset. The replacement cost of reserves
is referred to in the financial statements as the "exploration and field
development (i.e., drilling) allocation or provision". This method provides a
substantial source of internal funds for investments through charges (provi-
sions) against current income but reduces the reported profitability of the
Trust. The amount of the provision is not determined automatically from
OKGT's costs but by the Ministry of Finance based on the recommendation of the
Ministry of Industry and OKGT. The provision is generally revised every few
years and can therefore be interpreted as a standard cost type of valuation.
The provision is expressed in two parts: an exploration component and a field
development (i.e., drilling) component which in 1982 amounted to Ft. 32 and
Ft. 16, respectively, per million Kcal (lower heating value) of hydrocarbon
produced, equivalent to a total of Ft. 480 per TOE (US$ 1.54/barrel of oil
equivalent) extracted. As a consequence of OKGT's more expensive and expanded
exploration and drilling program and the recommendations of the Bank, OKGT and
the Ministry of Industry discussed the need for increasing the provision with
the Ministry of Finance. In December 28, 1983, the Ministry of Finance issued
a directive stating the principle that the provision will be adjusted annually
to reflect OKGT's expanded operations and rising costs. Furthermore, the
production taxes will be reduced to the same extent as the increase in the
provision so that OKGT's profitability will not deteriorate. A specific
formula was included in the directive for 1983 (retroactive) through 1985
which allowed for inflation (5% per year), the expanded and more dlfficult
drilling program, as weli as anticipated improvements in productivity (2% per
year). The provision for exploration and field development under this formula
will be less than the actual expenditures by about Ft 500 million (11%) in
1983, Ft 300 million (4%) in 1984 and Ft 25 million (1%) by 1985. The reserve
replacement cost method being used by OKGT is satisfactory. It should also be
noted that some Western accounting associations and regulatory agencies
recommend that major oil companies provide supplemental information in their
annual reports concerning the current replacement cost./ of petroleum
reserves.
6.       The provision for exploration and field development is placed by OKGT
in a fund from which actual exploration and field drilling expenditures are
financed. To the extent that actual expenditures do not equal the provisions
for the year, the fund could have a positive or negative balance at the end of
the year. Small negative balances are generally covered from profits or
retained earnings but larger negative balances are made up by either an income
tax offset (credit) or by an increase in the unit provision for the following
year as decided by the Ministry of Finance. In the recent past (1980-82) the
fund had small positive balances at the end of the year but is expected to
have increasingly negative balances from 1983 onwards unless the unit provi-
sion is increased.
7.       The depreciation periods used by OKGT for varioup fixed assets are
generally based on the expected economic life of the asset. The main excep-
tions are the production wells. The wells (exploration and production) that
are financed from the funds accumulated through the provision for exploration
and field development are indirectly expensed immediately through the provi-
____________________
1/ The concept of replacement cost usc in the Western industry only includes
discovery and appraisal and does no, include the costs of development wells
needed to bring the reserves to a producible state.

sion. However, the cost of wells (tangible and intangible drilling expenses
excluding the cost of surface equipment) financed from the investment fund
(para 16) are depreciated but only within a period of one-hi,lf to one year;
for practical purpuses, therefore, the cost of these wells are also charged
against current income. The practical difference between the accounting
treatment of the costs of wells financed from the exploration and development
fund and those financed from the investment fund is that the cost of the
latter wells will appear in the gross fixed assets value and the accumulated
depreciation value while the costs of the former will not be included in these
two values. In this context, fully depreciated assets still in use are given
a nominal value of Ft. 100 in the accounting books.
The depreciation period for the major groups of assets are as
follows:
1.   Electronic equipment and computers                           4 years
2.   Drilling rigs                                              4-8 years
3.   Vehicles                                                   6-8 years
4.   Machineries, mechanical/electrical
equipment and process units                            10-15 years
5.   Buildings                                                20-15 years
6.   Pipelines                                                   35 years
8.       Hungarian enterprises must also set aside, and charge against current
income, a provision for technical research and development (R&D). The amount
charged against income is placed in a technical development fund from which
all R&D expenditures are financed. The enterprises have some discretion in
determining the amount of the provision. In the case of OKGT, the annual
provision for technical research and development is presently set at 1% of
annual net sales less raw material costs. The provision for technical R&D is
used to finance experimental seismic work, EOR studies, and other applied
petroleum research work.
c.   Valuation of Fixed Assets and Inventories
9.       All assets are valued at historical costs.  The value of fixed assets
include capitalized interest during construction while inventories are primar-
ily valued based on the "first-in first-out" (FIFO) method although some items
are valued on a standard cost basis. Furthermore, finished goods inventories
are valued only on the basis of direct production costs, without any general
overhead allocation.
d.   Selling Prices, Production and Import Taxes
10.      As mentioned earlier, OKGT's petroleum product selling prices to
industrial, commercial and household consumers are regulated by the Govern-
ment. The liquid petroleum product prices are generally comparable to inter-
national levels with the exception of LPG and home heating oil, which are only
about 40% and 50% of the international levels and of gasoline, which is about
200% of the international price respectively. In the case of home heating oil
and LPG, however, the Government pays OKGT a consumer price equalization
subsidy which raises OKGT's revenue on home heating oil (US$ 258/ton) to
international price levels and on LPG (US$ 127/ton) to about 50% of interna-
tional price levels. In the case of gasoline, the prices (US$ 572 per ton for
regular, US$ 619 per ton for super and US$ 667 per ton for extra) include
sales taxes of about US$ 300 per ton (Ft. 12,880/ton) which OKGT collects on



- 70 -                           ANNEX 4.03
Page 5 of 10
behalf of the Government. The natural gas selling price of OKGT varies
according to industrial, commercial and household users and ranges from about
60% to 80% of the most likely fuel substitute (e.g., fuel oil and gas oil) for
each user. The internal transfer prices between the subsidiary enterprises
are determined by OKGT although it has to follow the Government's profitabil-
ity guidelines. Since OKGT's selling prices of petroleum products to final
users (i.e., industry and households) are generally in line with international
prices, with the few exceptions noted earlier, and since these prices are very
much higher than domestic oil and gas extraction costs, the Government has
imposed a very high production tax of about Ft. 6,342/5on (US$ 19.93/barrel)
of oil and about Ft. 2,751/1,000 m3 (US$ 63.98/1,000 m ) of natural gas. In
addition, an import tax of about Ft 4,580/ton (US$ 14.39/barrel) of oil and an
average of Ft. 555/1000 m3 (US$ 12.90/1,000 m ) of gas is imposed to bring the
cost to OKGT of imported Soviet petroleum, which is less than international
levels at present, in line with international costs. In the case of crude
oil, therefore, the production tax and the import tax account for about 76%
and 56% respectively of the transfer price from the extraction enterprises to
the refining enterprises of OKGT. The extraction enterprises therefore have
only modest profits; most of the profits of OKGT are generated by the refining
and petroleum product marketing enterprises. In the case of natural gas, the
high level of production and import taxes have also left only a modest profit
margin for the extraction enterprises. However, the recent adjustments to the
provision for exploration and field development as well as the production
taxes are expected to improve OKGT's profitability.
e.   Profitability Guidelines
11.      The Government established profitab 1ity guidelines in 1980 for
enterprises whose prices were not regulated    The measure of profitability
is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of profit before income taxes to the
sum of the values of net fixed assets (at historical costs), the raw material
and finished goods inventories, and total wages. This ratio can be referred
to for convenience as the "before-tax return on total resources employed".
For mining and petroleum enterprises, this ratio is supposed to be about 10%
(compared to 15% for the chemical industry), although for OKGT the ratio has
ranged from 6% to 8% in recent years. In the case of OKGT, this profitability
measure correlates well with the conventional return after taxes on net assets
normally used by the Bank.
f.   Income Taxes and Profit Distributions
12.      Enterprises pay a municipal income tax (15% of profit Defore taxes)
and a national income tax which together result in a marginal total income tax
rate of about 53% of profit before taxes. However, the tax regulations permit
the deduction of certain principal repayments on State Development 2ank (SDB)
loans to be deducted from income for national income tax purposes .-  With
1/  Regulated prices are maximum prices.
2/ The marginal national income tax rate is 45% of: profit before taxes
minus municipal taxes minus some SDB loan repayments. The SDB loan repayments
deductible for tax purposes are determined by SDB at the time the SDB loan is
approved. This qualifying repayment is referred to as the loan repayment to
be paid from profits. The other (non-qualifying) loan repayments are to be



- 71 -
ANNEX 4.03
Page 6 of 10
this deduction, OKGT's average total income tax payments (municipal and
national) during 1979-1982 ranged from 34% to 42% of profit before taxes. In
reporting after tax profits, however, the Hungarian enterprises also deduct
these SDB loan repayment from income (see chart at end of Annex), thus under-
stating their true profitability since loan repayment are not a cost against
income. In this appraisal report, profits have been restated to include these
SDB loan repayments. This latter convention will be followed in the financial
reporting requirements as well as for purposes of the financial covenants
under the proposed project.
13.      A part of the after tax profit is generally distributed by enter-
prises as profit sharing benefits to employees. the employee profit sharing
distribution is determined by the enterprise management and is discretion-
ary. In the case of OKGT, the employee profit sharing has ranged from 20% to
30% of after tax profit equivalent to about 25% to 35% of the cost of labor
and wages. However, if the profit sharing distribution exceeds 2% of the 1/
total employee wages, the Government imposes a very high progressive surtax,-
and in the case of OKGT, about 65% of the profit sharing distribution is paid
as surtax to the Government.
14.      Hungarian enterprises transfer funds or pay dividends to the Govern-
ment, However, these transfers or dividends to the Government are not calcu-
lated on the basis of after tax profits, but rather, on the depreciation
charges. In general, 40% of the depreciation charges are transferred to the
Government. However, for purposes of determining the amount of the transfer,
the depreciation funds earmarked for part of the SDB loan repayments is
excluded when the 40% formula is applied (para 19). In the case of OKGT,
these transfers have in fact ranged from 25% to 35% of the total depreciation
charges because of the exclusion, or equivalent to 25% to 45% of after tax
profits in recent years. The employee profit sharing and the transfers to the
Government together have therefore ranged from 45% to 70% of OKGT's after tax
profit 'n the last few years.  Of the profits retained by OKGT, the major
portion (equivalent to 20% of after tax profits) is placed in the reserves
(para 20). Finally, starting in 1983, the Government imposed, as a temporary
measure, a surtax of 9% on the profits and depreciation retained by Hungarian
enterprises as part of an effort to reduce overall investments in the economy.
The surtax rate was raised to 22% for 1984 and the surtax is expected to be in
effect until 1986 or 1987.
g.   Internal Cash Generation
15.      Although it appears that the proportion of profits retained by OKGT
is relatively moderate due to the employee profit sharing and transfers to the
Government, the fact that a provision for exploration and field drilling is
charged against revenues provides a substantial source of financing for
exploration and drilling which are typically considered as investments (and
therefore amortized over several years), rather than immediate expenses, by
be paid from profits. The other (non-qualifying) loan repayments are to be
paid from the depreciation charges associated with the specific investments
financed by the particular SDB loan (para 19).
1/ The surtax is as follows: for the profit sharing equivalent to the first
2% of wages there is no surt.ax; for the second 2% the surtax is 100%; for
amounts representing cver 4% of wages the surtax is 600%.

the Western oil industry. In a conventional sense, therefore, OKGT finances a
major proportion of its investment program from internally generated funds.
This proportion has been in the 60%-70% range in the past several years with
the exception of 1980, a year of transition in the financial systems and a
period when inventories of gas and petroleum were increased by an unusually
large amount. With the Ministry of Finance directive of December 28, 1983
concerning the provision for exploration and field development as well as
production taxes, the proportion of self-financing is expected to range from
50% to 60% through the end of the decade and is satisfactory.
16.      The investable funds of an enterprise, that is, the retained profits
and depreciation, borrowed funds, as well as new equity and grants from the
Government, are placed in an account called the "investment fund".  The money
in the investment fund is used for investments or replacement of assets, for
debt (principal) repayment and for permanent increases in working capital.
Temporary or seasonal increases in working cap'tal are financed from short-
term loans or current liabilities. Operating losses are generally not
financed from the investment fund or the reserve fund (para 20) but are han-
dled through the Ministry of Finance and may be covered by additional equity
or grants from the Government or by loans.
17.      In evaluating the internal cash generation of an enterprise, the
provisions (e.g., allocation for exploration atid field drilling) or non-cash
charges against income other than depreciation, have to be taken into
account. In the case of OKGT, the provisions are a major source of internal
cash generation. The internal cash generation of OKGT can be derived as
follows using 1982 data as an example.

h.   Loan Sources
18.      Long-term loans for investments are provided by the SDB and the
National Bank of Hungary (NBH). The latter also provides short-term loans.
In general, SDB provides long-term loans for state approved projects (gener-
ally very large capital investments and infrastructure). NBH provides both
short-term loans for working capital as well as long-term loans for invest-
ments sanctioned by an enterprise. The grace periods on long-term loans would
normally correspond to the project implementation period and the repayment
period would be withia ten years after the grace period. Interest rates are
presently about 12% to 16% and loans for investments would generally include
the capitalized interest during construction.
19.      In general, the long-term loan principal repayments are supposed to
be paid from depreciation funds. With respect to long-term loans from NBH,
this is almost always possible because the depreciation period for investments
financed by NBH loans would generally not be more than ten years and would not
exceed the loan repayment period. The depreciation charges iiould therefore
equal or exceed the loan repayments. However, in '.he case of investments
financed by SDB loans, the depreciation period generally exceeds ten years.
Given that the SDB loan must be repaid in at most ten years, and s1nce the SDB
loans generally finance a very large proportion of a project (up to 100%), tha
project depreciation charges will be less than the SDB loan repayments in many
cases. In these situations, part of the loan repayments have to be financed
from profits. The income tax regulations of the Government recognize that it
would be an unreasonable financial burden if profits "earmarked" for debt
repayment is taxed. Therefore, SDB loan repayments to be paid from profits
are deducted from income for determining the national income tax liability
(but not deducted for determining the municipal tax liability). This income
tax practict can be interpreted as an investment credit for major investments
with long depreciation periods. The depreciation charges "earmarked" for SD3
loan repayments are likewise excluded from the 40% rule for transferring
depreciation charges to the Government.
i.   Insurance and Reserves
20.      Hungarian enterprises are not required by the Government to insure
normal business risks; such insurance is optional and left to the enterprise
management to decide on. A company can act as its own insurer, supporting
major risks/losses primarily through its reserves. Government enterprises are
required to set aside a portion (generally 20%) of the'r after-tax profits in
a reserve account with the National Bank of Hungary. The reserves are gradu-
ally built-up to a maximum equivalent to 6% of the value of the resources
employed (i.e., net fixed assets plus inventories plus wages) by the enter-
prise. The reserves can be used only with the permission of the Ministry of
Finance and for the same pLrposes as the investment fund, i.e., for invest-
ments or replacement of ass6ts, for debt repayment and for permanent increases
inl working capital. OKGT however has chosen to insure all its inventories and
fixed assets with the i.atii Insurance Company (the only industrial insurance
enterprise in the country'. OKGT's insurance policy provides for indemnity
equivalent to 100% of the replacement cost of the assets. This arrangement is
satisfactory.

J.   Auditing and Reporting
21.      The financial information and control system within OKGT is satisfac-
tory. There is an internal auditing group. In addition, OKGT is subject to
financial auditing by the Ministry of Finance. However, the frequency and
scope of this particular external audit does not meet the minimum requirements
of the Bank. The audit is primarily concerned with tax collection and is
generally carried out every two years. During each audit, one or two special
areas or major accounts, such as sales and marketing or inventories, would be
investigated in depth, in addition to the tax liabilities. All enterprises,
OKGT included, also 3ubmit to the Ministry of Finance every four months income
statements and balance sheets for routine review as well as for general sta-
tistical compilation. During negotiations, agreement was reached with OKGT
that it will submit to the Bank: (i) within six months of the end of the
fiscal year, short form annual audit reports on its consolidated financial
performance and situation, consistent in scope and content with Bk guide-
lines and audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,"k In this
context the principles of consolidation and the concept of profit generally
acceptable in the Western accounting profession will be used; and (ii) within
45 days of the end of each six-month period, unaudited income statements and
balance sheets as of the end of the period covered.
C.       General Comment
22.      OKGT has peTformed in a financially responsible mannLer within the
industrial financial and fiscal system described above. The recent policy of
the Ministry of Finance on the provision for exploration and field development
as well as on production taxes, coupled with the financial covenants included
in the proposed project, should ensure a satisfactory financial situation for
OKGT in the future.
1/ The Bank and the Hungarian authorities have identified an acceptable
independent auditor (a Hungarian enterprise) for this purpose.

HUNGARY
PETROLEUM   PROJECT
Petroleum Geology of Hungary
A. Petroleum Geology
1.       Hungary covers an area of 90,000 square kilometers, of which 70,000
are considered prospective. The country is mostly flat, its monotony being
interrupted by two mountain ranges of moderate elevation. However, the
subsurface geology of Hungary, and in particular its petroleum geology, can
only be understood after a careful study of the surrounding Alpine chains.
2.       Hungary, as recently as 20 million years ago, was part of the Alpine
system. Only in the very recent geological past, the Alpine branches
occupying what is now Hungary foundered and the area became the locus of deep
basins which were inundated by the sea and large inland lakes. During the
Late Tertiary up to 6,000 m of sediments, mainly sands, shales and marls, were
deposited in these basins. These youngest formations are readily recognized
on seismic records as are structures related to them. Older formations (those
related to the foundered Alpine chains), however, have undergone repeated
severe dislocations and in many cases are severely overpressured. Moreover,
due to the particular geological history, subsurface temperatures are
generally very high.
3.       This particular geological setting has had a number of significant
effects on oil and gas exploration in Hungary:  (a) except for the youngest
formations, oil and gas exploration is very manpower intensive and costly; and
(b) as a rule, hydrocarbon deposits are small and strongly faulted, rendering
development difficult and expensive. For the above reasons, international oil
companies have shown little interest in exploring in Hungary. The national
oil company has been able to explore and develop the (medium depth) younger
Tertiary and base Tertiary prospects, but has been unsuccessful so far in
systematically exploring deep Tertiary and Mesozoic (Alpine) prospects.
4.       Despite these severe geological complexities, Hungary offers good
prospects for finding additional oil and gas reserves. The geological
parameters which determine the presence of oil and gas deposits are generally
well developed although with wide variations in quality/quantity. While these
parameters are best developed in the southeast and southwest where the oil and
gas fields are concentrated, hydrocarbons have been proven in most of the
remaining sedimentary areas albeit in much smaller quantities.
5.       Source Rocks.  Bituminous shales of Tertiary age have been
encountered in most sedimentary basins; they are best known in the
southwestern and southeastern producing basins. In the lesser explored areas,
fewer data are available but locally the presence of Tertiary source rocks is
established. In the older formations bituminous rocks are known from
Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimer s. To what extent these source
rocks have contri,uted to proven reserves and to possible reserves is a
subject for furtb2r studies.

Page 2 of 3
6.       Reservoir Rocks.  In all sedimentary basins well developed reservoir
rocks have been identified. The best known are of Tertiary age which are
widely distributed and characterized by high porosities and permeabilities.
Clastic rocks capable of storing hydrocarbons are also abundant in the older
geological horizons, but their quality is variable; exploring for such
reservoirs is risky. Of local importance are karst reservoirs (e.g.,
Nagylengyel) and fractured basement reservoirs (e.g., Doboz gas field). Such
reservoirs are usually very prolific, but they can only be predicted by
careful geological analysis employing high quality seismic data.
7.       Structures and Traps.  The particular geological history of Hungary,
closely related to the Alpine orogeny, gave rise to a very wide variety of
structural traps. The structures in the younger Tertiary section are
typically fault closures or anticlinal domes draping over basement features,
which can be reedily detected by conventional geophysical methods.
Stratigraphic traps like sand wedgeouts and sand lenses embedded in shales
form an additional important trapping domain. Such traps can also contain
prolific hydrocarbon accumulations but again special geophysical methods are
needed for their detection. Geological structures related to older sediments
have been strongly affected by tectonic movements related to the formation of
the Alps. As a result reservoir porosity has often been destroyed and oil and
gas production depends largely on fractures. Furthermore, such structures are
complex, strongly folded and faulted, and thus difficult to map. Careful,
intensive seismic experimenting before acquisition and processing is a
prerequisite.
8.       Petroleum Generation.  The formation of oil and gas depends
critically en the prevailing temperature gradient in a given area (increase of
temperature per unit of depth). The Hungarian basins are unique in Europe in
having exceptionally high gradients (5.50 C/100 m against a worldwide average
of 2.5° C/100 m). There are several subbasins, particularly along the
Yugoslav border, where at a depth of 4,000 m, temperatures as high as 2200 C
have been measured.  In such areas, gas will dominate over oil; exploration
for deeper formations would become technically very difficult and costly. On
the other hand, generation of oil commences at much shallower levels in areas
with a high temperature gradient.
B. Exploration History
9.       In the early part of the century geologists predicted that only a
thin veneer of prospective sediments was present over most of the country and
exploration for oil and gas would be a wasteful effort. This belief was
fostered by the observation that Alpine type chains rose to great heights in
Austria; rocks similar to the Karawank Mountains in Austria outcrop in several
parts of Hungary. D';ring a Petroleum Congress in 1921 in London, the view was
brought forward that much of Hungary, together with Yugoslavia and Romania,
belonged to a large basinal complex. Following this Congress, the Anglo-
Persian Oil Company (now BP) showed interest in th,e eastern part of Hungary
and ultimately drilled a well at Budafa. Unfortunately the location was
placed down flank. Successively, other foreign interests entered in Hungary
before World War II: Maort, a joint venture between Standard Oil Company of
New Jersey, and Manaat, a joint venture between German and Hungarian
interests. These prewar efforts culminated in the discovery of two fields:
Budafa and Lovaszi.

10.      Systematic exploration commenced after 1948 when the industry was
nationalized and OKGT was entrusted with the conduct of oil operations in
Hungary. At first, the search for oil centered in the southwestern part of
the country where the two discoveries were being followed up. Seismic
information soon revealed the presence of additional prospective areas. It
became apparent that there are basically two prospective realms in Hungary,
the younger Tertiary section, consisting of alternations of sands, shales and
marls, and the pre-Tertiary section with a much more varied rock sequence.
Having identified the relatively simple younger Tertiary realm, OKGT
concentrated its exploration efforts on it and structures immediately in
contact with it, spending relatively little time and money on the more
difficult areas.
11.      Substantial areas of Hungary, therefore, have been only sketchily
evaluated, if evaluated at all, due not only to geological complexities but
also to technical hazards such as severe overpressures and very high
temperatures. In any event, geophysical tools and methods to explore such
complex structures as those prevailing in Hungary, have become available only
very recently in some producing areas, mainly in the US and Western Europe.
Equally, there have been significant advances in drilling technology, and high
pressures and temperatures can now be successfully overcome. This is a very
timely development for OKGT which is forced to explore these more difficult
prospective realms if it wants to arrest the decline in reserves in the
existing producing areas.
C. Resource Base and Geological Prognosis
12.      OKGT has successfully explored thp relatively simple prospective
realms. About 200 trapping structures remain to be evaluated which can be
tested with equipment presently in operatisn. Reserves now stand at about 20
million tons of oil and about 90 billion m of gas. In addition, there are
about 30 billion m of low-calorie natural gas containing up to 83% of inert
gases (mostly CGO), which are now beginning to be produced for mixing with
pipeline gas and70r local power/heat production and industrial uses.
13.      In order to sustain the present petroleum production levels into the
next decade, it is critical that deeper (more complex) geological structures
be explored aggressively and diligently. Bank staff, with OKGT, have
evaluated the potential of all such known prospects. This study indicates
that there is an 90% chance that 130 million tons of producible oil reserves
and 400 billion m of gas can be added to Hungary's resource base. An
analysis of the shape of the expectation curves indicates that there are
several areas where additional exploration efforts can make immediate
additions to reserves. Several areas have lower but still realistic chances
for finding very significant recerves.  Invariably, some key parameters such
as structural definition, presence and quality of source rocks and reservoirs
are not fully understood or evaluated.  It is a major objective of the
proposed project to enhance the amount and quality of data having a bearing on
the lesser known parameters, and in so doing determine an optimum exploration
program for raising the expectations into the probable and proven reserve
category. Annex 5.02 gives a more detailed treatment of Hungary's petroleum
geology and expectations.

HUNGARY
Petroleum Geology and Hydrocarbon Expectations
Review of Individual Geological Conditions
5.01      The presence of oil and/or gas in ary geological prospect critically
depends on a number of geological parameters. There is now a concensus among
petroleum geologists that these factors are as follows:
(a) Presence of source rocks: sedimentary rocks with a high
amount of organic material which, under suitable temperature
conditions, can be transformed into oil and gas;
(b) Maturation of source rocks: in order for source rocks to
expel hydrocarbons, they have to attain an equilibrium
with a certain temperature-pressure regime. Expulsion of
hydrocarbons generally takes place at a temperature of
between 60° and 1800 C;
(c) Reservoir/seals: rocks which contain interconnected por-
ous volumes in which liquids and gas can move freely. When
this pore volume is greatly reduced, free flow will becomec
inhibited. For a reservoir to retain oil or gas, it has
to be overlain by impermeable rocks (seals). Where no
such impermeable rocks are present, the hydrocarbons in
the reservoir rocks dissipate to the surface and are lost;
(d) Trapping structures: a geological trapping structure is a
configuration of reservoir rocks and source rocks which can
contain hydrocarbons. Commonly, these are anticlinal domes,
i.e., reservoir rocks being convex upward and overlain by
impervious rocks. Many other configurations are possible,
such as porous reef bodies embedded in shales or sand lenses
within shales. All of these configurations occur in Hungary.
In the following paragraphs, these parameters are discussed in some detail;
particular attention is paid to the variations that are known to occur in the
various Hungarian basins.
Source Rocks
5.D2      Fine grained rocks which contain large amounts of organic material,
derived either from plant remains (marine algae, land plants, etc.) or from
animal remains (wnstly of marine origin). Under suitable temperature/pressure
conditions, the organic material contalned therein is converted into hydrocarbons.
The composition of source rocks determines whether oil, gas or both are generated.
There are strong geochemical indications that land plants predominantly generate
gas, whereas marine organisms predominantly generate oil. Thus, in a geAlogical
basin, where large amounts of sediments are accumulated and where a high peenentage
of land plants is deposited with them, large amounts of gas can be expected. In



_ 80 -
ANNEX 5.02
Page 2 of2O
marine sediments, organic material will be mostly from cnimal remains and algae;
transformation of this organic matter will lead to the formation of oil. In the
Hungarian basins both types of source rocks are known, although those of marine
origin seem to predominate. The most important source rock intervals have been
identified in the southeastern and southwestern basins; in the remaining areas
more studies are required to determine the regional distribution of these rock
units.
5.03 Status of knowledge on the Hungarian basins. Abundant intervals of dark
shales and clays have been observed in exploration wells in most basins. Im-
portant intervals have been identified in Paleozoic sequences in the Mesozoic
and Tertiary.
Maturation of Source Rocks
5.04      For organic material to become transformed into oil and gas, it has to
be exposed to high temperatures, on the order of 60°-180° C. At lower tempera-
tures, no hydrocarbons are expelled; at much higher temperatures (above 2000 C)
only gas is formed (even from source rocks which have oil potential).  It is a
general observation that with increasing depth, temperatures increase. The rate
of increase is called the geothermal gradient; in "normal" geological basins,
this rate of increase is some 2.50 C per 100 m. In such a basin, a source rock
would start to expel hydrocarbons when overlain by about 2,500 m of sediments.
In an evaluation of the oil and gas potential of a basin, two key points must be
considered: (a) the thermal gradient is not a constant for a basin; it can vary
widely;  and (b) different source rocks expel hydrocarbons at different tempera-
tures. In other words, oil can be formed in one part o.L a geological basin at
2,500 m where the prevailing temperature gradient is 2.50 C per 100 m; in another
part of the basin where the gradient is 4° C per 100 m, oil can be formed at a
much shallower depth of 1,500 m. Conversely, if the temperature gradient is
20 C per 100 m, oil will start fonming only at a much greater depth.
5.05 Status of knowledge on Hungarian basins. The Hungarian basins are unique
among similar basins fringing the Alpine chain in having very high temperature
gradients. In the southern basins this gradient reaches values in excess of
5° C. Such high values indicate that source rocks deeper than say 4,000 m will
expel gas, even if of marine origin. Conversely, expulsion of oil starts at
much shallower levels than in normal basins, i.e., between 1,500 and 2,000 m.
Presence of Reservoir Rocks
5.06      Each geological basin contains its characteristic rock suites.  The
particular composition is determined by the rate of subsidence of the basin,
its hinterland (topography) and whether it is a basin located on a continent or
in the marine realm.  The Hungarian basins underwent strong subsidence in early/
middle Tertiary times when the area was inundated by a branch of the Mediterranean
or inland lakes. The hinterland retained a mountainoua relief. In the process
of strong initial subsidence, rock masses broke loose from the hinterland and slid
into deeper waters along the steep basin slopes. In the deepest part of the basin,
these sediments, before coming to rest, spread over extensive areas.  As the
coarser (heavier) elements (sand particles) settled before the finer elements



- 81 -
ANNEX 5.02
Page 3 of 20
(clay particles), a certain zoning of sands and shales resulted.  Often such
rock sequences have a wide areal extent and they can occur in multiple layers;
equally, single units of limited areal extent can occur. If a basin becomes
shallower, rock material is generally deposited by rivers rather than rock
slides. Resulting reservoir rocks can reach great composite thicknesses while
individual layers show wide variations. Such reservoirs are widely distributed
in the Hungarian basins. They are well described in the southern basins where
they form important production horizons. Sandstone reservoirs of Tertiary age
also occur in the remaining basins but there they tend to be of shallow marine
to contirnental origin. Pre-Tertiary reservoirs have a wide occurrence; they
are developed as sandstones, porous limestones, reef limestones or even frac-
tured metamorphic rocks.
5.07 Status of knowledge on Hungarian basins. There is no scarcity of reser-
voir rocks in the Hungarian basins. Most exploration wells have encountered
sand reservoirs and/or limestone reservoirs. There is no regional study of the
distribution of individual reservoir units, mainly because of the scarcity of
high resolution seismic data.
Qualtcty of Reservoirs
5.08      A reservoir has a certain rock volume in which hydrocarbons can move
freely. The actual volume varies widely and is determined by physico-chemical
forces and the composition of the rock material; these cannot, generally, be
predicted and certain assumptions must be made by the prospect appraiser. A
general observation, however, pertains to changes in reservoir rocks with depth:
the deeper a sandstone is buried, the smaller the rock volume in which liquids
can circulate. In many basins reservoir characteristics become very poor at
depths in excess of 5,000 m. Hydrocarbons may still be present, but their pro-
duction requires expensive and complex techniques. Yet other geological agents
can reduce porosity: in many areas, concurrently with basin formation, volcanic
activity takes place. Amounts of fine grained material are widely spread and
mixed with other sediments. When such fine materials are laid down with sands,
the pore volume will be strongly reduced and the scope of hydrocarbons to move
is impaired.
5.09 Status of knowledge on Hungarian basins. In very deep wells, particularly
in the southern part of the country, a decrease in primary porosity is noted;
however, this downgrading effect is frequently counterbalanced by the presence
of fracture systems which has a beneficial effect on production. In the central
and northeaatern basins, Tei.iary reservoirs are often contamirnated by the
tuffaceous material which reduces primary porositie-. The effects of such tuffaceous
material in reservoir rocks in Hungary is a subject of intensive study by OKGT.
Very deep limestone reservoirs have shown irregular porosity distribution.  Loss
of porosity Is a major risk in exploring for such reservoirs.
Structures Which can Retain Hydrocarbons
5.10      Oil- and gas-bearing structure  are normally a combination of the
following: a reservoir sequence, convex to the surface, is overlain by impervious
rocks; the latter prevent escape of oil and gas which enter the underlying res-
ervoirs. Many structural combinations are known but the basic principle remains



- 82 -
ANNEX 5.Q2
Page 4 of 20
the same: a reservoir rock must be overlain by impervious rocks to hold oil
and gas in place. There is sufficient information available in the Hungarian
basins for demonstrating that geological trapping structures are widespread
and that most of them could, indeed, retain oil or gas. In the shallower
horizons of Tertiary age such trapping structures are usually well expressed
on seismic records. In deeper Tertiary layers mapping becomes more difficult
due to poor resolution. In the Mesozoic intervals, which are generally
atrongly disturbed by geological forces, a massive seismic effort ia required
for mapping individual trapping structures. A major component of the project
will address this problem.
Overall Evaluation of a Basin
5.11      The geological parameters summarized above determine the type of hydro-
carbons in a basir, their distribution and the size of the oil and gas fields.
A full evaluation of the oil and gas incidence requires a thorough knowledge
of these parameters. Where these changes were rapid or where they are only im-
perfectly known, an appraisal can become a complex and intricate task. During
recent years special statistical methods have been developed which address
this problem and which have been widely used. In most of these methods the
geologist is required to make statements which reflect his knowledge of tnese
parameters. These statements have to be translated into a chance of their
occurrence. The geologist will also have to make statements as to porosity dis-
tribution, population of drillable prospects, etc. A statistical treatment (Monte
Carlo method) then results in a listing of all possible outcomes which can be
expediently displayed as an expectation curve. An example of such an expectation
curve is shown in Figure 1.

Plotted on the abscissa of the graph is the amount of recoverable oil (or
gas) which has a chance of being found and recovered, as indicated on the
ordinate.  In the example given, there is a chance P1 that at least an
amount Xi will be found that can be recovered. Chances of finding a re-
coverable amount smaller than X are higher than Pl; conversely, there is
less chance of finding amounts iarger than X1.
Application of Appraisal System to Hungary
5.12      The Bank is in the process of developing such a hydrocarbon eval-
uation program for use in the justification of exploration projects; more im-
portant, such an evaluation system, once available, would be made available to
borrowers to enable them to carry out their own evaluations of relevant risks.
The method used in this report has been developed by the Canadian Geological
Survey; it has been adopted by the US Interior Department which has introduced
a number of modifications. The program is called Resource Appraisal Simulation
for Petroleum (RASP). In essence, a group of earth scientists who are most
familiar with'the area to be appraised, have to provide certain statements re-
lating to those geological parameters which are relevant to the formation of
oil and gas pools.  A summary sheet of the informatio'a required is given in
Attachment 1. As mentioned in para.5.11 a statistical treatment then results
in a listing of all possible outcomes which can be expediently displayed as
an expectation curve. A careful comparison of expectation curves and a close
scrutiny of the input data permit ranking of various exploration prospects;
furthermore, the particular shape is indicative of the state of geological
knowledge at the time of appraisal.  In most, appropriate exploration progrs
can then be designed, the execution of which would prove or disprove the ex-
pectations. In any case prospect evaluation should be a continiuous process, to
be carried out after new data have been acquired. In the following paragraphs
the outcome of the Bank staff/OKGT evaluation is presented. The particular
shape of the individual expectation curves is discussed; where necessary,
particular exploration risks are highlighted. Hydrocarbon volumes are geological
reserves, i.e., oil in place and gas in place. To arrive at producible reserves,
a factor of 25% has been used for oil and 70% for gas.
5.13      OKGT has divided the country into 12 geological basins.  In areas of
intensive exploration and production these basins are well defined and develop-
ment of a rational exploration strategy offers no problems. In the lesser ex-
plored areas, particularly in the northwestern and central/northeastern parts of
the country, the geological knowledge remains fragmentary. An important element
of the proposed project aims at raising the understanding of the petroleum
geology of these lesser known areas. As summarized in para. 5.06 and Annex 5.01,
para.    2, the Hungarian basins are characterized by deep troughs filled with
Tertiary sediments which are erosion products from the rising Alps. The pre-
Tertiary sediments were parts of the Alpine mountain system which subsequently
foundered and were covered by branches of the Mediterranean or large inland lakes.
In the producing areas the Tertiary sediments have been intensely explored in the
depth interval between the surface and 3,500 m. Less is known of their develop-
ment at greater depths as seismic quality deteriorates sharply rendering seismic
mapping difficult. The pre-Tertiary formations are relatively well known in areas



- 84 -
ANNEX 5.02
Page 6 of 20
where they occur at depths shallower than 3,000 m. Structural mapping remains
difficult as these formations are strongly folded and faulted. In the lesser
explored areas insufficient seismic and drilling information is available to
allow a meaningful assessment of the oil and gas potential. Yet there is
sufficient evidence that they can develop into important targets for oil and
gas In all prospective realms, but particularly in the younger Tertiary
there are indications of subtle traps such as sand wedgeouts near existing
fields or along basin flanks; exploration for such trapping structures requires
dense, high resolution seismic grids and advanced processing techniques. OKGT
is aware of the presence and the importance of such prospects but has neither
the methods nor the tools for their detection. The Bank project will provide
consultant services, seismic methods and technology as well as drilling tech-
niques to start evaluating lesser explored areas and deep prospects in pro-
ducing areas. In the following paragraphs the status of knowledge in the var-
ious basins is summarized. The output of the RASP method is summarized and
where appropriate work programs are proposed which aim at increasing the over-
all oil geological knowledge. The ultimate aim of the project is to increase
the hydrocarbon resource base and arrest the decline or even increase the rate
of oil and gas production.
Northwest Hungary (Area 1, 2; 5,000 km )
5.14      OKGT has long recognized the oil exploration potential of NW Hungary.
The area is characterized by an extensive, NE-SW trending basin with a fill of
Tertiary sediments in excess of 8,000 m.  In the west the basin is overridden
by basement rocks which were detached from the nearby Austrian nappes. Toward
the east, the basement rises toward the Bakony Mountains. The basin extends
into Czechoslovakia where minor production has been established. While known
in broad outline the basin remains virtually unexplored. The maiin drawbacks
for active geophysical exploration wLre difficult terrain conditions, gravel
surfaces with difficult shothole drilling, resulting in insufficiently deep
holes and thus limited penetration. Some seismic lines, recently acquired with
the vibroseis method, resulted in some improvement.
5.15 Prospectivity: the Tertiary section contains good source rocks and well
developed reservoir rocks. Trapping structures in the Tertiary are sand wedge-
outs and gentle anticlinal structures over basement highs. Along the western
flank there are indications of structures in the pre-Tertiary section but these
cannot be detailed with the seismic information available. Past exploration
resulted in the discovery of some small gas fields.

A high risk, low reward play. The main risks are poor caprocks and low quality
reservoir rocks. Furthermore, deep prospects cannot be evaluated as the avail-
able seismic data cannot be used for prospect mapping. Apart from a naumber of
experimental seismic lines, no immediate exploration activities are recommended.

of trapping structures. Gas expectations are 8 billion cu m, most of which
is from Tertiary levels. There is some scope for finding small oil fields.
Future seismic surveys will focus on defining structural closures in Lower
Tertiary and Cretaceous levr1s. Regional studies will aim at defining
fracture trends.
5.17 Planned program: as a first step, some 1,300 km of high quality seismic
data will be acquired, using an improved vibroseis recording instrument, en-
abling higher multiplicities and 2 m sec sampling rate, which will be financed
by the Bank project. Advanced processing of selected lines carried out by
foreign contractors for comparison with GKV processing will also be financed
by the Bank project. If seismic data can be improved, six strategically placed
exploration wells will be drilled by OKGT. There are no drilling difficulties
which would require specialized equipment and materials.
Nagykanizsa Area (Area 3; 4,000 km2)
5.18      This area is intermediate between the Bakony 1Mountains and the Karawank
Mountains/Dinarides in Austria and Yugoslavia respectively. The pre-Tertiary
rocks, at the surface in these two areas, have been downfaulted and are now
covered with Tertiary sediments, the thlr cness of which varies between 2,000 and
6,000 m. The depressions filled with Tertiary sediments are reasonably well de-
fined by a dense grid of seismic and many exploration wells. One important prospect
domain is imperfectly known and demands additional seismic: sand lenses deposited
by turbidity currents which transported clastic material from the rising mountains.
Detection of such sand bodies/lenses requires a detailed study of existing well
data, for which sonic and formation density logs and well velocity surveys are
indispensable, and their correlation with wavelet processed and inverted seismic
data. The structuration of the underlying sediments is of incredible complexity
and has so far defied the successful application of seismic methods and may well
do so in the future. The uppermost layers of the Mesozoic (i.e., the contact
area between the Mesozoic and the Tertiary) can be mapped locally; important oil
and gas pools have been found at this level. Exploration for Mesozoic trapping
structures is therefore a matter of great urgency.
5.19 Prospectivity: most of the shallow Tertiary prospects and a limited amount
of Upper Mesozoic prospects have been adequately explored. The area contains
various prospective but untested realms in the deeper Tertiary and in the Mesozoic.
Major exploration risks lie in erratic porosity development of the Mesozoic res-
ervoir rocks and the definition of the geological trapping structures including
caprocks.

Oil (Billion bbl)                         Gas (Trillion cu ft)
A low risk, medium volume play. Expectations for oil are 25 million tons while
those for gas are in excess of 20 billion cu m. Porosity development and in-
tegrity of hydrocarbon traps are the main exploration risks for Tertiary prospects
which account for about one third of these totals. Careful seismo-stratigraphic
studies cati minimize the risk for this trapping realm. Additional seismic data
will be acquired in selected areas. The main risks for pre-Tertiary prospects are
low reservoir perosities and very complex trapping structures. Future seismic
surveys should concentrate on areas where (a) good reflections can be obtained;
and (b) a case can be made for secondary (fractured) porosity.
5.20  Plan-ned program:  OKGT has selected th.   areas where important trapping
structures are expected but where so far no usable geophysical data could i- ac-
',uired. In the southern area (north of Nagykanizsa) a structurally E-W trending
high area faces deep troughs which are filled with Tertiary sediments. Individual sand
bodies abut against impervious rocks of the structurally high trend where large
volumes of hydrocarbons can be trapped. The Bank project would finance 100 km of
experimental seismic employing the highest possible technology. ProceBsing would
be done by foreign contractors and compared with advanced processing by GKV and
the services of consultants familiar with aimilar problems would be secured. If
successful, similar areas along the same geological unit would be surveyed using
the same methods. Ultimately, up to 12 drilling locations could result from this
survey. In the central area, south of the Nagylengyel field, a deep graben-like
depression has been outlined. Good source rocks and reservoir rocks are in con-
tact with each other; intensive compressional forces provided a large number of
trapping structures. 400 km of experimental seismic lines are planned to define
individual traps and porosity trends; dense sampling and seismic modeling in con-
junction with well studies would be required. Acquisition and processing would
be part of the Bank project. If successful, OKGT would continue acquisition
along the edges of the basin using the same methods. It is expected that a large
number (in excess of 50) of drillable prospects can be so defined. In the northern

area some 5,000 m cf Tertiary sediments overlie faulted/thrusted basement and
Mesozoic sediments. The area is characterized by many oil shows, but prospect
mapping has been impossible due to poor seismic data. The project will finance
the acquisition of 200 km of high quality seismic lines to locate stratigraphic
traps at the base Tertiary and to identify structural prospects in the underlying
Mesozoic. Intensive field experimenting will be necessary. An additional
difficulty in the Nagykanizsa area is the rugged topography, making the shooting
of regular grids impossible, necessitating "slalom" (crooked line) shooting.
Prospects in all three areas are deep and complex. A possible well location
has been identified in Area 3; the well would test a combination structural/
stratigraphic trap in the Lower Tertiary; total depth (4,500 m) would be in
Paleozoic rocks which are expected to be fractured. The interval between 3,000
and 4,000 m is highly o arpressured whereas in the lower part of the hole normal
pressures would prevail.  The area immediately south of Lake Balaton shows sim-
ilar geological complexities in the older formations. In addition, there is a
drastic thickening of Neogene formations towa-rd the south leading to combination
structural/stratigraphic traps. Previous seismic surveys gave insufficient
results for prospect mapping and the entire area (some 2,500 km2) is only very
lightly ex-^l-red.  OKGT has included 1,200 km of high resolution seism±c in the
Bank projee . The gravel surface makes drilling slow, and to speed up seismic
progress w.thout affecting quality, the Bank-financed modern 120-channel in-
strument should be employed here as soon as available.

Expectations for Tertiary prospects are negligible. There is a low chance that
small to medium sized Cretaceous gas fields will be found. The area is in an
advanced stage of exploration. Most of the obvious traps have been tested; what
remains are small structures, most of them poorly defl'ed by seismic.  Low
porosities, particularly for pre-Tertiary prp5pecrs, are an additional risk.
On the other hand, there is a (as yet unevaluated) potential for stratigraphic

would be very dense and processing costs would be high. OKGT carries out
stratigraphical studies and will focus on areas where there are good geological
indications for the presence of such subtle traps.

Oil (Billion bbl)                          Gas (Trillion cu ft)
A high risk, low volume play. This is reflected by the geological input which
shows that individual structures are mostly small and poorly defined. No ex-
ploration work is recommended here before an assessment of all available data
has been carried out.  The southern part of this area needs particular atten-
tion, as it is located next to the highly attractive Area 6 (Kiskunhalas).
Area 6 (5,000 km2)
5.23      The southern part of the project area (Kiskunhalas) contains a
.ariety of trapping structures ranging from wedgeouts to anticlinal folds and
thrusts. Hydrocarbons have been discovered in a variety of Mesozoic and Ter-
tiary rocks, including fractured basement. The area of primary interest is
located some 25 km WNW of Szeged where a Tertiary basin with over 5,000 m of
sediments has been outlined. Repeated tectonic movements led to complex struc-
tural patterns, affecting both Tertiary rocks and Mesozoic rocks. Unlike areas
discussed previously, Mesozoic source rocks are still in the oil generating
phase on this basin.
5.24 Prospectivity and exploration risks: the expectation curves attest to
the fact that the area has considerable untested oil and gas potential.  In
particular, the expectation curves for Mesozoic and basement prospects exhibit
a "long tail" suggesting the presence of high volume prospects. The main risks
for both plays lie in the definition of structural traps. in particular, the
Mesozoic structures are strongly folded and faulted rendering placing of

Oil (Billion bbl)                      (Gas (Trillion cu ft)
A low risk, medium volume play. There is a good chance that small oil accumula-
tions can be fnund quickly in contventional structures. The largest part of the
total expecte ions, 25 million tons of il and 30 billion cu m of gas, are in
complex pre-Tertiary prospects. To prove this potential, future seismic should
focus on deep data to map the numerous complex trapping realms. In parallel
with seismic work, geological/structural studies -hould be undertaken to establish
preferred areas for fractured porosity.
5.26 ProRram: in order to help clarify the structural complexr.ties, a small
area near Kiskunhalas has been chosen where an experimental seismic survey (300 km)
will be carried out to define a Miocene prospect at a depth of 4,500 m.  Tn the
same area there are indications of strongly faulted Mesozoic thrust slices which
are located in close proximity to Tertiary and Cretaceous source rocks. A 3-D
seismic survey to be shot and processed by a foreign contractor is planned to
detail the structure of such a prominent thrust, the outline of which -7111 be de-
ternined by the conventional survey. The area is chosen for a pilot 3-D survey,
as i:eflections are observed at depths, but interpretation is very doubtful. Two
deep exploration wells will be required to adequately test the Lower Tertiary
section and the Mesozoic play. Both wells will have to penetrate a highly over-
pressured section in the Lower Tertiary; thereafter, the pressure r 4ime will be
hydrostatic again.  Subsurface temperatures are expected to range between 1800 C
and 200° C.  A similar test is planned in the northeastern part of Area 6 where a
sizeable dip closure at Mesozoic level is overlain by thick Tertiary sequences,
which are partly overpressured. The program for Area 6 which will be financed
under the project includes 300 km of conventional seismic, a 3-D survey by a foreign
contractor and three deep exploration wells.

Area 7 (1,800 km2)
5.27      The Mako trend, straddling the eastern part of Area 7, is a pro-
nounced Tertiary feature. Several important source rock zones have been de-
termined in this basin. The area surrounding the Mako Basin contains several
rich oil and gas fields. The base Tertiary section has not been actively ex-
plored nor have the underlying Mesozoic sediments. That the latter are
prospective has been demonstrated by a stratigraphic test encountering good
reservoirs in these and in Mesozoic rocks. There is also a large potential
in Tertiary strat traps and traps within the Mesozoic. The area is only
covered by old analog lines with poor penetration and a few vibroseis lines.
5.28 Prospectivity and exploration risks: the Tertiary reilm has been
reasonably well explored with the exception of strat traps for which there are
numerous indications. There are fair chances that additional, small volumes
will be found in conventional small structures. Large volumes of oil and gas
could be present in subtle traps; detection of such trapping structures re-
quires dense seismic grids and advanced processing. There remains a fair chance
of finding sizable gas accumulations in Mesozoic prospects.

Oil (Billion bbl)                    Gas (Trillion cu ft)
The convent. il (shallow)Tertiary realm is relatively well explored; oil ex-
pectations for future discoveries from such traps are relatively small if com-
pared to oil discovered so far from this realm (about 4 million tons). On the
other hand, there are good chances for finding sizable gas accumulations in the
Lower Tertiary and pre-Tertiary sections. Expectations are 25 billion cu m of
gas. The main uncertainty lies in the definition of such deep prospects. As
in Area 6, focus of future exploration work will be on deep seismic penetration
and the drilling of selected deep structures which can be so outlined. The Bank
project includes profiling 400 km of high resolution seismic and drilling one
deep test. The amount. of seismic work may well increase if subtle structures
can be vapped successively.

Oil (Billion bbl)                   Gas (Trillion cu ft)
There are numerous indications of subtle traps in the Tertiary sequence
(wedgeouts, sand lenses in impervious shales). This prospective realm is
practically unexplored. Systea-tic search for such trapping struetures,
which are of small areal extent, requires a dense grld of high quality seis-
mic. Expectations are very high: 25 million tons of oil and 40 billion cu m
of gas. OKGT is evaluating an appropriate strategy for developing this pros-
pect realm.
5.31 Propesed 2rogram: some 400 km of seismic lines are planned in order to
map 1OsOZoic prospects and Tertiary wedgeouts along the !ako west flank.  The
two objectives may require different field parameters, to be only effectively
combined by employing an instrument with a high number of channels. This will
be followed by a 5,300-m deep test which will be so located as to evaluate, if
possible, a Mesozoic closure and Tertiary stratigraphic traps. Seismic
stratigraphy studies and advanced processing will be required. Total depth of
the exploration well will be below 5,300 m; the well is expected to drill
through an overpressured section and temperatures will be in excess of 200° C.
requiring special completion and testing equipment.
Area 8 (2,500 k)
5.32      This area is the least known among the Eungarian geological basins.
Geophysical operations were thwarted by difficult surface conditions; also there
was little seismic penetration due to the presence of thick Miocene volcanic/
tuffaceous layers, but apart from some regional lines, seismic lines are old.
Regional data, mainly gravity and magnetics, suggest that the sedimentary sec-
tion Is several thousand meters thick. Of particular prospective Interest is
the Jaszag depression, a NE-SW trending trough covering an area of some
1,500 km2.  North of it are the Deinan and Hezokeresztes oil fields; the

Szolnok-Eajduszoboszlo gas trend straddles its southern border. The area thus
appears to have a favorable petroLeum geological setting.
5.33 Prospectivity and ezploration r roblens: geochemical. studies on corehole
samples proved the presence of weLl developed source rocks.  Reservoir de-
velopuent, on the other hand, is erratic due to the widespread occurrence of
tuffaceous sediments. The section underlying the Tertiary is also considered
prospective but structures could not be mapped due to Insufficient penetration
of the old selsu±c. The area bas a moderate oil and gas potential but is
severely underexplored. Seisamic coverage is very loose and data quality Is
generally poor.  A major risk is the apparent association of Tertiary source
rocks with volcanic teXfaceous sediments; structural traps, whbre indicated,
appear to be small. *    he stratigraphic sequence below the Tertiary is prac-
tically unknova.

The hydrocarbon evaluation suggeats the presence of medium to smalL sized oil,

billion cu -m of gas. These low values are a.reflectiou of the lackz of in:forma-
tion on kay parameters.
5.35 Program: There is an urgent need for a ragional geological study which
would incorporate stratigraphical, geochemical and structural data. Parallel
to these studies, ORGT wlll initiate seismic surveys (financed by the Bank
proJect) which will have the dual objective of mapping medium depth (Tertiary)
and deep (Cretaceous) horizons. As the actual prospect area is void of seismic
information, ezteasive field experiments are needed to establish shooting parameters.
Provisions have been made for the driLling of a stratigraphlc well.

Area 9 (5,000 km2)
5.36      Seismic data indicate the presence of an extensive NE-SW trending
structural feature in the central part of the area. The atructure is paralleled
by basInal areas. The area is surrounded by a string of Tertiary Baa fields.
An attempt has been made to reach the Mesozoic level on this structural trend;
while oil and gas shows have been encountered at several levels in the Tertiary
and Cretaceous, none of the wells was located on a bona fide structure. Two
distinct trapping realms are recognized: (a) structural/ltrattgraphic traps
in the Tertiary section. To detail such features, dense seismic grids are
required as well as a thorough seismo-stratigraphic evaluation combined with
pseudo velocity processing of the seismic data, attempting to detect sand wedges
by analoging of sand velocities in nearby wells; and (b) top Mesozoic prospects,
mainly dip closures.
5.37 ProsPectivity and risks: from the geological data available, it would
appear that the area is gas prone.  Expectations for Tertiary and Mesozoic
prospects are low reflection,mainly lack of structural coutrol of the prospective
horizons. Future programs should therefore ain at inventorying the Tertiary
prospects and conclusively mapping the deeper culminations. A deep test to
evaluate a Mesozoic prospect carries a high priority.

The area has a good gas potential from remaining Tertiary structures: expecta-
tions are 20 billion cu m. There are indications of large deep features which
need additional high quality seismic for their proper definition. The main
risks lie in the inadequate knowledge of reservoiT and trapping parameters.
5.39 Program: the project provides for some 400 km of seismic lines to detail
Tertiary prospects and to map a favorable structural position of the Cretaceous

structurally possible, both prospective realms,

Area 10 (3.750 km2
5.40      The area is characterized by a central high zonc whic, extends into
Romania. In Hungary this high zone is surrounded by deep basinal features which
contain large thicknesses of source rocks and reservoir rocks. A large struc-
ture in the northern part faces three Important depressions. Closure at base
Tertiary has been well established; below this horizon seismic data indicate
the presence of a thick sequence of presumably Cretaceous age. Regional
studies suggest that the latter rock units contain good reservoirs and source
rocks.           I
5.41 Prospectivity and risks: oil expectations for Tertiary horizons are high;
there is a good chance that additional oil and gas fields can be discovered
quickly; there are low chances that large additions to reserves can be made.
Lower expectations for Cretaceous prospects are readily explained by the much
lower number of structural prospects identified. Focusing seismic on deeper
horizons and drilling a number of key tests evaluating these deep horizons are
matters of great urgency.

Remaining Tertiasy prospects carry high expectations:  60 million tons of oil
and 140 billion cu m of gas, mainly from Tertiary horizons.  While there are
indications of large pre-Tertiary structures, poor seismic data have prevented
a proper prospect assessment.
5.43  Progran: exploration for Tertiary prospects carries a high priority.
OKGT will actively map such prospects as a part 'if theiT own operations. In
parallel, some areas will be selected where seismic will focus on deep pros-
pects. For this purpose, the Bank project will finance acquisition of 400 km of
high resolution seismic and drilling of one pronounced deep structure.

Area 11 (7.500 km2)
5.44      Oly six deep tests were drilled in this area and only a few low
quality ,eismLe lines are available, but OKGT has made extensive use of
gecolectric methods. A compilation of all available esploration data In-
dicates the presence of seven ubbasiuns. The younger Tertiary is thinner
than In the adjoining areas.  Furthenoro, seismic mapping will be rendered
difficult due to the presence of thick tuifitic layers, which were detected
by geoelectric measurements. The composition of pre-Tertiary rocks shows
great variations; therefore, few statements can be made regarding their hydro-
carbon potential. OKOT has followed a careful and pragmatic approach in ex-
panding exploration in this area. Ia the Mateszalka area, where good re-
flections have been obtained, they plan to drill a parameter well (-strat-
igraphic test, the results of which will aid seismic interpretation). In
the easternmost part of Area 11 a geological basin has been identified which
extends into Romania. The stratigraphic section contains favorable rock
sequences; in Romania oil has been encountered in several boreholes. Im-
mediately south of Debrecen a structurally high element has been identified
which laces a pronounced basin to the south. The regional settipg for oil
and gas generation appears favorable.

Bxpectations for all horizons are low. To a certain extent this is due to the
admixture of volcanic matter with source rocks and reservoir rocks which
sevesely downgrades some key parameters. More important, seismic coverage is
grossly inadequate; structures where known, appear small and are poorly defined.
On the other hand, there are positive signs of hydrocarbons within the area.
It is a matter of great urgency to acquire seismic data of sufficient quantity

and quality to provide a prospect inventory.  Based on this seismic data, a
well should be chosen at a location which would provide a maximum of struc-
tural and stratigraphic information. Both seismic acquisition (1,000 km)
and the drilling of one well are included in the Bank project.
5.46 Program: OKGT will drill a stratigraphic test in a key area where no
drilling problems are expected. The Bank project includes acquisition of
1,600 km of seismic in two areas.  In the Mateszalha area good quality reflections
are observed to a depth of approximately 5,000 m.
Area 12 (2.500 km2)
5.47      A deep basin trending N-S, straddles the boundary between Areas 10
and 12. In the southern part of Area 9 an extensive basement high oriented
in an E-W direction has been partly explored. This basement high is of
greatest prospective interest. It contains a fractured gas reservoir section,
several hundred meters thick. The prospect extends further to the east but
mapping of deeper horizons has been beyond the capacity of OKGT's equipment.
Along the basement high pronounced wedgeouts of Tertiary elastics are present.

The expectation curves suggest that there is a high chance that additional oil
and gas resources can be discovered in the short term. Expectations are 30
million tons of oil and 70 billion cu m of gas. To prove these expectations,
a better understanding of the porosity (including fractures) distribution in
the important reservoir horizons is required; furthermore, a better definition

of the deeper trapping realms is urgently needed.  Both are expected to be
achieved by application of high resolution seismic and seismo-stratigraphic
studies.  The Bank project provides for 500 km of seismic and drilling for
one deep well.
5-49 Program: the immediate Bank-financed exploration program will consist
of the acquisition of 500 line-km of seismic and the drilliig of one deep
well which wi1 evaluate the prospects of an additional fractured basement
reservoir.
conclusions
5.50      A statistical smmAtion of the various expectation curves shows the
following results: there is about a 80% chance that say 130 million tons of.
oil will be discovered in structures yet to be tested; there is a 50% chance
that 400 billion cu m of gas could be present. Much of these expectations are
from producing areas or areas close to producing basins. According to present
geological information, however, there are good prospects of finding additional
reserves, mainly gas, in the lesser explored basins in northwest Rungary.
5.51      In other underexplored or unexplored areas the plays as outlined
offer small expectations for oil and gas. In most cases, however, important
parameters are insufficiently known and suggestions for future work, mainly
studies, seismic acquisition and regional studies, are mandatory.
5.52      The expectation curves for individual plays indicate that locally
substantial additional reserves can be found in the short term. These will be
found mainly in conventional structures in Tertiary layers. These prospects
do not offer serious technical problems and will thus be explored by OKGT.
5.53      The upper end of the expectation curves is determined by the oil and
gas potential of deep Tertiary prospects and pre-Tertiary (including basement)
prospects. A careful study of the input data indicated particular areas whe.;e
the data base is incomplete or lacking; for each case, relevant recommendations
(studies, geophysical acquisition, drilling) have been made. For key areas in
this category the Bank project will provide the first phase of advanced ex-
ploration, i.e., acquisition of 8,600 km of seismic and drilling of 11 key
exploration wells.

HUNGARY
PETROLE-UM PROJECT
Technical Description of-the Ex2loration and EOR Com_onents
A. Exploration Component
1.       The exploration component of the project includes seismic surveys and
exploratory well drilling. These are described in the following sections.
2.       SeLimic surveys.  OKGT's seismic coverage between 1984 and 1988 will
amount to about 19,000 km of which approximately 9,200 km will be in areas
covered by the Bank project. Three types of surveys are envisaged: (a)
reconnaissance seismic In four areas which are considered prospective but
where previous operations failed to give acceptable results. In northwest
Hungary the main operational problems have been difficult terrain conditions
and extensive gravel surfaces. The latter had prevented drilling of suffi-
ciently deep shotholes with consequent limited signal penetration. Seismic
lines which were recently acquired indicate that better results can be
obtained with the vibroseis method. Under the project, about 1,300 km of new
lines will be acquired using an improved vibroseis recording instrument (120-
channel recording and two m sec sampling rate). In the area south of Lake
Balaton similar terrain conditions prevail. Trapping structures are complex
fault/thrust blocks and small wedgeouts and sand lenses; successful seismic
mapping requires high multiplicity acquisition and denser sampling rates. A
total of 1,200 km of seismic lines will be acquired here. To speed up seismic
progress without affecting quality, a Bank-financed 120-channel instrument
will be employed in this area as soon as available. In the areas south of
central mountains previous seismic acquisition was rendered difficult due to
the presence of volcanic tuffaceous layers and adverse surface conditions.
OKGT will acquire 1,600 km of seismic lines, to be financed under the Bank
project. As the actual project area is void of seismic information, extensive
field experiments are required to determine optimum shooting parameters. In
northeast Hungary accentuated terrain and the presence of tuffitic layers in
the objective section were the main reasons for the failure of previous seis-
mic work. Under the Bank project 1,600 km of seismic lines will be
acquired. In order to improve on previous surveys, larger charges and higher
multiplicity are required to achieve better penetrations. (b) In nine produc-
ing areas 2,900 km of high quality detailed seismic will be required over
specific prospect realms. These prospects have the following comnon fea-
tures. They are deeper than 3,500 m, they are structurally complex and they
are all located in prolific producing areas. Past seismic surveys were only
rarely successful due to operational/technical reasons. Consequently explora-
tion drilling for such prospects carried a high risk. The detail seismic work
financed by the project will employ bigger charges and higher shooting multi-
plicity than previous surveys in order to achieve deeper penetration. Where
possible, pattern shooting with multiple shotholes (30-50) and large total
charges will be tried. If these new seismic surveys indeed result in improved
structural control, future drilling is expected to add substantially to proven
oil and gas resources, as for each prospect there will be a nimber of follow-
ups which can be evaluated with the experience acquired in this initial
phase. (c) As conventional detailed surveys may well be insufficient for
unraveling complex, faulted structures, a pilot 3-D survey will be *introduced
and financed by the Bank in the area of Kiskunhalas where deeper reflections
have been observed. The exact area to be surveyed will be determined after
completion of the conventional survey in the area.

Annex 5.03
Page 2 of 5
3.       Seismic data processing.  The Geophysical Exploration Company (GKV),
a subsidiary of OKGT, is also entrusted with seismic processing. This is done
with a Geomax unit (Raytheon-SO with CGG software, extended by GKV's own
programs). The package is fairly advanced but it cannot be further updated as
CGG switched to other hardware. Presently the Geomax processing center can
just keep up with processing the routine output of OKGT's seismic field
crews. With the increased number of channels, the expected increase in multi-
plicity, the reprocessing of old lines and the additional more advanced pro-
cessing, the capacity of the center is too low. An immediate increase in
capacity is therefore required at the start of the Bank project.
4.       An entirely new and advanced computer center and processing software,
also capable of handling 3-D processing and seismic structural modeling, is
included in the Bank project. However, such a system cannot realistically be
expected to be fully operational before 1986/87. Therefore, as an interme-
diate solution covering the years 1984/85, a second Geomax unit (which can be
purchased at very attractive rates and installed and operated at short notice)
will be provided to double the present processing capacity. While most of the
seismic processing will be carried out locally by GKV, some 1,000 km of data
will be processed experimentally outside Hungary.
5.       Exploration drilling.  Eleven deep exploration wells will be drilled
tinder the project. Nine will be located in producing areas; they will test
deep proapects which have a high chance of finding additional hydrocarbons but
wbich could not be systematically explored due to s,vere technical problems.
Modern drilling techniques used elsewhere to overco'ie similar difficulties
will be applied by OKGT with the assistance of expi.triate consultants. The
remaining two wells will be drilled in less explored areas where extensive
seismic surveys are financed by the Bank. The particulars of those deep wells
already identifLed are summarized below.
(a)  Szt. Gyorgyvolgy:  the well would test a combination structural/
stratigraphic trap in highly overpressured Lower Tertiary sediments;
total depth (4,500 m) would be in (normally pressured) Paleezoic
rocks which are expected to be fractured. The well has thus two
objectives. There are numerous additional prospects in a similar
geological setting.
(b) Kiskunhalas: a multiple prospect area. A first well would test a
large structure at Lower Tertiary level; the well would then pene-
trate into the underlying Mesozoic formations. The Lower Tertiary
section is highly overpressured; temperatures at total depth (4,000
m) are expected to reach 2000C. A second well will be drilled fol-
lowing a 3-D survey. It will test a faulted/fractured Cretaceous
limestone prospect; tetal depth will be 4,500 m. This drilling
program is expected to open up an entirely new exploration play.
(c)  Alpar:  the well has a dual objective.  It will test an attractive
prospect in highly overpressured Tertiary sediments; it will then
enter a normally pressured, fractured Mesozoic rock sequence, which
has not been tested previously. On seismic sections, iiany follow-ups
are indicated.



- 102 -
Annex 5.03
Page 3 of 5
(d)  Mako-3:  this well aims at testing a deep fault closure with Lower
Tertiary and Triassic objectives, west of the giant Algyo field.
Pressures and temperatures are expected to be very high. Success at
this location would lead to considerable follow-up drilling.
(e) Fabiansebestven: this is a key well in Area 10. It has three main
objectives: Tertiary, Cretaceous and (presumably) fractured base-
ment; the latter two are practically untested in this area. Risks
are high pressures and high temperatures. Total depth is 4,300 m.
(f)  Mezotur:  the prospective Cretaceous sectirn is overlain by over-
pressured Lower Tertiary formations. Success at this location would
greatly expand the prospectivity of the Cretaceous prospect realm.
Total depth would be 4,600 m.
(g) Doboz: a deep well which aims at testing Mesozoic horizons expected
to te highly fractured and gas bearing. Again the objective section
is overlain by geopressured Lower Tertiary sediments. Temperatures
are expected to be in excess of 2000C.
(h)  Bagamer;  a test of a structural/stratigraphic setting which has
similarities with the Carpathian prospective area in Romania. The
well will test Tertiary and pre-Tertiary sediments; the latter appear
to be strongly disturbed. Total depth is expected at 4,000 m, but it
may well be shallower due to an extremely high temperature gradient.
B. Enhanced Oil Recovery Component
6.       The enhanced oil recovery (EOR) component of the project includes one
field demonstration test and four pilot EOR tests. These are described in the
following sections.
7.       Nagylengyel Carbon Dioxide Injeclon Field Demonstration Test.  Pilot
tests conducted by OKGT in the past have indicated that ultimate recovery of
oil from the Nagylengyel field in southwest Hungary could be increased by 4-
16% by injecting carbon dioxide in order to create a seconcdary gas cap in the
reservoir. However, due to the karstic nature of the reservoir rock which
precludes mathematical modeling, the feasibility of the process needs to be
verified over a relatively large area of the reservoir. The Block I Creta-
ceous (Rudistic) reservoir has been chosen for this purpose. The project
requires (i) the drilling and completion of two carbon dioxide wells and the
recompletion of three existing wells in the Budafa field about 35 km to the
south; (ii) the drilling and completion of 6 gas injection wells and the re-
completion of 36 production wells in Nagylengyel; and (iii) the construction
of surface facilities at Budafa and Nagylengyel and a 20-inch 35.1 km carbon
dioxide pipeline between Budafa and Nagylengyel. If economically successful,
the field demonstration test would be expanded into a field-wide application
which is expected to provide an incremental oil recovery of 2-7 million tons.
8.       Demten Steam Injection Pilot Test.  The thermal recovery pilot tests
conducted by OKGT in the past, although indicating a potential to increase
ultimate oil recovery from the Demjen field substantially, failed to reach
conclusive results on the basis of which full-scale EOR projects can be
designed. The economics of the thermal EOR methods remain undetermined, and



- 103 -
Annex 5.03
Page 4 of 5
practical operating problems, specifically controlling the propagation of a
displacement front in the reservoir, are yet to be resolved, These can only
be achieved throlugh well-designed and controlled field pilot tests. The
purpose of both the steam injection and in-situ combustion pilot tests (para.
10) is therefore to find practical solutions.to operating problems deriving
from the complex reservoir geology and clarifying the economics of thermal EOR
methods in Demjen.
9.       The steam injection pilot test will be conducted in the Block A d-
layer of the West Demjen field.  As a result of the steamflooding, SZKFI
expects to recover about 63,000 tons of incremental oil corresponding to 18%
of the oil initially in place in the test area. The main component of the
project are: (i) drilling of five steam injection wells and equipping of six
steam injection and 11 production wells with high- temperature wellhead equip-
ment; (ii) construction of approximately 2 km of gathering and steam injection
pipelines; (iii) construction of an oil gathering station equipped with emul-
sion treating, oil and water measuring, storage and disposal facilities; (iv)
construction of a steam generation station (about 350 ton/day at 40 atm)
complete with water softening and purification facilities; and (v) provision
of utilities (power, fuel and water).
10.      Demjen In-Situ Combustion Pilot Test.  A wet in-situ combustion pilot
test will be conducted in the DK reservoir block of the East Demjen oil
field. The pilot will involve layers c, da and df encountered between 250 and
350 m. The design includes six air injection and 18 production wells. On the
basis of previous pilot tests and laboratory studies SZKFI estimates the
incremental recovery to be obtained from the test area at about 49,500 tons
(or 34.4% of the oil originally in place). The main components of the project
are: (i) drilling and completing six air injection and three production wells
approximately 300 m deep and recompleting 15 existing we'ls for in-situ com-
bustion production; (ii) construction of wellhead facilities, gathering and
air and water injection pipe lines for six injection and 1  production wells;
(iii) construction of an air compressor station (200,000 m /day capacity, 115-
atm discharge pressure); (iv) construction Jr an oil gathering station con-
plete with emulsion treating, gas separation, storage and oil, gas and water
measuring and disposal facilities and flare stack; and (v) expansion of the
central oil terminal, railway filling station and utilities.
11.      Algyo Micellar Solution Injection Pilot Test. A micellar solution
injection pilot test will be conducted in the NY-1 section of the Szeged-1 oil
reservoir in the Algyo field, Hungary's largest hydrocarbon accumulation. To
this end six existing wells will be used as production wells and two new
injection wells will be drilled. The application of the micellar solution is
expected to result in increasing the recovery of oil from the reservoir by
about 10% over conventional waterflooding. The main components of the project
are: (i) drilling and completion of two injection wells approximately 2,400 m
deep, and working over six existing wells; and (ii) construction of apprxi.-
mately 1 km of injection and gathering lines.
12.      Algyo Enriched Gas Injection Pilot Test.  An enriched gas injection
pilot test will be conducted in the small Tisza-Z oil reservoir in the Algyo
field using the ethane-rich overhead gas from the nearby Algyo gas processing
plant. Four existing crestal wells will be used for gas injection; 11 exist-
ing wells will be used as production wells. Based on laboratory tests the

incremental recovery from miscible gas injection is expected to be 4-14%,
resulting in an Incremental recovery from the test area of about 46,000-
154,000 tons. The main components of the project are: (i) construction of
approximately 8 km of gas injection lines and rehabilitation of existin
gathering lines and wellhead facilities; (ii) ionstruction of a compressor
station and gas distribution center (120,000 m /day capacity at 200 bar dis-
charge pressure); and (iii) rehabilitation of the existing oil gathering
station and utilities.

l   There is no standard disbursement profile for petroleum projects and for
Hungarian projects due to insufficient history and number of completed
projects. The estimated schedule of disbursements is based on the
following assumptions: (i) oil field service charges will be disbursed
three months after the services have been performed; and (ii) materials
and equipment will be procured six months prior to actual use in the
project.

HUNGARY: PETROLEUM PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
A.       Production and Import Quantities
1.       The total oil and natural gas consumption in Hungary during the fore-
cast period (1984-89) was determined on the basis of Government estimates.
The annual total crude nil refinery run of OKGT was also fixed based on the
capacity and product mix range of OKGT's refineries as well as the expected
consumption.  Some imports and exports of refined products continue during the
forecast period due to minor   fferences between the refinery product mix and
the consumption mix.  The oil_I and gas production levels of OKGT with the
proposed project was also established and the difference between requirement
(for consumption) and domestic production was covered by imports. The produc-
tion and import quantities are shown below.

B. Prices and Costs
2.       The financial forecasts assume that OKGT's selling prices remain at
current levels. Similarly, all of the costs, with the exception of the
provision for exploration and field development, the production taxes, as well
as wages are assumed to remain at current levels. The provision for
exploration and field development is assumed to increase according to the
formula establishd by the Ministry of Finance for 1983-1985 (Annex 4.03, para.
5). After 1985, the provision is assumed to be less than the actual
expenditures by about Ft 25 million per year, as expected for 1985. Wages are
assumed to increase at a rate of 5% per year. Production taxes are assumed to
reduced by the same amount as the increase in the provision for exploration
and field development.

HUNGARY:  PETROLEUM   PROJECT
Minimum Petroleum Discovery..
To Earn 20% Economic Rate of Return
A. Main AssumRtions
1.       The objective of this analysis is to determine the minimum u :otal
recoverable petroleum reserves (initial) that ahould be discovered su that the
exploration component, together with the subsequent field appraisal, develop-
ment and production, would earn a 20% economic rate of return. Most of the
petroleum reservoirs in Hungary have moderate quantities of recoverable
reserves (initial) ranging from I to 5 million tons of oil equivalent (TOE).
Given the recent exploration drilling success rate of OKGT in the seven basins
to be explored under the project (507) and the fact that the wells under the
project will be drilled in the best prospects identified so far, it is assumed
that the exploration component included in the project (11 wells to be drilled
on eleven prospects in seven basins) would discover six reservoirs with this
range of recoverable reserves.
2.       As many of the petroleum fields expected to be discovered are likely
to contain multiple reservoirs, it is also assumed that each reservoir will
subsequently require one appraisal and five development wells, each well
costing about 50% of the average exploration well cost under the project
(i.e., US$ 4 million in 1983 prices including 25% physical contingencies of
which 50% would be foreign exchange costs). Given that substantial baaic
infrastructure, such as roads, pipelines, oil and gas terminals, are already
present in five of the seven basins, the cost of surface facilities is assumed
to average about US$ 10 million per reservoir. About 2'% of this cost would
be in foreign exchange. The annual economic productiotn costs, that is,
excluding depreciation, provisions, taxes and other transfer payments, are
estimated to be about 2% of the total development expenditures of which also
25% will be foreign exchange costs.
3.       It is further assumed that 50% of the recoverable reserves would be
produced during the first five years of production. Subsequently, the produc-
tion rate is assumed to decline by 15% per year. The economic price of oil is
taken Jo be US$ 215 per ton (1983 prices) and that of natural gas US$ 139 per
1000 m (based on fuel oil parity) throughout the production period. Finally,
it is assumed that about 75% of the recoverable petroleum discovered will be
gas and 25% will be oil. The weighted average value of the discovery would
therefore be about US$ 182 per TOE.
3.       On the basis of the above assumptions, a total recoverable reserves
of about 9.9 million TOE would yield a 20% economic rate of return as shown in
the following cost and benefit streams. The corresponding cumulative value of
the benefits (i.e., petroleum revenue) during the fifteen year primary produc-
tion life (1992-2007) would be about US$ 1.74 billion (in 1983 terms) which
would represent a gross foreign exchange savings. This compares favorably
with the cumulative foreign exchange cost (for exploration, development and
production) of about US$ 227 million during 1984-2007e The cumulative net
foreign exchange savings through 2007 would thus be about US$ 1.51 billion.
