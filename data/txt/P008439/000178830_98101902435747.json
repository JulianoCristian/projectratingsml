The project consists of: (a) an\n            exploration component including exploratory deep well\n            drilling; (b) an enhanced oil recovery component including\n            four pilot tests and a semi-commercial field demonstration;\n            (c) rehabilitation of one, and development of two gas\n            fields; and (d) technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
