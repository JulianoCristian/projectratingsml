     support the Government's strategy for the development\n            of the petroleum sector.  This strategy is aimed at\n            arresting the decline in domestic oil and gas production\n            through a series of priority investments in exploration,\n            field development and rehabilitation and enhanced oil\n            recovery.  The project also plans to assist in strengthening\n            OKGT's capabilities in the overall management of the\n            petroleum sector.  The project consists of: (a) an\n            exploration component including exploratory deep well\n            drilling; (b) an enhanced oil recovery component including\n            four pilot tests and a semi-commercial field demonstration;\n            (c) rehabilitation of one, and development of two gas\n            fields; and (d) technical assistance and training."}, "docdt": "1984-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
