Related to the\n            long term goal of the project, i.e. modernization of the\n            Ministry and establishment of conditions that would ensure\n            sustainability of road rehabilitation and maintenance over\n            time (creation of a road fund, increased utilization of the\n            private sector, devolution of responsibilities for road\n            maintenance at the municipal level, a reformed Ministry for\n            Public Works), the outcome of the project remains uncertain.\n            Sustainability of the project as a whole is uncertain,\n            though sustainability of the various physical components is\n            clearly likely. The Bank's performance is overall rated\n            unsatisfactory, although marginally. The project preparation\n            was thorough. The Bank closely supervised the implementation\n            of the physical components and of the action plans, despite\n            the persisting security problems in the country and\n            dwindling commitment from the MIRP to the reform objective.\n            However, the Bank was in a way unable to provide the needed\n            guidance to the GoA to implement the project in the early\n            years of project implementation. Bank's supervision\n            also focused on delivery of components and failed to\n            sufficiently analyze how this would influence the outcome of\n            the project and hence the attainment of the project\n            objectives. Borrower's performance is rated\n            unsatisfactory. Performance was satisfactory during project\n            preparation and in the last years of implementation, but\n            unsatisfactory during the first half of project's\n            implementation. the Borrower failed to pursue the\n            project's goals and to implement many of the reform\n            actions, which it insisted be included during project\n            preparation. Lessons learned pertained 1) to the complexity\n            of project design in an uncertain county environment with\n            weak institutions existing, the need for a condition of\n            effectiveness to test client commitment; 2) inadequate\n            coordination among agencies and ministries and the need of\n            the Bank to set in place mechanisms to facilitate\n            implementation; 3) the absence of an adequate financial\n            system, which made it difficult to have reliable information\n            on project disbursements and funds; 4) the too cursory\n            analysis of risks during appraisal; 5) the need of\n            supervision missions to focus on long-term goals in addition\n            to short term issues and delivery of outputs; and 6) the\n            lack of counterpart funds, which created major delays and\n            tensions, along with the need to closely coordinate between\n            the sectoral and the finance ministries during supervision."}, "docdt": "2003-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
