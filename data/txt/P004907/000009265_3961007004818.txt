NNORAUDUM MAND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBBD TO TUE MMCUTIV  DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOW TO TIE
DEMOCRATIC um  POPULAR  EULIC OF ALY ERIA
FOR A SIXTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Democratic and
Popular Republic of Algeria for  the-equivalent of US$130
million to help finance a Sixth Highway Project.  The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with
a maturity of 17 years,. including S years of grace.
1.      Background.^  In a most difficult politico-economic settingi the
Government has embarked on far-reaching reforms to create a market-based
economy. Improving transport is an integral part of this policy. Algeria's
transport infrastructure is comprised of a 95,000 km-long road network, 5,100
km of railway tracks, ten major ports, 11 international airports, and 5,000 km
of oil and gas pipelines. It provides good coverage of transport needs across
the country, but is old and has not been upgraded or adapted to modern
transport technologies. Roads carry 90% of passengers and freight, and their
condition is deteriorating steadily, with the proportion of good national and
wilaya roads falling from 49% in 1987 to about 41W in 1992.  No more than 201
of roads in the municipal network are in good condition. Funding of road
maintenance is an issue, even though a drastic revision of p::iorities has
taken place in recent years, reducing new construction from two-third to one
third of total Government budget for national and Wilaya roads. For municipal
roads, local budgets cannot sustain normal maintenance, and the financial
support given by the central Government is essentially, and inappropriately,
for construction and reconstruction.
2.      The Ministry of rnfrastructure and Regional Planning (MIRP) is in
charge of rational road planning and supervision of works. Its grip on the
road administration was loosened following a sweeping decentralization in
1984. The provincial Governments, or Wilaya, manage their own road budgets,
plus the largest part of the national roads budget by delegation from MIRP.
Decentralization contributed to weakening of standards of project technical
and economical feasibility, which MI has now undertaken to restore through
development of national guidelines for road strengthening and rehabilitation.
Similar efforts are being made for rehabilitation of bridges, an area
neglected to date and where action is overdue. Better prioritization of road
works should also be targeted, through expansion of network-based maintenance.
An autonomous motorway agency, ANA, was created in 1993 to manage the motorway
construction program, but it needs technical support. The road industry,
including contractors, laboratories, quarries, bitumen distribution, and
engineering consulting, are dominated by public enterprises. Competition,
strongly encouraged under Bank projects, has been growing but the private
sector has not become involved to the extent desirable because it does not
find the enabling environment it needs to do so. The heavy constraints
imposed on the road industry until now, namely limited access to foreign
exchange, irregularity in supplies of needed inputs and payment delays, have
very adverse effects on private enterprises, which are generally small and
discriminated against in subtle ways by some public works (PK) managers.



-2-
3.      Project Objectives.  The objective of the Project is to enhance the
capabilities of the Borrower to manage its road sector by (i) reducing the
backlog of roads and bridges in need of rehabilitation and maintenance, (ii)
strengthening the Borrower's agencies responsible for the management and
maintenance of roads; (iii) providing sustainable solutions to finance road
rehabilitation and maintenance works; and (iv) creating an environment   -
conducive to the efficient utilization of human and financial resources in the
Borrower's road sector, in particular through increased competition,
-participation of the private sector and implementation of a quality
improvement strategy.
4.      Project Description.  The project consists of three principal
components: (a) road rehabilitation works: strengthening and rehabilitation of
roads carrying high-and-medium traffic volumes (34%), a repair program for
priority bridges (7%), plus related design and supervision (3%); (b) Deriodic
maintenance by contract for national roads (26%), pilot program for municipal
roads (7%), current and emergency maintenance by force account through
purchase of equipment, and traffic counting equipment (6%), and design, and
supervision of works (i%); (c) traininci. technical assistance and studies: for
institutional development, with a focus on the ANA (S), on modernization of
MI's management (6%), studies of general interest to the sub-sector (3t), and
audit of key road enterDrises (1%).
S.      Project Implementation.  MIRP would be the executing agency through
its specialized departments. A staff member is designated to coordinate
project implementation. The project will finance consultants to supervise
road works and advise on technical matters as they arise. Municipalities
participating in the pilot program will be asked to enter into agreements
conferring the responsibility of executing agency to the PW administration.
The loan proceeds going to capacity building for ANA will be treated as grant
from the Government to ANA.   The development of effectiveness in quality
control will be monitored by the CTTP (the national technical organization in
charge of setting the standards for quality control) for the Ministry, and the
newly-created network of PW laboratories.
6.      Project Sustainability.  Good road management, especially the
management of works quality is essential to project sustainability, as is
regular funding of maintenance. The proposed capacity building is tailored to
meet the first requirement, especially through the strong development of
continuous training of engineers and managers in the PW, and new curricula of
advanced engineering studies which will ensure higher qualification of young
recruits at entry into the profession. Generalization of the funding
mechanism tested under the pilot municipal road program, and the possible
establishment of a Road Fund by mid-term review will strongly work toward
meeting the second requirement. In addition, Action Plans to eliminate long-
standing bottlenecks in quarry and bitumen supplies, improve performance of
public laboratories and speed up payments to contractors and consultants are
at the core of the strategy to create the enabling environment that a dynamic
construction industry needs.



-3-
7.      Lessons From Previous Bank Operations.  Bank experience of transport
lending to Algeria spans more than two decades. Road projects have met with
relatively good results, and a satisfactory rapport has been developed with
MIRP. The Highway V project introduced competition, maintenance by contract,
and the institution building of the CTTP.
Some problems have been clearly identified in relation to: (a) progress on
proc.urement, (b) slow disbursement due to poor handling of requests by the
Algerian Development Bank (BAD) and other intervening entities;
(c) inoperative decision making processes when other ministries are directly
involved: and (d) difficulties for some locals to collaborate with foreign
consultants, either'as a client-or as a partner in joint ventures.'
8.      Rationale For Bank Involvement.  Good maintenance of road
infrastructure is essential to' economic-development as'roads carry the brunt
of traffic. The current maintenance backlog must be eliminated. Local road
budgets are tight and extensive external financing is needed. Bank involvement
will be important to: (a) maintain the priority on maintenance during the
stabilization program; (b) support modernization and training efforts at MIRP,
and (c) restore donor confidence. The wealth of experience acquired by the
Bank from other similar operation bodes well for its ability to assist in
addressing organizational and financial issues; and the Bank could be
particularly effective at this particular juncture of time when Algeria seems
ready to move toward liberalization of its economy. The project is closely
linked to the overall country strategy established in the Country Brief issued
in June 1994, particularly concerning public expenditure reforms, development
of the private sector and public enterprise sector reform. Measures designed
to improve the incentive framework in the road maintenance industry, together
with specific steps for increased participation by private contractors to road
works programs will strongly contribute to deepening reforms (private sector
promotion, enhanced competition, development of small- and medium-scale
enterprises, privatization and public enterprise restructuring) sought under
the ERL scheduled for Board approval in January 1995.
9.      Issues and Actions.  The main issues, the corresponding actions and
their link with conditionalities are described below:
(a)    Policy- _nd Financing:  inadequate taxation of road users is being
addressed through: (i) the ongoing update of the user charges study,
(ii) tbe ongoing revision of road user charges to be complemented, by
the possible establishment of a road fund to assure road maintenance,
and (iii) a loan effectiveness conditional4.ty to create the
appropriate inter-ministerial committee for studying the
establishment of a road fund. The consistency of short-and medium
term road sector policy is being improved by several project
components and is summarized in a road sector policy letter signed by
the Minister of MIRP. Foreign exchange scarcity is being addressed
through: (i) a new regulation allowing access to foreign currency,
and (ii) the possible import financing of road bitumen out of the
proceeds of the ERL.



-4-
(b)     Imnlementation Canabilities: slow disbursements and loose control of
decentralized units are being addressed by: (i) a comprehensive
analysis of disbursement circuits, procedures, and the
"debudgetizzation" of road rehabilitation works, and (ii) a re-
centralization of'decisions for selection of local public-works
directors by MIRP; lengthy procurement is being addressed by: (i) a
letter already signed by the Director of Roads imposing specific
deadlines for each administrative step on local Directorates, and.
(ii) a series of targeted training seminars on procurement.
Deficient supply of bitumen and quarry supplies is being addressed
by: (i) an audit of bitumen supply and quality, followed by an action
plan,- and (ii) -a national diagnostic -and training process on
quarries; poor performance of the "quality control chain" and
weakness of laboratories are being addressed by: (i) an in depth
audit of laboratories, (ii}-an inproved contractor- qualification
process, (iii) specific targeted studies and training, and (iv) an
action plan on laboratories.   Specific criteria on financial
viability for contractor qualification has been developed to
eliminate non-performing public contractors;
ic)     Human Resources: shortage of middle management skills at MIRP is
being addressed by: ti) the development of an autonomous motorway
agency (ANA), (ii) recent recruitment of several engineers combined
with an intensive training plan, (iii) the nomination of a project
coordinator, (iv) the development of a systematic process of learning
from past failures and (v) specific technical assistance for the
Ministry of Infrastructure;
(d)     Municipal Road Maintenance is being addressed by: (i} renewed
dialogue between MIRP, MF, CNP and the Ministry of the Interior
(MICLERA)on financing and institutional issues, (ii) a pilot project
component on periodic maintenance of municipal roads, and (iii) a
loan effectiveness conditionality to create the appropriate inter-
ministerial committee for pilot project monitoring.
10.     En7ironmental Aspects.  As road works will be limited to
rehabilitation and maintenance of existing roads, no potentially adverse
environmental impact is expected; there will be no resettlement. A special
environment handbook on road rehabilitation has been developed at the Bank's
request to train local engineers and help them avoid and/or mitigate possible
impacts. Another environment handbook on new road construction will be
prepared under the project. The project has environmental benefits, e.g.
environmentally-conscious institutional improvements. Road safety will be
improved during the project through infrastructure audits and greater
attention will be paid to user and construction crew safety during work
execution. The project will introduce dust control for quarries and asphalt
plants.  The project has been rated B.
11.     Project Benefits.  Direct benefits will accrue to road users as
reduced vehicle operating costs, and to central and local Governments as
avoided reconstruction costs of roads and bridges. Estimated economic rates of



-5-
return are within 20-40 percent for rehabilitation works and higher for road
strengthening and bridge rehabilitation. Secondary benefits are to come from
the more enabling environment created for the private sector. Streamlining of
-input supplies to work sites, and enhancement of quality controls will reduce
road maintenance costs and extend,durability of pavement works..Moreover,
better road management will result-in much more efficient uses of scarce-
resources. These secondary benefits are significant albeit hard to measure.
12.     Risks.  Political uncertainties constitute the main risk. Restoration-
of normal working conditions nationwide is necessary for smooth project
implementation and proper Bank supervision.-More controllable risks are: (a)
the opposition of vested interests.-to reforms, e.g., laboratories and bitumen
suppliers, which the action plans will help ove=come; (b) a failure of the
pilot municipal roads program which would prevent its replication nationwide,
a risk minimized through careful project design; and (c) insufficient
counterpart funds, however budgetary resources have already been secured for
more than 66% of project costs.
13.     Special Measures to Temporarily Adapt to the Security Situation.  The
recent experience of the Fifth Highway Project implementation under the
present security situation has enabled us to assess corresponding risks to
this project and identify adaptative measures: (a) for civil works, the main
risks are destruction of asphalt plants and slow implementation; flexibility
will be given to the Director of Roads to launch works wherever such
destruction is less likely and security measures have been strengthened; the
provision of explosives for quarries is highly protected by the police
force;(b) for studies, the main risk is the unwillingness of needed foreign
experts to travel to Algeria; work has been organized in such a way as to
achieve maximum complementarity between local and foreign consultants, train
local consultants at foreign partners, headquarters and have regular working
meetings outside Algeria. Adaptive measures to maintain supervision
effectiveness include: (a) hiring a high-level local consultant who regularly
meets counterparts, visits work sites and takes video films; (b) regular
working meetings between Bank staff and Algerian counterparts at the Bank's
Paris office, and (c) frequent phone calls/faxes for maintaining continuous
contact. To develop reasonable policy continuity despite the possible change
of key personnel, the loan agreement covenant on action plans will strengthen
the implementation framework, outlined in the policy letter. Such measures
will enable the launching of the Sixth Highway Project under the present
circumstances, but regular evaluations of their effectiveness are necessary
during this temporary exception to standard supervision Bank rules, and the
next possible supervision mission of Bank staff in the field should be quite
extensive.
14.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executives
Directors approve it.
