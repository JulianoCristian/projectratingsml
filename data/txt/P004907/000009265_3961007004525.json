enhance the capabilities of Algeria to manage\n            its road sector by: 1) reducing the backlog of roads and\n            bridges in need of rehabilitation and maintenance; 2)\n            strengthening the agency responsible for the management and\n            maintenance of roads; 3) providing sustainable solutions to\n            finance road rehabilitation and maintenance works; and 4)\n            creating an environment conducive to the efficient\n            utilization of human and financial resources in the road\n            sector, in particular through increased competition,\n            participation of the private sector and implementation of a\n            quality improvement strategy. The project will finance road\n            rehabilitation works by strengthening high-traffic basic\n            economic network pavements; rehabilitating medium-traffic\n            national roads with appropriate low-cost technologies;\n            rehabilitating priority bridges; and related design and\n            supervision. The project will also finance road maintenance\n            through periodic maintenance by contract for national roads;\n            purchasing of equipment for current and emergency\n            maintenance of Saharan tracks and for traffic counting;\n            providing technical assistance for and executing a pilot\n            program for maintenance of municipal roads; and related\n            supervision, general studies and training."}, "docdt": "1995-01-06T00:00:00Z"}
