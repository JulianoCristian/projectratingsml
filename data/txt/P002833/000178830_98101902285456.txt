INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TOGO
FOR A RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN COTTON AREAS
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Togo for the equivalent of US$14.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a rural development project
in cotton areas. The French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) is expected
to provide co-financing for the project in the form of a grant in an amount
equivalent to US$5.1 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on Togo, Report No. 458a-TO "Current
Economic Situation and Prospects of Togo" was issued on December 30, 1974. A
basic economic mission visited Togo in March/April 1976 and discussion of the
report with Government is planned for October 1977. The report's main findings
are incorporated below. Annex I contains basic country data.
3.        Togo's long-term annual average growth of GNP per capita in real
terms has been about 4 percent during 1960-75. From 1966 to 1970, GDP growth
in real terms was steady, averaging 6 percent yearly. The sustained expansion
of Togo's economy was due, in great part, to a vigorous expansion of phosphate
exports at favorable prices and also to good market conditions for cocoa and
coffee exports. With its low-tariff structure - a legacy from trusteeship
days - Togo developed into an important regional commercial entrepot and, with
fast commercial growth, accumulated substantial foreign reserves. Between
1965 and 1970, Togolese exports increased by 22 percent a year in current
prices. During this same period, imports - particularly of consumer goods, of
which a high percentage were subsequently re-exported - also rose sharply.
4.        In the early 1970s, real GDP growth continued at a rate of about
6 percent per annum (1970-73) though with wide disparities among sectoral
contributions. GDP growth was mostly sustained by mining and services
activities (10 percent and 7 percent growth per annum respectively), while
agricultural production decreased due to adverse weather conditions, and
border trade, sharply curtailed by Togo's neighbors, also declined. In 1974,
with the quadrupling of phosphate prices, the trade balance recorded a sizeable
surplus (15 percent of GDP). This surplus turned into a deficit (7 percent of
GDP) in 1975, with a reduced phosphate export volume. A further trade deficit
was registered in 1976 with lower phosphate prices. The 1975 per capita GDP
is estimated at US$290.
5.        The Togolese Government has generally followed prudent financial
policies which have led to some budgetary savings during periods of high export
growth. For instance, budgetary revenues rose from about 11 percent of GDP
during 1966-70 to 19 percent in 1975, and budgetary savings increased from an
average of 2.7 percent (1966-70) to 5.9 percent of GDP in 1975.    Selected tax



- 2 -
increases as well as public savings generated through the Office des Produits
Agricoles Togolais (OPAT) as a result of favorable world market prices for
coffee and cocoa, have helped improve domestic resource mobilization. How-
ever, export prices and volumes fell in late 1975 and early 1976 (para. 4);
foreign exchange reserves, which rose to record highs of seven months of
imports during 1974, decreased to the equivalent of about three months' import
requirements in 1976. Togo's market-oriented economy has historically shown
tthe capacity to adjust rapidly to swings in agriculture and trade, but the
magnitude of the recent fluctuations in phosphate earnings was unprecedented,
thus resulting in heavy short term borrowing from BCEAO (the regional Central
Bank) and private sources in late 1975 and 1976 which subsequently increased
the debt service ratio (para. 9). The Government is now reviewing expenditure
plans which were based on expectations of high phosphate revenues, and is
taking steps to restrain expenditures, including decisions to freeze new
hiring and to postpone or slow down public investment.
6.        Much of Togo's rural population has remained untouched by the modern
sector's economic expansion. To improve conditions in the countryside, the
Government is accelerating the promotion of food crops and important cash crops
like cocoa, coffee and cotton, especially in less developed regions of the
country. The Government's growing concern with social equity is shown by its
policy to distribute more widely the benefits of economic growth. For instance
it raised producer prices of agricultural products and selectively increased
minimum wages and salary levels -- especially for lower paid staff -- and
abolished the head tax. Some further reallocation of current and capital
expenditures towards the rural sector may also be needed to achieve the
Government's objectives in this sector.
7.        Togo's development outlook is favorable with prospects for GDP growth
during the next decade of about 7 percent per year and further improvement in
income distribution and employment. The 1976-80 Development Plan assesses the
physical and institutional bottlenecks to future growth withl considerable
realism, although financial targets have had to be revised in the light of
recent price movements. The Government's strategy is to further diversify the
economy and exploit natural resources, to rehabilitate and expand both food
and cash crops production, to further improve the country's infastructure in
order to lay the ground for new, directly productive investments, and to
promote international regional cooperation. Longer term development policy
gives emphasis to equity and employment, including basic education reform,
rural development programs and extension of the feeder roads network, promo-
tion of small- and medium-scale indigenous enterprises and the search for
more labor-intensive techniques.
8.        While domestic resources available for public investment more than
tripled between 1966-70, foreign financing doubled thus reducing the average
foreign share in the financing of total public investments from nearly 70
percent during the First Plan period to close to 50 percent in 1971-75. While
the Bank Group has become a major donor, the European Development Fund, the
Federal Republic of Germany and France provided more than 75 percent of



total capital aid disbursement, which averaged between 5 and 7 percent of GDP
during the past 10 years. The bulk of this assistance was primarily for
infrastructure projects. The expected level of public investment will require
continued efforts by the Togolese Government to mobilize increasing amounts of
domestic resources. Traditional donors are likely to provide relatively large
amounts for public investment, but Togo has already begun to diversify its
sources of assistance by approaching OPEC and other Western and Eastern
countries.
9.        During 1971-74, aid to Togo was provided on relatively soft terms,
with grants accounting for about 50 percent of foreign capital inflow. As
of December 31, 1975, the country's external public debt amounted to US$157
million (of which one-third was undisbursed), mostly incurred at low interest
rates and with repayment periods of more than 10 years. More recently, the
share of suppliers' credits and commercial borrowing has increased. Average
debt service payments, which amounted to about 4 percent of exports from 1971
to 1975, have gone up to about 19 percent (including short-term debt service)
in 1976. Given Togo's good longer-term economic prospects, the Government
should be able to reduce the debt service ratio to below 10 percent by 1980.
In view of the country's low per capita income, the growing need for external
funding of priority projects in an expanding economy, and Togo's exposure to
widely fluctuating world market conditions, the major part of foreign financing
necessary to sustain economic growth should continue to be provided on conces-
sionary terms. Because Togo is expected to be able to finance about 30
percent of its public investment program, foreign donors should continue to
provide on average at least 70 percent of total project costs including -- in
appropriate cases -- some financing of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TOGO
10.       To date the Bank Group has extended five credits to Togo amounting
to US$37.9 million and two loans totalling US$53.0 million for the CIMAO re-
gional clinker project (a loan of US$3.5 million to Togo and one of Us$49.5
million to CIMAO). Three of the credits were for highway construction and
maintenance and two for agricultural projects. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank Group operations in Togo as of June 30, 1977, as well as
notes on the execution of the projects.
11.       The Highway Maintenance Project, the Bank Group's first lending
operation in Togo, was satisfactorily completed. The Second Highway Project
evolved from preinvestment studies financed under the first and provided for
the construction or upgrading of three highways and the continuation of the
maintenance program. This project is progressing satisfactorily although, due
to inflation, the scope of the road construction component had to be reduced
in 1976. The Third Highway Project has, as its main objective, the improve-
ment of two important roads serving mainly agricultural areas, and the continua-
tion of the efforts begun under the two previous highway projects to build up
an efficient road maintenance service. A fourth road project focusing on
feeder roads was appraised last July. The aim of this project would be the



- 4 -
establishment of a central agency to carry out feeder roads construction and
maintenance for the whole of Togo. This would be achieved by equipping,
training and staffing the Department of Genie Rural within the Ministry
of Rural Improvement.
12.       The first agricultural project for which a credit was approved in
1974, covers part of a long-range program for the development of the Plateau
region's coffee and cocoa potential. This project, which includes planting
and maintenance of 4,400 ha of cocoa and 4,000 ha of coffee, is proceeding
well. The second agricultural credit, which was approved in June, 1976,
provides financing for a rural development project in the Maritime Region
geared primarily to increasing food crop production and providing support
services and rural infrastructure for 20,000 farm families. Project imple-
mentation has begun on schedule.
13.       Togo is the host of the CIMAO project, one of the largest interna-
tional industrial ventures so far undertaken in West Africa. Implementation
of this US$284 million clinker project, financed by the Bank and seven other
official aid agencies, is proceeding satisfactorily.
14.       The future lending program will include in addition to the Feeder
Roads Project two agriculture projects and an education project.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
15.       Agriculture is vital to the Togolese economy.   It employs some 75
percent of the active population and provides nearly 40 percent of the coun-
try's total export earnings.
16.       Togo's approximately 300,000 farm families work holdings that aver-
age 2-5 ha. Cultivation is usually done by traditional techniques and yields
are low. Yams, maize, rice and sorghum account for over 80 percent of agricul-
tural output, the bulk of which is for subsistence. The main export crops are
cocoa and coffee (which together account for 75 percent of agricultural ex-
ports), cotton, groundnuts, and copra. GDP per capita in the rural sector is
low, less than US$100.
17.       Responsibility for the agricultural sector is now shared by two
ministries: the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR), which is concerned with
policy formulation and program coordination of production activities; and the
Ministry of Rural Improvement (MAR), which is concerned with rural infrastruc-
ture development and support services. The execution of development projects
is entrusted to autonomous public corporations which are regionally or product
oriented. The five SORADs (Societes Regionales d'Amenagement et de Developpe-
ment) were set up in 1966-1967, with responsibility for all development
activities within their regions, including extension services, rural engineer-
ing, input supplies, credit distribution and marketing. The SORADs' effective-
ness has been undercut by the lack of clearly defined programs, shortage of



trained manpower, inadequate management and limited financing. A number of
crop-oriented specialized corporations have recently been set up: SRCC for
cocoa and coffee, SONAPH for oilpalm, SOTOCO for cotton (para. 21), and
TOGOFRUIT for fruits. Their responsibilities range from the supply of
inputs and the provision of extension services to primary marketing and
processing. This has led to some duplication between the role of the spe-
cialized corporations and the SORADs. The Government has been considering
since some time regrouping all extension activities under a unified service,
attached to the Ministry of Rural Development, but decentralized at the
regional level. Technical support, training, marketing and processing for
specific crops would still be supplied by the specialized corporations. The
recent Government decision to formally place the SORADs in charge of food
crops and to transfer these agencies from the Ministry of Rural Improvement
to the Ministry of Rural Development would seem to be a positive step towards
unification of activities. Since the focus of the present project is on
cotton production, and its positive impact on the other crops is merely inci-
dental thereto, SOTOCO is the most suitable project entity, while under the
previous Maritime Region Rural Development Project the regionally oriented
agency, SORAD, was assigned the key role.
18.       Agricultural credit is extended by the National Bank for Agricul-
tural Credit (CNCA), which was set up in 1967. Most of CNCA's loans to
farmers have been channeled through the product-oriented corporations and the
SORADs. Inadequate credit policy and weak management resulted in a high
percentage of defaults and arrears, but new management and organizational
reforms initiated under the IDA-financed Cocoa-Coffee Development Project
should improve conditions considerably. Direct arrangements with farmer
groups, successfully tested under this project and encouraged under the
Maritime Region project, are expected to improve loan recovery.
19.       The Ministry of Trade supervises the two marketing bodies:     the
Office des Produits Agricoles du Togo (OPAT) which has broad marketing and
price stabilization functions for export crops. OPAT has, over the years,
generated sizeable public savings (22 percent of total public savings over
the 1970-75 period) which are used to finance development in general, while
direct contribution to agricultural investments were modest (6 percent of
total). TOGOGRAIN which intends to play a stabilizing role for foodcrops
has not had much impact on the market. It has built up six silos with a
total capacity of 7,000 tons, but due to poor crops during 1975 and 1976,
its purchases have been limited.
20.       Agricultural research is carried out by French commodity-oriented
institutes. The Government has recently created a multi-disciplinary research
institute which should eventually become responsible for research coordination
and basic research.
21.       SOTOCO (National Cotton Agency) which would carry out the proposed
project has been in operation since March 1974. It has two main fields of
activity: extension work and primary marketing of cotton. Extension work
covers cotton and the growing of foodcrops associated with cotton, including
multiplication of seeds, propagation of modern techniques, procurement and
distribution of farm inputs. Primary marketing of cotton includes buying



the seed cotton at a fixed price, yearly decreed by the Government (see para.
24), directly from the farmer or through existing cooperatives, transport,
handling and delivery at the gins. SOTOCO is not at present involved in
ginning, but it would be the operator of the new Lama Kara gin. Marketing
credit is arranged by the Government through an account at CNCA. At the
beginning of the marketing season, SOTOCO draws from this account to pay for
the seed cotton bought from the farmers. SOTOCO sells the cotton to OPAT
which repays SOTOCO into the CNCA account on the basis of a "bareme" which
includes the farmgate price, handling and transport costs. Fertilizers and
insecticides are procured by SOTOCO and supplied to the farmers who repay at
the end of the marketing season at the subsidized price (see para. 25). CFDT
provides technical assistance to SOTOCO in the form of five expatriates.
Extension work is carried out by a total of 400 extension agents to be in-
creased to 725 under the project (corresponding to about 75 farmers per
agent).
22.       Agricultural sector growth has lagged behind the rest of the
economy. While GDP growth in real terms averaged 6 pecent from 1966 to
1973, agricultural production increased by only 3 percent per year. During
the 1970s, export volumes of agricultural products (cocoa, coffee and palm
kernels) declined sharply. Cotton production averaged 9,000 tons in the
sixties, reached a peak of 10,800 tons in 1974, and stabilized at around
7,000 tons in 1975 and 1976. There are agro-climatic constraints on agri-
culture in many parts of the country. In the coastal plateau of the south-
east, for example, rainfall is only half what it is in the coastal areas of
most other West African states, thus limiting the range of crops grown and
yields attained in the Maritime Region. In this region, high population
density and overcropping have caused depletion of soils, further limiting
the immediate agricultural potential. In the northern Savanna and Kara
regions, aside from the exhaustion of soils in the densely settled Kara
hill country, agricultural growth has been limited by the prolonged Sahelian
drought and the presence of onchocerciasis in otherwise agriculturally pro-
mising river valleys.
23.       Lack of investment and limited absorptive capacity in the agricul-
tural sector during the 1960s hindered the country's rural development. In
recent years, however, the Government has become increasingly aware of the
priority of the agricultural sector for the country's development. The Third
Development Plan calls for substantial improvements in agricultural perform-
ance both in industrial and food crops. For industrial crops, the Govern-
ment's objective is to restore traditional exports. A major program for
coffee and cocoa rehabilitation, started in 1974 with IDA assistance, should
begin yielding results by the end of the decade. A five-year cotton program
to increase production is the subject of the proposed project. There is scope
for rehabilitation of traditional copra production, and possibilities for
development of other products such as oil palm, sugarcane, tobacco and cashew
nuts, are being examined. For food crops, the Government hopes to slow down
imports and to reach self-sufficiency in the eighties. Recent increases in
official farmgate prices for export crops, higher producer prices for food
crops resulting from increased urban demand, improved credit and support
facilities for organized farmers, and easier access to markets should help
achieve these production objectives.



24.       Present agricultural price structure is however not satisfactory in
regard to cotton. At its present level of $205/ton of seed cotton, producer
price is too low comparatively to cereals on one side and selling price of
cotton to the gins on the other side, thus resulting in high taxation of
cotton growers. In 1976/77, seed cotton was bought from the farmer at
$205/ton and sold at the equivalent of $590/ton, leaving a surplus to the
Government of about $330/ton (net of on-farm input subsidy), or about 55
percent of the farmgate value. At this producer price, returns per man-day
and also per ha are higher for cereals than for cotton. There is a general
shortage of foodcrops in Togo, which in turn led the Government to keep cash
crop prices low to avoid a shift of production from cereals to cotton, which
would further aggravate the deficit. The Association has indicated to the
Government that, for the forthcoming season, cotton seed producer prices
should be increased at least to $245/ton to redress the situation. The
Government has given assurances that cotton farmgate prices would be set up,
on a yearly basis, at a level sufficient to provide adequate incentives to
producers, and to exchange views with the Association at least once a year on
this matter (Section 4.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
25.       Government is also providing additional incentives by subsidizing
farm inputs, principally fertilizer, for which the farmers are currently
charged about 25 percent of actual cost. The Government considers these
subsidies as necessary to encourage the use of improved technologies, but
it has agreed with the Association that these subsidies should be removed
at an appropriate time when farmers reach an advanced stage of using modern
techniques and yields increase sufficiently to cover the increased cost
of inputs. Assurances have been obtained under the Maritime Region Rural
Development Project and the proposed project ( Section 4.01 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement) to consult annually with the Association on
input prices with a view towards progressively reflecting full input costs
in the prices charged to farmers. In order to establish the basis for the
yearly consultation on both producer and on-farm input prices, the Government
and the Association have agreed on the need for a study of the pricing policy.
An agricultural sector mission is scheduled for the spring of 1978 to launch
such a study with the Government.
26.       The basis of agricultural growth should be both improvement of
yields and expansion of cropped areas. Area increases can partially be
achieved through double-cropping, intercropping or decreasing fallow. But
substantial efforts will have to be made to bring new land into production.
Some of this land will be found in areas to be freed of onchocerciasis. As
a means of expanding the total cultivated area, Government has embarked on
a mechanization program with the purchase of 400 agricultural tractors. In
the view of the Association a more appropriate step would be to test alter-
native methods of selective mechanization, such as the use of power tillers
under the Maritime Region Rural Development Project, and animal traction as
planned in this project, before going ahead with full scale tractor mechani-
zation.

27.       The proposed project is based on intensified utilization of cropped
areas consisting of the introduction of improved cultivation methods for
cotton and integration of food crops with cotton in rotation. The project
would be carried out in the areas with cotton growing potential in the
Savanna, Kara, Central and Plateau region. These areas, at an altitude of
200-500 m., are ecologically well suited for cotton and food crop production.
There are some 140,000 families in the project area, cultivating about
278,000 ha. The average farm family has about eight people, 45 percent of
whom are active. Most cultivation is done by hand, while less than 1,500
farmers use oxen. Cotton is grown by 30,000 farmers, and the average cotton
area per farm varies from 0.3 ha. in the Kara to 0.7 ha in the Plateaux
region. Cattle population is estimated at 200,000 head.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed project is described in detail in the report entitled
"Appraisal of a Rural Development Project in Cotton Areas" (Report No. 1494-TO
August 26, 1977) which is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. The project was identified by a RMWA mission in October 1975. The
feasibility study was carried out in November-December 1975 by the French CFDT
with FAC financing. The project was appraised in October 1976. Negotiations
took place in Washington from July 18 to July 22, 1977. The Togolese delega-
tion was headed by Mr. DOGO, Minister of Plan, Industrial Development and
Administrative Reform.
29.       The proposed project would be carried out over five years and
would aim at increasing cotton production from 7,000 tons to 34,000 tons and
food crops grown in rotation with cotton from 40,000 tons to 57,000 tons of
maize and sorghum, at full development.    It would encourage the adoption of
improved cotton growing techniques, and help the farmers raise the productiv-
ity of maize sorghum and groundnuts cultivation (including proper soil prep-
aration, timely planting of improved seeds, fertilization, pest control,
selective ox-drawn cultivation and adoption of cropping patterns in which
food crops would benefit from the residual effects of fertilizers applied to
cotton). It would reach about 53,000 farm families (over 400,000 people),
representing about 36 percent of the rural population in the project area
(para. 27).
30.        It would comprise five main components:
-    strengthening SOTOCO, through provision of additional staff,
training, buildings and equipment for its headquarter and field
services (including establishment of a seed multiplication and
field trials system);
-    providing a small allocation for ox-cultivation training and
credit to farmers for acquisition of ox-cultivation equipment;
-    expanding the Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit within
the Ministry of Rural Development;



9-
-    building and improving 700 km of feeder roads; and
-    providing incremental on-farm inputs to expand improved cotton
planting by 20,000 ha, maize by 13,700 ha, sorghum by 7,500 ha
and groundnuts by 2,700 ha.
31.       Concurrent with the proposed project, FED intends to finance a
program of village wells construction to improve the supply of drinking water
in the project area. About 64 wells for the project area would be built as a
first priority under the FED Program (Section 3.02 of the draft Development
Credit Agreement). The Government is also committed to increase Togo's gin-
ning capacity to process 30,000 tons of cotton by the early 1980's (Section
4.05 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Implementation
32.       The proposed project would be carried out by SOTOCO (para. 21).
Under the project, SOTOCO's organization would be changed to include four
departments: commercial, financial, technical, and civil engineering for
supervision of feeder roads construction and maintenance. Field services
would be divided into four regions corresponding to the administrative divi-
sion of the country. Although SOTOCO is de facto authorized to carry out food
crop growing in rotation with cotton, SOTOCO's original statutes would be
amended to extend its responsibility for food crops growing in the cotton
areas (Section 3.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement). The Govern-
ment has also agreed to make available to SOTOCO by September 30, 1977, three
seed multiplication farms (Centres Polyvalents) (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement), to enable SOTOCO to carry out its seed multi-
plication program. SOTOCO would be entrusted with feeder roads construction
because of the absence of an agency with overall responsibility for feeder
roads in Togo. The Government plans to establish such an agency, under the
recently appraised Feeder Roads Project, within the Ministry of Rural Improve-
ment which would eventually take over SOTOCO's feeder roads section. Arrange-
ments have been made that SOTOCO would submit its annual program for seed
multiplication and road construction to the Association for approval (Section
2.06 of the draft Project Agreement).
33.       An experienced Togolese has been appointed to the post of General
Manager. He is assisted by an expatriate Technical Manager who is already
on duty.  A Deputy General Manager, a Financial Manager, a Commercial Manager
and five other senior technical positions remain to be filled. The Financial
Manager and the five senior technicians would be recruited internationally in
view of the shortage of these skills in Togo. Agreement has been reached that
all senior positions would be filled before December 31, 1977, by candidates
whose qualifications and terms of reference are satisfactory to the Association
(Section 3.01(b) of the draft Project Agreement).
34.       The project would be monitored by the Project Monitoring Evaluation
Unit of the Ministry of Rural Development which has been established to



- 10 -
monitor the IDA-financed Maritime Region Rural Development Project, and would
be extended under the proposed project before September 30, 1977 (Section 3.01
(a) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Inputs
35.       Procurement of on-farm inputs under the project would be financed by
a special account opened in SOTOCO's name at CNCA. Government would make the
first deposit of US$1.2 million as operating capital. This amount plus the
Government's reimbursement of subsidies on inputs sold to the farmers during
the first year of the project, estimated at about US$0.7 million, would enable
SOTOCO to immediately order the inputs for the second year of the project.
The account would later be replenished through payments by farmers for inputs,
payments by Government for reimbursement to SOTOCO of inputs subsidies, and
withdrawals from the IDA Credit and the FAC grant for incremental project
inputs. The Government has given assurances that it would reimburse this
account yearly not later than September 30, of each year (Section 3.01 (c)
(iii) of the draft Development Credit Agreement). Opening of the special
account at CNCA with the initial deposit if US$1.2 million would be a condi-
tion of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01(d) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement). The same mechanism has been used under the Maritime Region
Project.
Cost and Financial Arrangements
36.       The total cost of the project based on mid-1977 prices, and includ-
ing contingencies would amount to US$23.6 million (net of taxes of US$2.4 mil-
lion). The foreign exchange component would be US$15.7 million or 67 percent
of costs. The proposed IDA Credit of US$14 million would cover 59 percent of
total project costs. The project would be co-financed by FAC (US$5.1 million,
22 percent of costs) on a joint basis. IDA and FAC would finance the foreign
exchange costs and about 40 percent of the local cost. The Government would
finance the balance of the local cost (US$4.5 million, 19 percent of costs)
plus taxes. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be the
effectiveness of the FAC convention (Section 6.01(b) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement).
37.       The major portion of the project funds would be channeled by the
Government as a grant to SOTOCO, directly for an amount of US$22.3 million and
indirectly through a special account of CNCA for an amount of US$3.6 million
to be used as a revolving fund for the procurement of on-farm inputs. The
Government would use US$0.1 million to operate the Project Monitoring and
Evaluation Unit.
38.       As of September 30, 1976, SOTOCO showed a cumulated operational
deficit of US$0.6 million for its first two years of operation due to insuffi-
cient revenues. To strengthen SOTOCO's finances, Government would implement
the following measures: first, a grant of US$1.1 million to cover SOTOCO's
operational expenses in 1977 (for headquarters staff, extension work, field
trials, seed multiplication and training operations). Second, starting
the 1977/78 season, the Government would increase the price paid by OPAT



- 11 -
to SOTOCO for cotton to cover all SOTOCO's expenditures (Section 3.05 of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). The payment of the US$1.1 million for
1977 would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 (c) of the
draft Development Credit Agreement). Also in order to safeguard SOTOCO's
finances, agreement has been reached that in case SOTOCO's activities would be
extended to ginning operations, SOTOCO would be paid an amount per ton of
cotton sufficient to cover its operating costs and depreciation related to
these operations (Section 4.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
SOTOCO would keep separate accounts for its various operations (Section
4.01(b) of the draft Project Agreement).
Procurement
39.       All contracts of US$50,000 or more for the procurement of vehicles
and equipment, including road building machinery (totalling about US$5.7
million), and fertilizers and insecticides (about US$12.7 million, of which
incremental cost of US$3.7 million would be financed under the project),
would be awarded through international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA guidelines. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a preference
of 15 percent, or the level of applicable duty, whichever is less, when
comparing domestic bids with those of foreign manufacturers. Contracts of
less than US$50,000 equivalent would be awarded according to local procedures
acceptable to IDA: these are estimated to amount to US$0.3 million. Contracts
with a total value of US$3.1 million, for buildings scattered over an area too
large to attract international competition, would be awarded on the basis of
competitive bidding advertised locally, in accordance with local procedures
which are acceptable to IDA. Construction and maintenance of feeder roads
(about US$3.5 million) would be carried out under force account by SOTOCO
which is being equipped for this purpose.
Disbursement
40.       The proceeds of the IDA Credit are expected to be disbursed against
costs incurred over a four-and-a-half year period. The FAC grant would cover
five years, and would include retroactively start-up costs, primarily for
salaries of key personnel and operating expenditures dating from January 1977
involving disbursements estimated at about US$0.4 million. From the date of
credit signature the IDA credit and FAC grant would be disbursed at the ratio
of 3:1. The IDA credit would be disbursed to cover 56 percent of:
(a) expenditures for buildings, furniture, vehicles, and equipment
for road construction, ox-drawn demonstration, field trials,
research and training (US$4.2 million);
(b)  incremental expenditures for staff salaries and operating
costs (US$5.5 million);
(c) expenditures for the Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
(US$0.1 million); and
(d) incremental expenditures for on-farm inputs (US$2.3 million).



- 12 -
US$1.9 million would be unallocated. Disbursements against item (b) and (c)
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures certified by SOTOCO
and the Ministry of Rural Development with the supporting documentation
retained by the executing agency and made available to supervision missions.
Economic Justification
41.       The economic rate of return of the project would be 32 percent over
10 years. Sensitivity analysis shows that a 20 percent decrease in benefits
would reduce the economic rate of return to 14 percent, while cost increase of
20 percent would reduce it to 17 percent. If only 70 percent of the farmers
were to participate in the project, the rate of return would fall to 20 percent.
42.       The project's direct benefit would be higher incomes for over 20
percent among the poorest of Togo's population -- as a result of an increase
by some 50 percent of the value of their crop production. Additional benefits
would be increased Government revenues and foreign exchange receipts. The
average net cash income per family in the project area is expected to increase
from its presently low US$130 per annum to US$260 (in constant terms) by the
second half of the eighties. For many families the project would even consti-
tute the first step toward shifting from non-cash to cash economy. In so far
as the Government is concerned, the project would start generating revenues as
early as the second year of the project, increasing to US$9.8 million by the
second half of the eighties. By both generating and saving foreign exchange,
the project is also expected to improve the country's foreign exchange position.
Exports of cotton and groundnuts from the project area would generate about
US$30 million of foreign exchange by 1985., i.e. about 5 percent of Togo's total
export in that year and 10 percent of agricultural exports only. The project
would have also important non-quantifiable benefits ranging from the improve-
ment of the nutrition intake for the rural population to the strengthening of
agricultural institutions.
Project Risks
43.       The main risk of the project would be the lack of response of the
farmers to the techniques proposed in the project, because, first the farmers
have had only limited or no exposure at all to improved techniques in Togo.
Secondly, the use of these techniques would result in considerable increase in
labor requirements. This might constitute a bottleneck in the Savanna region
where labor is more limited, and where ox-cultivation would be encouraged to
overcome this. Thirdly, the project would result in higher yields which could
induce the farmers to reduce the surfaces cultivated and thus result in a
status quo in the production. Good management, effective extension work and
adequate pricing and marketing policies would considerably reduce this risk.
The proposed project would provide for effective management and extension
services. However the pricing policy is less satisfactory. As stated in
para. 24, the present cotton farmgate price is insufficient to induce farmers
to grow more cotton. This is expected to be corrected. The proposed project
would provide for a yearly review with the Association of the Government's
pricing policy both for producer prices and for input prices in the agricul-
tural sector to make this policy more growth-oriented. Another risk would



-13 -
be the duality in the organization of the agricultural sector based on the
SORADs with region-wide responsibilities and the crop-oriented agencies. This
could lead to confusion and duplication of activities. IDA has gone both
ways: the Maritime Region Project uses the regionally oriented SORAD, and
both the Cocoa-Coffee and proposed project use the crop-oriented institutions.
The Government is committed to rationalize the institutional set up but still
shows some slowness and uncertainty in streamlining it. The early 1978 sector
mission would address these issues (para. 25).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Togo and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and SOTOCO, the Recomendation fo the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of
a draft resolution approving the proposed Development Credit, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
45.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
46.       Special conditions of effectiveness included in the Development
Credit Agreement would be: the opening of an account in SOTOCO's name at
CNCA and initial deposit of US$1.2 million; effectiveness of the FAC agree-
ment; and transfer by Government of US$1.1 million to SOTOCO.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMNENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.

C.   Projects in Execution
Credit No. 131       Highway Maintenance Project; US$3.7 Million Credit of
October 10, 1968; New Closing Date: June 30, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: January 14, 1969
Execution of this project is virtually completed and was generally
satisfactory.
Credit No. 450       Second Highway Project; US$8.7 Million Credit of
December 28, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977;
Effectiveness Date: April 19, 1974
The project provided for the construction of one section of the
main south-north road axis - (Blitta-Sokode) and two secondary roads (Sokode-
Kambola and Agou-Notse). The project is proceeding satisfactorily. How-
ever, due to inflation, the scope of the road construction project had to be
reduced; the construction of the Agou-Notse road, one of the three roads to
be constructed under the project was dropped. The economic re-evaluation of
the project shows that the economic return of Blitta-Sokode has increased from
22 percent at appraisal to 29 percent, while the return of Sokode-Tchambo has
slightly decreased from 16 percent to 14 percent.
Credit No. 503       Cocoa/Coffee Development Project; US$6 Million Credit of
August 6, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980;
Effectiveness Date: March 12, 1976
This project provides for the rehabilitation of the planting and
maintenance of 4,000 ha of cocoa and 4,400 of coffee in the Plateau Region.
The project is proceeding well. Action has been initiated towards the prepara-
tion of a follow-up project.
Credit No. 638       Maritime Region Rural Development Project; US$9,5 Million
Credit of June 16, 1976, Closing Date: December 31, 1981;
Effectiveness Date: October 26, 1976
The purpose of the project is to improve and diversify production
of upland crops (maize, cassava, groundnuts, cowpeas and cotton); develop
lowland rainfed rice and vegetables; rehabilitate irrigation facilities for
existing vegetable production; renovate smallholder coconut plantings; and
provide the necessary support services and infrastructure for about 20,000
farm families. Most of the components of the project are now operational.
The project is proceeding on schedule.
