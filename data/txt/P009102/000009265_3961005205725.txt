MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A
PRIVATIZATION IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed technical assistance loan to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$100 million to
help finance a Privatization Implementation Assistance and Social Safety Net Project. The loan would
be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen years, including five
years of grace.
2.           Sector Background. The process of economic liberalization during the 1980s exposed
the wealnesses of Turkey's state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector. Originally established within the
framework of economic planning for industrial development and the provision of infrastructure, few
of these enterprises are equipped to face the challenges of a dynamic market economy. SOEs are
active in almost all sectors of the economy. In addition to the usual monopolies in the service sector,
SOEs dominate the financial, commodity trading, and mining sectors and in the production of basic
metals and chemicals. Past efforts to reform the SOE sector through changes in the legal and
institutional framework, pricing policies, ma.rket regulation and the personnel regime have yielded
limited results. Their financial performance has worsened over time and their economic efficiency
has lagged behind that of the private sector. SOEs remain a major contributor to the overall public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR). In 1993, the borrowing requirement of the SOEs was 6.1
percent of GNP (close to 40 percent of the total PSBR). The deterioration in SOE performance has
resulted from wage increases, agricultural support prices, political interference, the pursuit of multiple
and often noncommercial objectives, and a legal and institutional framework which discourages
commercial behavior and fails to impose financial discipline.
3.           Current SOE inefficiencies will be difficult to correct without fundamental sector
reform. Divestiture - sales and liquidation - has been brought to the forefront as the primary
instrument for achieving this objective. Privatization is needed to sever the link between the
Government and SOEs, impose a hard budget constraint, improve efficiency, and depoliticize pricing
and hiring decisions. Privatization is also being viewed as a tool to generate revenues from the sale
of SOEs, to fund severance payments and reduce public sector debt, and to tap private sector
resources for expansion in all sectors, particularly infrastructure. Other, complementary elements of
the agenda include labor restructuring, the commercialization of SOEs to be retained in the public
sector, and the strengthening of the Government's regulatory role.
4.           In the wake of the economic liberalization of the early 1980s, the Govermnent decided
to privatize SOEs which no longer had a national mission. The main objective was to increase
efficiency and lessen the budgetary burden of SOEs. A masterplan for privatization, which classified
SOEs into those to be liquidated, sold or retained in the state sector, was completed in 1986.
However, the plan was never implemented. Instead, a few small SOEs and minority shareholdings
were sold, representing less than one percent of the total fixed assets of SOEs. The overall pace of
privatization was constrained by a lack of political commitment, unclear privatization objectives and
institutional and technical difficulties. in October 1991, a new coalition Govermnent came into
power. Subsequent changes in 1992 in the management and structure of the Public Participation
Administration (PPA), tne agency responsible for privatization, helped to accelerate the pace of
privatization. The privatization program gained momentum with the sale of relatively large cement
companies, the privatization of several agro-industrial firms, and sale of minority shareholdings.



-2 -
5.           The current coalition Government, which assumed office in July 1993, announced a
renewed privatization program coupled with the strengthening of the social security system and the
development of a social safety net targeted at redundant SOE workers and affected communities. The
scope of the program expanded from the sale of small and medium enterprises and minority shares to
cover the reform and privatization of major enterprises in a wide range of sectors. A substantial
number of SOEs were sold in 1993. A sizeable portfolio of SOEs in the tradeable goods sectors have
been transferred to PPA and are slated for privatization (agro-industries, auto assembly and
distribution, oil refining and distribution, steel, petrochemicals, and shipping). A Decree has been
issuej to establish the conditions for privatizing TEK, the power utility, and preparatory work for the
reform of the telecommunications sector is underway. Success in privatizing PPA's core portfolio of
SOEs is both feasible and desirable. Initial successes would have major demonstration effects for the
program as a whole, move PPA further along the learning curve in preparation for more complex
transactions, and help mobilize revenues which could be utilized to settle the large liabilities of
problem SOEs prior to their privatization.
6.           Project Obiectives. The main objective of the project is to promote efficiency and
productivity and further the development of Turkey's dynamic private sector by providing assistance
for an accelerated privatization process. The project would also help lay the basis for more
comprehensive privatization and sustained fiscal contraction in the future. It would build up
institutional capacity through technical assistance and the experience gained through the
implementation of the current program, thereby enabling the Government's administrative machinery
to manage the larger and more complex workload entailed by a broader divestiture program. Another
important objective is to alleviate the adverse impact of SOE downsizing and divestiture on displaced
workers and their families.
7.           Project Description. The proposed project would include:
(a)      technical and financial support for the preparation and implementation of privatization
transactions; a public information campaign to promote and broaden public support
for the Government's privatization agenda; the strengthening of PPA; and the
strengthening of the capacity of the Undersecretariat of Treasury and Foreign Trade
(Treasury) to manage the debt liabilities of SOEs to be privatized (63 percent of total
project costs);
(b)      social safety net measures, including labor adjustment programs to determine the
extent of labor displacement in individual SOEs, assess the demand for labor services,
and provide counseling, retraining, and small business assistance through local
institutions; the strengthening of agencies responsible for the labor adjustment
programs; and studies to analyze the options for the reform of the social
insurance/pensions systems, and develop a unique identifier system for Turkish
citizens (31 percent);
(c)      the preparation of a regional development plan to diversify the economic base of the
Zonguldak Region, where a high concentration of layoffs in steel and mining
operations is likely (2 percent); and
(d)      studies to develop a regulatory framework for the privatization of the
telecommunications sector and establish a coordinated strategy for the private
provision of infrastructure services (4 percent).

8.           Project Costs and Financing Plan. Total project costs are estimated at US$129 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of about US$81 million equivalent excluding taxes and
duties. Of the total, the proposed Bank loan would finance US$100 million equivalent, and the
Government would finance US$29 million equivalent. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan
are showni in Schedule A. Provision has been made for retroactive financing of up to US$7 million
equivalent. The amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in
Schedules C and D respectively.
9.           Project Implementation. PPA would be responsible for the implementation of the
privatization component, including the public information campaign. Treasury would be responsible
for managing the SOEs' debt liabilities. The implementing agencies will need technical assistance,
training, and equipment tailored to strengthen their capabilities to discharge their expanded or, in the
case of Treasury, new responsibilities. Contract staff will need to be recruited to make absorptive
capacity commensurate with the considerable workload implied by the privatization effort.
10.          Treasury would develop and monitor the implementation of the labor adjustment
program with technical assistance. It would also act as the channel for directing loan funds to lead
agencies which would be responsible for delivering the labor adjustment services at the local level.
The transfer and use of funds would be in accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank; would be
based on protocols signed between Treasury and the lead agencies; and would be in response to local
demand. Treasury would be responsible for the studies to be carried out under the project. The State
Planning Organization would be responsible for the preparation of the Zonguldak regional
development plan.
it.          Lessons Learned and Project Sustainabilitv. A Technical Assistance Project for State
Economic Enterprises, financed by a US$7.6 million Bank loan in 1984 (Loan 2400-TU), was
intended mainly to assist three SOEs to improve their operational and financial efficiency. This
component did not, however, become operational. Three months after loan approval, a new
Government issued a more sweeping decree on the privatization and restructuring of SOEs than the
one existing at the time of Board approval. Because of the considerable uncertainty among the
enterprises regarding their future, they did not implement the component. Instead, the Government
and the Bank agreed on the utilization of loan funds to commission privatization/restructuring studies
precedent to privatization. Although the studies were well-received, the Government did not take
action to privatize. Lessons learned include: the need for Government ownership of the planned
initiatives; the need to develop effective means of gaining public support; the need to address socio-
political concerns, specifically to develop effective labor adjustment programs; the need to ensure that
the project scope is commensurate with administrative capacity; and the need for decisive corrective
action if implementation is unsatisfactory. These lessons have been taken into account in the design
and the implementation arrangements for the proposed project with the Government already taking
crucial actions to strengthen institutions and build momentum in implementation.
12.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. A major challenge facing Turkey today is to set the
economy firmly back on the road to private sector-led growth. This will require the inplementation
of an effective stabilization strategy. Sustained fiscal contraction and SOE reforms, including SOE
privatization, are key to stabilizing the economy, improving efficiency, and accelerating growth.
Thus, support for the Government's efforts to disengage from production activities and foster the
continuing development of the private sector is a central theme of the Bank's assistance strategy for
Turkey.



-4 -
13.          To achieve the objectives of improved efficiency and sustained fiscal contraction, the
Government is committed to accelerating the pace of privatization. To this end, the Government has
requested Bank assistance to help prepare and implement privatization transactions; forge popular
support for privatization; ensure an efficient and transparent privatization process, and strengthen the
capacity of the various agencies to implement privatization; establish, in the case of the utilities, a
regulatory regime that promotes competition and eff.ciency; and piovide an effective social safety net
for displaced labor.
14.          At the previous Government's request, the Bank completed a State-Owned Enterprise
Sector Review In March 1993 (Report No. 10014-TU) and draft studies on the Labor Force
Implications of SOE Reforms and on Turkey's Pension System. Building on this sector work, the
Bank will help lay the basis for a more enduring public sector reform and fiscal contraction process.
Under the proposed operation, the Bank will help ensure efficiency and transparency in the divestiture
process and seek to ensure early successes through the provision of quality advisory support, the
establishment of a well-designed social safety net, and the provision of a sound analytical base for
Government decisions on the design of a social insurance system for Turkish citizens.
15.          The proposed project is consistent with the strategic framework of the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy for Turkey approved by the Executive Directors on March 11, 1993.
Accelerating SOE divestiture has been a central theme of our dialogue with tht Government for some
time, and it is consistent with the Government's stated fiscal objectives. Recognizing the urgency,
despite associated political difficulties, of implementing comprehensive SOE sector reforms, the
Government has asked for Bank support for its strategy to implement the first phase of its
privatization program and accompanying social safety net measures to alleviate the hardships of
workers and their families. The Bank has responded on an accelerated timetable to the window of
opportunity presented by the Government's request. Achieving early privatization successes will lend
credibility to the Government's program, provide an impetus to proceed with speed and efficacy, and,
over the medium term, help promote greater economic efficiency and stability.
16.          Agreed Actions. Several actions have already been taken by PPA and Treasury.
Progress on privatization is as follows: a contract for financial advisers for the privatization of one
SOE has been awarded; all actions for the sale of two SOEs have been completed (the approval of the
Public Participation High Council is awaited); and negotiations for financial advisory contracts for the
privatization of three SOEs are ongoing. Treasury has invited bids for advisers for . )E debt
management and the labor adjustment program. PPA is in the process of evaluating uids for in-house
strategic and legal advisers and has invited proposals for public information advisers.
17.          During negotiations, the following agreements were reached: (a) the Governmetft
would provide adequate annual budgetary allocations to meet the counterpart funding requirements of
the project, starting with the FY94 budget; (b) PPA and Treasury would furnish to the Bank for its
review, by October 31 of each year, draft work programs with specific targets for the following year;
and by November 30 of each year, confirm that programs satisfactory to the Government and the
Bank had been approved; PPA and Treasury would monitor progress in the implementation of
components for which they would be responsible and provide the Bank with quarterly progress
reports; (c) a mid-term implementation review would be held by October 31, 1995, on the basis of
agreed criteria, including inter alia, the privatization of at least one-half of the number of SOEs and
affiliated partnerships in PPA's portfolio as of January 1994, with privatization defined as the sale of
not less than 51 percent of PPA ownership or the transfer of management control, and the sale of at
least one-half of PPA's share participations as of January 1994; (d) the disbursement of funds for
labor adjustment services would be in accordance with criteria agreed with the Bank; (e) the
conditions of loan effectiveness would be: (i) the award of contracts to financial advisers for the
privatization of two SOEs; (ii) the appointment by Treasury of in-house advisers for debt management



-5-
and the labor adjustment program; and by PPA for in-house strategic, legal, and public information
advisers; and (iii) the execution of the Subsidiary Project Agreement between the Government and
PPA.
18.          Environmental spects. The Project has been classified as Category C in terms of
impact on the environment. Provision has been made to conduct environmental liability assessments
of SOEs with environmental issues prior to sale. The environmental liabilities of SOEs in sectors
such as oil, petrochemicals, steel and mining will need to be addressed prior to privatization.
19.          Program Qbjective Categories. The project would provide an impetus for private
investment and would help improve public sector management. Through the social safety net
components, the Government would achieve its objective of alleviating the hardships of layoffs for
displaced workers and their families.
20.          Benefits. The proposed project would set the stage for more significant Government
action to downsize the SOB sector over the longer term. Reductions in the labor force and in
subsidies to SOEs to be privatized will result initially in a modest improvement in the fiscal deficit,
while the restructuring and divestiture of SOEs will increase productivity and efficiency, facilitate
private sector development, atract direct foreign investment, help improve Turkey's competitive edge
in world markets, and lay the basis for a longer-term structural reduction of the deficit. Finally, the
provision of an effective social safety net will promote stability, increase labor force mobility, and
improve public support for the Government's economic strategy.
21.          Bisk. The project faces several risks. The Government's preoccupation with
political and security matters may preempt follow-through on the privatization agenda. There is a
coalition government, nationwide elections are upcoming, and the security situation places major
demands on the Government. Possible labor opposition to potential displacement, income losses, and
unemployment presents another risk. Lacking a strong institutional base, the level of management
and coordination effort required for a divestiture process may be difficult to sustain.
22.          The Government's commitment is reflected in up-front action being taken as
summarized in para. 16. The public information campaign would help improve the political and
social acceptability of the program by initiating a dialogue on the costs and benefits of privatization.
The provision of a social safety net as an integral part of the process would help broaden the support
of labor. The design and timing of technical assistance is being carefully tailored to equip the
agencies with requisite capacity. Treasury and PPA have already invited, and in some cases, are in
the process of evaluating bids for in-house advisers. As conditions of loan effectiveness, Treasury
will appoint debt management and labor adjustment program advisers, and PPA will appoint strategic,
legal and public information advisers. Funding is being made available through a PHRD grant and an
advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). Provision has also been made for a mid-term
review by October 31, 1995, on the basis of criteria agreed with the Bank.
23.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
