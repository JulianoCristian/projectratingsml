APPRAISAL OF THE
LIBERIAN BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
SUMMARY
1.        The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment 1/ (LBDI) was estab-
lished in 1965 with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation,
and received a first Bank loan of $1 million in 1972, together with a $500,000
loan from the African Development Bank. Both loans are now fully committed.
2.        Although high levels of protection have permitted establishment of
some inefficient import substitution industries in the past in Liberia, Govern-
ment incentives and tax policies have recently been revised to give greater
emphasis to export industries in the future. Concurrently, LBDI's project
screening skills have improved. The Government continues to seek to stimulate
private investment as a vehicle for industrial growth.
3.        Although LBDI got off to a slow start, its level of activity is now
increasing dramatically. Approvals of loans and equity investments rose from
$576,000 in 1972 to $1.3 million in 1973. Another $1.5 million of projects
had been approved during the first four months of 1974. LBDI's financing has
been for industry, agriculture, tourism, and transport, and the company is now
beginning to lend to trade establishments and, within limits, to public sector
projects. LBDI is the only institutional source of long-term finance for
private enterprise in Liberia. Its investments have gone mostly to small
Liberian-sponsored projects, and nearly half of them (by amount) have been
primarily export-oriented. Projects submitted under the first Bank loan had
an average expected economic return exceeding 25%.
4.        In September 1973, Mr. Elias Saleeby, a Liberian previously in the
employ of the DFC Department of the Bank, took over as President of LBDI.
In the short time he has been in office, he has been energetic and effective
in improving internal procedures and in finding new initatives for LBDI. He
is ably assisted by an expatriate General Manager.
5.        LBDI's plans for recruitment of staff are satisfactory.  An engineer
and an agro-industrialist provided by UNIDO will bring needed technical
expertise, and will help train Liberian counterparts.
6.        LBDI's policies and procedures are generally satisfactory.  Further
improvements in procedures are possible and LBDI has agreed to carry out the
suggestions detailed in this report. These include establishing a bookkeeping
service to help clients with small enterprises and to aid its own follow-up
work.
1/   Formerly the "Liberian Bank for Industrial Development and Investment."
In order to better reflect its multi-functional orientation, LDBI's Act
Is expected to be amended to drop the word "Industrial" from its name.



v 
7.        Because of inflation and the high cost of funds, LBDI recently raised
its interest rate cum service charge from 10% to 11.5%. On foreign exchange
loans sub-borrowers assume the exchange risk. The interest rate is now at the
ceiling permitted by Liberia's usury law. A new National Bank was established
recently to regulate the banking system, including interest rates. The usury
law is now expected to be repealed. Interest rates are expected to rise at
that time and LBDI has agreed to review its own lending rate when this happens.
The US dollar is legal tender in Liberia, and it is not expected that a Liberian
currency will be issued in the immediate future.
8.        LBDI has been successful recently in reducing the proportion of its
portfolio affected by arrears over three months to 5%, compared to about 10%
a year ago.
9.        LBDI suffered net losses in 1971 and 1972, and earned only a very
small profit in 1971 (less than one percent of its net worth). This was
primarily the result of large foreign exchange losses which LBDI has suffered
due to deutsche mark borrowings from KfW on which LBDI had previously failed
to pass on the foreign exchange risk to sub-borrowers. KfW recently agreed
to reschedule its.loan to LBDI. LBDI has agreed to substantially eliminate
the exchange risk on this loan by June 30, 1975.
10.       With a favorable investment climate, and LBDI's increasingly dynamic
stance, LBDI could achieve its goal of $3 million of loan approvals and
$300,000 of equity investments in 1974. The Government has agreed to provide
the company with a new $2 million loan, but budgetary difficulties due to
recent oil and commodity price changes will not permit all of these funds to
be disbursed at present. Instead, LBDI will receive the $2 million in the
form of promissory notes redeemable over a five-year period. As a result,
LBDI has negotiated up to $1 million of local expenditure financing out of
credits from international sources through 1976.
11.       LBDI would be a suitable and creditworthy borrower for a Bank loan.
Its total resource requirements through calendar 1976 are expected to be about
$11 million, and LBDI has negotiated with ADB and the World Bank for financing.
ADB's loan would be $2.5 million which, taken with other resource availabilities,
would leave $4 million of requirements to be financed by IBRD.
12.       The terms of the proposed loan should include the following:
(a) A 7:1 total debt/equity limit (excluding undisbursed or undiscounted
portions of Government loans). (b) Due to the rapid increase in LBDI's
operations, retroactive financing under the loan up to $750,000 should be
allowed to maintain continuity of Bank financing. (c) Up to $500,000 of local
expenditure financing should be permitted from the proceeds of the Bank loan.
(d) Given improvements in LBDI's appraisals, the free limit has been raised
from $50,000 to $100,000, and the aggregate free limit from $200,000 to
$1,000,000. The above limits would permit the Bank to review about 15% of
the projects LBDI is expected to submit under the proposed loan, and at least
75% of the amounts to be financed. Other terms and conditions of the proposed
loan should be those normally applied to Bank loans to development finance
companies.






APPRAISAL OF TIE
LIBERIAN BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
I. INTRODWCTION
1.01      The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI) was estab-
lished in 1965 with the assistance of the International Finance Corporation,
which subscribed to 25% of LBDI's $1 million share capital. A $1 million
Bank loan was extended to LBDI in June 1972, and is now fully committed.
LBDI has requested further assistance from the Bank Group. This report
appraises LBDI for a proposed Bank loan of US$4 million.
II. ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENTS
Economic Structure and Growth
2.01      An analysis of the economic situation of Liberia appeared in the
"Basic Economic Report on Liberia" dated October 1, 1973. With a population
of roughly 1.5 million, Liberia has an annual income per capita of about $210.
Income distribution is highly skewed, however, with 4% of the population
accounting for over 60% of income, and about three-quarters of the population
having incomes below $70 per annum.
2.02      The economy is dominated by an enclave sector of predominantly for-
eign-owned iron ore mines and rubber plantations which contribute respectively
29% and 6% of GDP, and 74% and 12% of exnorts. As a result, fully 20% of GDP
represents net factor payments abroad. GDP at factor cost of $408 million in
1972 and permanent wage employment of 125,000 in 1970 were distributed as
follows:

Permanent    Rate of Value

2.03      The Liberian economy has experienced a satisfactory rate of growth
during the last two decades. Most of the growth has taken place in iron ore



- 2 -
and rubber, and more recently in forestry. In real terms, GDP grew at an
average annual rate of 5.2% from 1964 to 1972. Preliminary statistics for
1973 indicate that real GDP decreased during the year, partly due to a
worsening of the terms of trade. The Monrovia consumer price index increased
by about 20% during 1973. Most of the increase in prices is due to food,
oil and other imports, which are expected to reverse Liberia's previously
favorable balance of payments situation and increase the country's net
resource gap by about $60 million in 1975.
The Industrial Sector
2.04      Industrial Structure and Growth.  Despite the constraints of a
small domestic market and a scarcity of technical and managerial knowhow,
manufacturing has grown at a rate of 10% D.a. from 1964 to 1972. Manufactur-
ing per se still represents only about 5% of GDP, however. A survey of
industrial establishments undertaken by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry
and Transportation (MCIT) for 1972 indicated a gross output from industry
of $254 million and employment of about 15,0100 broken down into the following
subsectors:

187               100                100
The 187 firms surveyed are reported to include nearly all industrial estab-
lishments except workshops and cottage industries.
2.05      Liberian industry, other than mining and forestry operations, is
heavily concentrated in the vicinitv of Mfonrovia. OVnership is predominantly
foreign. liowever, there is a small but active group of Liberian entrepreneurs
engaged in a number of agri-business, manufacturing, and service industries.
In many cases, these entrepreneurs hold positions with the Government as well.
2.06      Export industries in Liberia are few, and include pelletizing of
iron ore, fish processing, some wood and rubber processing, and production of
explosives. A Bank review of fifteen import substitution industries in Liberia
revealed a number with high proportions of imported inputs, low value-added,
low capacity utilization, and high rates of effective protection. In some cases
(notably cookies, biscuits, and toffees) operations appear to be uneconomic even
after excluding sunk costs (see Annex 1).



-3-
Government Industrial Policies
2.07      The Government has no detailed strategy for the role to be played by
industry in Liberia's economic development, although as noted in the following
paragraph, steps are being taken to rationalize general policies affecting the
sector. Industrial development is of course expected to contribute to GDP,
employment, and the training of Liberian technical and managerial staff. The
Government assists private industry in achieving these objectives through in-
centives, tax and tariff policies, institutional support, and promotion of
and assistance in implementing projects in the industrial sector.
2.08      Incentives.  The Liberian Government has traditionally followed a
liberal policy under which foreign firms are encouraged to invest in the
country and are granted tariff and tax incentives and freedom to repatriate
earnings.  Foreign and Liberian firms are granted incentives either under the
Investment Incentive Code or after negotiating a special concession agreement
with the Government (the latter applying in the case of the iron ore, rubber,
and forestry sectors). Recently, the Government has been renegotiating a
number of concession agreements to improve their returns for Liberia. It has
also revised the Investment Incentive Code to eliminate some excessive incen-
tives and to provide relatively greater incentives for export industries. The
conditions which an enterprise must now fulfill before receiving incentives
are:  (a) training and em-ployment of Liberlans must be satisfactory, (b)
Liberians must be given an option to purchase shares; (c) at least 25% of the
gross output must be domestic value added; (d) domestic raw materials must be
used where feasible. Incentives now apply for a maximum of five years and
include exemption from 90% of duties on imported inputs, exemption from income
taxes on re-invested profits, and halving of taxes on distributed profits.
Tariff protection on final products is also possible, and is decided upon
after a case-by-case analysis. The recent Bank economic mission to Liberia
devoted some time to helping improve knowledge of techniques of economic
project analysis among Government employees concerned with industry. Export
operations may receive 100% duty exemption on inputs, and exemption from all
income and excise taxes.
2.09      Tn addition to these measures, the Liberian Government is now revis-
ing the structure of tariffs. The new tariff schedules are expected to be
more uniform in nature, and anomalous cases of disincentives to manufacture
(because of higher duties on imported inputs than on final products) will be
eliminated. The above tariff and incentive changes were made in line with
recommendations of the recent Bank economic mission.
2.10      Policies affecting forestry.  Government policy in forestry includes
required reforestation (or payment of fees to Government to undertake reforesta-
tion).  Also, to enhance value added in this sector, increasing proportions of
lumber cut in Liberia must be processed before export (or penalty fees must be
paid). By 1977, all lumber must be processed before export.



-4-
2.11      Price controls.  The MCIT regulates the prices of firms who have a
monopoly on domestic production of certain goods in order to keep consumer
prices as low as possible. Administration of the controls has varied, but
in some cases it has proved to be effective. Recently, controls on the
domestic markup of imported goods have also been instituted.
2.12      Free port and industrial park.  The Government has operated a free
port at Monrovia to encourage transhipments and establishment of export pro-
cessing operations using imported inputs. However, a lack of space in the
free port zone has inhibited its development. In 1963 the Government expro-
priated 1100 acres to establish an industrial park outside of Monrovia; only
three firms have moved into the park to date.
2.13      Institutional framework.  Government institutions directly affecting
industry include the MCIT, the Liberian Development Corporation (LDC), and the
Concession and Investment Commission (CIC) of the Ministry of Finance. LDC is
an agency created in 1961 with responsibility for reviewing applications for
investment incentives, promoting and undertaking feasibility studies of indus-
trial projects, making equity investments and issuing guarantees for the
Government. LDC has not been very effective in promoting industrial develop-
ment. In the recent past its role has been uncertain due to overlapping
responsibilities with MCIT. During 1973, however, LDC was given a new charter
and new management, and some MCIT staff and functions were transferred to LDC
so that a single institution could have responsibility for industrial promo-
tion. As yet, it is uncertain how effective the restructured LDC will be in
promoting industrial development. It depends in part on whether LDC can coor-
dinate effectively with other institutions like LBDI, and in part on whether
it develops the necessary technical expertise in project identification and
promotion.
2.14      When LDC was reorganized, it passed the function of evaluating appli-
cations for investment incentives on to the Secretariat of the Concession and
Investment Commission located in the Ministry of Finance. The CIC has devel-
oped standard investment incentive agreements in accordance with the new
Investment Incentive Code.  Similarly, standard concession agreements have been
developed for iron ore and forestry, and are under consideration for other indus-
tries. The CIC is chaired by the Minister of Finance, and decides on applica-
tions where total project cost is $2 million or less. Projects exceeding that
size are decided upon by the National Planning Council headed by the President.
2.15      In 1973, following the establishment of the Mano River Union between
Liberia and Sierra Leone, a Secretariat was established to coordinate policies
and programs affecting the two countries. In addition to easing trade barriers,
some commercial and industrial projects may arise of the Union. This develop-
ment will probably not have a very large effect on industrial development,
since the combined markets of Liberia and Sierra Leone are still too small to
permit much further import substitution.
2.16      Government industrial projects.  The Liberian Government has tradi--
tionally left industrial development to the initiative of private enterprise.
Through LDC it has held investments in only three enterprises: Liberian Iron



Ore, West African Shoe and Rubber, and LBDI. Recently, the Government has
purchased shares in the Liberian Cement Company. The Government is not opposed
to helping promote industrial projects itself, and it has done so in the
recent case of a large rubber processing project (assisted by the British
firm: Guthries). The Government may play some role in other forthcoming
industrial projects such as a sugar factory, galvanized roofing sheets, and
possibly an iron and steel plant (see para. 6.02).
Investment Financing
2.17      Most institutional financing of private investment in Liberia comes
from the banking system. There are six commercial banks operating in Liberia,
two of which have a majority Liberian ownership. Commercial bank loan matu-
rities are generally less than two years, although in a few cases longer-term
loans have been granted. Commercial bank loans outstanding to the private
sector totalled $54 million at the end of 1973, having grown at an average
annual rate of about 17% since 1968. At the end of 1973, 46% of outstanding
commercial bank loans were for commerce, 24% for agriculture (including
forestry and fishing), 18% for personal and other loans, 5% for the construc-
tion industry, 3% each for transportation and manufacturing, and 1% for mining
(see Annex 2).
2.18      Interest rates.  Interest rates in Liberia have been held below
10% due to a usury law. Including various service charges and fees, however,
effective interest rates of commercial banks are now about 12%. Because of
higher interest rates outside of Liberia, and the lack of restrictions on
external capital flows, commercial banks transferred a net of $9.5 million
abroad during 1972 and 1973.
2.19      National Bank.  A bill to create a new National Bank of Liberia
was recently passed by the Liberian Congress. The management and staff of
the National Bank are already on the job, assisted by an advisor from the
IMF. The National Bank will regulate and supervise the banking system,
establish reserve requirements, undertake economic research, perform Government
banking ftinctions, act as a clearing house, and eventually provide credits and
discount services for banks. The US dollar is the currency of use in Liberia,
and a separate Liberian currency is not expected to be issued at the present
time. A bill proposing repeal of the usury law is before the Congress and on
adoption will enable the National Bank to regulate interest rates in the
future. National Bank officials expect to permit interest rates to rise at
least to levels prevailing outside the country, in order to provide an in-
centive for an inflow of funds into the domestic banking system.
III. LBDI'S ROLE
3.01      LBDI's broad objectives according to its Charter and Policy State-
ment are to finance the development of productive enterprises along diverse
geographical and sectoral lines, and to help develop a capital market. A
summary of the volume and characteristics of LBDI's financing appears as
Annex 2.



-6-
Volume and Locus of Financing
3.02      Volume of operations.  LBDI's outstanding investments of about $2
million represent roughly 20% of total outstanding bank credit to the manu-
facturing, tourism, forestry, fishing, and agriculture 1/ sectors combined
(see Annexes 2 and 4). LBDI's importance in the Liberian context is under-
scored by the fact that it is the only national institution in Liberia pro-
viding long-term loans and equity financing for productive enterprise. For
a number of reasons, however, LBDI has been slow to build up to its potential
in terms of volume of business. After having built up a net investment port-
folio of about $1.6 million in its first three years of operation, LBDI's
volume of business was very low in 1970 and 1971 and as a result, its total
assets have not increased since 1969. The first Bank loan was made to LBDI
in June 1972 because the company appeared to be beginning to operate more
aggressively and effectively. Indeed in 1972 operations improved, and in
1973 the company finally achieved and surpassed its long-targeted goal of
$1 million of annual approvals.
3.03      With aggressive new management installed in September 1973 and an
expanded scope of activities LBDI now seems to be well on the way to a satis-
factory level of operations. Approvals of loans and equity investments rose
from $576,000 for 23 projects in 1972 to $1.3 million for 34 projects in
1973. Another $1.5 million for 12 projects was approved during the first
four months of 1974. Commitments rose from $289,000 in 1972 to $885,000 in
1973. Disbursements were $477,000 in 1973 compared to $141,000 in 1972.
LBDI has experienced a low rate of cancellation of projects after Board
approval. Only three projects for $21,000 were cancelled in 1973 compared
to two projects for $41,000 in 1972.
3.04      Geographical distribution of operations.  Most of LBDI's loans for
forestry and agriculture (including oil palm processing, poultry, and coop-
eratives) have been located outside of the Monrovia area, the balance of its
portfolio (about 65% of the outstanding amounts) being concentrated there.
This geographical imbalance should tend to diminish in the future since
forestry projects are expected to take up an increasing proportion of LBDI's
financing. There is also some potential for projects to be established
outside of Monrovia as spin-offs from iron ore concessions (see para. 6.02).
However, it is likely that much manufacturing activity will continue to be
placed near Monrovia as it is simply not economic to locate elsewhere given
the location of markets and suppoLting infrastructure.
3.05      Sectoral distribution.  LBDI's portfolio is well diversified by
economic sector. About 35% (by amount) of the outstanding portfolio at
March 31, 1974 was for manufacturing enterprises, and 30% for agriculture,
agricultural processing, and livestock projects. Forestry and fishing each
1/   Excluding an $8 million increase in outstanding commercial bank loans
to agriculture which occurred in the fourth quarter of 1973, due to
shifting of an account of a single client from a foreign bank to its
Liberian subsidiary.



-7-
represented another 10%, tourism 6%, and the 9% balance consisted primarily
of transport and trade services (see Annex 4). Recently, LBDI has expanded
the scope of its activities by undertaking lending to agricultural cooperatives
and retail establishments.
3.06      Client characteristics.  LBDI has an open door to all who seek
assistance for worthwhile projects in Liberia. Most of LBDI's financing has
gone to small-scale Liberian enterprises. Of the 103 projects for which
LBDI has provided a total of $3.9 million of financing since its establish-
ment, 92% of the number and 79% of the amount financed has been majority
Liberian-owned enterprises. The average size of LBDI's loans has been about
$38,000, and 80% of the loans by number (20% by amount) have been for $50,000
or less. About half LBDI's financing has been for expansions; half also has
been for export projects.
Quality of Project Work
3.07      Appraisals and project selection.  LDBI has built up satisfactory
expertise in financial and economic techniques of project appraisal. Apprais-
als have improved since the first Bank loan was made in 1972. However, the
company has had no engineers nor agriculturalists to help with the technical
aspects of projects. LBDI now has plans to obtain this needed expertise.
3.08      The data available on the performance of LBDI's projects indi-
cates that the development bank, for the most part, has avoided selecting
unviable projects. The low level of arrears (see para. 5.01) indicates
satisfactory financial results for most projects. LBDI's projects have also
had favorable outlooks from an economic point of view. The weighted average
economic return estimated for the five projects above the free limit submitted
for financing under the first Bank loan exceeded 25%.
3.09      There is still room for improvement in LBDI's appraisals, however.
At times critical assumptions lying behind projects are not given sufficient
examination, and incremental effects of projects are not evaluated. More
comparison of alternative project designs, and especially of alternative
machinery, is needed.
3.10      Improving projects; follow-up.  LBDI's appraisal and follow up
work have resulted in the financing of projects which do not endanger LBDI's
own viability and have favorable expected returns for the economy. However,
*           LBDI has not normally helped improve the design or operations of projects
it has financed. This may not be needed for the larger projects LBDI finances,
but it is needed for those relatively new Liberian entrepreneurs who are just
*           at the threshold of developing the managerial abilities they will need to
make their projects a success.
3.11      LBDI could take a number of steps to improve follow-up and assistance
to clients, namely:



-8-
(i) provide excerpts of appraisal reports to clients;
(ii) prepare and implement a realistic schedule of visits to projects;
(iii)  carry out more thorough investigations of projects in difficulties
with a view to identifying problems and making recommendations for
improvements;
(iv) prepare financial and operational reporting forms for clients;
and
(v) provide a bookkeeping service for its smaller clients, either
directly at a small fee, or with the assistance of an existing
accounting firm.
3.12      During negotiations LBDI agreed to upgrade its follow-up activities
and assistance to clients by taking the steps enumerated in para. 3.11 above,
within the constraints of its own limited expertise and the difficulty of
recruiting qualified staff in Liberia.
Other Development Efforts
3.13      Since its establishment, LBDI has underwritten, on a "best efforts"
basis, shares in three companies (Mesurado Fishing, the petroleum refinery,
and PPP Timber). It has participations in the shares of seven other companies,
one of which it recently sold to the Government (the Liberian Cement Company).
The scarcity of private funds available for investment severely limits the
potential for capital market development, but LBDI intends to do more equity
financing on its own and believes that a greater scope for selling equities
to private Liberians is also possible.
3.14      LBDI has little opportunity for other resource mobilization efforts.
There is no market for bonds in Liberia, and the development bank has to rely
on the Government as its domestic source of funds. Recently, LBDI raised
funds from a New York finance company by discounting Government promissory
notes. However, this was a high cost operation (effective interest rate:
11%), and LBDI is now expected to have sufficient funds without resorting
to such financing (see para. 5.04).
3.15      LBDI has a unique opportunity to develop in-depth knowledge of
various industrial subsectors.  Its normal comparison of expected financial
and economic returns on projects it appraises gives it important data regard-
ing the effect of Government policies on the private sector. The development
bank could therefore provide very useful feedback to the Government regarding
the effects of Government industrial policies, and it has shown some inclina-
tion to begin doing so.



IV. ORGANIZATION OF LBDI
Ownership, Board, Management
4.01      Ownership.  There has been no material change in LBDI's ownership
since 1965 (see Basic Data, page i).
4.02      Board of Directors and Executive Committee.  Annex 5 gives a list
of LBDI's Board and Executive Committee. There are eight Board members, of
which three are Liberians, one IFC, and four representing foreign interests
in proportion to shareholdings. Mr. Stephen Tolbert, Minister of Finance,
is LBDI's Chairman.
4.03      LBDI's Board takes an active interest in the affairs of LBDI.
Board matters are first discussed by LBDI's Executive Committee, and often
are voted upon by mail by the Board. The Board met once in 1972 and three
times in 1973. There has been one meeting so far in 1974.
4.04      LBDI's Executive Committee consists of five Board members resident
in Monrovia. It meets about eight to ten times a year. The Executive
Committee decides on LBDI investments up to $100,000. The limit for invest-
ment decisions by management was recently increased from $5,000 to $10,000.
4.05      Management.  Mr. Elias Saleeby, a Liberian previously employed in
the DFC Department of the Bank, took over as President of LBDI in September
1973. For the short period that he has been in office, he has proved himself
energetic and effective in finding new initiatives for LBDI. He receives
needed advice and assistance from his General Manager, Mr. R. Chellappah, who
formerly worked in the Development Finance Company of Ceylon. Mr. Chellappah
recently accepted a renewal of his contract until May 11, 1976.
Policies and Lending Conditions
4.06      At the Bank's urging, prior to the first loan to LBDI, the company
modified its Policy Statement to allow it more flexibility in security
requirements on projects. However, this flexibility does not seem to have
taken place in practice, since LBDI commonly requires such stringent security
as personal guarantees of project sponsors, and heavy collateral requirements.
Unless LBDI's exposure in a project is unreasonable, a mortgage on project
or collateral assets valued at twice the value of LBDI's investment should
be sufficient protection for the company. Security requirements exceeding
this amount could prevent LBDI from financing new entrepreneurs with worth-
while projects but little collateral to offer. LBDI's security requirements
were discussed during negotiations and it was generally agreed that these were
excessive in some cases in the past; for larger projects, however, stringent
security requirements had represented an appropriate measure of prudence by
LBDI's management and Board (see para 4.07).



- 10 -
4.07      Limit on individual investments.  The Policy Statement adopted by
LBDI at its incorporation limited its loan and equity investments in individual
companies to 10% of its total resources. With the new resources expected to
be provided to LBDI (see para 6.13), commitment in an individual enterprise
could approach LBDI's net worth, which would subject the company to far too
great a risk of capital impairment. During negotiations, therefore, agreement
was reached that LBDI would change its Policy Statement to express its limit
on commitment per enterprise in terms of LBDI's own net worth; it was also
agreed that this limit would normally be 30% of LBDI's net worth and 5% of
its quasi-equity. In cases where LBDI's financing over and above this limit
is considered critical to project implementation, LBDI would be required to
adjust its security requirements to the magnitude of risk involved. LBDI has
since changed its Policy Statement accordingly (see Annex 5).
4.08      Interest rate.  In May 1974, LBDI raised its interest rate from 9%
to 10% and its service charge from 1% to 1.5% per annum making a total annual
cost of 11.5% per annum. On ADB and IBRD loans, the sub-borrowers assume the
exchange risk. When Liberia's usury law is repealed, a further increase in
the company's interest rate may be called for, depending upon the level of
inflation and the new interest rates charged by commercial banks (see paras.
2.20, 2.21). LBDI has agreed to review its interest rates periodically,
after the repeal of the usury law,' which is expected soon.
Departmental Organization and Staff
4.09      Annex 7 presents LBDI's organization chart.  The company consists
of a Projects Department and a Controller's Department, supported by necessary
administrative staff.
4.10      Projects Department.  LBDI's project staff have responsibility for
both appraisal and follow-up of investments. There are seven full-time
project staff; four of which are Peace Corps volunteers, the other three
Liberians. The term of employment of two of the volunteers expires at the
end of 1974, and LBDI expects to have them replaced. The company also
has a part-time Liberian financial analyst who expects to begin working
full-time in December 1974. LBDI has also recently obtained UNIDO Special
Industrial Services funding for initial six-month technical assistance posts
for an industrial engineer and agri-business specialist. It is expected
that the experts will be with LBDI for a minimum of two years, however,
through renewal of SIS funding or inclusion in the UNDP's regular program.
LBDI has recruited a Liberian agriculturalist and expects to recruit a
Liberian engineer as counterparts. All of LBDI's Liberian project staff have
had training courses in the last year, either through EDI, or bilateral prog-
rams. LBDI's programs for training, technical assistance, and recruitment of
staff seem satisfactory, although the company could usefully employ an
additional Liberian project analyst (or more, to replace expatriates) if
suitable individuals can be found.
4.11      Accounting Department.  LBDI's Accounting Department has responsi-
bility for the company's accounts, financial planning, processing loan
contracts, disbursements and collections. There are at present three pro-
fessional staff in this department. This number could be increased to permit
LBDI to provide a bookkeeping service for clients (see para. 3.11).



- 11 -
Procedures
4.12      An evaluation of LBDI's appraisal and follow-up work appeared above
(paras. 3.07-3.12).
4.13      Planning and control.  Recently, LBDI has improved its internal
reporting systems and regularized staff meetings which have resulted in
better planning and control of operations. More careful and thorough finan-
cial planning is still needed and LBDI has agreed to take the necessary steps.
4.14      Procurement.  In many cases, LBDI learns of projects after clients
have already decided upon the equipment to be purchased. In some cases,
LBDI has asked sponsors to obtain alternative bids on equipment, or has
itself sought advice on whether quotations received by project sponsors were
reasonable. LBDI exercises judgement regarding the appropriateness of con-
struction costs in its projects as well, at times by seeking the opinion
of an independent architect. To ensure that least-cost alternatives are
explored, it was agreed during negotiations that LBDI would normally require
sub-borrowers to obtain competitive bidding on construction contracts over
$50,000.
4.S5      Disbursement.  LBDI typically disburses on the basis of shipping
documents for imported equipment. For local purchases, disbursements are
made on the basis of pro-forma invoices prepared by suppliers. After a few
minor cases of misuse of funds occurred in the past, LBDI now makes all checks
payable directly to suppliers rather than project sponsors when pro forma
invoices are involved. For construction contracts, LBDI makes disbursements
in stages, after being shown evidence of work completed or visiting the site
of the project to ensure that funds are being used properly. These disburse-
ment procedures are now satisfactory.
4.16      Accounting and auditors.  LBDI's accounting work is satisfactory,
as is the work of its auditors, Coopers & Lybrand Co. The auditors use the
approach outlined in the Bank's guidelines for DFC audits and, with the ex-
ception of share certificates in one company which LBDI had not received by
the end of 1973, had no qualifications to LBDI's accounts.
4.17      Legal.  LBDI's legal work is performed by two different firms; one
for contract writing and another for litigation of defaulted accounts. LBDI's
lawyers do not have an in-depth knowledge of the company's business, and loan
contracts have in a few cases omitted important matters. LBDI is now devel-
oping standard legal documents and is considering whether to have a lawyer
on its own staff. These steps could improve the company's legal work.

V. LBDI: FINANCIAL CONDITION
Portfolio Evaluation
5.01      Annex 4 is a summary of LBDI's outstanding loans and equity port-
folio as at March 31, 1974. The portfolio consists of three equity invest-
ments totaling $143,000 and 70 loans for $2 million. Four loans outstanding
exceed $100,000 and account for nearly half of LBDI's portfolio (oil palm
processing, logging, fishing, and assembly of consumer durables). Two of
those projects have not yet become operational, and the other two are meeting
payments regularly. Eighteen loans with $103,000 outstanding, representing
five percent of the loan portfolio, were in arrears over three months as of
March 31, 1974. This is a significant improvement since March 1973 when nine
percent of the portfolio was affected by arrears over three months, and it
compares favorably to the experience of other development banks in Africa.
It reflects the recent special efforts LBDI has taken to improve its record
of collections. Most of the loans in arrears were made by LBDI in its first
few years of operations. One of them is a $51,000 investment in a poultry
farm, which is now being reorganized under new management, and has begun
repaying again. The other 17 loans in arrears are small loans with a total
outstanding amount of only $52,000. However, they represent about 40% of
LBDI's small loans portfolio 1/. In the past, LBDI has not paid as much
attention to collections on small loans as was required. However, it is now
giving more emphasis to these loans. A number of the small loans may even-
tually have to be written off. Three other large LBDI projects which had
been in difficulty in the past have been rescheduled and now have favorable
prospects. As of December 31, 1973 LBDI had set aside $103,000 in provisions
representing 5.3% of the loan and equity portfolio, which is ample at present
to cover probable losses on the portfolio.
5.02      LBDI holds equity participations in a port storage company, an oil
palm plantation and processing operation, and a meat processing company. None
of these investments has paid a dividend as yet. The storage company has
encountered difficulties due to decreasing traffic moving through the port of
Monrovia and the other two companies have just begun operations. LBDI sold an
investment it held in the profitable Liberian Cement Company to the Government
during 1973.
Resources
5.03      KfW loan.  LBDI has an outstanding deutsche mark loan from KfW,
equivalent to about $1 million, on which it had previously failed to pass on
the foreign exchange risk. As a result, LBDI has suffered exchange losses
due to exchange rate adjustments amounting to over 30% of its net worth in the
last few years. In early 1974, LBDI obtained agreement with KfW to extend the
1/   Defined as approved loans of $10,000 or less.



- 13 -
maturity of the loan from 1978 to 1996, and to suspend repayments until 1986.
During negotiations LBDI agreed to substantially eliminate its present
Deutschemark exposure on KfW loan before June 30, 1975, either by negotiating
a cover with the Government or balancing its assets and liabilities by cur-
rency. LBDI will keep the Bank informed of the degree of its DM exposure in
its quarterly reports to the Bank.
5.04      Liquidity problems and domestic resources.  The unexpectedly rapid
increase in LBDI's level of business since last year led to a liquidity
shortage which had LBDI seeking additional funds from a number of sources.
Chase of Liberia agreed to an overdraft facility at an interest rate one
percent above the London inter-bank rate. Also, LBDI discounted $500,000 of
Government promissory notes with the New York branch of the First Curacao
International Bank at an effective interest rate of about eleven percent.
5.05      Recently, the Government agreed to provide LBDI with $1 million of
funds on a short-term basis at a 7.5% rate of interest. This will make other
high-cost arrangements mentioned above unnecessary.
5.06      Regarding longer-term resources, in May 1974, the Government agreed
to provide LBDI with an additional $2 million in the form of a long-term loan
subordinated to share capital. LBDI will receive promissory notes redeemable
over a five-year period. Depending on the schedule of redemption of promis-
sory notes and the possibility of local expenditure financing up to $1 million
being available out of the proposed IBRD and ADB loans, it appears that LBDI
will have enough funds to cover expected domestic expenditure commitments
through 1976 (see para. 6.13).
Financial Results
5.07      Annexes 8 and 9 present LBDI's financial statements from 1969
through 1973. LBDI's past and projected financial ratios appear in Annex 15.
After two years of losses. LBDI made a small profit of $7,000 in 1973, which
was less than one percent of its net worth.  Profit before provisions and
exchange losses decreased slightly because of the rising cost of debt caused by
increased utilization of ADB and IBRD funds. While LBDI's administrative costs
appear to be high at four percent of average total assets, this is primarily
due to the small amount of its assets. In absolute amounts its administrative
expenses were only $129,000 in 1973. LBDI has done extremely well to operate
within this budget, and only through the use of volunteer staff has it been
able to do so and still devote attention to the very small loans which make
up the majority of the projects it finances. Following improvements in the
prospects for collection on many loans in LBDI's portfolio, the company wrote
back during 1973 $94,000 of provisions previously made, which its auditor
approved. LBDI's exchange losses on deutsche mark borrowings during 1973
were $159,000, emphasizing the importance of covering the exchange risk (see
para. 5.03).
Financial Position
5.08      At the end of 1973, LBDI's provisions for possible losses were ample
at 5.3% of its loan and equity portfolio. Reserves and surplus represented



- 14 -
another 7% of loans and equity investments outstanding. The ratio of LBDI's
long-term debt to equity plus $1 million subordinated Government loan amounted
to 0.5/1. Including disbursed or discounted portions of the Government loan
as debt, 1/ the ratio of total debt to equity was 1.2/1.
VI. PROSPECTS
Business Outlook
6.01      There have been a number of uncertainties affecting the investment
climate in Liberia in the last few years, including tax policies of the new
Government and fears that a Liberian currency might be issued with the estab-
lishment of a central bank. New investment has not slackened, however, and
private investors now seem quite confident that Government policies will re-
main favorable. The areas where most future industrial expansion may be
expected are iron ore, timber, and processing of tree crops.
6.02      Two major developments in the iron ore sector may become realizable
within the next decade. The first is a major new mine in the Wologisi moun-
tain range. The second is an iron and steel plant. The latter has been dis-
cussed in Liberia for many years, and has seemed highly unlikely to be realized.
However, the Government has recently received a proposal from Austria to estab-
lish a one million ton plant, for which Austria would supply up to 70% of
capital required and take all of the output. In the shorter run, there are
a few smaller projects which may result from spin-offs from large iron-ore
concessions. LAMCO, for instance, has an active program in this regard.
6.03      Liberia has much potential for wood product industries, including
chipboard, blockboard, veneer, plywood and knocked-down furniture components.
Investment in logging operations was thought to exceed $2 million annually
in recent years. However, the rapid growth in forestry investment in the
last few years is not expected to continue at the same pace, since all Liberia's
merchantable forests have now been parcelled out to concessionnaires.
6.04      The Government has been pursuing establishment of a Liberian rubber
processing facility, and a project jointly sponsored by Guthries Malaysian
office with a 1.2 million ton capacity is now in LBDI's pipeline. Off-shoots
of this project may include the manufacture of rubber shoes, tires and tubes,
rubber conveyor belts for mining companies (Liberian mining companies consume
3 million meters of conveyor belts per annum), and general industrial rubber
components.
6.05      Another project which the Government is promoting is a sugar mill.
A pilot sugar cane plantation was begun in 1973.
1/  Which amounted to $200,000.  The $800,000 balance is excluded from this
calculation.



- 15 -
Strategy for LBDI
6.06      LBDI faces a number of challenges in developing its future business
and impact. These include: (1) limited investment opportunities and capable,
interested project sponsors; (2) LBDT's low earnings which allow it little
room in its budget for costly promotional efforts (see para. 5.07); (3) LBDI's
multi-sector involvement, which is beneficial to development in that LBDI's
long-term financing is needed in these sectors, but which makes it difficult
for LBDI to play much more than a role of financier in any particular sector;
and (4) LBDI's own equity, which limits the size of project it can finance
with acceptable risk (see para. 4.07); and (5) limitations in the number and
abilities of its staff.
6.07      In spite of these difficulties LBDI has made good progress in the
past year or so and the strategy it is presently following is to expand the
scope and volume of its financing, to improve its stance in the community as
an active development agent, and to improve its profitability. In the last
year, LBDI has begun financing agricultural cooperatives and retail enterprises.
Also, LBDI is obtaining a change in its Act to enable it to finance public
projects. It will limit such financing to 30% of its portfolio. This is a
constructive development since it will enable LBDI to contribute its advice
regarding the formulation of such projects. Recently, LBDI has been actively
seeking to participate in larger industrial projects in Liberia. It has been
able to do this without neglecting the small scale sector which has taken most
of its attention in the past. LBDI also intends to do more financing and sales
of equities. Financing larger, longer-term projects, and taking a more active
role regarding equities, should help LBDI attain an adequate level of profit-
ability, which in turn would enable it to increase its assistance to the
small-scale sector. LBDI needs to establish satisfactory profitability
and pay attractive dividends before it will be able to raise new share capital.
6.08      As an integral part of this approach, LBDI is taking a number of
steps to increase and develop its staff, and its plans in this regard seem
satisfactory (para. 4.10).
6.09      The constraints LBDI faces do not prevent it from enhancing its
development contribution now by providing more assistance to clients and
discussing with the Government the effects of Government's policies on the
projects it finances, as suggested above (paras. 3.11 and 3.15).
Forecast Operations for LBDI
6.10      At the end of March 1974, LBDI had a pipeline of projects requiring
some $3.5 million of its financing. These included the rubber processing pro-
ject mentioned above (requiring $500,000 from LBDI), pharmaceuticals ($500,000),
a transport company ($450,000), galvanized roofing sheets ($425,000), agricul-
tural hand tools manufacture ($450,000), reconstituted milk ($260,000), red
brick production ($250,000), wood curing ($160,000), and pottery ($150,000).
6.11      In addition to the large projects quoted above, LBDI's pipeline in-
cluded 10 rubber farms requiring an average investment of $7,000 from LBDI,
five other agricultural projects averaging $5,000, three bakeries averaging



- 16 -
$20,000, cassava processing ($55,000), printing ($30,000), blockmaking ($30,000),
and nine other retail and other small businesses projects (averaging about
$25,000 each). While many of these projects probably will not come to fruition
before the end of 1974, others may which LBDI has not yet received.
6.12      LBDI's financial projections and the assumptions behind them appear
as Annexes 10 through 14. LBDI expects that it can approve at least $3 million
in loans and $300,000 in equity investments in 1974. Loan approvals are expected
to increase by 10% annually thereafter. Although these targets are optimistic,
they are not unreasonable. The company has made a good start in approving
about $1.4 million in loans and a $100,000 equity investment by May, 1974.
Recently, it submitted another $500,000 wood processing project for approval
by its Board. With continued aggressive management, LBDI has a good chance
of meeting the above goals. It is expected that about 65% of LBDI's loan
approvals (or 60% of total financing) will be for imports. Approved loans are
expected to be fully committed by the year following the year of approval, and
disbursed by the year following the year of commitment, in line with LBDI's
experience.
Resource Requirements
6.13      LBDI is expected to sign contracts for loans and equity investments
from calendar 1974 through 1976 (inclusive) for about $10.1 million. 1/ In
addition, the company is expected to have about $1.4 million of uncommitted
approvals at the end of the period. The 65% of this latter amount which is
expected to be financed from external sources must be included in financing
requirements through the period because LBDI requests external financing when
it approves projects--not at the time of its own commitments. The roughly $11
million of LBDI's 1974-76 requirements are expected to be financed as follows
(in $ million):
Foreign         Local
Total   Expenditure   Expenditure
LBDI collections and cash generation             2.3            -            2.3
Discount of Government notes                     0.5           -            0.5
Redemption of Government notes                   0.9            -            0.9
Balance of IBRD/ADB past loans, net of
repayments during period                       0.5          0.5            -
New ADB and IBRD loans                           6.5          5.5            1.0
10.7          6.0           4.7
6.14      Of LBDI's total financing requirements from international sources
throughi 1976 of about $6.5 million, ADB will provide $2.5 million; a Bank
loan of $4 million should therefore be adequate.
1/   Including $250,000 for the company's new building.



- 17 -
6.15      Disbursements.  At LBDI's request it was agreed that up to $500,000
of the proposed Bank loan would be available to finance not more than 95% of
local expenditure, that is, goods and services obtained in Liberia. This is
justified because of the Government's shortage of funds due to recent oil and
commodity price increases. The Government is virtually LBDI's dnly domestic
source of funds. ADB has also agreed to allow 20% of its loan, or the equi-
valent of $500,000, to be used for financing local currency expenditures.
Import financing will include the CIF cost of direct imports, 75% of the in-
voice price of goods previously imported into Liberia, and 60% of construction
costs which would represent the import financing component of such costs. The
Bank could provide these funds without its financing exceeding 50% of LBDI's
total commitments. LBDI has agreed that it would draw down the ADB and IBRD
lines of credit on an approximate pari passu basis.
6.16      To maintain continuity of Bank financing, it is recommended that
retroactive financing up to $750,000 be permitted of subprojects submitted
to the Bank under the proposed second loan. Projects approved by LBDI
between May (when the first loan was fully committed) and November (when the
proposed second loan might be signed) may be submitted by LBDI.
Forecast Financial Results
6.17      High cost short-term borrowings, and a 25% increase in administrative
expenses due to cost of living adjustments already made, plus the hiring of
new staff, is expected to keep LBDI's 1974 profits at about the same low level
as in 1973. Thereafter, LBDI's higher cost of debt will be offset by the
company's higher interest rate, and administrative expenses are expected to
decrease as a proportion of average total assets. Assuming no further ex-
change losses, net profit as a proportion of average assets is expected to
rise from 0.2% in 1974 to 2.2% in 1976. Due to dramatically increasing
leverage, profits may rise even faster to roughly 18% of net worth in- 
1976. A modest dividend might be payable as from 1975. If LBDI's services
increase commensurate with its role, the company's profit forecasts would be
somewhat less than that shown in the annexes.
6.18      LBDI has a low equity base in comparison with its expected future
level of operations, and it expects to have subordinated Government loans
totaling nearly three times its equity. This unusual concession on the
part of the Government would mean that LBDI could potentially borrow more
than thirteen times its equity according to the typical debt/equity clause
in Bank loan agreements (which permits portions of Government loans maturing
after Bank loans to be counted as quasi-equity). This is excessive since
LBDI could not expect to continue to enjoy such leverage once it has been
weaned from concessionary treatment by the Government. Because of this it
has been agreed that LBDI would limit total debt to seven times its net worth,
including in debt only disbursed or discounted portions of Government loans.
The portion of undisbursed/undiscounted Government loans represented by Gov-
ernment promissory notes held by LBDI will be excluded from the computation
altogether. LBDI is expected to exceed this limit in 1977, and therefore an
increase in share capital would probably be required by that time. Annex 15



- 18 -
indicates that LBDI's debt service coverage is expected to decrease from 5.4
in 1974 to 2.0 in 1978, due to increasing amortization payments on debt.
With expected maturities on borrowings at least as long as LBDI's subloans,
the company's debt service coverage, assuming reasonable profits, should be
comfortable throughout the life of the proposed Bank loan.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      LBDI has an important role to play in financing development projects
in Liberia. It has performed well with the first Bank loan, and it deserves
further financial assistance and institutional support from the Bank Group.
It is recommended that a second Bank loan of $4 million be made to help LBDI
meet expected financing requirements through calendar 1976.
7.0n2     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from LBDI on the
following matters:
(1) LBDI would change its Policy Statement to limit normally its
commitment in a single enterprise to 30% of its own net worth
and 5% of quasi equity. (This has since been done-para. 4.07);
(2) LBDI's present foreign exchange risk exposure on its borrowings
from Kfw would be substantially eliminated by June 30, 1975
(para. 5.03);
(3) LBDI would work immediately to improve its procedures (paras.
3.09-3.11 and 4.13) and introduce more flexibility in its lending
conditions (para. 4.06);
(4) ADB and IBRD lines of credit would be drawn down on an approximate
pari passu basis (para. 6.15);
(5) the Bank would permit local expenditure financing up to $500,000
and retroactive financing (covering LBDI's loan approvals from
May'74 to November'74) up to $750,000 out of the proposed loan
(paras. 6.15 and 6.16); and
(6) LBDI would observe a debt/equity limit of 7:1, including under
debt only the discounted and disbursed portions of Government
loans (para. 6.18).
7.03      Other terms and conditions of the proposed Bank loan are those
generally applied to recent Bank loans to development finance companies, in-
cluding standard commitment fees. The foreign exchange risk would be taken
by sub-borrowers. The amortization of the loan should be the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of LBDI's sub-loans and fixed amortization schedules
for LBDI's equity investments, with a maximum maturity of 15 years from date
of approval by IBRD of individual subprojects.



- 19 -
7.04      Recognizing improvements made in LBDI's appraisal work, the free
limit on individual projects has been radseodfrom $5C,000 to $100,000, and
the aggregate free limit from $200,000 to $1,000,000. These limits will
allow the Bank to review about 15% of the projects expected to be submitted
by LBDI under the proposed loan, and at least 75% of the amounts to be financed.

LIBERIAN BANK FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT
Operating Policies
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will carry on its
business in accordance with the following policies which the Board of Directors
will adopt by resolution at its first meeting.
1.        Purposes and Types of Activity
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall assist in the
economic development of Liberia. To his end, it will encourage the development
of private productive enterprises in the country by providing medium- and
long-term loans (up to a maximum of fifteen years) and equity financing. It
may also sponsor and underwrite new issues of securities and guarantee loans and
commitments of their investors.
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will consider private
investments in industrial projects, agricultural projects associated with or
contributing to manufacturing enterprises, Services, Handicrafts, Extractive
Industries, and Tourism. (Restriction to private enterprise to be changed).
The Bank will not engage in re-funding or re-financing operations
previously arranged, as part of the term loan to be financed by the Bank. The
Bank will not engage in financing commercial transactions, including imports
or exports.
2.        Diversification of Financing
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will diversify its
financing (except for the temporary investment of liquid funds in short-term
securities) among different types of enterprises and types of financing. Therefore,
it shall in general observe the following guidelines:
A.   LBDI will take security commensurate with its risk exposure.  In
particular, in cases where it is in LBDI's interest to take an exposure
in an individual enterprise that is equivalent to more than the
combined amount representing 30 percent of net worth and 5 percent of
the quasi-equity (the present $3 million of subordinated loans
outstanding from the Government) special care will be taken to adjust
its security requirement to ensure adequate protection against the
magnitude of risk involved. Investment in the equity of any single
enterprise shall not exceed 10% of the Liberian Bank for Development
and Investment's paid-in share capital and free reserves.  The aggregate
value of all investments, computed at cost, in the equity of all
enterprises shall, at no time exceed the aggregate of the paid-in
share capital and free reserves of the Liberian Bank for Development
& Investment.



Annex 5
Page 2
B.    Investment in the form of both loan and equity by the
Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall
normally not exceed 50% of the total assets of enterprise.
In the form of equity alone the Liberian Bank for Development
and Investment's participation shall not exceed 25% of the
equity of the enterprise.
3.        Definition of Private Enterprise
(To be modified to permit investment in public enterprises up to 30%
of LBDX's total commitments).
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall finance only
enterprises that are privately owned and managed. The existence of a government
or other public interest in an enterprise will, however, not necessarily
preclude an investment or loan by the Liberian Bank for Development and Investment
providing the government's interest as measured by voting power or control of
the management of the enterprise is not predominant and especially if the
government's equity investment is intended only to be temporary, pending its
selling out to private interest.
4.        Management of Enterprises
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall refrain from
taking a controlling interest in any enterprise or any other interest which
would give it primary responsibility for the management of such enterprise.
5.        Promotion of a Capital Market
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall conduct its
operation so as to assist in the investment of both private Liberian and foreign
capital in Liberian industry. In order to encourage the development of a capital
market, it will revolve its own portfolio whenever it can do so on satisfactory
terms.
6.        Soundness of Enterprises to be Financed
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will finance undertakings
which are soundly managed and which appear, on careful investigation to be economically
viable. It will watch the operations of such undertakings and will give technical
assistance to management when necessary.
7.        Geographic Distribution of Financing
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will select projects,
subject to sound investment criteria, on as broad a geographical basis as possible.



Annex 5
Page 3
8.        Liberian Bank for Development and Investment's own Management
and Staff
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will build and
strengthen its own management and staff so as to achieve a well balanced
organization, including financing and economic analysis, technical, accountancy
and legal services, and supervision of previously concluded investments.
9.        Prevention of Control
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will prevent any
one person or company or group of affiliated persons or companies from gaining
effective control of the organization.
10.       Noncompetition with Commercial Banks
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall not accept
deposits nor compete with commercial banks in its loaning activities.
11.       Reserve Policy
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment will build reserves
consistent with sound financial practice, including reserves for bad debts
and investments and supplementary reserves.
12.       Foreign Exchange Risk
The Liberian Bank for Development and Investment shall not assume
the foreign exchange risk in respect of relending of any non-Liberian moneys
borrowed by it.
13.       Modification or Amendment of this Resolution
Before this Resolution setting out the policies of the Liberian Bank
for Development and Investment shall be modified or amended, any proposed
modification or amendment will be circulated among the members of the Board
in a manner permitting ample time for the due consideration of such proposal
by the individual members, taking into account the desirability of consultation
by any member with the shareholders whom he represents.
