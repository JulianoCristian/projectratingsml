MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF
THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A VOLTA RIVER AUTHORITY
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit of SDR
A,       15.2 million (US$20.0 million equivalent) to the Republic of Ghana is
submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms, with 40 years maturity, and would help finance improvements and
investment requirements of the electricity generation system and
strengthening of the Volta River Authority (VRA). Additional financing for
the project would be provided by the European Ir.testment Bank (EIB., the
Government of Spain, the Valco Trust Fund, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation
Economique, and the Canadian International Development Agency.
2.        Background.  Ghana's total public electric generation capacity
is 1,122 mw of which 95Z is from hydroelectric stations on the Volta River
at Akosombo (912 MW) and Kpong (160 mu), owned and operated by the VRA.
The principal source of supply, the Akosombo plant, was erected in the
early 1960s and is now in need of a major retrofit. Furthermore, some
thermal capacity is also needed to meet growing demand in the 1900s and to
faciliLate better utilization by VRA of its hydro resources. VRA sells
electricity to the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG), the Volta
Aluminum Company (VALCO), and the mining companies, exports to Togo, Benin
and Cote d'Ivoire, and distributes power in Northern Ghana. About 70Z of
VRA's sales revenues are in foreign currency. Under the ongoing Northern
Grid Extension Project (Cr. 1759-GH), VRA's high voltage transmission
system is being extended to cover urban centers in Northern Ghana and will
replace most of the present isolated diesel stations in the early 1990s.
ECG distributes the purchased power within an interconnected grid in the
southern part of Ghana. VRA is a well-run public utility, with relatively
few institutional and financial problems. ECG, on the other hand, has been
less well managed and is the target for continuing major institutional
reforms and distribution system rehabilitation under the recently (August
1989) approved ECG Fifth Power Project.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group has been closely
associated with Ghan's power sector for almost 30 years.  The Government
has requested our further assistance in developing the sector. With VRA,
the Bank Group's role has evolved from that of project financier to
catalyst, facilitating major cofinancing with a small IDA contribution, as
was also the case in the Northern Grid Project. IDA's continued
involvement in the sector is justified in order to assist the authorities
to develop an optimal generation/transmission plan ard to help prioritize
projects in VRA's long-term investment program for financing over the next
five years. This program would complement ECG's distribution program under
the Fifth Power Project. IDA's continued association with VRA would also
be consistent with IDA's broader efforts under the public enterprise reform
program as the project would assist the institutional development of VRA
and enable it to meet the challenges of the 1990s. VRA has a major role to
play in promoting the further examination of opportunities for regional



cooperation in power development and IDA's support would contribute to this
broader objective.
4.        Proiect Obiectives.  The project would enable VRA tot
(i) maintain the high standard of reliability of the country's electricity
supply; (ii) meet projected domestic and export demand through the year
1995 including an interconnection with Burkina Fasol and (iii) implement
its ongoing program of institutional development.
5.        Proiect Descrintion.  The proposed prnject would support VRA's
investment program for the period 1990-95. The main components would be
the retrofitting of the Akosombo plant - generators, turbines and auxiliary
systems; transmission developments including a second bulk supply
substation in Accral extension of the 161 kV grid to supply the Upper West
Region including Wa, its capital city, and an interconnection to Burkina
Fasol distribution needs in Northern Ohanal training facilitises and,
stutdies of future system requirements. The total project cost is estimated
at about US$146.4 million equivalent (excluding any interest during
construction) of which the foreign exchange componrnt is US$127.3 million
(87Z). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedulle B. A timetable of key project
processing event and the status of Bank Group operations in Ghana are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 8207-GH, dated February 6, 1989, is also attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The following agreements have been reached with
the GOG and VRA: (a) VRA to submit audited accounts to IDA within six
months of its fiscal year-end; (b VRA to earn at least 8 rate of return
on currently valued average net fixed assets; (c) long-term borrowings by
VRA would be limited to ensure a minimum debt service coverage of 1.5;
(d) VRA to maintain a debt contingency fund in foreign exchange against
future foreign debt service obligations; (e) VRA's receivables to be
settled in accordance with the respective power supply agreements; (f) VRA
to review annually with IDA its investment program and related financing
plan; and, (g) onlending arrangements for the IDA credit. The signing of
an acceptable Subeidiary Loan Agreement between the Government and VRA;
and, the effectiveness of cofinancing from the EIB for the Akosombo
retrofit component of the project are conditions of credit effectiveness.
7.        Benefits.  An adequate supply of reliable electricity is
essential to sustain Ghana's economic recovery and to provide better value-
for-money to customers facing higher electricity bills. The proposed
project would enable VRA to maintain the high standard of reliability of
the country's electricity supply, meet projected domestic and export demand
through 1995, and extend the national grid to some of the areas that are
not benefitting from hydro power generation. The proposed project would
assist VRA to implement the ongoing program of institutional development,
designed to meet the challenges of the 1990s. The internal economic rate
of return is estimated to be in the 142-191 range for various components,
which is satisfactory.



8.        Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the proposed
project. The major risks relate to possible project delays particularly
with regard to the retrofitting of generating units at the Akosombo power
plant, which will require careful scheduling to ensure reliability of power
supplies during project implementation. However, VRA is a very capable
institution with strong engineering resources available. Provided timely
financing is made available, the proposed implementation timetable should
be achieved.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
