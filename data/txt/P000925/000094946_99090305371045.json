This assessment is based on the fact that\n            most of the physical components were not completed. However,\n            both the Bank and the Borrower's performances achieved\n            mixed ratings, since identification was satisfactory,\n            consistent with the Government's strategy for the power\n            sector. Yet, compliance with covenants was deficient, which\n            contributed to the negative supervision results. The key\n            lessons convey that: 1) Unconventional projects, require\n            extensive research, adequate design, and if needed, a pilot\n            project to precede the main operation. Therefore, the most\n            appropriate lending instrument for this situation, is a\n            Learning and Innovation Loan, which provides flexibility to\n            changes, indicated by the successful Akosombo rehabilitation\n            redesign, a best practice exceeding expectations. 2) Power\n            diversification, a mix between hydro and thermal power\n            supply, plus additional regional interconnection, could\n            prove sustainable, particularly under uncertain hydrological\n            conditions, as Ghana was faced with. Late action gave way to\n            high energy costs, following the installation of emergency\n            thermal power plants. 3) Independent regulation is critical\n            if political influence becomes the cause for financial\n            viability problems, such as the low tariffs in this project,\n            which reduced the power authority's performance. Though\n            an independent utility body has been now established,\n            sustainability remains uncertain."}, "docdt": "1999-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
