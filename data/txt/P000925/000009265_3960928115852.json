support VRA's investment program\n            for the 1990 - 1995 period.  To this end the project will :\n            a) maintain the high standard of reliability of the\n            country's electricity supply; b) meet projected\n            domestic and export demand through the year 1995, including\n            an interconnection with Burkina; and c) implement its\n            ongoing program of institutional development.  Project\n            components comprise the following : 1) retrofitting of the\n            Akosombo plant which includes the reconditioning of six\n            turbine runners; 2) transmission development, including\n            extensions of the 161 KV grid to supply the city of Wa and\n            the provision of an interconnection with Burkina Faso; 3)\n            provision of NED needs through 1994 for network extension;\n            4) construction of a VRA training center; and 5) studies for\n            future system requirements, tariffs and cooperation in power\n            generation amongst neighboring countries."}, "docdt": "1990-02-06T00:00:00Z"}
