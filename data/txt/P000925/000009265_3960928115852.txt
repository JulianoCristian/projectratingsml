SIXTH POlWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. EnerRv Resources and Consumption
1.01      Ghana has substantial energy resources, of which fuelwood and
hydropower are the most important. About 18.3 milin1: hectares are under
tree cover, equivalent to three quarters of the country's 'lnd area, of
which about 8.8 million hectares is forest.  The high forest zone is
concentrated in the southwest, where most of the timber industry is
located.  The northern savanna woodland has less timber potential, but is
the most important source of domestic fuelvood.  Deforestation is a growing
problem in this area and fuelvood scarcities are beginning to develop as a
result.  This issue is being addressed under the Ghana Environmental Action
Plan and the Ghana Forest Resource Management Project.
1.02      Ghana's hydroelectric potential has been the subject of many
studies, some dating from the 1920s but which have mainly covered specific
projects or regions. The country's total technically exploitable hydro
potential is estimated at 10,000 GWh annually (2,300 MW installed
capacity), derived mainly from three major river systems (Volta, Tano, Pra)
in the central and western regions. The presently installed hydro plant
capacity is 1,072 MV, based on two dams on the Volta River. Other sites on
the Black Volta, Pra, Tano and Oti rivers have been studied to pre-
feasibility stage and one of these, Bui (300 MW and 1,175 GWh) has been
studied to full feasibility level. There has been a comprehensive,
country-wide zurvey of small hydro potential, and some recently identified
sites could possibly provide an economic supply to isolated centers.
1.03      Offshore deposits of both crude oil and natural gas have been
identified at Saltpond, Tano and Cape Three Points, but their slze remains
to be confirmed. Further field evaluation work is being carried out under
the ongoing Energy Project (Credit 1373-GH, May 1983). Ghana has no known
deposits of solid hydrocarbons. Solar energy is plentiful with most
regions receiving in excess of 1,900 hours of annual sunshine. This
potential has not yet been exploited to any extent. Wind regimes are
moderate, and insufficient for energy purposes based on existing
technology.
1.04      Not energy consumption in 1987 is estimated at 3.4 million toe,
rather low given the structure of the economy and its favorable energy
resource endowment. The bulk of consumption is woodfuel (662) followed by
petroleum products (202), electricity (1OZ) and agricultural residues (4S).
Commercial energy consumption increased steadily throughout the 19708 and
early 19809 despite the deteriorating economy, spurred by subsidized
petroleum products and low real prices for electricity. However,
consumption declined sharply after 1982 because of shortages of both
petroleum and electricity, but have since recovered as supply conditions



-2-
returned to normal. The transport (342), industry and mining (26X) and
household (222) sectors account for most commercial energy consumption. An
overall energy balance for Ghana is contained in Annex 1-1. Energy sector
issues were examined in considerable detail as part of the UNDP/World Bank
Energy Sector Assessment Program (ESMAP). This sector review report (Ref.
No. 1) 17 was discussed with the Government of Ghana (GOG) in September
1986 and, subsequently three ESMAP projects are underway in an effort to
improve industrial and household energy efficiency.
B. Enervy Sector Organization
1.05      The Ministry of Fuel ¶nd Power (MFP) has principal
responsibility for petroleum and electricity; it establishes and implements
sector policy. To strengthen overall energy sector planning. GOG has
created a National Energy Board (NEB). MFP supervises the state-owned
Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), Ghana Oil Corporation (GOIL),
and the refining company Ghanaian Italian Petroleum Corporation (GRAIP), as
well as the two power sector entities -- the Volta River Authority (VRA)
and the Electricity Corporation of Ghana (ECG). VRA supplies electricity
in bulk to ECG, the Volta Aluminum Company (VALCO), several mines, the
Akosombo Textile Company, and Akosombo Township. VRA also exports
electricity to Communaute Electrique du Benin (CEB) and Energie Electrique
de la Cote d'Ivoire (EECI). Under the ongoing IDA-assisted Northern Grid
Extension Project (Credit 1759-GH) of February 1987, the responsibility for
generating and distributing electricity in Northern Ghana was transferred
to VRA from ECG. These responsibilities are handled by VRA's Northern
Electricity Department (NED). ECG distributes the electricity it receives
from VRA throughout the rest of Ghana.
1.06      Since its foundati n in 1961, VRA has operated as a quasi-
encleve within Ghana, is relatively small. has been well-managed and hmas
enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. ECG, on the other hand, is a much
larger organization, set up in 1967 to succeed the Electricity Division of
the Ministry of Works and Rousing, but has never satisfactorily made the
transition from a Government department. It has suffered from ineffective
management it. the past and has failed to establish itself as an autonomous
and effective public utility. In an effort to improve performance of the
power sector, the Electricity Supply Board of Ireland (ESB), acting as
consultant to GOG, studied the situation in 1985 and concluded that a
merger of VRA and ECG offered the best prospect for the future development
of the sector (Ref. No. 2). GOG, with the concurrence of IDA, considered
that a merger would have strained VRA's capabilities, particularly at a
time wiw it was embarking upon a major expansion program in northern
Ghana. ECG's position was extremely weak, both financially and
maRagerially, and required major reforms and external assistance to
establish it as a sound public utility. Consequently, the merger did not

3-1, and are referred to in this report by their reference numbers in
that listing.



-3-
proceed but was retained as one of several sector organization options, to
be considered in the light of ECG's performance in the next few years.
1.07      In the short term, attention has been focuswed upon sector
reforms and other measures needed to strengthen ECG. ESB was commissioned
to carry out a complete diagnostic study (Ref. No. 3) of ECG's
organization, management, operations and personnel needs, under the ongoing
Power System Rehabilitation "roject (Credit 1628-GH), of September 1985.
The study provided a satisfactory basis for improving ECG's performance and
ESB is currently assisting ECG to implement the agreed recommendations.
While a sound start has been made in reforming ECG, the task will take
several years and its continuation constitutes a major component of the
recently-approved (August 1989) ECG Fifth Power Project.
C. Enervy Policy and Pricing
1.08      Government policy in the energy sector is designed tos (i)
reduce the cost of energy supplies to the economy through rehabilitation
and proper maintenance of installations in the petroleum and electricity
sub-sectors; (ii) reduce dependence on petroleum imports through
accelerated exploration of Ghana's basins and the promotion of more
efficient energy use and proper pricing; (iii) improve forestry management
to provide an adequate long-term supply of fuelwood; and (iv) strengthen
sector institutions through a program of public enterprise reform focusing
on coumercialization.
1.09      Prices of petroleum products and electricity fell sharply in
real terms from the mid-1370s till 1983, as a result of high domestic
inflation and over-valued exchange rates during that period. After the
major devaluation of the Cedi in 1983, domestic energy prices were
increased very sharply to bring them back into line with their
international equivalents. Subsequent increases have generally kept up
with the successive devaluations since then. Petroleum product prices are
now above international levels and are unsubsidized. Some inter-product
price distortions also exist, particularly with regard to kerosene. Based
on recent studies, satisfactory pricing arrangements have been established
for both electricity and petroleum products. Electricity pricing is
discussed below (paras. 1.21-1.23).
D. Existing Electricity Suiply Facilities
1.10      Ghana's total installed public generating capacity is about
1.122 NW of which 1,072 MK (95Z) is hydroelectric from two stations on the
Volta RLver at Akosombo (912 MW), and Kpong (160 MW). Both stations are
owned by VRA and are capable of providing firm energy (in 49 years out of
50) of 4,792 GWh/year ani can deliver 6,055 GVhlyear on average. Total
diesel capacity is about 50 MV of which Tema (30 MW) is the largest and is
currently being rehabilitated with U.K. financing. The remainder comprises
a number of small stations most of which will be retired under the Northern
Grid and ECC Fifth Power projects.



-4-
1.11      Ghana's transmission system is shown OAn  ap IBRD No. 21913, and
comprises over 1,300 km of 161 kV lines with a further 800 km now under
construction to improve supply in northern Ghana. Eight circuits of 67 km
each connect the Akosombo and Kpong hydro plants to the VALCO smelter at
Tema and to other industrial loads, while a 650 km transmission loop
supplies ECG and mines in southern Ghana. A 161 kV double circuit line
provides an interconnection with CEB, connecting Akosombo to Lome, Togo.
The Cote d'Ivoire was interconnected in 1983 through a 225 kV transmission
line capable of supplying a demand of 100 MW.
1.12      ECG distributes power in the urban centers located within an
interconnected grid in the southern part of Ghana. ECG's facilities
comprise a number of 33 kV subtransmission systems, feedira power from
VRA's transmission system, and a number of 11/0.4 kV distribution systems.
In recent years, service within the distribution system has deteriorated
due largely to poor maintenance and inadequate reinforcement of the
distribution system. These problems are now being addressed and the
distribution system rehabilitation would be completed by 1993.
1.13      Total captive generating capacity is estimated at about 30 MW,
of which about 23 MW is installed in six organizations in the mining and
timber industries, hospitals, the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation
(GWSC) and some commercial enterprises. With the notable exception of Him
Timber Company (installed capacity 2.3 MW) captive capacity is mainly used
for standby purposes in the event of power failures.
E. Access to Electricity Service
1.14      In Ghana about 15S of the population has access to
electricity& . ECG has about 244,000 customers, 70S of whom are
concentrated in the five cities of Accra, Kumasi, Tema, Takoradi and Cape
Coast. VRA has about 20,000 customers in northern Ghana and also supplies
a small number of major customers directly frum the grid. About 752 of
ECG's customers are classified as residential and, although they account
for about 47Z of sales, most of them are low-income householders who
consume under 200 kWh mnnthly. About 5 of ECG's customers generate about
65Z of its sales revenues. A major GOG goal is the extension of
electricity supply to many communities presently unserved (para. 1.20).
P. Trends and Pattern of Electricity Consumption and Exports
1.15      Domestic and ezport sales of electricity since 1978 are detailed
in Annex 1-2. Until the severe drought of 1982184, when electricity
supplies were seriously curtailed, about 75 of sales were for export to
neighboring countries and to the enclave VALCO aluminum smelter. During
the drought the latter was completely shutdown and supplies to CF. and to
ECG were reduced. Total system sales fell from 5071 GWh in 1981 to 1594
Glb in 1984. Since 1985 supplies have been restored to all customers.
While exports have fallen somewhat as a result of the comMissioning of
2V   Using a total population of about 13.5 million and a 10 person
household.

CEB's Nangbeto hydro-station and VALCO's lower demand (para 1.23), they
still constitute 702 of the sector sales. Rowever, sale. to CEBS are
expected to rise again as demand in Benin and Togo increases in the short-
term and with the commissioning of interconnections from Northern Ghana by
the mid-1990". VRA is also discussing with Burkina Faso an inter-
connection, to be cogmissioned by 1992. Feasibility studies are currently
underway and the VRA cost of the transmission line sculd be financed under
the proposed project. Exports to Cote d'Ivoire, which dropped considerably
in 1988, were resumed in mid-1989.
1.16      Domestic load is also forecast to rise significantly in the next
decade. ECG's sales fell sharply as a result of supply restrictions from
1003 GWh in 1981 to 723 GWh in 1984, but have since recovered to 1,097 GVhs
in 1988, about 102 above the 1987 level (995 GMh), assisted by the
improvements under the ongoing rehabilitation project. Recent studies have
shown that this upward pressure of demand at an annual rate of about 52 is
expected to continue through the mid-1990s, as the system is progressively
improved. With the electrification of northern Ghana by 1991, NED demand
is expected to quadruple by the year 2000. VRA's forecast of load growth
through 2000 is detailed at Annex 1-3.
1.17      In the early 1980s ECG's system losses averaged about 12Z but,
as a result of system deterioration and weaknesses in customer accounting,
have since risen to about 22Z. A program is in place to reduce system
losses progressively to 10X, which is acceptable by industry standards.
System rehabilitation would reduce technical system losses, while non-
technical losses would be reduced progressively as improved revenue
management programs are put in place. VRA's transmission losses are about
2.5? at present, which is very reasonable.
G. Power Sector Oblectives. Stratetv and Develotment
1.18      Government has embarked upon an ambitious program of economic
recovery, a major element of which is the reform of the public enterprise
sector. Under this program EC6 and VRA are key public utilities to be
comuercialhzed. Ca ..Ltal invested in the power sector, at current
replacement cost is about US$1.2 billion. Ongoing and planned investments
will increase this capitalization to about US$1.5 billion in the next five
years. VRA is already a highly autonomous, financially viable and well-
run entity and attention is now focussed upon bringing ECG to a similar
standard. MPP has demonstrated a considerable comuitment to this process
in the last two years. Responsibilities of ECG and VRA have been redrawn
in such a way as to stimulate competition in the delivery of electricity to
consumrs. A new ECG Board was appointed, top ECG management was replaced,
sector financia'. objectives and targets were agreed and appropriate tariffs
were approved. The ultimate objective is a financially viable, well-
managed sector, whose institutions enjoy a high degree of autonomy and are
capable of delivering a reliable and economic supply of electricity.
1.19      Now the economic crisis is past, the medium-term strategy of GOG
is focused upon economic expansion. The power sector is a potential
constraint on economic development because of under-investment in recent
years, particularly by ECG in subtransmission and distribution facilities.



- 6 -
Improving the sector's efficiency and delivery capability is now of the
highest priority. As a result of a renegotiated contract with VALCO in
1984, VRA is now better able to protect the domestic market against power
restrictions than in the past, by reducing supplies to VALCO in years of
poor rainfall. However, system planning studies carried out in late 1988
indicated that VRA would need to invest in additional thermal generating
facilities to firm up and complement hydro energy in order to meet future
load. The optimal expansion program, based on average hydrological
conditions, called for 400 MW combustion turbines to be commissioned in 4
phases through 2006. A first phase of 100 MW of combustion turbines was to
be commissioned by 1992 to meet expected demand through 1995, and a second
thermal increment of 100 MV was to be added by 1996 to enable VRA to meet
expected demand through the year 2000. However, owing to unexpected above
average rainfall in 1989 (the second highest since the dam was built), by
the end of 1989, the Akosombo reservoir was almost full at a level of 274.3
feet, compared to a maximum allowabie level of 276.5 feet. The currently
high lake level will not affect the medium to long term generation
.requirements (i.e., beyond 1995). In the short term, however, because of
the high water inflow in 1989, it is possible to delay the commissioning of
the first 100 MW phase of the thermal complementation by at least two years
from 1992 to 1994, on the basis that the water level would revert to normal
or below normal. A further postponement of the thermal program may again
be necessary if the hydrology remains above average. VRA will continue to
closely monitor the lake level and will, as part of the annual review of
its capital investment program (para. 1.40), review with IDA each year, its
decision concerning the introduction of the first phase of thermaal
generating facilities. Reliability of the present Akosombo units has
deteriorated somewhat in recent years and studies (Ref. No. 4) have now
confirmed that VRA needs to undertake a major retrofitting of the 25 year-
old Akosombo hydroplant by the early 19909, to avoid the risk of major
breakdowns. From ECG's perspective, substantial investment is proposed
under the Fifth Power Project to complete the rehabilitation of its system
and to provide for economic growth in domestic demand over the next four
years. VRA's investment program (1989-96) totalling about US$558.0 million
equivalent is set out at Annex 1-4. About US$89.7 million consists of
rehabilitation/retrofitting of existing facilities; about US$151.4 million
of committed transmission and distribution schemes; about US$213.7 million
of future expansion; and about US$103.2 million of other ongoing projects.
With respect to ongoing projects in its capital program, VRA is responsible
for managing infrastructure projects including water supply, sewerage and
public health and hospital services in the Akosombo, where VRA is the local
authority, and Akuse townships. While these are not direct power
expenditures, VRA considers them vital for continued efficient operations.
VRA also considers the renabilitation of existing housing and provision of
new housing and related infrastructure projects necessary in light of the
acute shortage of adequate housing and the need to attract qualified staff
for its operations in these areas. VRA's ongoing projects were reviewed by
IDA and are considered acceptable.
1.20      A major GOO long-term (30 year) goal is the provision of
electricity to most of the population, by extending the interconnected
transmission grid to towns and villages throughout Ghana, and especially to
substitute the existing diesel generation by hydro power. Some MFP-



sponsored electrification schemes are already underway, with financial
assistance from India and Japan (about US$10 million). ECG is the
implementing agency. Other bilateral donors have expressed to GOG an
interest in financing regional electrification studies and, thereafter, in
funding regional electrification projects. However, in order to establish
a sound framework for such development, GOG has agreed with IDA to prepare
a long term (30 year) National Electrification Plan. This would establish
policies and uniform standards, identify priority programs for the
extension of the grid to unelectrified areas of Ghana in accordance with
satisfactory economicifinancial criteria. It would also complement VRA's
long-term generation and transmission plan. The study is being financed
under the ECG Fifth Power Project. Under the Fifth Power Project,
agreement was reached with GOG that the consultants' report would be
reviewed by GOG and IDA and satisfactory economic/financial criteria would
be adopted for future electrification programs. The proposed project
includes a provision for NED expansion to implement the recozmendations of
the National Electrification Study to 1994. It was agreed that before this
component of the project proceeds, it would be reviewed with IDA in the
broader context of the National Electrification Plan, as required under the
Fifth Power Project.
H. Power Sector Financial Obiectives and Tariffs
1.21      COG's goal is the provision of an efficient, economic, and
affordable supply of electricity to the whole country. To this end, a high
priority is accorded to the mobilization of resources from within the
sector by charging tariffs sufficient to cover supply costs, to contribute
a reasonable portion of investment costs and to earn a reasonable return on
invested capital. Under their respective statutes, ECG and VRA are
required to operate in a commercial manner, consistent with the objective
of adequate sector resource mobilization. In recent years, electricity
tariffs have not kept pace with the substantial increases in costs
associated, in particular, with major Cedi devaluations. ECG has been
unable to meet its financial obligations, including those to VRA, whose
position has been cushioned by its substantial foreign currency earnings
from VALCO, CEB and EECI.
1.22      In an attempt to put the sector on a sound financial footing,
consultants (Coopers and Lybrand, U.K.) were commissioned in 1986 to
undertake a tariff study of the power sector. The objective was to develop
tariffs which reflect the economic i.e. long run marginal costs (LRMC) of
supply, are affordable, generate sufficient revenue to ensure financial
viability, and are easy to administer.  In their report (Ref. No. 5), the
consultants identified, as part of the LRMC of electricity supply in Ghana,
the opportunity cost to the economy of lost export revenues resulting from
higher Ghanaian demand. This fasctor represents about 401 of LRMC and, to
recover it from Ghrnaian customers, constitutes a burden on them. The
consultants also identified a serious problem of affordability in asplying
LRMC tariffs to many residential customers and recommended phasing-in full
LRMC over 25 years.  GOG agreed to adopt a uniform national tariff
structure, based on LEMC principles. For 1988, the level of tariffs
recommended by the consultants were substantially adopted following a
review by MPP, ECG and VRA and approximated to about 751 of LRMC. While



- 8 -
there is some cross-subsidization in the tariff structure, tariffs for non-
residential and residential (over 600 units) customers ar:e comparable to
those in many developed countries. Ghana's tariffs are "Auch below those
prevailing in Western Africa but this is largely a reflection of the
relative low costs and efficiency of the country's hydro system. In order
to ensure the financial viability of the power sector, GOG has also
established a target rate of return of at least 8 on currently valued net
fixed assets in operation. Tariffs adopted for 1989 were designed to
enable VRA to continue to earn an 82 and ECG a 62 rate of return, as agreed
under the Fifth Power Project. Increases ranged from 62 for low-income
consumers to 202 for non-residential users. The current tariff schedule is
shown at Annex 1-5. In fixing tariffs for 1989 GOG expressed serious
concern at the prospect of further adjustments to domestic tariffs to
reflect recent devaluation and inflationary pressures at a time when the
service remains unreliable. While maintaining its commitment to previously
agreed tariff objectives, GOG wishes to re-examine certain aspects of the
1986 tariff study in the light of developments since then, and has agreed
to keep IDA closely involved in all aspects of the study and its
implementation. The study will be done shortly under the proposed project.
1.23      While VRA is required to achieve an overall financial target of
not less than an 82 rate of return on its revalued fixed assets, ezport
tariffs to VALCO, CEB and RECI are determined by negotiation. VRA has
supplied electricity for VALCO's aluminum smelter since Akosombo was
commissioned in 1966. In 1984, the VALCO 1962 contract was renegotiated to
include provision for quinquennial reviews and for increases in the price
of electricity supplied, originally fixed at 2.625 US mills/kWh. The
renegotiated rate approximated to the world average price of power supplied
to smelters in the early 19809. Under the amended contract VRA supplies to
VALCO are determined by a formula which guarantees priority of supply to
the Ghanaian market and enables VRA to manage its reservoirs more
efficiently, maximizing sales and avoiding spilling water in wet years.
Maximum energy assigned to VALCO is now 2760 GWh annually, for four
potlines, with the right of first refusal over any additional available
energy, at a price to be negotiated. In 1988, VALCO was supplied 2745 GWh
(plant energy efficiency has been improved since 1984) yielding revenues of
about US$53 million, an increase from about US$30 million in 1987. The
price VALCO pays is linked both to its purchases from VRA as well as world
aluminum prices, which have been rising recently. VRA has recently
successfully renegotiated VALCO rates, under a contract which would be in
effect through 1994. VRA also pioneered electricity supply across national
boundaries in Western Africa and established links with CEB in TogolBenin
(1972)..and with EECI in Cote d'Ivoire (1984). VRA supplied CEB with 300
GWh in 1988, a significant reduction on the 1987 level (410 GOh) following
the commissioning of CE's Nangbeto hydrostation. The contract with CEB
was also recently renegotiated with an increase from about US¢4 to 4.81kWh.
At present, there is no long-term agreement with EECI.
I. VRA - The Imilementina Agency
1.24      The 1961 Volta River Development Act (Ref. No. 6) requires VRA
not only to operate its plant according to sound public utility practices
but also to develop the Volta Lake for transportation, fishing and tourism.



VRA is authorized to sell the electricity it generates in bulk to any
public corporation, including power utilities in neighboring countries and
to Government departments. By a recent amendment, to reflect its extended
responsibility agreed under the Northern Grid Extension Project, VRA is
also authorized to distribute electricity in Ghana.
1. Organization. Manaaement and Staffing
1.25      VRA is governed by a Board, whose members are appointed by the
Head of State, and is composed of a Chairman (currently the PNDC Secretary,
Fuel and Power) and seven others, including VRA's Chief Executive, the
Managing Directors of ECG and of VALCO, and a VRA staff representative.
The Board, by tradition, is composed of persons from outside Government
services, and its quality has successfully preserved for VRA the essential
autonomy from undue interference by Government endowed from the earliest
days of VIA's creation.
1.26      Following a recent review of departmental responsibilities,
VRA's senior management structure has been modified. Three Deputy Chief
Executives (DCEs) - for Corporate Planning and Finance, Engineering and
Operations, and Resources and Services - now report to the Chief Executive.
The Board Secretary/Legal Adviser, the Director of Internal Audit and the
Corporate Relations Officer also report to the Chief Executive. Each
functional area is the responsibility of a Director, with appropriate
supporting staff. An organization chart is at Annex 1-6. VRA is a well-
run utility with a local staff of about 2850, including 450 personnel
engaged in power distribution in Northern Ghana. Of the rest (2400), about
400 are engaged in the provision of support services in Akosombo and Akuse
townships. Staffing levels are expected to fall by about 400 over the
project period.
1.27      Since its establishment more than 25 years ago, VRA has enjoyed
a 'twinning' arrangement with Ontario Bydro of Canada under which it has
obtained a whole range of specialist advise and management services,
including term assignment in Ghana, and training facilities for its own
staff in Canada. VRA currently employs, at its own expense, several senior
Ontario Hydro managers in specialist areas of system planning, materials
management, management information systems, vehicle workshop maintenance,
and general management consultancy. In 1987 16 VRA staff returned to Ghana
after attachment periods, ranging from 6 to 24 months, with Ontario Hydro.
VRA also makes use of overseas consultants in engineering, management and
finance from time to time to assist it in developing and designing new
systems or to undertake sophisticated system planning tasks. VRA staff are
always assigned to such tasks in order to ensure in time full *technology
transfer'. In addition, under the ongoing Northern Grid Extension Project,
VRA has engaged a number of key expatriate project engineering staff,
financed under Credit 1759-GH.
1.28      The restructuring of VRA's management is designed to help it
meet the challenge of the 19909. While Engineering, Systems OperatiGns and
Administration Services are well-established, the Corporate Planning and
Finance function has recently been reorganized. In the past there has been
a division of responsibilities for financial matters. Accounting and



- 10 -
Finance have now been brought together under one Director, which should
improve the quality of service to senior management and the Board. This
area needs to be strengthened. Given the nature of VRA's business and its
likely expansion in the next decade, a greater emphasis needs to be placed
on planning and development and improved MIS. To achieve this, a new DCW
has been recruited whose responsibilities include, inter alia, development
of VRA's capable, younger staff and strengthening its planning, finance,
accounting and MIS functions. VRA has also advised 1DA during negotiations
that the several line manager positions in the reorganized department had
been filled. VRA is developing a corporate plan with the assistance of
Coopers & Lybrand International (London). The corporate plan, which would
include key performance indicators to enhance the future planning and
monitoring of its financial and operational performance, is expected to be
in place by mid-1990.
1.29      In addition to an extensive overseas training program VRA has a
local training facility to meet its non-specialist training needs.
However, its present buildings are cramped and there are no residential
facilities. In order to remedy these problems and to provide for the
necessary expansion of local training, VRA proposes with donor assistance
to provide a purpose-built training centre. This project is at a
preliminary stage and is tentatively included in VRA's investment program
for the years 1991 to 1992. VRA has requested DANIDA's assistance to
undertake a full feasibility study of this project.
2. Accounting, Audit and Insurance
1.30      VRA's accounting and budgeting systems are generally
satisfactory and provide timely and reliable financial information. It has
an independent internal auditing department which forms part of its system
of internal control. VRA's electricity operations are financially separate
from the other activities--resettlement, lake research and lake transport -
for which separate accounts are kept. NED's activities are also kept
separate from those of electricity generation/transmission, but are
consolidated at the year-end. Improved financial systems and reporting are
expected following the full computerization of VRA's accounts, and other
4Aprovements are expected as a result of the full integration of financial
management.
1.31      VRA maintains its accounts in accordance with appropriate
international standards. Each year its fixed assets are revalued, using a
satisfactory indexation formula, following the latest physical inspection
and valuation in 1985. Depreciation and rate of return are calculated on
the full replacement cost of VRA's fixed assets. The cedi value of foreign
currency loans is also adjusted annually at prevailing exchange rates. VRA
is preparing with its auditors, for submission to IDA, a statement of the
accounting policies and treatment to be adopted in respect of work to be
undertaken under the Akosombo retrofit project. These would take into
account the need for particular internal control/monitoring arrangements
and the treatment of existing asset, depreciation and revaluation reserve
accounts.



- 11 -
1.32      Present auditing arrangements are satisfactory.  VRA's accounts
and auditors' report are submitted within the 6 month period agreed with
InA under the ongoing Northern Grid Project. VRA's auditors (Coopers and
Lybrand, Accra) have never had occasion to qualify VRA's accounts. In
future, VRA will continue to submit to IDA satisfactory audited accounts
within six months of its fiscal year end, as agreed during negotiations.
1.33      VRA's current insurance arrangements, based largely on self-
insurance need to be re-examined to ensure their adequacy against normal
public utility risks. VRA is carrying out a study of its various insurance
options, and has agreed to review with IDA the recommendations of the study
as soon as they become available.
3. Recent Financial Performance
1.34      VRA's financial position has continued to recover from the
drought of the early 19809, which caused it to curtail supplies to all
customers between 1983/85. From a low 1670 GWh in 1984, sales in 1986
increased to 4252 GWh, an increase of 1552, and have since continued to
rise. Furthermore, as a result of the earlier renegotiation of the VALCO
agreement and subsequent increases in export (to CEB) and domestic tariffs,
WRA's revenue/kWh has increased significantly, to offset higher operating
costs arising from cedi devaluations and local inflation. Measured by its
profitability, under the difficult circumstances of the mid-1980. VRA's
financial performance has been satisfactory. VRA's rate of return on
revalued average net fixed ass ets (ANFA) in operation, rose from about 62
in 1985 to about 91 in 1988. 37 Tn 1987, VRA took over the responsibility
for power distribution in Northern Ghana as a result of which it agreed to
absorb an operating loss on the activities of NED in 1988 of about 41
billion. equivalent to 0.81 rate of return. Such heavy losses will recur
in the 1990., and their elimination would require a substantially expanded
market and careful control over operating costs (paras. 1.38139). In order
to ensure adequate liquidity and to protect VRA's future viability under
the ongoing IDA Credit 1759-GH, VRA agreeds (a) to earn at least 82 p.a. on
currently valued average net fixed assets in operation; and, (b) not to
incur future long-term borrowings without IDA agreement, unless future debt
service is estimated to be covered at least 1.5 times by future net
revenues. VWA has asreed during negotiations to include these conditions
under the proposed project. VRA's total debt service coverage at end-1988
was satisfactory at about 2.5 times. Audited financial results for the
last three years (1986-88) are summarized in the following table and
detailed at Annex 1-7.
31   Under Credit 1759-GB of February 1987, VRA's agreed annual rate of
return on ANFA is 81 from FY1987.

1.35       VRA is permitted to operate an external US dollar account into
which are paid dollar revenues from VALCO and from exports, and from which
VRA services its foreign debt and finances operational and capital foreign
exchange requirements as well as its cedi requirements when necessary. VRA
has in the past (1984/85) faced foreign exchange shortages when it had to
obtain short-term loans to meet its foreign exchange commitments, and it
could again be faced with shortages of foreign exchange to cover debt
service during times of less favorable export revenues. Consequently, VRA
agreed under the Northern Grid Project to set aside funds (a Debt
Contingency Fund) in foreign exchange from its foreign currency earnings,
equivalent to not less than its future annual foreign debt service
obligations. This fund is being built-up by annual appropriations from
WA's foreign currency earnings to an amount equivalent to about US$50
million by the mld-1990s and would then be adjusted in accordance with the
.evel of VRA's debt service obligations. During negotiations, VRA agreed
to continue to build-up and maintain this contingency fund under the
proposed. project.
1.36       At the end of 1988, VYA's capitalization Was US$735 million
equivalent; its debt/equity and current ratios and the level of its
receivables were satisfactory. VRA's capitalization at December 31, 1988

ki After adjustment for ECG arrears (para. 1.37)
1.37       VRA's balance sheet provides a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the Corporation in accordance with internationally-accepted
accounting standards. As a large part of VRA's fixed assets are now debt
free and have a long life, VRA's debt/equity ratio is low. Liquidity at
end 1988 was adequate with a current ratio of 1.2. Customer receivables
were about 3 months billings at end 1988. However, a large part of this
was the result of ECG's failure to pay its bills, for bulk supply of
electricity; at end 1988 ECG was owing about 03.6 billion, equivalent to
one years' billings. This problem has now been resolved under the ECG
Fifth Po-er Project. ECG's arrears to VRA (03.6 billion) have been
converted to a dividend from VRA to GOG. Henceforth, the mutual current
obligations of Government, ECG, GWSC and VRA, would be settled on a monthly
estimated basis through a clearing system and would be reconciled
quarterly. All other customers receivables averaged 1.2 months' billings.

separate operating entity, NED. Service was provided to about 25,000
customers from isolatcd diesel stations, some of which have been retired,
and the rest are to be retired by 1992 as the grid is extended to these
areas. In the meantime, VRA has improved the quality of service, extended
the power supply to new customers and has ensured the availability of
diesel fuel for generation, which had previously been a major problem. By
agreement under Credit 1759-GH, VRA is required to meet operating losses
from its surplus on bulk supply operations. VRA maintains separate
accounts for N.'")s operations. NED's audited financial results for
1987/88, and, projected results for 1989/90 are summarized below.
Financial projections for NED through 1996 are set out in Annex 1-7.

a/ Gross value of fixed assets transferred from ECG and valued at current

1.39      NED's recent financial position is attributable to the cost of
establishing the new organization and of improving the quality of service
--involving expensive fuel purchase and transportation--pending the
commissioning of grid supplies. Its financial position is also affected by
a uniform national tariff. However, as grid supply becomes progressively
available, expensive thermal will be eliminated and as new distribution
projects are completed NED's customer market is expected to expand rapidly.
For example, by substituting the cost of grid supply for that of thermal in
1988, NED's operating loss would have been about 0450 million, equivalent



- 15 -
to ¢17/KWh, compared to J1038 million, equivalent to J40/KWh.  The adequacy
of tariffs will be addressed in the forthcoming tariff study (para 1.22).
Under the Northern Grid project, VRA agreed to meet the operating losses of
NED and consequently has every incentive to control costs and expand the
market. However, for several years an operating loss is likely to
continue. VRA's required 82 rate of return on ANFA is calculated after
taking into account NED's operating losses.
5. Financing Plan (1990-96)
1.40     Financial projections for VRA through 1996 which encompass the
proposed project period (1990-95) are set out in Annex 1-7, and the
assumptions made in their preparation in Annex 1-8. VRA's estimated
capital requirements during the 1990-96 period amount to about US$484
million equivalent of which 142 consists of ongoing projects (IDA Credit
1759-GH). About 57? of VRA's requirements would be raised from IDA and
other cofinanciers and the remaining 43? would be generated by VRA from
internal funds after providing for debt service, working capital and
contributions to its debt contingency fund. VRA may wish to embark upon
further projects, as yet undefined in its capital expenditure program.
Therefore, VRA has agreed that it would review annually with IDA, until the
project is completed, the composition tf its capital expenditure program
for the following five years, together with a related financing plan.

6.   Future Financial Position
1.41      The salient features of VRA's projected financial performance
from 1989 through 1996 are summarized below. Tariffs would increase
significantly in 1991 and 1992 and moderately thereafter, in constant US
dollars, as a result of the agreed rate of return targets. VRA's operating
ratio declines from about 471 in 1990 to about 45Z in 1996. Debt service
coverage is comfortable (well above 1.5) declining from its high of 3.9 in
;9rs to 3.3 in 1996 when the servicing of some project loans begins.
Liq$idity would be satisfactory with receivables at 1 month's billings
throughout the project period. The current ratio increases significantly
through 1996 after the initial impact in 1989/90 on current assets of cash
appropriations for investments in the debt contingency fund for foreign
debt service (para 1.35) and fuel costs in some years (Annex 1-7). VRA's
debt equity ratio would be very satisfactory in the 21-232 range during
project implementation and declining to below 2O0 by 1996.

J. Bank Group Role in the Power Sector
1.       Past Lendina
1.42     The Bank Group has been closely involved in the development of
Ghana's power sector, with eight lending operations in the past 30 years.
Since 1961, three Bank loans to VRA have assisted in the financing of the
Akosombo and Kpong dams and power plants and recent Credits (1628-GH and
1759-0H) are helping VRA to rehabilitate its system and extend grid supply
to northern Ghana.  Lending to ECG began soon after its formation in 1967
and the ongoing Power System Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1628-GE) is the
fourth lending operation. The amount of Bank Group lending for power
projects in Ghana to date (US$190 million) exceeds that for any other
sector and has helped finance virtually all the major sector investments
since Ghana's independence. The Bank's participation in the Akosombo and
Kpong hydro generation projects and the ongoing Northern Grid Extension
Project was especially important in mobilizing the large amounts of
cofinancing needed for these ambitious projects.
1.43     Two Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR) have been prepared on
Ghanaian power projects. An early PPAR covered the first four projects.
The second PPAR of June 6, 1985, covering the fifth (VRA's Kpong
;

hydroelectric project, Loan 1380-GH) and sixth (ECG's Third Power project,
Loan 1381-GB and Credit 689-GB), emphasized the need to fully utilize
existing facilities before investing in additional capacity. This is a
major objective of both the ongoing and the proposed power projects.
2.   Rationale for IDA Involvement
1.44     The Bank Group has been closely associated with Ghana's power
sector for almost 30 years. The Government has requested our further
assistance in developing the sector. With VRA, the Bank Group's role has
evolved from that of project financier to catalyst, facilitating major
cofinancing with a small IDA contribution, as was also the case in the
Northern Grid Extension Project.  IDA's continued involvement in the sector
is justified in order (a) to assist the authorities to develop and
implement an optimal generation/transmission program; and (b) to confirm
the priority projects for financing over the next five years. This program
would complement ECG's distribution program under the Fifth Power Project.
IDA's continued association with VRA would also be consistent with IDA's
broader efforts under the public enterprise reform program as the project
would assist the institutional development of VRA and enable it to meet the
challenges of the 19909. VRA has a major role to play in promoting the
further examination of opportunities for regional cooperation in power
development and IDA's support would contribute to this broader objective.
I . THE PROJECT
A.       Prolect Obiectives
2.01     The project would enable VRA tot  (i) maintain the high standard
of reliability of the country's electricity supply; (ii) meet projected
domestic and export demand through the year 1995 including an
interconnection with Burkinat and (iii) implement its ongoing program of
institutional development, designed to meet the challenges of the 1990s.
B.       Prolect Descrlption
2.02     The proposed project would support VRA's investment program for
the period 1990-95. A detailed project description is outlined in Annex 2-
1. The main components would be:
(i)   the retrofitting of the Akosombo plant including the
reconditioning of the six turbine runners, rehabilitation of
other turbine parts, installation of new governors, supply
and installation of new stator core windings for the
generators (units 1 to 4) and rewinding of units 5 and 6,
supply and installation of new equipment for the overhaul of
the electro-mechanical systems and the supply of spare parts
for the next five years of operations;
(ii) transmission development including the extensions of the
161 KW grid to supply Wa, the capital of the Upper Western



- 18 -
region, and other towns in the region and in the Northern
region, to provide an interconnection with Burkina Paso, and
provide a second bulk supply substation in Accra;
(iii)   provision of the NED needs through 1994 for network
extension to provide electricity supply in all regional and
district capitals in the NED service area;
(iv)   the construction of a training center for VR that could
also be used by ECG and other Government agencies, for
training of technical and nontechnical staff; and,
(v)   studies for future system requirements, tariffs and
cooperation in power generation amongst neighboring
countries--Cote d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Burkina Paso and
Nigeria.
C.       Project Cost
2.03     The total project cost is tentatively estimated at US$146.4
million equivalent (excluding any interest during construction) of which
the foreign exchange component is about US$127.3 million (872 of total
cost). The cost estimate is based on mid-1989 prices. Physical
contingencies of 102 on the major project components, and price
contingencies, based on current inflation trends were added. Inflation
rates used are contained in Annex 1-8. The detailed project cost estimates
are shown in Annex 2-2 and are summarized below:

D. Proiect Financing Plan
2.04      A detailed project financing plan is set out at Annex 2-3.  An
IDA Credit of US$20 million equivalent is proposed to the Republic of
Ghana. Under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOG and VRA, the 1D4
Credit would be onlent to VRA for 20 years, includiLg 6 years grace 5' at
the prevailing IBRD interest rate. VRA would bear the foreign exchange
risk. The signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement acceptable to IDA would
be a condition of effectiveness. The proposed IDA credit would finances
(a) 100S of the foreign exchange cost of the overhaul of the turbines
(US$14.3 million); and, new Governors (US$3.0 million); and (b) 100S of the
AV The grace period is in line with the implementation period required to
complete the retrofitting of Akosombo generators (para 2.07).



- 20 -
foreign exchange cost of studies of future genaration and transmission
interconnection schemes (US$2.7 million).
2.05      Adequate project cofinancing is available to cover the rest of
the foreign exchange cost and part of the local cost, as indicated below:
(a) The European Investment Bank (EIB) has agreed to provide US$28.2
million equivalent to financ.e lOOS of the foreign costs (US$25.4
million equivalent) and local costs (US$2.8 million equivalent)
of the overhaul of the generators and exiters under the Akosombo
retrofit component. EIB financing would be provided to VRA for
20 years, including 6 years grace at an interest rate of about
5.5z.
(b) The Government of Spain has indicated a willingness to provide
about US$22.6 million equivalent to GOG to finance the extension
of the transmission line to Va in the Upper Vest Region. The
onlending terms to VIA have not yet been agreed.
(c) CCCE (France) has agreed to provide a credit to GOG of about
USSO.6 million equivalent to finance prefeasibility studies for
the White Volta hydroelectric sites. CIDA (Canada) has agreed to
provide GOG US$0.3 million equivalent to finance the tariff
study.
(d) VRA would meet most (US$16.3 million equivalent) of the local
costs and US$44.4 million equivalent of the foreign exchange
requirements, including all interest during construction (US$9.6
million equivalent), from internally generated funds. VRA would
also borrow US$20 million equivalent from the Valco Trust Fund.
GOG has advised IDA that financing from this trust fund would be
made available to VRA on the same onlending terms as the IDA
Credit. VRA would seek financing for the foreign costs of the
training centre (US$3.6 million equivalent) upon completion of
the feasibility study being financed by DANIDA.
The effectiveness of the EIB financing for the Akosombo retrofit
project would be a condition of effectiveness of the IDA Credit.
E. Proiect Implementation
1. Status of Preparation and Execution
2.06      The proposed project was prepared by VRA, with the assistance of
consultants. The condition of the Akosombo plant has been investigated by
several external experts as a result of increasing equipment failures in
recent years, despite vigorous preventative maintenance. A Japanese
*maufacturer (Hitachi) and VRA's consultants (Acres International), carried
out independent studies to determine whether to replace or overhaul
(retrofit) the turbine runners and concluded that the benefit of
replacement vodld be marginal. This was confirmed by an operl"ing utility
in late November, 1989. Acres International has also prepared a



- 21 -
feasibility report on the thermal investment program (Ref. No. 7) as part
of an update of VRA's long-term generation/transmission development plan.
2.07      VRA would implement all aspects of the proposed project with
assistance from consultants as required. VRA has established a sound
record in project management. It has a strong Engineering Department,
which., with the judicious use of consultant assistance, can manage complex
projet:ts such as the Northern Grid Extension. As the latter project will
be latgely completed in 1990, engineering resources should be adequate to
handle the proposed project. The Akosombo retrofit, which would take six
years to complete, would be supervised on site by the Generation Systems
Department. VRA's arrangements for managing the project are detailed in
Annex 2-4. Project completion is expected by end-1995; an implementation
timetable is set out at Annex 2-5.
2.  Monitorina and Reporting Requirements
2.08      The proposed project would require careful coordination within
VIA. The Engineering Department, under the supervision of the DCE,
Engineering and Operation, would be responsible for monitoring physical
works. Monitoring of institutional performance would involve the Chief
Executive and his senior management team. VRA is familiar with IDA's
reporting requirements, from earlier and ongoing projects. Quarterly
progress reports vnuld be made to VRA's Board, MFP, IDA and other financing
agencies. Detailed reporting requirements were discussed during appraisal.
An annual review of the implementation of all aspects of the proposed
project, including the achievement of any agreed performance targets, would
be undertaken by VRA, GOG and IDA.
2.09      During negotiations, it was agreed that the project accounts, and
the Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) would be audited annually by
independent auditors satisfactory to IDA according to acceptable auditing
standards. The audited accounts and the auditor's report would be
submitted to IDA within six months following the end of the fiscal year
(para. 1.32). SOEs will be reviewed by IDA on a regular basis.

2.11    The different procurement lots along with their estimated value
and procurement method is detailed in Annex 2-6. IDA financed lots for
the retrofit of the Akosombo Plant will be procured through ICB. IDA
financed consultants for studies will be selected in accordance with IDA
guidelines and consultants would be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. All IDA-financed procurement would be subject to
prior review. Other procurement would be in accordance with the
guidelines of selected cofinan iers.

2.13    The proposed IDA credit would be disbursed by end-1995,
in accordance with the schedule shown at Annex 2-7. The disbursement
estimates which take into account the former East Africa Region Power
Sector Investment profile is nine months longer than the profile owing to
the nature of the retrofit project which requires units to be taken out of
service one at a time. VRA would be expected to bear any cost overruns,
including any extra costs associated with a lengthened implementation
schedule. Disbursements of the IDA credit would be fully documented,
except for expenditures of less than US$150,000 equivalent, which will be
disbursed against SOEs.
5. Environmen-al Aspects
2.14     The proposed project is not expected to have any major adverse
environmental effects. An important component of the project (172 of the
project cost) is the supply to Wa in the Upper West Region. The shortest
route to supply Wa is the extension of the 161 kV system from Daboya to Wa
(approximately 150 km).  However, the line would need to go through the
Mole National Game Reserve. Cognizant of the environmental needs of the
project and of the African Convention for Conservation of Nature and
Natural Resources Agreement, signed by Ghana in 1969, VRA has decided to
build the transmission line to Wa by circumventing the Mole game reserve
and thereby protecting it. This h:s increased the distance to be covered
by about 280 km and has, therefore, substantially idded to the cost of
this component. The transmission line extension in the north will provide
grid supply to an area presently supplied by diesel generators and would,
therefore, eliminate air and noise pollution caused by diesel generation.
The bulk supply substation in Accra will be located in a vacant parcel of
land owned by the Government, and ECG has taken steps to transfer the
title of the property to the power utility.
F. Proiect Justification Benefits and Risks
1. Justification and Economic Rate of Return
(a) Retrofitting of Akosombo Power Plant
2.15     Although the Akosombo hydro plant has been well maintained and
operated by VRA over the past 20 years, the equipment has deteriorated
over time and needs a major overhaul. It is expected that the frequency
and duration of outages due to failure of various components of the
generating units would increase if they are not retrofitted. Since the 6
generating units at the Akosombo power plant are similar, the benefit-
cost analysis is carried out in terms of a single generating unit and is
applicable to any of the 6 units. Each unit has 4 major components that
are considered for overhaul and together account for over 85Z of the cost
of retrofitting the unit. These components are: Generator, Exciter,
Turbine, and Governor. Since data on the costs and benefits are available
for each component separately, the benefit-cost analysis is carried out
for each component to show the economic viability of the proposed retrofit
project on a component by component basis, The advantage of this approach
rather than an aggregate analysis of the whole of a generating unit is



- 24 -
that if the overhaul of a particular component is not economically viable,
then it can be clearly identified.
2.16     The benefits of retrofitting a generating unit ares  (a)
improvements in efficiency of power generation; and (b) reduction in the
generating unit outages. Efficiency gains are associated only with the
overhaul of the Generator, while reduction in outages is gained by the
overhaul of each component. Overhaul of the Generator is estimated to
improve the power generation by 0.22 and is valued at the lcng run
marginal cost of generation. The benefit of the reduced outages is equal
to the cost of the load shedding that is avoided with the generating unit
in operation. If the domestic load was to be shed then the cost of
outages to the economy would be as high as several times the average
domestic tariff which would be around 10 US¢/kWh. Any cut in the power
supplies to VALCO causing interruption in the operation of the aluminum
smelter would also be very costly. However, since priority is given to
serve the domestic load and VALCO, the load that would be shed initially
is the exports. Therefore, the unit value of the avoided outage should be
at least 2.72 US¢IkWh which is thte tariff now paid by COte 4'Ivoire, and
could go as high as 4.9 US¢tkWh if outages affect sales to Togo. Assuming
the minimum existing export tariff of 2.72 US$IkWh, the IERR for the four
major components of the generating units is in the acceptable range of
19Z-48Z. Even at an export tariff as low as 2.0 US$JkWh, the proposed
retrofitting of the generating units is economically viable with the IER
in the 16S to 401 range. Details of the economic analysis are presented
in Annex 2-8.
(b) Extension of Transmission in the North
2.17     The proposed transmission line to Va in the Upper West Region
would extend the VRA's transmission line in the north, which is currently
being constructed under IDA Credit 1759-GH, to one of the last regions of
the country that is not receiving electricity from the hydro supplied
national grid. The Upper West Region has considerable agricultural
activities in groundnuts, millet, yams, cotton, and animal husbandry.
Extension of the transmission line would bring power supplies from the
national grid to the commercially and administratively important district
capitals in the region, which either do not have electricity at present or
are being supplied by inadequate and unreliable power from diesel
generation.
2.18     Based on valuing the incremental demand at the consumers'
willingness to pay of US¢14/kWh, which was estimated and used in the
economic justification for extending the national power grid to the North
under Credit 1759-GH, the IlRR for the proposed extension of the
transmission line to VA is estimated to be 122. The estimated IERR partly
reflects the higher investment cost incurred as a result of constructing
the transmission line around the Hole National Game Reserve in order to
avoid any adverse environmental impact (para 2.14). Although the IERR is
not very high, having regard to the Government's policy of electrification
of all district capitals as has been discussed under the ECG Fifth Power
Project, and the likely acceleration of economic development in the



- 25 -
region, the proposed extension of the transmlssion line is considered
justified.
2.19     The extenaion of the transmission line to Burkina Paso is well
justified with IERR of at least 282 assuming a -'nimum export tariff of
US02.72/kWh to value the additional exports. The actual tariff could be
much higher once the line is built, since Burkina Paso is a landlocked
country which depends on imported fuel for power generation. The IERR for
the transmission extension in the north comprising the extension to
Burkina raso and the Upper West is 141, which is satisfactory (Annex 2-
8). The proposed second bulk supply substation for Accra will improve the
security and reliability of VRA's delivery system and is justified.
2. Risks
2.20     There are no unusual risks associated with the proposed project.
The major risks relate to possible project delays psrticularly with regard
to the retrofitting of generating units at the Akosombo power plant, which
will require careful scheduling to ensure reliability of power supplies
during project implementation. However, VIA is a very capable institution
with strong engineering resources available. Provided timely financing is
made available, the proposed implementation timetable should be achieved.
;II. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01     The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(a) Submission of VRA's audited accounts to IDA within six months of
its fiscal year-end (para. 1.32 and para. 2.09);
(b) VRA to earn at least 8S rate of return on currently valued
average net fixed assets (para. 1.34);
(c) Limitation on VRA's long-tenm borrowings: subject to debt-
service coverage minimum 1.5 (para. 1.34);
(d) VRA to build-up and maintain in foreign exchange a debt
contingency fund against future foreign debt service and other
obligations (para. 1.35);
(e)  Level of VRA's receivables (para. 1.37);
(f) Annual review wLth IDA of VRA's capital investment program and
related financing plan (para. 1.40);
(g) Onlending arrangements for the IDA Credit (para 2.04).



- 26 -
3.02     Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit ares
(a) the signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOG and VRA
(para 2.04); and
(b) effectiveness of SIB cofinancing for the Akosombo retrofit
component (para 2.05).
3.03     On the basis of the above agreements, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA credit of US$20 million to the Republic of Ghana.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
General
1.       VRA's audited financial statements for 1988 and the approved
corporate budget for 1989 provide the basis for the financial projections.
2.       The following exchange rates were used in the preparation of the
financial projections.
Year                    Rates
1989                     280
1990                     340
1991                     372
1992                     374
1993                     376
1994                     378
1995                     380
1996                     380
3.       Future inflation rates were assumed as followst
Year                    Local        Foreiann
1989                    20.0Z           7.21
1990                    15.02           7.21
1991                    10.01           4.4Z
1992-1996                5.01           4.41
4. Income Statement
Revenue
Sales Revenues. Sales forecasts, as projected at Attachment 2,
take into account existing bulk supply contracts and reasonable domestic
demand forecasts. Sales revenues also include the additional revenue
required to achieve the agreed 8S rate of return target. The load forecast
is based on an average consumption growth rate of about 41 p.a. Revenue is
based on average and projected London Hetal Exchange aluminum prices for
VALCO, supply contracts for foreign consumers and the 1989 approved tariffs
.for ECG and local consumers. The average revenue for local consumers in
1989 has been calculated using old tariffs for the first half of the year
and the new tariffs approved and effective in July 1989 for the second half
of the year. Prices are held constant at 1989 levels for foreign consumers
and at the approved rates for local consumers from 1990 onwards.

Annex 1-8
Page 2 of 6
Operating Expenses
Salaries. Based on the 1989 budget and increased annually
thereafter by local inflation and 7.52 to cover promotions and salary
increases. Management plans to maintain a corporate regular staff level of
2,350 in 1989, which represents a staff reduction of 22 below the staff
level of 2,400 for 1988.
Materials. Based on the 1989 budget and adjusted annually for
international and domestic inflation applied to 701 and 302 of the cost
respectively, from 1990 onwards.
Transportation Costs. Based on the 1989 budget for maintenance
and operating costs and adjusted annually for international and domestic
inflation applied to 202 and 802 of the cost respectively, from 1990
onwards.
General Expenses. Expenses reflect budget provision for 1989
adjusted annually for international and domestic inflation applied to 602
and 402 of expenses respectively, from 1990 onwards. These comprise items
such as office rentals. repairs and maintenance, and other expenses not
directly related to operations such as staff welfare, education subsidies,
consulting services.
Generating Costs. With VRA taking over from ECG the distribution
of electricity in the north, it is expected that by 1990 most of the
systems will be connected to the grid. This will result in some decrease
in generating coscs because of the substitution of diesel generation by
supplies from the grid. Only the rehabilitated Tema diesel generating
station (30 MW) will remain in service until the mid-1990s when an
additional combustion turbine of 100 MW could be commissioned.
NED Deficit. See NED's financial projections (Annex 1-7, pages
4-5).
Depreciation. Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-
line basis over the expected life of the assets, at an average rate of 2-
1/42 on the average revalued gross fixed assets in operation.
Contingency. As in the 1989 budget, 52 of the total foreign
component and 102 of the total local component of operating expenses have
been budgeted to meet unforeseen expenses.
Staff Incentive Scheme. This allocation, representing 502 of
annual salary expenses, is provided in order to cover regular government
salary adjustments.
Other Income and Ezpenses
Other Income. This comprises rents, service charges and
miscellaneous receipts and has been adjusted for international and domestic
inflation.

Annex 1-8
Page 3 of 6
Fuel Costs. Projections are based on VRA's load and capacity
forecast and the assumption that the new combustion turbine would burn
residual oil from the Tema refinery at a cost of USS85/ton (1989 dollars)
and increasing at a rate of inflation of 6.7Z p.a.
Interest. See Attachment 3.
Debt Contingency Fund. Appropriations are based on the need for
VRA to maintain in foreign exchange an equivalent of one year's debt
service. The Fund is initially built up to an amount equivalent to about
US$50 million by the mid-1990s, and would then be adjusted in accordance
with the level of VRA's debt service obligations.  Appropriations have also
been made to provide for uneven fuel costs in some years arising from
hydrological variations.
Dividend. No provision has been made for payment of dividends by
YRA to the Government.
5. Balance Sheet
Assets
Fixed Assets. Fixed assets have t en revalued on the opening
balance each year, by applying local inflation rates to 20Z of total fixed
assets and foreign inflation rates to the remaining 802.
Depreciation. Accumulated depreciation has been revalued on the
opening balance each year by applying local inflation rates to 202 of total
accumulated depreciation and foreign inflation rates to the remaining 80X.
Accumulated depreciation has been reduced by expenses incurred for the
Akosombo retrofit. Retrofit expenses have been charged to depreciation
over 4 years commencing in 1990 upon completion of the rehabilitation
works.
Work in Progress. Capital investment at average exchange rates is
accumulaMed in work in progress pending commissioning after which it is
transferred to fixed assets (See Attachment 1). Expenses iacurred in
carrying out the Akosombo retrofit are accumulated in work in progress and
upon completion of the works, charged to depreciation, as indicated above.
Commissioning of assets in the Capital Expenditure Program is based on
estimates of VRA's Engineering Department.
Debt Contingency Fund Investments. These amounts represent the
investment of funds appropriated from net income for building up and
maintaining the debt contingency fund.
Cash. VRA's normal daily cash requirements amount to about 15-20
days cash operating expenses; however, the projected cash account includes
surplus cash. While no short temn investments have been projected, surplus
cash could be invested in short-term instruments.

Annex 1-8
Page 4 of 6
Inventories. These have been estimated annually at 0.4t of gross
fixed assets in operation.
Receivables. These have been estimated as 1 month's billing.
Equity and Liabilities
Revaluation Reserve. VRA's revaluation reserve is consistent with
generally acceptable accounting principles in Ghana. This account reflects
net surplus on revaluation of fixed assets and depreciation and takes into
account lossesigains arising from the valuation of foreign exchange loans.
Grant. The following items in the capital expenditure program are
expected to be funded by grants: rehabilitation of the Tema Diesel Plant
including preliminary works (ODA), studies financed by CIDA ar  financing
for the proposed training center.
Long-term Debt. Details are in Attachment 3.
Accounts Payable. These h&ve been estimated as 8.3Z of annual
cash operating expenses plus 52 of capital expenditure.  Accounts payable
also include accruals for the staff incentive scheme and for contingencies.
Loan Interest was estimated at 3 months' annual interest.
6.  Funds Flow Statement
Working Capital Changes. Relate to movement in inventories (0.4Z
GFA), debtors (1 month billings), creditors (1 month's cash operating
expenses, 52 of year's capital expenditure program for construction), and
accrued interest (3 months annual interest).
Debt Service. Calculations are given in detail in Attachment 3.
Debt Contingency Fund. These amounts relate to the investment of
funds appropriated from income for building up the debt contingency fund.
Other Payments. These represent payments for fuel costs incurred
in some years (previously provided for through appropriations of income to
the debt contingency fund).
Capital Inveszment. Details of the Capital Expenditure Program
are given in Annex 1-4, and of interest during construction in Attachment
3.

Income Statement
Revenues
Energy Sales. Forecasted sales are based on VRA's 1989 budget and
take into account reasonable domestic demand forecasts.
Losses. Distribution losses are expected to gradually decrease
from 20? in 1989 to 10? in the next 4 yeart, and are held constant at 10l
from 1994 onwards.
Eneray Revenues. Revenue is based on a constant tariff rate of 8
Cedis for NED's customers.
Other Revenue. To cover revenues from service connections. sale
of equipment, etc. calculations were based on VRA's 1989 budget and
adjusted for local inflation for the outer years.
Oneratint Expenses
Salaries. Based on 1989 budget for 463 employees and increased by
7.5? to cover promotions and normal staffing increases and by local
inflation thereafter.
Materials. Projected at 0.15? of gross plant and escalated by
foreign inflation thereafter.

VOLTA RIM  AUTORITY
SIXTH POWR PROJECT
D ILD PROECT DESCRIPTION
GENERAL
1.        The Volta River Authority (VRA) was established under the Volta
River Development Act, 1961, of Ghana. The primary functions of VRA
include the generation of electric power, first by the development of the
hydroelectric potential of the Volta River and the construction and
operation of a transmission system for the supply of electric energy for
industrial, commercial and domestic use. VRA is also responsible for the
development of the Volta Lake.
2.        VRA's first hydroelectric plant at Akosombo has six generating
units. Four of the units, with a total installed capacity of 588 MW,
including a 152 overload capacity, were completed in 1965, and the
additional two with capacity of 324MW, including a 152 overload capacity,
were completed in 1972.
3.        The second hydroelectric plant at Kpong was completed in 1981
with four units of 37 MV each and a total addition of 148 MW to VRA
generating capacity. This plant is located downstream from Akosombo, has a
limited storage capacity and is operated in close coordination with the
Akosombo plant.
A - AKOSOMBO GENERATING STATION RETROFIT PROJECT
4.        Over the years, various investigations and studies have been
carried out by VRA to ensure efficient and profitable operation of its
power system. After 25 years of successful operation of Akosombo
generating station, VRA is now looking ahead to the next 25 years of
trouble-free, reliable and economic operation. In order to achieve these
objectives, VRA retained Acres International Limited of Canada in June 1988
to carry out the Akosombo Rehabilitation Study and to recommend a
comprehensive implementation program to modernize, upgrade, and improve the
performance, reliability, maintenance and operation of the plant. The
study has a very wide and open scope to ensure that all possible avenues of
improvement are covered. Other studies have also been carried out by the
original manufacturer of the various parts in the plant as followss
(a)  Investigations by EPDCI/Hitachi.  EPDC International Limited
(EPDCI) of Japan performed site inspection and investigation for
planning of renovation, overhaul, and/or modernization of the
turbines and associated auxiliary equipment of the Akosombo
power plant during March/April 1988.  Their detailed
investigation and recommendations are contained in a report

Annex 2-1
Page 2 of 6
entitled 'Field Inspection & Investigation, Final Report of
Units 1 to 6 Water Turbine' dated June 1988. EPDCI
investigations indicated that the turbine runners could be
replaced by vew runners or they could be retrofitted. The
economic advantage of replacing the runners was very marginal.
(b)  G.E. Canada.  Canadian General Electric Company Limited (now GE-
Canada) carried out inspection of Units 1 - 4 generators during
January 1988. Its findings and recommendations are covered in
'Inspection Report for Volta River Authority' for Akosombo
hydroelectric generators. GE-Canada has also submitted a
separate proposal to VRA with various options for the rewinding
of generators.

B - TRASSMISSION SYSTEM EXPANSION
The transmission system expansion includess
(a) Supply to Wa
This component includes the extension of the 161 KV line of
Tamale - Larabanga to Sawla and Wa, and the construction of a
llne from Bolgatanga to Navrango, Tumu, Hau and Va. These lines
will be insulated for 161 KV but will operate at 34 5 RV. The
Va load (estimated at 1500 KW by 1992) will be subdivided in two
equal parts at the receiving busbar of each of the above lines.
The original plan to supply Wa was to extend the 161 KV line
from Daboya to Wa (approximately 150 km). However, in order not
to cross the Mole National Game Reserve, VRA has-decided to go
around it and thereby comply with the international agreement in
this regard (The African Convention for Conservation of Nature
and Natural Resources, signed by Ghana in 1969). The total
distance of lines needed to be built is 156 km from Larabanga to



- 52 -
Annex 2-1
Page 5 of 6
Wa and 272 km from Bolgatanga to Wa or about three times the
distance of the shortest route. The existing synchronous
generators at Wa diesel station will be decoupled from the
diesel engine and connected as synchronous condenser to each of
the busbars. Load flow studies showed acceptable steady-state
operation of the lines as described above. The total distance
of lines needed to be built are 156 km from Larabanga to Wa and
272 km from Bolgatanga to Va.
(b) SuDply to Burkina
A prefeasibility study carried out by Coyne et Belier (France)
has shown the interest in exporting power from Ghana
hydroelectric system to Burkina, now that the 161 KV grid will
soon be extended to Bolgatanga. The African Development Bank
(AfDB) is financing a detailed feasibility and design study for
this interconnection. The study is being carried out by
Tractebel (Belgium) and the report is expected in Spring 1990.
A meeting was held in Bolgatanga on September 6, 1989 between
the management of VRA and Sonabel (the electric utility in
Burkina) and agreement has been reached in principle for the
construction of this interconnection. Each utility will be
responsible for building the portion in its own territory.
(c) Bulk suDily substation in Accra
In order to improve reliability of supply to Accra, ECG and VRA
agreed to construct a second bulk supply substation 161134.5 RV
in Accra. The substation will be located in the North West
section on the outskirts of Accra. ECG has identified the site
which is a vacant government owned property and proceeding for
its legal acquisition. The site is located near the 161 KV
supply circuit that supplies Takoradi and the West.
C - DISTRIBUTION NED
The project provides for NED capital requirements to extend the
distribution networks to supply new loads in the regional capitals as well
as other electrified cities. The project provides also for establishing
distribution networks in all district capitals. The total number of new
customers that would be added to NED system by end of 1984 is estimated at
30,000 new customers or about 300,000 additional persons will have access
to electricity.
D - STUDIES
The project covers the following studies:
(a) a tariff studys
(b) prefeasibility for next hydro-electric plant

VOLTA RIVER AUTHORITY
SIXTH POlWER PROJECT
Economic Analysis
Backaround
1.       The main features of Akosombo reservoir hydrology and energy
supply allocation principles that govern the VRA's generation operations
and affect the economics of the proposed project are highlighted below
before proceeding with presentation of the benefit - cost analysis.
2.       Reservoir Capacity and Water Tnflows.  The Akosombo reservoir has
a fairly large storage capacity. It could hold enough water to generate
over 12,000 GVh of electricity at the Akosombo and Rpong generating
stations which is about 2.5 times the present demand including the VALCO
load. However, there is a wide fluctuation in annual water inflows. The
highest recorded annual inflow is 3049 cubic meter per second which is more
than 10 times the lowest recorded annual inflow of 288 cubic meter per
second. In addition to the high variability from year to year, the
recorded flows on the Volta River demonstrates that it is common to have
prolonged wet and dry periods lasting over a decade. On the average, the
potential energy available from Akosombo and Rpong hydro plants is
estimated to be about 6000 G/hlyear.  However, as a result of the
hydrologic variability, simulations of the operations of these plants
reveal that the energy yield varies by at least 202 from the average during
prolonged wet and dry periods. The economics of VIA's power generation
operations and expansion plan is greatly influenced by the large size of
the reservoir and potential generation relative to the existing load, as
well as by the periodic variation in the water inflows.
3.       Energy Suunlv Allocation Principles.  Since the availability of
energy on the VRA grid varies from year to year depending on the
hydrological conditions, VRA has developed a system of priority rules to
allocate available energy amongst the competing demands. There are three
categories of demands (a) dodestic demand consisting of ECG, NED, mines,
etc.; (b) VALCO; and (c) exports to the neighboring countries. Domestic
demand is given priority and is tgeated as firm demand which must be met in
full with a 982 probability (i.e. 49 years out of 50). The supply to VALCO
depends on how much energy is generated by the hioosombo plant and is
determined according to an allocation Oormula embeded in the VALCO - VRIA
contract.
4.       Decision on how much energy will be generated at Akosombo is made
based on hydrological conditions each year at the end of the rainy season
in November and is repeated at quarterly intervals throughout the following
year if the reservoir's water level differs from the estimation. If the
total energy generated at Akosombo plus Kpong (201 of generation at

Akosombo) ezceeds the domestic demand plus VALCO's allocation, then the
surplus is available for export.
Retrofittina of the Akosombo Power Plant.
5.       Introduction.  Although the Akosombo power plant has been well
maintained and operated by VRA over the past 20 years, the equipment has
deteriorated over time and needs a major overhaul. It is expected that the
frequency and duration of outages due to failure of various components of
the generating units would increase if they are not retrofitted soon.
Since the 6 generating units at Akosombo power plant are similar, the
benefit - cost analysis is carried out in terms of a single generating unit
and is applicable to any of the 6 units. Each unit has 4 major components
that are considered for overhaul and together account for over 851 of the
cost of retrofitting the unit. These components ares Generator, Exciter,
Turbine, and Governor. Since data on the costs and benefits are available
for each component separately, the benefit - cost analysis is carried out
for each component to show the economic viability of the proposed retrofit
project on a component by component basis. The advantage of this approach
rather than an aggregate analysis of the whole of a generating unit is that
if overhaul of a particular component is not economically viable, then it
can be clearly identified.
6.       Costs.  The estimated cost of retrofitting a generating unit that
is used in the analysis is broken down by the 4 major components as
follows.
Component                      Cost (USS 000)
Generator                        3,849
Exciter                            388
Turbine                          3,567
Governor                           470
Total                     8,274
These costs, which include spare parts as well as engineering and
supervision costs, plus a 10 physical contingency are taken as investment
in 1990 which would provide benefits over the life of the retrofitted unit              [
estimated to be at least 20 years.
7.       Benefits.  The benefits of retrofitting a generating unit ares
(a) improvements in efficiency of power generation; and (b) reduction in
the generating unit outages. Efficiency gains are associated only with the
overhaul of the Generator, while reduction in outage rate is gained by the
overhaul of each component. Overhaul of the Generator is estimated by the
VRA consultants to improve the power generation by 0.22 at an average
generation of 730 GWhlyear. The efficiency gain in power generation is
valued at the long run marginal cost of generation (3.7 US¢/kwh) for
inclusion in the benefits stream of the analysio.

ANNEX 2-8
Page 3 of 8
8.       The energy that is not generated because of outage of a generating
unit is 157.7 GVhlyear, based on the VRA consultants estimate that with one
unit (150 MV) outage, 12? of the energy that can be produced by the unit
would be lost from the top end of the VRA unit stacking diagram ( 1S0 MV *
8760 h * 0.12 - 157.7 Glh). At present the expected outage (i.e. the
energy not generated) for a unit due to failure of a component, based on
the probability of failure of that component during the year. is estimated
to be: 10.2 GWhlyear for Generator; 5.0 GWh/year for Exciter; 4.6 GWhlyear
for Turbine; and 2.8 GWH/year for Governor. Overhauling the components is
estimated to reduce the probability of their failure by 902. This implies
that the expected outage in GWh/year for each component will be reduced by
901. The physical condition of the generating units has deteriorated
overtime and should deteriorate even faster in the future if not
overhauled. Therefore, if a unit is not retrofitted the probability of
failure by each component will increase exponentially over time at a rate
which is conservatively assumed to be 202 for the Generator, Exciter, and
Governor. This implies, for examle, the Generator will reach a 25Z
probability of failure (i.e. 3 months of the >ear) in 8 years time with the
estimated probability of failure of 5.82 at present. As for Turbine it is
assumed that without the overhaul a complete breakdown will occur in 10
years with the probability of failure remaining constant in the meantime.
Again this is also a very conservative assumption and these components
would fail sooner if the generating unit is not overhauled.
9.       Tha value of the outage that is avolded through the retrofit
project is equal to the cost of the load shedding caused by the failure of
the generating unit. If domestic load was to be shed then the cost of
outages to the economy would be as high as several times the average
domestic tariff which would be around 10 US#Ikwh. Any cut in the power
supplies to VALCO causing interruption in the operation of the aluminum
smelter would also be very costly. However, since the priority is given to
serve the domestic load and VALCO, the load that would be shed initially is
the exports and its value is the unit price paid by Ghana's neighbors.
Therefore, the unit value of the avolded outage should be at least 2.72
US/kfth which is the tariff now paid by Ivory Cost. This could go as high
as 4.9 US$Ikwh if outages affect sales to togo which could happen lf two or
more units fail simultaneously.
10.      Economic Rate of Return. The benefit-cost analysis presented in
the attached tables indicate that the IERR for the four major components of
the generating units is in the 19Z-48S range assuming the minimum existing
export tariff of 2.72 US$/kwh as shown below.

The IERR would be higher, ranging from 252 to 72Z, if outages were to
affect export. to Togo at the tariff rate of 4.9 US¢Ikwh. The proposed
retrofitting of the generating units is economically viable, with the IERR
in the 16Z to 40Z range, even at an export tariff as low as 2 US¢Ikwh which
is substantially below operating cost of thermal generation in any of the
neighboring countries.
Extension of the Transmission Line
11.      Transmission Line to Wa.  The proposed transmission line to Wa in
the Upper West Region would estend the VRA's transmission line in the
north, which currently is being constructed under the IDA Credit 1759, to
one of the last regions of the country that is not receiving electricity
from the hydro supplied national grid. The region has considerable amount
of agricultural activities in sheanuts, groundauts, millet, yams, cotton,
and animal husbandry. Extension of the transmission line would bring power
supplies from the national grid to the commercially and administrating
important district capitals in the region which either do not have
electricity at present or are being supplied by inadequate and unreliable
power from diesel generation. The capital cost of the proposed
transmission line is US$20 million spread over 4 years starting in 1990,
and includes additional cost incurred by constructing the line around the
Hole National Game Reserve in order to avoid any adverse environmental
impact. Also included in the cost stream of the analysis is the Operation
and Maintenance Cost (O&M) assumed at 11 of the cumulative capital
investment cost.
12.      The demand for electricity is estimated at 15 GWh/year at present
and it is forecasted to grow at 8 per year in the first 4 years after
completion of the project and at 61 thereafter for 6 years. The
incremental demand served which is the difference between the demand served
'with3 and *without" project would be the same as the forecasted demand
since without the project there would be no supplies from the grid. To
estimate the benefits, the incremental demand is valued at the consumer's
willingness to pay for electricity of 14 USCtkWh. The growth rate of
demand and the value of consumers willingness to pay used here have been
estimated and used for economic justification of extending the national
grid to the north under the IDA Credit 1759.1/ The IERR for the proposed
extension of the transmission line to Va is estimated at 12?. The IERR is
reduced to 11 if the growth rate of demand is 20X less than the projected
rate. Although the TERR is not very high, having regard to the
Government's policy of electrication of all district capitals as has been
discussed under the EC6 Fifth Power Project, and the likely acceleration of
nconomic development in the region, the proposed extension of the grid is
c-onsidered justified.
13.      Transmission Line to Burkina Paso.  The proposed extension of
VRI's transmission line to Burkina Faso would enable VRA to export
1/    See Ghana - Northern Grid Extension Project, Staff Appraisal Report,
January 8, 1987 (Annex 2).

electricity and earn substantial foreign exchange revenues witb a
relatively small capital lnvestment of US$2 million. Burkina Faso is a
land-locked country dependent upon expensive imported fuel for its power
generation. However, to take advantage of the relatively cheap hydro-
electricity from Ghana, Burkina Faso has to incur additional investment in
transmission lines to its border with Ghana in order to link up with the
extended VRA transmission system. Therefore, the export tariff to Burkina
Faso is conservatively assumed at 2.72 USCIKWH. This is the tariff
currently paid by Cote d' Ivoire and it is less than one-half of the cost
of the fuel for power generation in Burkina Faso. Taking the projected
exports to Burkina Faso in Annex 1-3 (which indicate an average demand of
41 GWhlyear for the next 10 years), and valuing them at the export tariff
of 2.72 USCIKWh produces an extremely attractive IERR of 53Z. The lowest
projected demand by Burkina Faso is 24 GWh in 1995, and with conservatively
taking the averr.ge export at this level, the IERR is reduced to 28Z which
is still very attractive. Combining the benefit-cost analysis of extending
the transmission line to Burkina Faso and Wa produces an IERR of 14X for
the transmission extension component of the project.
