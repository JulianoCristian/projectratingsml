{"cdata!": "The outcome of the Second Education\n            Project for Guinea was satisfactory. The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, sustainability is likely with\n            adequate operating budgets, and the performance of both the\n            Bank and Borrower was satisfactory. Two main lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, projects should be\n            designed to fit local situations. Also, if there is no sense\n            of \"ownership\" at the local level, there can\n            really be no commitment and project objectives cannot be\n            sustained. Second, IDA does not appear to have assured that\n            effective mechanisms to monitor project activities and\n            safeguard against the risks inherent in the complexity and\n            diversity of project objectives were put in place. This\n            situation emphasizes the problem of matching the resources\n            needed for adequate implementation to the needs of the\n            project, including staffing continuity and adequate\n            specialization. This can be resolved by either the IDA\n            providing adequate resources or assuring that borrowers\n            engage sufficient specialist advice within the project."}, "docdt": "1991-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
