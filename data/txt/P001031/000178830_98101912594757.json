Second\n            Education Project will be to continue Bank Group support of\n            Government's education strategy through: (a) increased\n            training of skilled workers by improvement and expansion of\n            three vocational training schools and strengthening of the\n            technical instructor training institute; (b) improvement of\n            the Government's capacity for education and human\n            resources planning by reorganization and strengthening of\n            the responsible units; and (c) upgrading the quality of\n            primary education by strengthening and expansion of the\n            national pedagogical institute, the education print shop,\n            and two primary teacher training colleges. The project is\n            expected to allow various benefits to the Guinean economy.\n            In the short term, improved training of skilled workers\n            would lead to increased productivity in the industrial\n            sectors. Medium-term benefits would include: further\n            development of the national education system, definition of\n            qualitative and quantitative education targets, reallocation\n            of resources available to the education sector to assure\n            their optimum use, and revision of existing policies\n            regarding employment guarantees for vocational training and\n            university graduates."}, "docdt": "1983-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
