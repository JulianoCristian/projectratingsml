WEST AFRICA REGIONAL TRANSPORT AND TRANSIT FACILITATION PROJECT

                                   GHANA COMPONENT

   I-      Project background

1.      The project supports the objectives of Road Program I (RP-I), which covers the Tema –
Ouagadougou – Bamako road corridor (the Corridor), and is part of the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU)/Ghana’s PACITR (Community Action Plan for Road
Infrastructure and Transport, Programme d’Action Communautaire des Infrastructures et du
Transport Routier). The objectives of the RP-I program are to facilitate transport and transit on
the Corridor to boost internal and external regional trade and support sustainable economic
growth of the concerned countries, a recognized vector of poverty reduction. More specifically,
the project supports the following three major project components to be implemented in the three
countries that are along the Corridor.

    Corridor road infrastructure improvement. This component is expected to improve key
     sections of the road Corridor to carry inter- and intra-country traffic by: (a) rehabilitating
     and strengthening key road sections; (b) constructing rest stop areas; (c) implementing
     social and environmental mitigation measures for the civil works; (d) implementing a
     Corridor specific Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency
     Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) action plan; and (e) designing and implementing a Corridor
     specific physical road safety action plan.

    Corridor transport and transit facilitation measures. This component is expected to
     strengthen the capacity of customs and transport authorities to better manage the
     movement of transit traffic along the Corridor by: (a) constructing a Satellite Transit
     Truck Village (STTV) adjacent to the Port of Tema; (b) rehabilitating and equipping the
     Faladie, Bamako multifunctional platform; (c) supporting the upgrading of customs
     related Information Communication Technology (ICT) and extension of cargo tracking
     system to better monitor and secure transit traffic; and (d) providing logistical, capacity
     building and Technical Assistance support to improve the effectiveness of customs and
     transport authorities to monitor and control transit traffic.

    Project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component is expected to fund
     the management, monitoring and evaluation of project implementation activities in
     Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali.

2.      The project, which includes Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali, was approved by the World
Bank Board on June 19, 2008. Currently, the Project Development Objective (PDO) for the
project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory (MS) due to slower than expected implementation of
the transport and transit facilitation measures on the Corridor; slow implementation of the civil



                                                1
works components in Ghana and Mali; and political turmoil in Mali which has negatively
affected the implementation of all project activities in that country.

   II-     Performance of Ghana Component of the Project

3.     The Ghana component of the project became effective on October 2, 2008, and current
disbursements have reached US$25.7 million leaving an undisbursed balance of about US$54.3
million out of an original credit amount of US$80 million. About 80 percent of the Credit
proceeds are contractually committed.

4.       The Implementation Performance (IP) rating for the Ghana component of the project is
rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) primarily due to the slow implementation of all of the
civil works activities (rehabilitation of the Buipe – Tamale road; construction of a STTV parking
facility near the Port of Tema; and construction of four rest stop areas/intervening stations along
the Ghana portion of the Corridor) supported under the project. An action plan was put updated
in June 2012, to improve the implementation of the civil works component of the project. Before
the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013, an assessment of project will be conducted to
see if the IP rating for the Ghana component of the project can be upgraded from “MU” to “MS”.

   III-    Rationale for reallocation of Credit proceeds and increase of financing
           parameters

5.      The Government of Ghana (GoG) submitted on November 21, 2012 a request to
reallocate and increase the financing parameters for the Ghana component (Cr. 4439-GH).
(Additional information to complete the request was submitted electronically on January 31,
2013.) The proposed reallocation of Credit proceeds is necessary for the following reasons:

    First, to prevent the continued substantial delays in the release of counterpart funds from
     GoG by increasing the financing parameters from 92.5 percent to 100 percent for the civil
     works components (Categories 1, 3, and 5 of the Financing Agreement). The delays in
     the release of counterpart funding, is expected to be a recurring issue and it is caused
     primarily by GOG’s over programming of road works contracts and slow release of
     funding to the road sector line ministry. Furthermore, the increase in the financing
     parameters for the Ghana component of the West Africa Transport and Transit
     Facilitation Project was tentatively agreed during the Mid-Term Review implementation
     mission that was fielded in December 2011 and was confirmed during the 2012 Country
     Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) exercises. Finally, thanks to projected project
     savings due to lower than expected road works costs, the increase in the financing
     parameters will not affect the implementation of any of the remaining project component.

    Secondly, to re-allocate the Credit proceeds from Categories 8 and 2 to Categories 1, 4, 5
     and 6 to fund additional costs for the civil works activities of the Ghana component of the
     project.

6.    Based on the information received from GoG, the proceeds for Ghana component (Cr.
4439-GH) will be reallocated as indicated in table 1.
