                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. The implementation of the project continues to make steady progress, and it is expected to substantially meet its objectives by the revised project closing date of June 30, 2015.
                         What follows is a brief update on implementation progress of key activities:

                         2. Civil works. The implementation of the road works funded under the project is either fully completed (Ouagadougou - Sakoinse road section in Burkina Faso and Buipe - Tamale
                         road section in Ghana) or substantially completed (Sikasso - Heremakono road section in Mali). The civil works to modernize the dry port at Faladie (Bamako) have been fully

                         completed and the facility is expected to be fully operational by end-2014. However, the construction of the remaining three rest stops/intervening stations (2 in Ghana and 1 in Mali)
                         along the Road Program I (RP-I) Corridor are behind schedule, and are not expected to be completed until the 1st quarter of calendar 2015. Furthermore, the construction of the
                         Satellite Transit Trucking Village (STTV) at Aishaman near the Port of Tema has yet to commence, and may not be completed before the end of the project.

                         3. Facilitation activities. Over the past 7 months, the three countries’ customs services have met through VC in February, March, May and July 2014 and have also met in
                         Ouagadougou in February and in Bamako from May/June 2014, to push forward the remaining facilitation activities (interconnection of customs management systems) funded under
                         the project. These regular meetings have allowed the testing on a small pilot basis the interconnection/interface to integrate the customs management systems of Ghana, Burkina
                         Faso and Mali and helped address legal and technical issues. The Governments of the 3 countries plan to sign a join Agreement and a Manual of Procedures by end-August 25,
                         2014, to enable the operationalization of the interface/interconnection of the customs management systems along the RP by the 1st quarter of calendar 2015.

                         4. Lastly, as of mid-August 2014, project disbursements had reached about US$160.4 million. Projected project disbursements for World Bank FY15 will be about US$20 million.
