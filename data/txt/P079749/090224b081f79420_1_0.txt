                         Implementation Status Overview
                          The improved project implementation observed in the previous Implementation Status Report (ISR) of May 2013 has been confirmed by the latest implementation review mission,
                         conducted in May-June 2013 in Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana. More specifically:

                         (a) The implementation of all project funded activities has fully resumed in Mali;
                         (b) the Sikasso – Heremakono road rehabilitation works in Mali have started on the ground;

                         (c) the Ouagadougou - Sakoinse road reconstruction works in Burkina Faso have been completed;
                         (d) the implementation pace of the Buipe – Tamale road rehabilitation works in Ghana has improved substantially;
                         (e) the bulk of the country specific facilitation activities have been completed;
                         (f) progress has been made over the last six months to implement some of the key regional transit facilitation activities such as the interface/interconnection of the customs

                         management systems between the three countries; and
                         (g) project disbursements have improved substantially in World Bank FY13.

                         Thus, the implementation performance (IP) rating for the project was confirmed as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ ('MS'). However, taking into account that the project is expected to close
                         on March 31, 2013, the next six months will be critical to ensure the completion or substantial advance of the balance of activities under the project.

                         Furthermore, a determination will need to be countries involved in the project to determine whether or not they will request and extension to the project closing date.

                         Finally, as of early-September 2013, disbursements had reached about US$124 million against a Project Appraisal Document (PAD) target of approximately US$182 million. For the
                         current World Bank fiscal year (FY14) projected revised disbursement target is around US$57 million.
