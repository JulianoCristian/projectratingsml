                         The project is expected to support the implementation of the first phase the WAEMU/Ghana’s Road Program I (RP-I) program. This program is intended to facilitate
                         transport and transit on the Tema -- Ouagadougou -- Bamako corridor as a pilot for other priority corridors.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation has improved substantially over the last 6 months primarily due to the: (a) full resumption of all project activities in Mali, including start of Sikasso -
                         Heremakono road rehabilitation works; (b) improved performance of the civil works component in Ghana; (c) substantial completion of the civil works component in Burkina Faso; and
                         (d) renewed progress being made in implementing the interconnection/interface of customs management systems between Ghana - Burkina Faso - Mali. In light of the improved
                         project performance over the last six month it was decided to upgrade the implementation performance rating of the project from 'Moderately Unsatisfactory' to 'Moderately
                         Satisfactory'. Going forward the involved Governments and World Bank Project Team will focus the supervision effort to ensure that by the project closing date, the remaining project
