development outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            difficulties experienced in the implementation of certain\n            project activities are primarily those of a regional nature.\n            The implementation of an activity involving a number of\n            countries requires a special approach and a lot longer\n            because dependent on the political will; the project\n            promoted dialogue between different stakeholders involved in\n            the project, which is the basis for the improvement of\n            social and functional relationships between them. For\n            example customs and freight forwarders, carriers and truck\n            drivers recognized that the project was an opportunity for\n            rapprochement between them; the humps, which were introduced\n            as part of the project to ensure road safety in the\n            Ouaga-Sakoins\u00e9 section, have reduced the number of deaths on\n            the stretch; and the improvement of customs procedures and\n            documentary processing at the Tema port and border crossing\n            ports through training and equipment supply has improved\n            customs and port operations to some extent with regards to\n            reduced delays. This has facilitated intra-regional trade\n            and contributed towards increased Trade within the\n            sub-region as benefits of increased trading are already\n            being gained. This has created an environment for a more\n            competitive and efficient private sector development through\n            trade and other economic ventures."}, "docdt": "2015-12-31T21:48:00Z"}
