Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project is expected to support the implementation of the first phase the WAEMU/Ghana’s Road Program I (RP-I) program. This program is
 intended to facilitate transport and transit on the Tema -- Ouagadougou -- Bamako corridor as a pilot for other priority corridors.

 1. The project will close on June 30, 2015, and it is expected to substantially meet its development objectives. Implementaion of the remaining project
 activities has been broadly satisfactory, and what follows, is an update on project implementation:

 2. Civil works. The implementation of the road works (Ouagadougou - Sakoinse road section in Burkina Faso; Buipe - Tamale road section in Ghana;
 and Sikasso - Heremakono road section in Mali) have been fully completed. The civil works to modernize the dry port at Faladie (Bamako) have been
 fully completed, and the facility is now fully operational serving the RP-I Corridor transit traffic. The construction of the 2 rest stops (Sabou and Pa) in
 Burkina Faso has been fully completed long back, while the construction of the 1 rest stop in Mali (Koumantou) has been substantially completed.
 However, although the construction works started in August 2014, the construction of the two intervening stations/rest stops in Ghana (Savelugu and
 Sakamkrom) is behind schedule, and there is a risk that they will not be completed before end-June 2015. Furthermore, the construction of a Satelite
 Transit Trucking Village (STTV) at Aishaman near the Port of Tema was shelved by GPHA due to financial constraints. As a result of this decision, it
 was decided to improve the existing transit yard adjacent to the Port of Tema. The civil works are expected to commence shortly and to be substantially
 completed by June 2015.

 3. Facilitation activities. Over the past year, the custom services from Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali have worked very closely to finalize the remaining
 facilitation activities (interconnection of customs management systems on the RP-I Corridor from Tema to Ouagadougou - Bamako) funded under the
 project. These regular meetings have allowed the testing on a pilot basis the interconnection/interface to integrate the customs management systems of
 Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali and helped address legal and technical issues. Based on the latest round of discussion, it is now planned the
 interconnection/interface of the customs management systems of Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali should become partly operational by June 2015.
 Furthermore, the Gvoernment of Burkina Faso has selected service provider to provide cargo tracking services on its portion of the RP-I Corridor. Mali
 is still in the process of testing its cargo tracking system on its section of the RP-I Corridor.

 4. Finally, as of end-March 2015, cumulative project disbursements had reached about SDR116.7 million, giving an agregated disbursement ratio of
 about 95.4%. Based on current projections, it is expected that cumulative disbursements should reach about 99% by end-June 2015.
