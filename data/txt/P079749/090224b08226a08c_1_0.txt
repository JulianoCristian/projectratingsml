                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project is expected to support the implementation of the first phase the WAEMU/Ghana’s Road Program I (RP-I) program. This program is intended to facilitate
                         transport and transit on the Tema -- Ouagadougou -- Bamako corridor as a pilot for other priority corridors.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Based on the findings of the November/December 2013 full implementation review mission, implementation of the project continues to make steady progress towards the
                         achievement of its objectives. More specifically:

                         - The implementation of all project funded activities has fully resumed in Mali and is making good progress;
                         - the implementation of the Sikasso – Heremakono road rehabilitation/reconstruction works contract in Mali is making good progress and should be substantially completed by

                         August 2014;
                         - the Ouagadougou - Sakoinse road reconstruction works contract in Burkina Faso has been completed since April 2013;
                         - implementation of the Buipe - Tamale road rehabilitation/reconstruction road works contract is expected to be fully completed by February 2014;
                         - the bulk of the country specific facilitation activities have long been completed;

                         - construction of the intervening stations/rest stop areas in Ghana and rest stop in Mali should commence before the end of the 1st quarter 2014;
                         - construction of the Satellite Transit Trucking Village (STTV) in Ghana should commence before the end of the 1st quarter of 2014; and
                         - project disbursements remain strong.

                         However, implementation of some of the key key regional transit facilitation activities, such as the interface/interconnection of customs management systems between Ghana -
                         Burkina Faso - Mali, is proceeding more slowly than what was expected in June 2013.

                         That is why the implementation performance (IP) rating for the project remains as ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ ('MS').

                         Lastly, as of mid-January 2014, disbursements had reached about US$140 million against a Project Appraisal Document (PAD). For the current World Bank fiscal year (FY14)
                         projected revised disbursement target is around US$46 million.
