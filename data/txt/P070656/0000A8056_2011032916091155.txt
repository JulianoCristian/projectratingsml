                           The Ministry of Forestry (MINFOF) have completed 5 out of 6 triggers for the US$12M 2nd tranche release (anticipated since December 2008). But completion of the last of six
                         triggers is delayed due to limited progress by the Recipient to 'sign final concession agreements for all 65 FMUs (Forest Management Units - UFA in french) awarded before January
                         2002 with companies having fulfilled their obligations and take appropriate measures against companies in violation of their obligations (including, as the case may be, the termination
                         of the concession), all as evidenced by copies of the signed final concession agreements and relevant notifications to companies'.

                         The government has also been asked to transmit, by the end of March at the latest, an action plan to the Bank for achieving the triggers needed for 3rd tranche release by late
                         October 2011.
