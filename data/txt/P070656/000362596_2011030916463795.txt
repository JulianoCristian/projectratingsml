2. 
We are pleased to acknowledge, on behalf of the Bank, the intention of the Donor to 
make a supplemental contribution to the Trust Fund in the amount of eight hundred eleven 
thousand and one hundred and two United States Dollars ($811,102) (the “Supplemental 
Contribution”).  With this Supplemental Contribution, the total amount allocated by the Donor to 
this Trust Fund will be now aggregate to £637,500 and $811,102

The Donor shall deposit the Supplemental Contribution into such bank account

Additionally, pursuant to recent discussions between the Bank and the Donor, the Bank 
proposes to amend paragraph 11.1 of the Memorandum of Understanding to extend the closing

“11.1. It is expected that the Contribution funds will be fully dispersed by the Bank in 
accordance with the provisions of this Memorandum by September 30, 2012.  The Bank 
will only disburse Contribution funds for the purposes of this Memorandum after such 
date with the written approval of DFID.”

All other provisions of the Memorandum will remain in force.
