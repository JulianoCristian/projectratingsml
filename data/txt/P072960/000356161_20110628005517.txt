7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
The project development objective is to reform and modernize the Russian Customs administration, with a
view to: (a) promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of international trade flows by
Customs, so as to further integrate the country into the world trading community, improve the investment
climate and secure the benefits from foreign and domestic investments in the economy; and (b) increase
taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its application, to support macro-
economic stability and increase transparency, timely transfer of collected revenues to the Federal budget,
and equity and predictability in customs operations. The project would promote internationally acceptable
practices for processing of international trade flows by Customs by: (a) adopting Customs standards that
facilitate trade through the implementation of procedures to expedite the processing of low-risk
transactions while improving the detection and prevention of contraband; (b) facilitating international
commerce and accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization (WTO); (c) fostering
a stronger partnership between Customs and participants of foreign economic activities; (d) transforming
the mindset of SCC officers towards the trade activity from one of protection of the domestic economy to
one of facilitating legitimate international commerce; (e) implementing improved business processes and
automated systems designed to increase efficiency and reduce discretion and opportunities for rent seeking
behavior; and (f) modernizing the Information Technology infrastructure of the SCC, and adopting
standardized, highly automated operational procedures, including electronic filing of declarations, which
would reduce the level of discretion by customs officers, and e-Government facilities for information and
interaction with the trade community. The project would increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs
Code and ensure uniformity in its application by: (a) adopting standardized and automated procedures
countrywide to facilitate voluntary compliance and reduce compliance costs; (b) improving the knowledge
and training of participants in foreign economic activities about the customs laws and procedures; (c)
improving transparency, uniformity and predictability of Customs actions; (d) implementing efficient
dispute resolution procedures; (e) improving enforcement capacity against smugglers and tax evaders
through improved risk management, intelligence, investigation, improving efficiency of inspection

activities, including post-release audit of goods and vehicles; (f) further developing the organization of the
SCC and its management systems to increase overall organizational effectiveness; (g) enhancing
professional integrity and skills of SCC officers; and (h) improving the conditions for countrywide training
and retraining of SCC officers.
