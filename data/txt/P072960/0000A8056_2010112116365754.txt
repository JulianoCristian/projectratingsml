                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to reform and modernize the Russian Customs administration, with a view to: (a) promote internationally acceptable
                         practices for processing of international trade flows by Customs, so as to further integrate the                                        country into the world
                         trading community, improve the investment                                             climate and secure the benefits from foreign and domestic investments
                         in the economy; and (b) increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its application, to support macro-economic stability and
                         increase transparency, timely transfer of collected revenues to the                                        Federal budget, and equity and predictability in
                         customs operations. The project would promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of international trade flows by Customs by: (a) adopting
                         Customs standards that facilitate trade through the implementation of procedures to expedite the processing of low-risk
                         transactions while improving the detection and prevention of                                             contraband; (b) facilitating international commerce and
                         accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization (WTO); (c) fostering a stronger partnership between Customs and participants of foreign
                         economic activities; (d) transforming the mindset of SCC officers towards the trade activity from one of protection of the domestic economy to one of facilitating
                         legitimate international commerce; (e) implementing improved business processes and automated systems designed to increase efficiency and reduce
                         discretion and opportunities                                      for rent seeking behavior; and (f) modernizing the Information Technology infrastructure of the
                         SCC, and adopting standardized, highly automated operational procedures,                                            including electronic filing of declarations,
                         which would reduce the                                         level of discretion by customs officers, and e-Government facilities
                         for information and interaction with the trade community. The project would increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code               and ensure uniformity

                         in its application by: (a) adopting standardized and automated procedures countrywide to facilitate voluntary compliance and reduce compliance costs; (b)
                         improving the knowledge and training of participants in foreign economic activities about the customs laws and procedures; (c) improving transparency,
                         uniformity and predictability of Customs actions; (d) implementing efficient dispute resolution procedures; (e) improving enforcement capacity against
                         smugglers and tax evaders through improved risk management, intelligence, investigation, improving efficiency of inspection activities, including post-release
                         audit of goods and vehicles; (f) further developing the organization of the SCC and its management systems to increase overall organizational effectiveness; (g)
                         enhancing professional integrity and skills of SCC officers; and (h) improving the conditions for countrywide training and retraining of SCC officers.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project is being implemented well. Disbursements stand at 67% and most of the contracts under the project have been procured. Nevertheless, recent developments warrant
                         another two year extension of the project. The Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is resulting in changes to the Customs Code and other regulations which have to
                         be reflected in the business applications fundedunderthe project. In particular, changes will have to be made to components and sub-systems of the Unified Automated Information
                         System currently being implemented under the project. Given the fundamental importance of this package in the overall project design and its anticipated contribution to the
                         achievement of the project's development objectives, the World Bank strongly supports an extension of the project.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
