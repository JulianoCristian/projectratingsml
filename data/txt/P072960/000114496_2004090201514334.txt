Re.: Customs Development Project (Loan 4689-RU)
Amendments to the Loan Agreement
—Special Account
Dear Mr. Kolotukhin, 
 
We have received your letter dated December 18, 2003, requesting us to amend the Loan Agreement for 
the above mentioned Loan in respect of the Special Account.  Having taken account of the special 
circumstances of Customs administration and the need for appropriate measures of security to be 
ensured in the establishment and operation of the Special Account, including the second generation 
special account in Russian rubles, we would be pleased to concur with your request, on an exceptional 
basis.  We hereby introduce the following amendment to the Loan Agreement, dated August 27, 2003.   
 
Section 2.02 (b) shall be amended to read as follows: 
 
(b) The Borrower may, for the purposes of the Project, open and maintain a special deposit 
account in Dollars (the Special Account), and ancillary thereto, a project account in Rubles, both 
in a bank acceptable to the Bank, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, including 
appropriate protection against set-off, seizure and attachment. Deposits into, and payments out 
of, the Special Account shall be made in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 6 to this 
Agreement. 
 
We note that the comfort letter which we have received from the [
name of financial institution
]
bank has not included the necessary references to the ruble account as envisaged by the above 
amendment.  We would therefore need the State Customs Committee to request that the Bank be 
furnished with a new comfort letter, which must be received by the Bank prior to our making further 
replenishments of the Special Account.

receipt by the Bank of the copy of this Amendment Letter countersigned by you.
