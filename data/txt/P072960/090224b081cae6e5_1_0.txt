                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to reform and modernize the Russian Customs administration, with a view to: (a) promote internationally acceptable practices for
                         processing of international trade flows by Customs, so as to further integrate the country into the world trading community, improve the investment climate and secure
                         the benefits from foreign and domestic investments in the economy; and (b) increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its
                         application, to support macro-economic stability and increase transparency, timely transfer of collected revenues to the Federal budget, and equity and predictability in
                         customs operations. The project would promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of international trade flows by Customs by: (a) adopting Customs
                         standards that facilitate trade through the implementation of procedures to expedite the processing of low-risk transactions while improving the detection and
                         prevention of contraband; (b) facilitating international commerce and accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization (WTO); (c) fostering a
                         stronger partnership between Customs and participants of foreign economic activities; (d) transforming the mindset of SCC officers towards the trade activity from one
                         of protection of the domestic economy to one of facilitating legitimate international commerce; (e) implementing improved business processes and automated systems
                         designed to increase efficiency and reduce discretion and opportunities for rent seeking behavior; and (f) modernizing the Information Technology infrastructure of the
                         SCC, and adopting standardized, highly automated operational procedures, including electronic filing of declarations, which would reduce the level of discretion by
                         customs officers, and e-Government facilities for information and interaction with the trade community. The project would increase taxpayer compliance with the
                         Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its application by: (a) adopting standardized and automated procedures countrywide to facilitate voluntary compliance and
                         reduce compliance costs; (b) improving the knowledge and training of participants in foreign economic activities about the customs laws and procedures; (c) improving
                         transparency, uniformity and predictability of Customs actions; (d) implementing efficient dispute resolution procedures; (e) improving enforcement capacity against
                         smugglers and tax evaders through improved risk management, intelligence, investigation, improving efficiency of inspection activities, including post-release audit of
                         goods and vehicles; (f) further developing the organization of the SCC and its management systems to increase overall organizational effectiveness; (g) enhancing

                         professional integrity and skills of SCC officers; and (h) improving the conditions for countrywide training and retraining of SCC officers.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is due to close on June 30, 2013 and continues to be managed and implemented well. Disbursements stand at USD 133 million or 95 percent of loan proceeds. Most
                         project activities have been completed. The remaining activities are on track for completion by June 30, 2013.

                         The rapid development of the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan continues to result in multiple legislative changes to the Customs Code and other regulations which
                         are being reflected in the business applications financed by the project. In particular, changes are being made to components and sub-systems of the Unified Automated Information
                         System (UAIS) under the project. Due to the constantly evolving changes in the legislative framework and procedural requirements, additional substantial changes to the UAIS are
                         anticipated to continue for some time.

                         The project has been consistently managed and implemented, and the project results indicators disclose an overall positive performance. In some cases results have already

                         exceeded the end-project targets, evidence that the Federal Customs Service (FCS) has made significant progress in meeting project objectives. Key results information for calendar
                         2012 and the first quarter of 2013 indicate, for instance, that physical inspection rates have been reduced and overall clearance times have improved, both of which positively impact
                         the Russian Federation's competitiveness. The results also suggest that the CDP focus on assisting the FCS to centralize key cargo processing decisions at headquarters and major
                         regional offices has proved to be effective, and has improved uniformity and consistency in interpretation of laws and regulations, ensuring that: (i) officials at remote border locations
                         have access to high-quality technical support in areas such as classification and valuation; (ii) the FCS adopts a uniform and consistent approach throughout the Russian Federation;
                         and (iii) FCS officials no longer have unfettered discretion that can be abused to circumvent rules and regulations. In a country the size of Russia this is a significant positive outcome
                         and demonstrates the ongoing relevance of the project in supporting a consistent approach to implementing national laws.

                         Overall, strong project ownership, consistent and coordinated implementation and a focus on results have led to strong implementation performance and substantial achievement of
                         the project development objective.
