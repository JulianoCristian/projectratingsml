F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective is to reform and modernize the Russian Customs
administration, with a view to: (a) promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of
international trade flows by Customs, so as to further integrate the country into the world trading
community, improve the investment climate and secure the benefits from foreign and domestic
investments in the economy; and (b) increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code and
ensure uniformity in its application, to support macro-economic stability and increase
transparency, timely transfer of collected revenues to the Federal budget, and equity and
predictability in customs operations.

In June 2009, the closing date of the loan was extended by two years, from June 30, 2009 to June
30, 2011. In June 2011, the closing date was again extended by two years, from June 30, 2011 to
June 30, 2013, to enable completion of remaining activities, mainly major information systems
contracts.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.       At appraisal (October 2002), the institutional, political and economic context in the
Russian Federation (RF) was in flux, following the economic and political turbulence of the
nineties: the country was barely a decade old. Moreover, the economy was only just recovering
from the financial crisis of 1998 – in large measure on the back of a sharp rebound of
international oil prices from the 1999 trough (as well as the generalized run-up in commodity
prices).

                          Table 1. Russian Federation: Economic Context at Appraisal

2.      In order to address the wide-ranging and profound challenges faced by Russia’s society
and economy, improving the business environment and strengthening public sector management
figured prominently in the Government’s Medium Term Program of Social and Economic
Development for 2002-2004. These strategic goals were expressly echoed in the World Bank
Group’s Country Assistance Strategy for 2003-2005. World Bank investment lending support
for treasury, tax and customs administration derived from these agreed priorities. Reflecting
their common border and the large volume of cross-border trade, the Finnish and Russian
Governments were also engaged in substantial cooperation to modernize the RF customs
processes and administration (among other tasks within the framework of the “Green Corridor”
project implemented jointly with Finland and Sweden). Moreover, as it was then the only
European Union (EU) member state that shared a common border with the Russian Federation,
the Finnish Government also led the EU-RF dialog on customs and border control. The
experience of the Finnish-Russian engagement in customs informed the CDP design, particularly
in highlighting the most pressing problems to address. These engagements led to an agreement
among the Finnish and Russian Governments and the World Bank to establish a US$0.7 million
Bank-administered Trust Fund1 in 2004 to support the RF customs modernization.

3.      Russia’s trade began to be substantially reoriented towards the OECD countries (from the
CMEA countries and former Soviet republics). Russia also began to intensify its efforts to join
the WTO. In this context, and as part of its strategy to support Russia’s initiatives to modernize
its core public sector entities, the customs administration represented a promising engagement
for the Bank.

4.      Despite the relative strengths of Russia’s customs administration, the reform agenda was
formidable. This included the need to align the customs administration with accepted
international norms, as expressed in the World Customs Organization’s (WCO) Kyoto
Convention, World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements, and various recommendations of
the United Nations Trade Facilitation Working Party. The practices and culture of the customs
administration needed to be reoriented – from that of a defensive, state control/national security
organ to those of a trade-facilitating, responsive public service agency (including reducing
compliance burdens and raising administrative integrity and transparency).

5.     In addition to comprehensive institutional development, the reform agenda required a
thorough revision of the legislative and regulatory framework for customs. At appraisal,
parliamentary approval of a new Customs Code was anticipated in early 2003 (correctly, as the
State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation adopted it on April 25, 2003).

6.      Appraisal also anticipated WTO accession in 2003 (optimistically, as accession did not
occur until August 22, 2012, largely due to protracted negotiations over tariff structures and non-
tariff barriers not related to customs administration). Similarly, accession to the International
Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures, including the 1999
amendments (the Kyoto Convention), was anticipated (also optimistically, as the act of accession
only came into force on November 21, 2010). The RF was already engaged with the WCO,
having joined July 8, 1991 (having a senior representative elected to the WCO’s governing body,
the Council, in 2007).

7.       Lastly, after the fiscal crisis of 1998, the Bank reformulated its strategic approach to the
country support for Russia. One dimension was to place more emphasis on developing the
institutional basis for effective macroeconomic stabilization, and within this effort to concentrate
on effective implementation of reform efforts. The tax and customs administrations, on the
revenue side, along with the Treasury system on the expenditure side, were the three key
elements for strengthening government capacity for fiscal management.

8.      Project identification and appraisal included diagnostic work on the performance of the
customs legal framework, organization and management arrangements, operational practices,
policy formulation, and consultative practices (summarized in Annex 10).

1.2      Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

9.      The development objective of the Russian Federation Customs Development Project was
to reform and modernize the Russian customs administration, with a view to:

     Promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of international trade flows by
      customs, so as to further integrate the country into the world trading community, improve the
      investment climate and secure the benefits from foreign and domestic investments in the
      economy; and




                                                  2
     Increase taxpayer compliance with the customs code and ensure uniformity in its application,
      to support macro-economic stability and increase transparency, timely transfer of collected
      revenues to the federal budget, and equity and predictability in customs operations.

10.    Based on information available at project appraisal, baseline values were established and
end-project targets agreed with the SCS. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were:

i.    Using the risk-based approach, reduce the number of import declarations and the number of
      non-energy export declarations selected for physical inspection, at designated sites, to no
      more than 23 percent and 12 percent, respectively, by the end of 2006, and to no more than
      10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, by the end of the project, from the current level of
      about 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively.

ii.   Reduce the average customs clearance time at the border by 7 percent by the end of 2006
      and by 10 percent by the end of the project, at designated sites.

iii. Reduce the average import clearance time, as measured by the time taken from the entry of a
     truck into the import clearance terminal to the release of goods from Customs control, by 25
     percent by the end of 2006 and by 50 percent by the end of the project, at designated sites.

iv. Reduce the average customs clearance time, as measured by the time taken between lodging
    of the customs declaration to the issue of the release note by 25 percent by the end of 2006
    and by 50 percent by the end of the project, at designated sites.

v.    Reduce by 5 percent the compliance gap measured by the following ratio by the end of 2006
      and by 10 percent by the end of the project.

      [(Value of EU exports to Russia as reported by the EU) - (Value of imports from the EU
      recorded by SCC)] / (Value of EU exports to Russia as reported by the EU)

vi. Increase enforced compliance in the collection of taxes and duties, as measured by the ratio
    of additional revenues (revised assessments, interest and penalties) to total revenue collected
    by the SCC, to 1.5 percent by the end of 2006 and to the EU average of 3 percent by the end
    of the project.

vii. Improve perceptions of traders and other stakeholders regarding the quality of service,
     responsiveness to complaints, and integrity of customs administration as indicated by
     periodic surveys.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11.     The PDO remained unchanged. As anticipated in the Minutes of Negotiation and agreed
during the November 2006 Mid Term Review, the methodology used to calculate KPI (i), (ii),
and (iv) was changed to follow FCS methodologies, so as to help mainstream project monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) activities. The average import clearance time KPI (iii) was agreed to be
dropped from the formal project M&E scheme. This reflected the FCS view that the overall


                                                 3
import clearance time was largely outside customs control, being dependent on the times taken
for clearances to be obtained from the numerous governmental agencies with a border presence
(at that time, customs did not have a coordinating role in border management as was
subsequently granted).

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

12.     The main direct beneficiaries are the Russian and international trade community –
importers and exporters – through more efficient customs clearance and transit processes (i.e.,
faster processing and low compliance burdens) and reduced rent-seeking (i.e., fewer inspections,
less official discretion and more transparency).

13.    The indirect beneficiaries, more broadly, constitute the citizens and firms in the Russian
Federation, who benefit from more stable and predictable revenue flows that contribute to the
financing and delivery of public services, promote more efficient economic and financial
management of public resources, stimulate productivity through an improved environment for
domestic and international investment, and from a more competitive private sector and reduced
informal economic activity.

14.     Honest and compliant customs clients from Russia and its trading partners have benefited
in several ways from the CDP, for example, through reduced compliance costs (and overall
reduction of the earlier burden of uncertain formal and informal payments) and higher
compliance rates. The project contributed to deterring evasion by increasing the burden of non-
compliant customs clients, as evasion has become more costly and time-consuming.
Improvements in customs procedural code contributed to improving the business climate by
increasing the predictability of application of customs legislation and reducing inconsistencies
between different laws and regulations, making it easier for customs clients to understand and
apply customs legislation. Customs clients also benefited from improved customs client services,
access to better information from the SCS/FSC, and reduction of time spent in queues to file
customs documents. Clients’ rights were strengthened through more efficient and equitable
appeals processes.

      D. PROJECT MANAGEMENT
      10. Project Management – US$3.00 million

1.6      Revised Components

16.      The component structure remained unchanged, and the subordinate activities also
remained largely unchanged, with only limited adjustments in response to changes in the
institutional context. These changes (and the affected components) included (a) the complete
transfer of tariff policies to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) from the customs administration
(Fiscal Policy Component), (b) changes in government-wide performance management and
budgeting (Organizational Structure and Operational Management Component), and (c) the
development of the Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan (Unified Automated
Information System Development Subcomponent).

1.7      Other Significant Changes

17.    Two institutional developments impacted the implementation progress (negatively) and
the development outcomes (positively). First, in May 2006, the SCC was transformed into the
Federal Customs Service as part of a government-wide administrative reform. Unlike some
other Services formed at the same time, this transformation elevated the status and stature of the
FCS: it ceased reporting to the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (as it then was)
and began reporting directly to the Government. Second, the elevation of the status of the FCS
was followed by the appointment of a new Head of the FCS in mid-2006. This was followed by
changes in the FCS management team and thereafter by extensive personnel reassignments
within the FCS through much of 2006. In addition, over the following few years, the FCS
underwent an organizational restructuring – the resulting FCS network is depicted in Figure 2.



                                                 5
Figure 2. The Territorial Network of the Federal Customs Service




18.     These developments had three important implications:
a. Integration and coordination of border management functions. The FCS was allocated a
   progressively increasing coordination role in the post-2006 integration process of Russia’s
   border management functions. While the elevation in status played an important role in the
   FCS being able to coordinate almost two dozen RF agencies operating on the border, other
   factors were also at play (e.g., the technical competence of the FCS, its relatively greater
   international orientation compared to other governmental agencies, and its tradition of being
   open to work with other countries’ border management agencies). At the CDP-supported
   customs posts on the Russo-Finnish and Russo-Estonian borders, implementation of some
   CDP-supported process reforms was at times somewhat slow, since FCS officials had to
   spend higher-than-anticipated amounts of time in persuading and coordinating other agencies
   to streamline border management functions and processes.
b. Implementation of the Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan. The FCS was
   effective in implementing the Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan once the policy
   decision to implement the Union was taken. However, this came at a cost: during the last
   four years of CDP implementation, the FCS leadership and its key technical teams (e.g., on
   information and communications technology) became increasingly pre-occupied with the
   implementation of the Customs Union.
c. Dealing with legal and political challenges. Making the FCS directly accountable to the
   Government enabled it to deal with the challenge from the Office of the Prosecutor General
   (OPG) more effectively than the Federal Tax Service (FTS) – see Section 2.2 below.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.      Project Preparation – Identification to appraisal took eight months. Negotiations took
place four months later. The relatively short twelve-month preparation cycle reflected (a) the
importance attached to customs modernization and the CDP by the Government and the Bank,
(b) SCC institutional ownership and capacity in developing project components and activities,
(c) the technical expertise of the Bank team that worked in close collaboration with the SCC, and
(d) the close involvement of other partners such as the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF, the
WCO, and the Finland Customs. The background analysis summarized in the Project Appraisal
Document captures the breadth of the analysis that was commensurate with the needs of
institutional development in the customs administration, as well as the particulars of the RF
context (e.g., the reforms associated with the transition to international norms and trade
facilitation). The risks identified (and rated substantial or high) included a number of “political”
or institutional “culture” risks. The anchor provided by international norms and practices (e.g.,
WTO, WCO Kyoto Convention, etc.) was expected to mitigate these risks. In retrospect, the
identified risks were genuine but reasonably effectively mitigated. The PAD also identified (and
rated substantial or high) several implementation risks related to information systems and ICT
personnel. In retrospect, these risks were also correctly identified (which some CDP capacity-
building activities helped to mitigate). The Bank team enjoyed an engaged, candid and efficient
working relationship with SCC top management and technical staff that endured into
implementation.

20.      Project Design – Notwithstanding the project’s ambitious scope and timeline, the CDP
design matched the RF customs’ institutional development priorities and needs well. Broadly
speaking, institutional development initiatives sought to raise the performance (behavior) of units
and individuals within the overall organization. The achievement of this goal depended on the
successful implementation of an interlocking package of interventions, including changes in
institutional culture. Not only was the package broad, but successful implementation of each
invention was essential to the successful conclusion of the project and the reforms: regulatory
delay could have frozen procedural reforms, for instance, delays in information systems support
could have stalled operational and/or management reforms.

21.    The CDP design touched on all relevant elements of the institutional development
package (except for physical premises, which the SCC/FCS addressed within its investment and
operational budget). The CDP emphasized the legal and regulatory elements. This reflected the
importance of the transitioning to an outward-looking, trade-facilitating stance while aligning the
organization with relevant international good practices. The CDP also emphasized information
systems development. This reflected the importance of timeliness and integrity in administering
customs transactions and in addressing the challenges of managing a large and complex
organization spread across ten time zones.2



2
  At the identification stage, a narrower and shorter-horizon information systems project was one of two alternatives
tabled. For reasons noted above, this alternative was not adopted.


                                                         7
22.      Given the complex scope and the decade-long implementation period, the close
alignment of the originally planned and actually undertaken activities is prima facie evidence of
the appropriate balance struck by the original design – and an outcome beyond the norm in major
institutional development projects.

23.     Quality at Entry – A Quality at Entry Review was held on September 17, 2002. The
Panel was broadly supportive of the proposed project and acknowledged its ambitious nature
(noting the high rate of return on even a partially successful project). The Panel commended the
use of the six-year implementation schedule as not creating unrealistic expectations. It endorsed
the “holistic” approach to institutional reform (in particular it not being an-ICT limited project)
and the interlinked nature of the project components. It also acknowledged that the strong client-
Bank relationship offered a promising start and endorsed the internalized project management
arrangements (i.e. no stand-alone project implementation unit as was – and continues to be – the
norm in Bank-financed projects in the Russian Federation). The Panel also made suggestions for
additional topics for the PAD. The key substantive concerns flagged included: (i) the risk that
ICT activities would get ahead of the broader institutional development initiatives, (ii) the
structure of internal incentives (including the remuneration and the internal distribution of rents)
and the prospects for staff resistance to reforms, (iii) the importance of mobilizing the private
sector to keep the pressure on continuing with institutional reforms, (iv) what would happen to
staffing levels as a result of increased automation of business processes, (v) the need for effective
anti-corruption/internal controls/disciplinary mechanisms, and (vi) the interplay between the
project activities and compliance with obligations under WTO accession and the Kyoto
Convention (including the tricky matter of valuation). Some of these concerns were addressed in
the final project design, although most were risk areas more amenable to implementation dialog
than ex ante activity design. The Panel also suggested that the performance indicators be
sharpened: this was done.

2.2    Implementation

24.     As noted above, the originally planned project components and activities remained
unchanged over the course of the ten-year implementation period (2004-2013). The additional
four years added to the original six-year timeline reflected a combination of the usual slippages
in technical activities from the original (best case) project schedule – plus the loss of momentum
in 2006-2007 due to the government-wide administrative reform which inter alia transformed the
SCC into the FCS, the subsequent change in FCS top management in mid-2006, and the project
stoppage for almost a year during 2006-2007 due to the challenge from the Office of the General
Prosecutor (OGP) to the legal basis for applying Bank procurement guidelines (as opposed to
national procurement legislation) to the CDP.

25.    Following the mid-2006 changes in FCS top management and the subsequent significant
changes to FCS middle management, the CDP management team took more than a year to arrive
at a new equilibrium, and for project implementation to resume. Another unanticipated
development in 2006 severely affected implementation and cast doubt at the time on the project’s
continuation. In 2006, following a several-month long investigation of the CDP by the OGP,
during which implementation and disbursements came to a halt, the OGP declared that as the
CDP Loan Agreement had not been ratified by the Duma (legislature) it did not have the status
of an international treaty, and so the FCS had erred in applying World Bank procurement


                                                 8
processes to the CDP. The OGP argued that project procurement should have been undertaken in
accordance with the Russian Federation procurement legislation, demanded immediate cessation
of the application of World Bank procurement processes, and for immediate application of
national procurement processes forthwith. As a result, project procurement remained suspended
till almost mid-2007 – and disbursement resumed in full swing even later - until the Borrower’s
authorities (the Prime Minister’s office, the Ministry of Finance, the then Ministry of Economic
Development and Trade, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the OGP, the
FCS, and other entities) reviewed the matter in detail, determined that all actions taken by the
FCS to implement the project were indeed fully legal and that no violation of any laws had
occurred.

26.     The halt in procurement and disbursements caused a protracted delay in project
implementation. Furthermore, this setback occurred at a sensitive point in the electoral cycle.
The timely recovery of the forward momentum of the project following the year-and-a-half
hiatus in project activities is to the credit of FCS management and technical teams, reflecting
also the robustness of the original project design and its implementing arrangements.

27.     Implementation was also affected by changes and a high degree of uncertainty in the
customs procedures following the November 2009 accession to the Customs Union with Belarus
and Kazakhstan (and consequent amendments to the Customs Code of the Customs Union
throughout 2010-12). The pace of the development and technical features of the UAIS
application software influenced the requirements for implementing the ICT infrastructure, which,
in turn, influenced the ability to pilot and refine the UAIS software.

28.     It is important to note the unique (for Russia) CDP implementation arrangements and
their impact on project implementation. Unlike other Bank-financed projects in Russia which
are managed and implemented by external stand-alone project implementation units (so-called
‘foundations’) regardless of the implementing or beneficiary agency, the CDP implementation
arrangements were differently designed. There was no project implementation unit: the CDP
was implemented directly by the FCS. The project team comprised experienced SCC/FCS staff
organizationally located in the central Headquarters under the direction of the First Deputy Head
of the FCS, supplemented by five experienced consultants on procurement, financial
management, accounting, etc. To the SCC/FCS senior management’s great credit, the CDP team
was managed in a disciplined fashion and allowed to focus on CDP implementation. Moreover –
and equally critical – the SCC/FCS senior management was actively engaged in directing,
supporting and empowering the project management team. Except possibly the 2006-2007
change in the project management team, the implementation arrangements for the CPD
constituted a best-case scenario, reflected in the successful implementation of a complex and
ambitious project. In addition, these arrangements were cost-effective (US$4.1 million during
2003-2013 for a loan of US$140 million) compared to other projects implemented in the Russian
Federation.

29.     Indeed, the FCS itself has assessed the non-PIU-centric implementation arrangements as
“sustainable and effective”, pointing out that due to these arrangements “the Client and the
Project Implementation Unit are rolled into one” and that as a result, “this structure has
contributed to better integration of the Project in FCS operation, active participation of personnel



                                                 9
and senior management of FCS Headquarters in Project implementation management and
promoted adoption of outputs of Project activities in FCS practice.”3

30.    Outcomes Achieved – Key impacts included (a) a modernized legal and regulatory
framework for customs operations, (b) the reorganization of the FCS structure and functions in
line with international good practices, (c) streamlining and automation of FCS business
processes (reflected in the attainment of the key project results indicators) impacting the entire
FCS, and (d) greater openness of FCS management to seek user feedback on service quality,
complaint handling and integrity (reflected in user surveys).

31.     As the FCS ICR itself notes, “Comparison of outcomes of similar customs modernization
projects financed by the World Bank in Russia and South-East European countries shows that the
Russian Federation overcomes most of the reviewed countries by the customs clearance time at
border checkpoints. In addition, the highest reduction (as compared to baseline values of
indicators) of both share of declarations selected for physical inspection and customs clearance
time before release of goods is achieved under the Customs Development Project of the Russian
Federation” (see Table 2).

32.     Furthermore, the FCS has noted in its ICR that “…Project outcomes have played a
significant role in formulation and implementation of the state policy in the sphere of
development of customs administration. The majority of Project arrangements and the Project
development objective are relevant tasks in the achievement of objectives of the state policy in
the customs administration sphere. All the basic Project outcomes are achieved; part of outcomes
is implemented, disseminated throughout the entire system of the customs authorities (including
dissemination by means of implementation of other public projects and programs) and is used in
the FCS practice.”

34.   Within the first three components, significant positive variations in sub-component
expenditures occurred in two cases:
a. Customs control and clearance (212 percent) – the increase arose from the need to work
   on this issue for longer than originally anticipated. This subcomponent achieved
   significant results (Box 1), not fully reflected in the project results indicators; and
b. Transparency and compliance with international standards (67 percent) – the key outputs
   were the preparation and dissemination of User Manuals for all operational information
   systems and ensuring compliance with international agreements on combating
   misconduct and offences by customs personnel (e.g., the 2003 Arusha Declaration). The
   FCS ICR has rated the sustainability of the results as high.

  Given the complexity and scope of the CDP, Annex 2 summarizes the results of the CDP components/
activities and the in-depth 136-page FCS report of CDP results, outcomes, lessons learned, and sustainability.

                                                     12
                     Box 1. Customs Control and Clearance – Significance and Results


This sub-component supported simplification of customs control and clearance policies and procedures. It
included streamlining interactions among customs offices and between the FCS and other entities (e.g., by end-
2012, the FCS had developed flow-sheets to streamline inter-departmental interactions with 25 federal
authorities), developing general and special-purpose customs audit processes, user training of FCS staff, and
developing an automated decision support system.

Work under this sub-component was also linked with other FCS activities (e.g., a joint project with Finland and
Sweden Customs on a “Green Corridor”, a “Kaliningrad Transit” project and 2012 FCS initiatives with Poland
and Estonia). Currently, 49 border checkpoints implement the ‘green’ and ‘red’ corridor system.

In addition, the FCS developed advance information procedures. Their impact is growing as evidenced by the
following FCS data: (a) for goods imported by road, the clearance time has been reduced to about 53 minutes (a
reduction of more than 30 minutes on average) while truck queue lengths have shortened although the number
of trucks entering rose by 30 percent in 2012, (b) for goods transported by rail, more than 50,000 messages
containing advance information were forwarded to the FCS, and (c) for goods transported by water, more than
7,000 messages were forwarded.

Post-audit (also known as post-release control) was also introduced. More than 4,800 post-audits were carried
out in 2012, resulting in additional assessments and penalties of RUR 5 billion (1.9 times that for the previous
year) and initiation of 40 criminal cases.

Ten electronic declaration centers (EDCs) were established in 2012 – these are specialized customs posts
authorized to accept only electronic declarations. The creation of EDCs has encouraged importers to use e-
declarations and enabled the FCS to process a rapidly growing volume of such declarations: 164,000 EDCs were
cleared in 2012, compared to 54,000 the previous year.

35.     Within the same components, there were major negative variations in the following:
a. Trade facilitation (-74 percent) – part of the costs were met from the budget of the FCS
b. Human resource management and training (-48 percent) - part of the costs were met from
   the FCS own budget since some activities (e.g., automation of HRM processes and
   defining training needs) later became part of the overall public administration reforms
   implemented by the Russian Federation.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     M&E Design – The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with the PDO
correctly focused on key dimensions of the institutional performance of customs
administration (i.e., the efficiency and effectiveness of physical control procedures, the
effectiveness of compliance management, the compliance burden, and the integrity and
quality of services). They also correctly attempted to isolate the performance impacts due to
the project interventions (i.e., by focusing selected KPIs on project-finance pilots).

37.    The seven original indicators represent only a subset of the numerous dimensions of
customs institutional performance. For example, they do not touch on the efficiency of
resource management, legal/regulatory coherence, etc. Moreover, the methodology to
quantify each KPI can, at best, serve only as a proxy for a series of broad dimensions of
performance (e.g., timeliness as a measure of the compliance burden). Nevertheless, a KPI
scheme must, in practice, provide a practical compromise: limited in number and expressly
“indicative” in nature.



                                                      13
38.      In the case of this project, the cultural transformation sought included a shift away
from an internally-focused “border defense” role and towards an outward-looking trade-
facilitating public service. The KPI design reflected this goal.

39.     M&E Implementation and Utilization – As a prominent fiscal actor and a
transactions-intensive public service agency, the custom administration is relatively well
disposed to, and well versed in, monitoring and analysis. The project-specific M&E
indicators and monitoring processes helped the FCS modernize its management outlook. In
particular, the KPI and subordinate outcomes indicator scheme was substantially integrated
into the FCS’s permanent reporting/monitoring framework6. In addition, a number of the
project-financed initiatives directly enhanced FCS information-gathering, information
analysis, and communications capacities. These efforts contributed to the sustainability of
the M&E arrangements and their utilization in the management of the FCS. The FCS has
noted in its ICR (in the context of the project M&E arrangements using data from different
quantitative and qualitative sources) that the CDP M&E approach “is an example of the
comprehensive assessment of both the performance of the customs authorities at large and the
outcomes of the Project and may be recommended for future use inter alia at implementation
of the public Program “Foreign Economic Trade Development” and “road map” to improve
customs administration”.

40.     As noted above, shifting to SCC methodologies for KPI formulation was anticipated
at Negotiations. This was meant to facilitate the mainstreaming of the CDP’s M&E activities
into the SCC (FCS)’s routine M&E, which took place in the context of the project’s Mid-
Term Review.

2.4      Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41.     The project triggered neither environmental nor social safeguards. Project financial
management arrangements were satisfactory throughout the project life. Quarterly financial
management reports (FMRs) were submitted on time and were acceptable to the Bank.
Audits of the project financial statements were carried out on an annual basis. Clean audit
reports were submitted on time. On several occasions, auditors noted that some equipment
delivered to final beneficiaries was not in use during audit. The management response was
that this had been caused by internal reorganization, and measures were taken to satisfactorily
address these issues.

42.     These findings give credit to the FCS management and project team and assume
special relevance in the context of Bank-financed projects in the Russian Federation: the CDP
remains the only World Bank-financed project in the Russian Federation implemented
directly by an agency (the FCS in this case) and not by an external entity (normally one of
several special-purpose ‘foundations’ in the Russian Federation which specialize in
management and implementation of projects financed by international financial institutions)
responsible for project procurement, financial management, accounting, disbursement, and
compliance with Bank policies, guidelines and processes.

  The FCS ICR refers in its ICR to the “adoption in FCS practice of a number of indicators used for assessment
of the Project effectiveness. In particular, indicators characterizing the time spent for customs control at border
checkpoints, the customs clearance time, the satisfaction of business community and public circles with FCS
operation are used to assess the FCS effectiveness and performance.” It also states that the use of these
indicators for assessing FCS performance is planned to be continued.

43.        Loan covenants remained in compliance throughout.

2.5        Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

44.      The CDP (along with the larger contributions by the SCC/FCS operational and
investment budgets, as well as other bilateral and multilateral cooperation programs) has
provided resources to enhance the institutional development of the FCS – in pursuit of the
key strategic goals of alignment with international norms and reduced compliance burdens
(as well as the subordinate goals). The successful implementation of the CDP has notably
strengthened the institutional platform of the FCS as well as its performance. Going forward,
the upgraded institutional platform provides a basis for the FCS to pursue its strategic goals.
The Detailed Plan for the Implementation of the Strategy of the Federal Customs Service of
2020 adopted in 2012 highlights nine broad areas of initiative: Customs Regulations (sixty-
three sub-initiatives), Effective Implementation of the Fiscal Function (fifteen sub-
initiatives), Customs Infrastructure (twenty-four sub-initiatives), Information Technical
Support (sixty-five sub-initiatives), Law Enforcement and Anti-Corruption (fifty-four sub-
initiatives), International Cooperation (twenty-four sub-initiatives), Institutional Development
(twenty-one sub-initiatives), Strengthen Human Resources (twenty-five sub-initiatives), and
Development of the Social Sphere (seventeen sub-initiatives). The nine broad initiatives in
large measure continue the emphases of the CDP and a majority of the detailed sub-initiatives
build directly on CDP project activities. Consequently, the preservation (and extension) of
the gains from the CDP is highly likely (especially given the continued strategic, institutional
and fiscal importance of customs).

45.     In the near term, the Government and the FCS are focused on fully integrating the
changes in the legal framework and procedures brought on by the Customs Union with
Belarus and Kazakhstan7 (including, critically, enhancements to the UAIS). Presently, the
authorities anticipate undertaking a review of the project experience and the FCS’s needs
during 2015. The authorities have repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the engagement
with the Bank/Bank team under the CDP. Keeping the dialog open and active with this key
trade-facilitation agency would contribute to the Bank maintaining itself as an active partner
in the economic and social development of the RF.

3.         Assessment of Outcomes
3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.     As the Russian Federation continues to integrate with the global economy, via trade
and cross-border investment, and as natural resource still account for a significant proportion
of Federation’s public finances, FCS performance remains a significant determinant of
economic growth and of the business environment. Moreover, as the sophistication of global
trade increases and the global alternatives for trade and investment expand, improved FCS
performance will also impact national competitiveness. The performance of the FCS, in turn,
remains a matter of consolidating and advancing the program of institutional development
embodied in the project. This is reflected in the RF’s current high-level strategic documents.

    And – subsequently - other entrants.

                                                  15
47.     The objectives, design, implementation and follow-up of the CDP remain highly
relevant to the goals of the Government, as expressed in the Government’s Development
Strategy 2020. In particular, the 2011 Update emphasized the “New economic growth model,
ensuring macroeconomic and social stability and Strategies for better business climate and a
more attractive investment potential in order to implement a sustainable growth model”.
Furthermore, the CDP’s objectives, design, and implementation remain aligned with the
World Bank Group-Russian Federation Country Partnership Strategy for the period 2012-
2016, specifically the expressed goals: “(i) increase growth and diversification through better
management of public finances, improved investment climate … , and (iv) improve
governance and transparency through more accountability and better service standards in
public administration, ...”

3.2        Achievement of Project Development Objectives

48.     The Key Performance Indicators (revised) suggest a strong achievement of the PDO.
Six KPIs substantially exceeded their targets (selectivity, timeliness, and compliance) while
one (enforced compliance) substantially underperformed (a detailed explanation is provided
later in this section). The user survey indicator showed an upward trend during 2010, 2011
and 2012.

49.    FCS explanation of reasons for under-performance of indicator on enforced
compliance. The FCS has explained in detail the reasons for under-performance of this

     Please see detailed explanation on next page.

                                                               17
indicator, stating that the value of this indicator is the result of two factors that could operate
in opposite directions. First, additional revenues to the federal budget from enforced
compliance (from revised assessments, interest and penalties) significantly increased in
absolute terms from 2006 to 2012 (RUR 3.2 billion in 2006, rising to RUR 12.21 billion in
2012 – see Table 4). However, the possibility of increases in the collection of fees and
penalties was impeded by FCS policies and processes: as a consequence, revenue from fees
and penalties increased only slightly (by RUR 0.1 billion in each case from 2006-2012).
Second, total FCS revenue transferred to the federal budget saw high growth (from RUR 2.8
billion to RUR 6.5 billion from 2006-2012) and caused a decline in the value of this indicator
(from 0.11 in 2006 to 0.19 in 2012). The FCS states that it would not be appropriate to assess
the lack of achievement of this target negatively, since a low share of additional revenues
from enforced compliance could be evidence of increased compliance which, according to
the FCS, is supported by a substantial reduction of the gap in the assessment of the amount of
foreign trade by the Central Bank of Russia (using the balance of payments methodology)
and the FCS: this gap has been reduced six-fold over the project life – evidence, according to
the FCS, of substantial improvement in compliance with customs legislation.

50.    In 2011, the FCS informed the Bank that the indicator and target value for enforced
compliance did not reflect the approach of the FCS (and of the Ministry of Economic
Development) in measuring the success of enforced compliance. The FCS focused on
measures to improve the effectiveness of controls at customs operations to prevent build-up
of customs arrears. In view of this approach, increased collections as a result of enforced
compliance are seen by management as deterioration in performance.

51.     Survey Results. In addition to the KPI-based assessment of project impact, the
observations of interested parties suggest the CDP achieved notable positive impact. Surveys
performed9 in 2006, 2008-9, 2010, 2011 and 2012 provide a nuanced picture of impressions
by the trading community, other state agencies, and customs staff on a variety of topics.

52.    The trading community reported generally positive or strongly positive impressions
over time (1200 respondents – from a country-wide and a broad manufacturing and natural
resource sample) - see Table 5.

   Software for customs documentation procedure: “convenient”      23       27     25     24     30

54.     A comparative analysis in 2011 of the trading community’s responses to
developments in the pilot areas versus the overall customs administration indicate that pilot
areas do not show advantages in speed of clearance, transparency or overall service quality.
However, respondents within the pilot areas do indicate improvements in many areas / factors
(including speed of clearance, transparency, service quality). The pilot areas do not
constitute a “controlled experiment” in that some of the important innovations are system-
wide (such as those in the legal/regulatory/organizational arrangements). Additionally, the
modernization program remains a work-in-progress. So many of the innovations to be
deployed in the pilot region first (notably the UAIS) were not yet in place or yet fully
effective. This is consistent with the staff in the pilot areas assessing aspects of the
modernization effort more positively than customs staff at large (suggesting perhaps that the
effects of the modernization initiatives in the pilots had not yet fully worked through to
impacts on the trading community).

55.     The 2011 narrative/textual interviews of expert representatives from state authorities,
professional associations, and NGOs (180 respondents and 72 from the pilots) indicate that:
(a) the modernization program (international norms, information systems modernization, e-
declarations, staff training, etc.) is seen as absolutely necessary, (b) the program is clearly a
work-in-progress which is thus difficult to definitively assess at this point, (c) despite its
ambitious scope, the program coverage/implementation is less comprehensive than it needs

                                                      19
be to address observed deficiencies in customs, and (d) there are areas, such as information
sharing, for which the FCS systems remain disappointing .

56.     External Survey Results. As analyzed by the Bank team and summarized in a July
2011 Europe & Central Asia Region Knowledge Brief (Volume 41), information on customs
performance from external data and surveys such as the Business Environment and
Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), the Logistics Performance Index (LPI), and the
World Economic Forum Enabling Trade Index (ETI) appears to present a broadly consistent
and relatively encouraging picture over the period 2005-2010. Problems with customs
regulations trend down in the BEEPS and LPI data. LPI and ETI data indicate export
clearance efficiency is higher than import clearance (associated with revenue collection and
community protection processes), consistent with the internal data and the project-financed
surveys. On transparency and corruption, the external surveys diverged somewhat, with
BEEPS showing improvements and the LPI and ETI indicators showing higher or
deteriorating reported incidences (respectively). The 2013 BEEPS data indicate a stalling of
progress during 2010-2013. The number of documents and time for import and for export
show improvement in only the ‘time to export’ data. Costs to import and to export are up
sharply in 2013. The 2012 LPI results indicate that customs administration and cross-border
trade environment generally lag the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) averages as well as
Upper Middle Income country averages. In short, the CDP helped the RF move forward in
terms of trade facilitation and international orientation. However, much work remains to
sustain and further advance the reforms.

3.3     Efficiency

57.     At appraisal, the economic benefits of the CDP were estimated for three streams of
benefits to the trading community (projected for 2003-2019). These were: (1) speeding
customs clearance “transportation effect”, (2) reduction in customs broker fees, and (3) lower
customs fees. Expected benefit streams associated with foreign trade growth (and the
contribution to national income growth), as well as the growth in transport and trade-related
service sectors, were noted but not quantified due to methodological constraints (notably
attribution).

58.     The financial analysis integral to the cost-benefit model presented in the PAD reflects
the fact that the subject of the CDP investments is a fiscal agency. Thus, the financial model
includes the net impact on state revenues due to: changes in tariffs and fees structures (due to
WTO and Kyoto Convention accession/alignment), as well as improvements in compliance to
customs and VAT laws (i.e., reduction in black and grey market activities).

59.     The estimation of Project costs and benefits and their net present value by each
Project year is at Annex 3. The calculation covers the implementation and operating periods
of the Project cycle. Taking into account the share of CDP financing within the total amount
spent on modernization and operation of the Customs UAIS, the net present value of Project
fiscal benefits is US$3.6 billion10, while the net present value of project economic benefits
(net of budget benefits) is US$415.3 million. Taking into account the net present value of



10
   Total amounts are provided for the period 2003-2020; the discount rate used is 0.1. The Net Present Value of
project economic and financial benefits also includes non-separable useful effects from implementation of
public-funded customs development programs in parallel with the CDP.

                                                      20
budget expenses for Project implementation, including co-financing costs, costs for payment
of interests and Loan principal, and costs for operation of the Customs information system
(US$91.8 million), the CDP has achieved a high level of economic and fiscal efficiency.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory (i.e., there were minor shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of
its objectives, in its efficiency, or in its relevance).

60.     The project was implemented through a decade of far-reaching institutional
transformation at the federal level. The major changes have been mentioned in this ICR.
CPD design was and remains highly relevant to the agency, sector, national and Bank-RF
strategic frameworks. The KPIs and other indicators of impact are strongly positive.

61.     Nevertheless, the improvements in customs administration cannot be fully ascribed to
the CDP investments, as they are not the only contributing factors and the yet-to-be-fully
operational UAIS limits the scope to isolate the impact in the pilot areas. Similarly, the
efficiency of the investment is most likely high, but this too is impractical to disentangle from
the broader customs modernization efforts (especially the legal and regulatory reform).


3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

62.     The project did not specifically target poverty impacts or social development, but the
CDP-financed FCS modernization ultimately resulted in more efficient collection of customs
revenues, which would benefit directly from improvements in compliance, predictability and
transparency nurtured by the project. Indirectly, more efficient and stable collection of
customs revenues was expected to lead to a stronger relationship between customs clients and
the FCS (borne out through the consistent upward trend in user survey results), more
confidence in government (the user survey results showed greater confidence and trust in the
FCS on the part of customs clients), greater social inclusion (this was not explicitly
measured), and increased equity and transparency (the positive findings from the user surveys
tend to support the realization of this hypothesis).

(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.      The CDP is essentially a pure institutional development project. Its successful
implementation can be seen in the positive indicators of customs administration performance
(e.g., the KPIs and survey results above). The positive prospects for the RF to sustain and
extend the institutional developments arising from the CDP – assuming there are no
unanticipated fiscal constraints or contingencies - are noted above in Section 2.5. In sum, the
impact on institutional change and ongoing reform ambition is very high.

(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

64.    The project had several unintended positive outcomes and impacts.

65.     First, the most salient positive unanticipated outcome was that most of the project
results and outcomes across project components were implemented countrywide rather than
                                               21
just in the project regions, under budget funds made available by the Government. This is not
only recognition that the project objective and outcomes were perceived as highly relevant by
country authorities, but also that the project design was appropriate and relevant to the FCS.

66.     Second, the implementation arrangements did not rely on a ‘stand-alone’ PIU – this
proved to be effective in generating strong management and technical ownership, facilitating
adoption of project results across the FCS and encouraging involvement of FCS management
and staff in the CDP, besides being cost-efficient.

67.     Third, the CDP’s ‘World Bank-financed project’ status (i) protected the project from
budget cuts (e.g., during 2008-2010) when national resources were scarce, and (ii) provided
the project with the flexibility to adapt project activities to unanticipated policy directions and
other developments (e.g., implementation of the Customs Union).

68.     Fourth, the CDP M&E framework and some of the key results indicators have been
subsumed into the FCS performance assessment framework, significantly enhancing their
system-wide impact. The availability of disaggregated performance information through the
CDP encouraged the FCS management to ‘drill down’ and examine project results (see
Figure 3) and – if positive – extend such interventions across the system. One example of this
relates to the reduction of customs clearance times.

Figure 3. Average customs clearance time (vehicle checkpoints, project pilot zones, minutes)




69.    The FCS ICR states that “A direct effect from implementation of Project activities on
customs authorities’ performance indicators may be assessed for a number of activities. For
instance, after construction of 4 inspection complexes in RF border checkpoints (Burachki,
Brusnichnoye, Torfyanovka, Ubilinka - North-West Customs Directorate) in November 2007,
a notable (70 percent) reduction of customs clearance time is observed in the respective



                                                   22
vehicle checkpoints.” Thereafter, similar inspection complexes were constructed with budget
funds in several other locations.

70.     There was an unanticipated setback which detracted from the project’s otherwise
positive progress and impact. In 2007, the Bank team was informed that following a several-
month long investigation of the CDP (begun in 2006) by the OGP of the Russian Federation
(during which implementation and disbursements came to a complete halt), the OGP declared
that as the CDP Loan Agreement had not been ratified by the Duma (legislature) it did not
have the status of an international treaty, and thus the FCS had no basis for applying World
Bank procurement processes to the CDP. The OGP opined that project procurement should
have been undertaken in accordance with Russian Federation procurement legislation,
demanded immediate cessation of the application of World Bank procurement processes, and
for immediate application of national procurement processers forthwith.

71.     As a result of this development, project procurement and disbursements remained
suspended till about mid-2007 until the Borrower’s authorities (the Prime Minister’s office,
the Ministry of Finance, the then Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, the Ministry
of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the FCS and other entities) with the Bank’s full
and active support reviewed the matter in detail, determined that all actions taken by the FCS
to implement the project were indeed fully legal and that no violation of any laws had
occurred.

72.     However, the halt in procurement and disbursements caused a protracted delay in
project implementation. It took several months after the mid-2007 high-level discussions for
project implementation to resume in full swing.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.    See section 3.2 above for a summary of the beneficiary surveys.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate.

74.      The risks to the sustainability of the development outcome from the CDP arise
through a number of channels: (a) risks to the institutional coherence and strength of the FCS
arising from political developments, (b) risks to the performance of the customs
administration arising from negative developments in the broad political economy (e.g.,
reversal of progress in the rule of law and the integrity of public administration), (c) risks to
adequate operational and investment resources needed by the FCS to maintain its staffing,
skills, information systems, and other assets, and (d) risks to the technical operations of the
FCS’s information systems and other specialized equipment.

75.     Each of the above risk areas can be potentially quite disruptive to the performance of
the customs administration and to sustaining the CDP investments. Nevertheless, the
probability of these risks materializing is fairly modest (save possibly the risks to adequate
operational and investment resources needed by the FCS – in the current situation of
somewhat straitened state finances, future annual capital allocations for customs appear likely
to be significantly reduced, as do outlays for operations and maintenance). In a straitened
budgetary situation, Customs is a significant contributor to the state budget, but that has not

                                               23
helped it to remain insulated from budget cuts. Many of the technical measures introduced in
the CDP (e.g., the UAIS, the revenue risk subsystem, etc.) increasingly limit the scope for the
trading community to not comply with the legal norms governing trade. These probably
militate against backsliding in the rule of law and/or social/political trends away from trader
compliance. In sum, the risks are generally modest, with the possible exception of moderate
risks associated with the FCS’s budget and its increasing dependence on modern ICT
operations.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory (i.e., only minor shortcomings in identification/preparation/appraisal).

76.      In retrospect, the background analytics and CDP design were well targeted to the
needs of customs administration in the RF (reflecting among other things the strong working
relationship with the WCO). Similarly the implementation arrangements – especially the
reliance on project implementation by the agency itself - turned out to be strong. The risk
assessments were generally on target and conservatively rated. The M&E arrangements and
effort levels were relatively commendable.

77.    The CDP design established a highly ambitious (no-slip) implementation timeline of
six years. Recognizing that six years substantially pushed the limits of Bank management’s
norms for project duration, the design could have benefited from a clearer, less ambitious
assessment of the likely duration.

78.    That said, the strong Bank team, strong cooperation with the IMF, technical support
from the WCO, and strong working relations established with the then SCC leadership
(within the relatively short eight-month preparation period) suggests something closer to a
Highly Satisfactory rating. However, weaknesses in aligning the Bank’s lending instruments
with the needs of complex institutional development projects induced the minor shortcomings
noted above (as did the related project preparation processes and norms).

(b)    Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory (i.e., only minor shortcomings in supervision)

79.     Focus on development impact – The quality of the project design (including the
impact-oriented KPIs) helped the Bank team maintain a focus on the project impact during
supervision (i.e., not overwhelmed by the dialog on inputs, timing and procurement
transactions). The (strong) project team also maintained the participation of substantive area
experts (i.e., on trade facilitation and customs operations). This also helped keep the dialog
focused on the impact of the project investments.

80.      Supervision of fiduciary aspects – Notwithstanding the complexity of the project
activities, procurement actions and financial management, no fiduciary problems emerged.
Credit is due to the FCS project management team. However, the strong country-based


                                              24
fiduciary team helped keep this running smoothly by, among other things, maintaining good
working relations with the FCS team.

81.     Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes – The supervision budget and effort
was substantial (225 staff weeks and 1.2 million USD) between FY03-FY14. Given the
scope and complexity of the CDP, greater supervision resources would have allowed the team
to strengthen technical supervision. The fact that a substantial part of the supervision effort
was based in the country office – even if team leadership and customs area expertise were
based outside of the RF - helped stretch the budget and maintain continuous engagement with
the client. It is worth noting that during the 2006-7 hiatus in project activities, the Bank team
organized a knowledge-sharing visit, at the request of the Head of the FCS, for key members
of the new FCS management team. This appeared to have raised the comfort level of the new
executive team with the CDP and the Bank and contributed to the subsequent renewal of
project momentum.

82.      Candor and quality of performance reporting – With the exception of the hiatus in
2006-7 (due to change of executive management and the OGP’s legal challenge to the CDP),
project activities generally maintained acceptable forward momentum and remained closely
aligned to the original project design. The time series of project ratings (Section G of the
Data Sheet) reflected this overall picture. In particular, the Development Objective (DO) and
Implementation Progress (IP) ratings were all “Satisfactory”, with the exception of the
“Moderately Satisfactory” IP rating set in October 2007 and the “Moderately Unsatisfactory”
ratings set for the DO and IP in May 2008. There was no reason to question the candor of the
ratings.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Whereas the general success of the CDP must certainly be attributed to the SCC/FCS’s
management and project management teams, the Bank’s performance in design and helping
resolve implementation challenges as they arose was commendable and on balance
Satisfactory. As noted above, the Bank’s contribution to quality at entry and the supervision
were subject to only minor shortcomings.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory (i.e., there were only minor shortcomings).

83.     In terms of budgetary support and FCS management continuity the Government was
engaged and supportive. Similarly, the legislative agenda needed to support customs
modernization was effectively managed, reflecting the Government’s support for customs
modernization. The Government was also able to resolve the issue raised by the OGP in
2006-7 (the challenge to the legality of the use of the Bank’s procurement processes) despite
the sensitive stage of the electoral cycle when this occurred.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory (i.e., there were only minor shortcomings)

                                               25
84.    The SCC/FCS maintained a strong commitment to the project objectives, a continuing
commitment to stakeholder dialog and coordination with international partners, well-staffed
and empowered technical working groups, mainstreamed M&E practices, and strong project
administration arrangements (including fiduciary functions).

85.      The one and a half year hiatus in project activities in 2006-7 following the change in
the FCS top management team (and the CDP project team) combined with the subsequent
legal challenge by the OGP were resolved and strong project management was able to
substantially bring implementation back on track. Both events were substantially outside the
implementing agency’s control. In addition, there was some impact on the FCS of the
broader public administration reforms being implemented (especially those pertaining to civil
service recruitment and salaries, budget management, etc.). Lastly the policy decision of the
Russian Federation to implement the Custom Union with Kazakhstan and Belarus led to more
than 200 changes in legislation, followed by changes in business processes – still ongoing.
This too, though a development outside the control of the FCS, was addressed by it although
it did lead to the final 2-year extension of the closing date. Nevertheless, the professionalism
of the FCS CDP team and support from FCS top management enabled the project to close
smoothly with almost all results indicators substantially over-achieved.

86.    In fairness, it would be hard to imagine any implementing agency undertaking such a
complex and ambitious project without any minor shortcomings and unanticipated
developments to address.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory (i.e., there were only minor shortcomings)

87.   The rating reflects the Satisfactory performance of the Government and the
Implementing Agency.

6.     Lessons Learned
88.    It was known at the outset that the CDP would be a high-risk but high-potential
reward project. Indeed, the implementation experience bore this out. The lessons learned can
be divided into those learned and applied at the project preparation stage, and those learned
from the implementation experience.

Lessons learned and applied at the project preparation stage

89.      The project design incorporated lessons learned from revenue administration reform
initiatives in the Russian Federation (e.g., the first and second Tax Administration
Modernization Projects) and from other regions of the world, including transition economies.
These included:

a) Customs (in fact all revenue administration) reforms can succeed only with strong high-
   level political will and commitment complemented by sustained technical support from
   the entity itself. Both were in evidence during project preparation.



                                              26
b) A medium to long-term strategic vision, owned by the implementing agency, is a
   prerequisite for sustained revenue administration reform and capacity-building. This was
   provided by the government and supported by Russia’s development partners.

c) Successful customs reforms must address institutional constraints to customs
   performance, and not center reforms exclusively on information technology and systems
   solutions. A strong institutional capacity development aspect was built into all
   components. Specifically, a change management element was created through Thematic
   Groups at the operational level to ensure commitment and continuity of project objectives
   and activities.

d) Business process re-engineering and related automated applications must be fully (though
   gradually) integrated throughout the customs administration, with appropriate
   management of the organizational transition (including human resource and training
   aspects) as central elements of this process. This was an integral part of project
   preparation activities and was reflected in the design of the CDP.

e) Development of application systems software is often a major bottleneck. Application
   systems software should be developed and fully tested early in the project cycle, and
   equipment purchases made after the software is successfully piloted. This was
   incorporated in CDP project activity sequencing: the project began with analyses of
   policy and implementation challenges, progressed to business process streamlining and
   then to automation and training provision: for example, the hardware required for the
   UAIS was procured at the end of the project.

f) Efforts to control the potential for corrupt behavior by customs officials require a
   comprehensive strategy aimed at reducing the motive and opportunity for corruption, and
   providing incentives for integrity to take hold. This was addressed by creating greater
   transparency in customs procedures and through implementation of automated systems to
   reduce discretion and to distance customs officials from clients.

g) Creation of a sustainable revenue administration system requires changes to the
   policy/legal and institutional frameworks as well as administrative actions to support
   institutional reforms. This did happen in the CDP: the adoption of the Customs Code and
   other customs policy reforms, coupled with the institutional transformation of the SCC
   into the FCS and the application to the FCS of public financial management and other
   reforms,      resulted    in    significant   modernization    of    Russia’s   customs
   policy/legal/institutional framework. And the administrative actions undertaken in
   parallel (including organizational strengthening, business process re-engineering and
   information systems modernization) ensured the sustainability of FCS modernization
   initiatives.

h) Institutional development typically depends on implementing a tightly-interlinked
   package of normative, procedural and organizational innovations, as well as human
   resource and information systems investments - the benefits of such institutional reforms
   can only be realized if all the pieces are put into place. This was achieved in CDP design,
   which included far-reaching changes in the Customs Code, detailed regulations and
   internal procedures, as well as organizational changes, plus changes in information
   systems, taking into account cross-dependencies, especially between legal norms,
   procedures and application software.

                                             27
Lessons learned from the implementation experience

a) Strong and consistent support for customs modernization from the Head of Customs is
   essential for sustained reform. The CDP enjoyed such strong support from the Head of
   the FCS throughout its life. In particular, the tenure the Head of the FCS throughout
   project implementation provided extraordinary stability and continuity to the FCS
   modernization process, the CDP and to the CDP implementation team as well. This
   strong support served to overcome the negative impact of the hiatus in implementation
   caused by the OGP challenge to the CDP.

b) The design and implementation of the project by the FCS itself (rather than through an
   external project implementation unit as in every other Bank-financed project in Russia)
   resulted in strong ownership at the technical level and cost-efficient implementation as
   well – this could be a model for the Russian Federation to consider emulating in other
   projects. The ‘no-PIU model’ and embedded technical ownership ensured that the project
   picked itself up after the OGP episode and went back to a business-as-usual mode of
   implementation even after a year’s hiatus. And the US$4.1 million CDP project
   management cost compares favorably with the US$4.5 million spent for management of
   the Judicial Reform Support Project from 2007-2013.

c) A dedicated project implementation/management team needs to work effectively with key
   operational parts of customs in supporting and coordinating reforms, rather than
   succumbing to time-driven pressures and becoming directly involved in implementing
   reforms. Considerable efforts were invested by the CDP management team in developing
   effective working-level cooperation with FCS organizational units across the country,
   critical to build and sustain institutional support for the FCS reforms.

d) Appropriate sequencing of reform/modernization activities is critical to their success and
   to the achievement of intended development outcomes. In the CDP, technical and
   diagnostic activities preceded the business process re-designs, which in turn preceded the
   design of modern information systems. For example, the advent of the customs union
   with Belarus and Kazakhstan induced a wave of changes in regulations, procedures and
   software applications that needed to be implemented in an internally consistent (and time
   consuming) sequence.

e) Complex, risky and longer-term public sector institutional reforms can often benefit from
   World Bank support in significant ways, not often appreciated or understood. This was
   the case for the CDP, where the FCS analyzed the key aspects of the Bank’s value-added,
   namely (i) its ability to bring relevant international experience to the FCS as and when
   needed, (ii) keeping the FCS focused on development results even in times of turbulent
   institutional change, (iii) the Bank’s flexibility in helping the FCS to adapt project
   activities to changing institutional reform priorities (especially on information systems
   where technological obsolescence can be rapid), and (iv) the protection the ‘Bank-
   financed status’ afforded to the project budget (and hence to the reforms it financed).

 7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Implementing Agency
 (a)    Implementing agency

 90.    Five sets of issues merit mention:

 i)    Ratings: A comparison of Bank and Borrower ratings (Table 7) indicates similar
       ratings on all aspects. The FCS ICR provides reasoned explanations for the ratings,
       while this ICR provides justifications for the Bank’s ratings.

       Borrower overall                         Satisfactory          Satisfactory

ii)    Improved quality of customs operations through CDP-supported activities: The FCS
       highlights several aspects of improved customs operations which have taken the FCS
       into the trajectory of a high-performing customs organization. These included (a) the
       adoption of a risk-based approach to customs operations and the implementation of a
       risk management system, (b) the adoption of a ‘single-window’ approach to border
       management and border control/clearance services, (c) increasing reliance on advance
       information systems and e-declarations for speedy clearance of customs documents, and
       (d) the development of a post-audit system. The Bank agrees with this assessment and
       hopes that these initiatives will be further strengthened and deepened in the coming
       years.

iii)   Exogenous developments affecting implementation and impact: The FCS examined
       several exogenous developments which, in its view, positively impacted the project and
       especially the significance and sustainability of its results and outcomes. The Bank
       agrees with this assessment. The key developments referred to by the FCS are
       summarized below:

       a) Changes to the policy/legal and institutional framework affecting customs’
          operating environment such as the adoption of the Customs Code (2004), the policy
          decision to create the Customs Union and the Common Economic Space (2010) and
          Russia’s 2012 accession to the WTO;

       b) The adoption of landmark laws to reform the public service (2003) and the civil
          service (2004) and their implementation (2003-2007 and 2008-2013), which
          resulted in new processes for competitive recruitment, performance evaluation and
          performance-based remuneration – these mainly affected the Human Resource
          Management and Training component;

                                                29
      c) Public financial management reforms at the federal level including the introduction
         from 2004 of medium-term expenditure planning and program- and results-based
         budgeting (when a Budget Process Reform Concept was adopted) – these reinforced
         the CDP’s results-based approach and increased the significance of the CDP results
         framework and of results collection and reporting. They also led to some budget-
         reform related activities being financed from state budget funds rather than from the
         CDP;

      d) The implementation from 2004 of administrative reforms at the federal level led,
         first, to the creation of federal executive authorities including the transformation of
         the SCC to the FCS and second, to the subsequent – since 2008 – increased
         emphasis on provision of IT-enabled public services (the latter facilitating the
         introduction of electronic customs declarations earlier referred to). These reforms
         also increased the significance of CDP IT activities11 and of electronic interaction
         between the FCS and other federal entities since federal agencies were prohibited
         from demanding the same documents from service users and clients again and again
         (2010 Law no. 210-FZ); and

      e) Increased federal emphasis on anti-corruption (through 2008 Law no. 273-FZ)
         which facilitated the implementation of federal and sectoral anti-corruption policy
         through, for example, the use of project outputs to improve integrity across the FCS.

iv)   Underestimation of macroeconomic assumptions: The FCS points out that the
      differences were significant (Table 8). The FCS makes the point that the better-than-
      anticipated macroeconomic performance positively affected the assessment of the
      project’s economic and financial costs and benefits. The Bank agrees with this
      assessment.

Table 8. Macroeconomic indicators – forecast vs. actual
 Indicator (annual average                      Forecast                              Actual
  growth rate, 2000-2004)                     (from PAD)
GDP                                               4.3                                  6.8
GDP per capita                                    4.7                                  7.2
Export of goods and services                      2.0                                  20.6

v)    Lengthy approval and clearance processes sometimes delaying implementation: The
      FCS mentions two categories of processes which sometimes led to delays in
      implementation:

      a) World Bank procurement reviews: The CDP included many relatively large
         activities (consultancy services as well as complex IT ‘supply and install’
         contracts). The World Bank procurement guidelines required Bank reviews at all




11
  The FCS estimates that during the course of CDP implementation, as many as 208 external changes impacted
IT-related CDP activities and implementation timelines. It estimates the cost of IT activities affected at US$87
million - about 70% of the total cost of the CDP IT component.


                                                      30
         stages of the procurement process (development of technical specifications, terms of
         reference, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, draft contracts, contract
         amendments, etc.). This sometimes led to delays in finalization of technical
         specifications or terms of reference, and hence in contract implementation. The
         Bank agrees with this assessment where it relates to procurement of complex IT
         systems such as the UAIS, and clarifies that in recent years, the Bank’s role and
         involvement in project procurement has progressively diminished wherever the
         client (as in this case) has sufficient technical and procurement capacity and where
         procurement risks are assessed to be low. Indeed, some recently developed Bank
         financial instruments require the use of country systems for procurement and
         financial management for speedy implementation, requiring agreement on project
         objectives and results, and specifying output-based or results-linked disbursement,
         thereby obviating the need for the implementing agency to require procurement
         reviews by the World Bank. (Indeed, if the FCS or the Russian Federation considers
         a follow-on CDP-like project to sustain and deepen FCS modernization, the Bank
         would suggest that such financial instruments could be considered as more
         appropriate vehicles for the complex modernization challenges the FCS confronts.)

      b) Internal governmental approval processes: The FCS mentions that for IT-related
         activities, some implementation delays arose from governmental requirements to
         obtain approvals, clearances, accreditation or registration from relevant
         governmental bodies. Especially in the case of software solutions or installation of
         complex information systems such as the UAIS, such requirements also caused
         implementation delays.

(b)    Co-financiers

91.    There were no direct co-financiers.

(c)    Other partners and stakeholders

92.     The World Customs Organization remained involved in supporting customs
modernization in the Russian Federation. The European Union is also continuing its dialog
with the FCS. Owing to its land borders, the FCS maintains a dialog with the customs
authorities of Finland, Estonia, Latvia and China. Lastly, through the Customs Union,
Kazakhstan and Belarus (and now Armenia) remain actively involved in the evolution and
further development of the Customs Union. These stakeholders were relevant for the CDP
since many aspects of CDP implementation (especially customs operations and clearance)
were intertwined with the ongoing FCS dialog on these issues with such stakeholders (e.g.. as
mentioned in Box 1, there were joint initiatives on ‘green’ and ‘red’ corridors with Finland,
Estonia and Latvia).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


This Annex summarizes the outcomes documented in the FCS’s in-depth (136-page) “Study
of Customs Development Project Efficiency and Evaluation of its Effectiveness”.

CUSTOMS OPERATIONS
1. Customs Control and Clearance [US$ 12.6 million actual]
   Risk Management System (RMS) – a strategic and implementation plan was devised,
    including technical requirements and pilot site preparations. RMS components were
    developed, including an econometric trade model and related methodologies, database of
    violations, and data warehouse facility for validation. Implementation of the RMS
    software, related documentation, training, etc., was performed under the Unified
    Automated Information System (UAIS) Sub-component of the Information Systems
    Component.
   Cargo Clearance and Control Procedures – Streamlined, standardized, revenue-risk
    based cargo clearance and control procedures were developed, covering inland and
    international transit, warehousing, import and export border clearance. Regulatory and
    procedural innovations were identified align international practices, including inter-
    agency information exchange (e.g., tax administration and border control).
    Documentation requirement and handling were streamlined. Implementation of the
    computer-supported tools and procedures was performed under the UAIS sub-component,
    as well as the operational and investment budget of the FCS.
   Post Release Control – Analytic and regulatory frameworks for strengthening post release
    control were developed, including technical and implementation requirements. Software
    and procedures and other implementation activities were performed under the UAIS sub-
    component.
   Inter-agency Coordination – An analysis of information exchange and interactions among
    the FCS, other state agencies, and the foreign trade community (related to clearance,
    payment, licenses and other legal controls, etc.) was performed. Innovations were
    developed, including alignment with international practices and treaty obligations,
    legislative and regulatory requirements, information systems requirements, information
    exchange formats, etc. Implementation of the systems and procedural innovations
    substantially arose in the context of the UAIS Subcomponent.
   Legal Information Support – Requirements analysis, design, and implementation of a
    Legal Information System were undertaken. The system supports the FCS Legal
    Department’s role in legislative analysis and drafting support. The system also supports
    the propagation of the legal norms, interpretations, and instructions throughout the FCS.
    The system is presently in pilot implementation at the FCS Headquarters and the
    Northwest Customs Administration and the Central Customs Administration.

2. Trade Facilitation [US$2.5 million actual]
   Realignment with International Norms – An analysis and comprehensive inventory of the
    (mis)alignment of the RF legal framework for customs procedures and WTO and revised
    Kyoto Convention was performed and a staged transition plan was developed.



                                             33
   Electronic Declaration System Pilot – An electronic declaration system was designed and
    piloted, including electronic signature facilities. The technical design and implementation
    requirements were feed into the larger UAIS subcomponent.
   Performance Indicators for Strategic Planning and Internal Control – Following a failed
    contracted-in effort, an FCS team developed a system of key customs performance
    indicators (with an emphasis on trade facilitation and commercial climate). Among other
    things, these indicators feed the FCS’s routine reporting to the RF Government. Further a
    “Road Map” for customs modernization was developed, including a benchmark/target to
    reaching a top-twenty ranking in the Bank’s annual “Doing Business” Survey. Survey-
    based methodologies and indicators were also developed to track client assessments of the
    quality of public services provided by the customs administration.
   Code of Ethics – In the context of the development of the FCS Human Resource
    Management Strategy, a Code of Ethics was developed and formally adopted by the FCS
    and was supported by an integrity action plan and further improvements in the tracking of
    integrity related performance of the FCS.
   Clearance Documentation Streamlining – The documentation requirements, submission
    mechanisms and procedures for clearance and control was analyzed and simplified.
   Staff Awareness – A program of staff awareness of the rationale and obligations of WTO
    Accession and Kyoto Convention was implemented. This represented an important
    instrument in the cultural change process.
   UNTDED Nomenclature – Formulation, translation and implementation planning for the
    adoption of UNTDED standard trade-related definitions was performed. Also, the links
    to the risk management system and the UAIS technical requirements were formalized.

3. Fiscal Policy [US$ 4.2 million actual]
   Tariff and Non-Tariff Policy Analysis – In the wake of 2006 administrative reforms,
    which, among other things, transferred tariff, exemptions, fees, and non-tariff customs
    policies to the MOF (from the then SCC), this activity was dropped from the project
    scope and subsequently undertaken by the MOF using budget resources.
   Customs Fees – Similarly, the activity to develop a customs fee structure based on
    administrative costs was dropped from the project scope. Although some initial analytic
    work was done on the RF’s alignment with WTO norms and GATT Article 8. In keeping
    with the 2006 national administrative reforms, work on customs fees was transferred to
    the MOF. The MOF subsequently undertook these activities using budget resources.
   Revenue Accounting – The flow of duties, fees, and other payments remitted to the
    Treasury by traders/brokers in the connection with customs procedures was analyzed.
    Legal and regulatory changes were identified and formulated to improve the process of
    calculating and remitting customs revenues, in concert with the updated customs control
    procedures. Also, technical and implementation requirements were formulated, including
    the training curriculum. Implementation of the computer-supported tools and procedures
    was performed under the UAIS sub-component.

      management. Technologies and implementation and training services were procured
      (although connectivity and bandwidth services were subscribed to using FCS budget
      resources). Implementation of the unified (wide area) network was completed. In
      total one hundred forty-eight sites were connected, including thirty-five FCS
      telecommunications centers proving technical support and technology services to the
      corresponding region(s).
    o Workstations, Servers, Peripherals, Standard Software, Video Conferencing and other
      Specialized Equipment – A round of replenishment and updating of the information
      processes technologies used in customs administration was completed.
      Approximately eleven thousand workstations were deployed, along with smaller
      number of related technologies (servers, printers, power conditioners, etc.). Four sites
      received video conferencing facilities. Subsequent annual replenishments of these
      office technologies have been part of the FCS on-budget investment program since
      2006.
    o Upgrading of Selected Application Software Systems – Plans to upgrade selected
      existing application systems (e.g., fraud detection, econometric trade modeling, risk
      database) were subsumed into other project initiatives/components, including most
      notably the Unified Automated Information System (UAIS).
    o Local Area Network – A methodology was developed to analyze and specify the in-
      office networking needs for FCS units. The methodology and resultant technical and
      implementation designs were piloted (in eighteen sites). Due to problems associated
      with extensive contract revisions, the implementation activities and technologies were
      shifted from project financing to budget financing. Based on the pilots, a general
      method and requirements statement were prepared. These informed the (ongoing)
      roll-out of LANs the FSC is carrying out with its own investment resources.
    o Large Truck and Container Inspection – Four movable “complexes” for physical
      inspection of large trucks and containers were specified and installed (initially).

                                              38

      other related items were enhanced and updated for selected functional areas, including
      clearance and control, valuation, fraud detection, currency and international barter
      transactions. Also, upgrades to the technological and technical management
      capacities of the central computing complex and the eight regional computing centers
      were specified and implemented, including training services and upgrades to
      system/information security facilities. These upgrades provided the basis for
      supporting the updated application systems, the expanded network connectivity, and
      the strengthen security policies. It also set the stage for the development, testing and
      rollout of the UAIS.
    o New Integrated Application (Sub)Systems for Selected Functions – Based on analysis,
      innovations and requirements from the various project components, national and
      international norms, and the requirements under the overall Concept for the UAIS, the
      design, development, and pilot testing of selected key customs functions was
      performed. The selected functions include customs clearance and control operations;
      accounting and control over the collection of customs duties and payments debts; risk
      management; post-release control and customs inspections. As an integrated system,
      the UAIS includes support for information exchange between existing and planned
      subsystems, document management and work flow, as well information interchange
      with the trading community, other public agencies, and cross-border coordination
      (e.g., green and red corridors with at selected border crossings). The UAIS also
      includes subsystems for Executive Decision Support (for pilot units in the FCS, e.g.,
      Senior Executives Office, General Organization and Inspection Department,
      Analytical Department, and Public Relations Department). The operational function
      subsystems have been piloted at FCS Headquarters and the pilot regions, including
      the corresponding regional and central management units. Other application
      subsystems are presently being developed / extended using FCS budgetary resources.
      These include control of internal normative documents and execution; human
      resource management; analysis and evaluation of the customs performance in major
      areas of economic, fiscal, enforcement, inspection functions; the FCS Portal; Central
      Register of participants to foreign economic activities.

    o Data Loading, Incoming/Outgoing Messaging, Database Administration, Data
      Transport Subsystems – Starting with the design, development and initial testing of
      the Data Transport Subsystem, four constituent subsystems of the FCS Customs
      Information Database were iteratively designed, developed and tested. The Customs
      Information Database (as a subsystem of the UAIS) consolidates data feeds from over
      thirty distinct (legacy) operational applications/databases. These include: customs
      cargo declarations; customs pay-in slips; delivery control documents; «Autocontrol »
      temporary imported (exported) goods under «Carnet-АТА» procedure; actual export
      of goods placed under customs export regime; «Account of forms and Vehicle
      Registration Certificates»; customs declarations log books; «Motor-Transport»;
      control over rocket and nuclear engineering. As the UAIS completes its coverage
      over customs procedures, these information flows (to the central Customs Information
      Database) will be internal to the UAIS.

PROJECT MANAGEMENT
10. Project Management and Administration [US$ 4.1 million actual]
   Project Management Reporting – Semi-annual project management reports were
    prepared, as well as quarterly financial management reports.
   Procurement – Extensive procurement/contracting process management (and substantive
    technical support) was performed. Overall, the project carried out forty-two ICB actions,
    representing US$151.3 million; nine smaller invitation-to-quote actions, representing
    US$0.3 million; twenty-eight procurement actions for “consulting” services from firms,
    representing US$16.2 million; and a number of procurement of individual “consultants”
    services, representing US$3.5 million.
   Project Audits – Annual audits of the project accounts/documentation were commissioned
    for 2003 through 2013.
   Monitoring and Evaluation (including surveys).

The in-depth evaluation report also noted the project activity linkage to key adjoining
initiatives. These include “green” and “red” channel innovations piloted at selected border
crossing with Finland and Poland, simplified vehicle control at the Estonian border, EU
transit trade via Kaliningrad, and mandatory advance information for trade within the
Russian-Belarus-Kazakh Customs Union. Each supplemented and built on innovations
financed within the project.

In addition, the project activities dovetailed with information exchange and coordination
initiatives in the broader public sector (i.e., including (but not limited to) the: Federal Tax
Service, Treasury, MOF, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport,
the Ministry for Communications, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Defense, the
Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Public Health
of Russia, Federal Drug Control Service, the Federal State Statistics Service, the Federal

                                            42
Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

The PAD forecast an Economic Rate of Return of 1898 percent on an NPV stream of US$ 5.1
billion of economic benefits. Other hard-to-measure/attribute economic benefit streams
certainly add substantially to these values.

The project economic and financial benefits were initially evaluated only for the regions
covered by the Northwestern (NWCD) and Central Customs (CCD) directorates. This was
because these two directorates accounted for the bulk of customs operations and Project
arrangements.

Underlying facts and assumptions:

1. The share of imports processed by NWCD and CCD in the total amount of imports and
   share of imports processed by project customs offices and posts of NWCD and CCD,
   remained unchanged during the entire Project implementation period.

2. The forecast achievement of financial benefits (against targets) was made by spreading
   the benefits over several years. All financial benefits have been classified into two
   groups:
   a. Benefits achievable relatively quickly, in the medium-term, their full effect being
       expected by 2006. The cost-benefit achievement path was initially as follows: 2003 –
       0 percent, 2004 – 10 percent, 2005 – 50 percent, 2006 and after – 100 percent;
   b. Benefits achievable only in the longer term, with maximum effect by 2008, i.e. by
       initially anticipated Project completion. The following time path has been assumed for
       these benefits: 2003 – 0 percent, 2004 – 20 percent, 2005 – 40 percent, 2006 – 60
       percent, 2007 – 80 percent, 2008 and after – 100 percent. These assumptions are
       justified by the fact that over the first years of the Project, the benefits would be
       insignificant or unrealized.

3. Taking the closing date extension into account, the following timelines are assumed for
   the medium-term benefits and that their full effect is achieved in 2012: 2003 – 0 percent,
   2004 – 0 percent, 2005 – 10 percent, 2006 – 20 percent, 2007 – 30 percent, 2008 – 40
   percent, 2009 – 50 percent, 2010 – 60 percent, 2011 – 80 percent, 2012 and after – 100
   percent.

4. The time frames for longer-term benefits are assumed to be as follows: 2003 – 0 percent,
   2004 – 0 percent, 2005 – 0 percent, 2006 – 0 percent, 2007 – 15 percent, 2008 – 30
   percent, 2009 – 40 percent, 2010 – 50 percent, 2011 – 60 percent, 2012 – 80 percent,
   2013 – 90 percent and thereafter – 100 percent.

5. Export and import amounts are assumed to remain unchanged in dollar terms over time -
   a conservative assumption, given an improved business environment for foreign trade
   companies as an expected (and achieved) project results and the growth of the world and
   of the Russian economy in the longer run.

7. Project benefits and costs independently affect the project financial and economic results,
   allowing direct summing up of all benefits.

8. Wherever possible, official information is used. Data from Rosstat was used where
   Rosstat data differs from FCS data. When information from other sources (such as mass
   media or expert estimates) is used, the most conservative estimate is presented.

Assessment of fiscal and economic effects at project completion

1. Treatment of project benefits: The list of Project benefits and costs did not undergo
   significant changes. Project benefits fall into two categories: public (RF government) and
   private. The following public benefits were quantified in the analysis: (i) improvement of
   the overall compliance level of foreign trade participants; (ii) improvement of the customs
   enforcement efficiency; (iii) more efficient control over export of goods and VAT refund
   claims by export entities; (iv) streamlining and better application of temporary import
   (export) customs regulations.

2. Treatment of private benefits: a) lower transaction costs for foreign trade participants as a
   result of speeding up of the customs clearance procedures; b) reduction in amounts paid
   for the customs brokers services stemming from the simplified customs procedures; and
   c) savings for foreign trade participants from lower customs fees - were evaluated for the
   project.

3. Besides quantified benefits, the Project was initially expected to generate additional
   benefits for both the private and public sectors, which were difficult to evaluate due to
   lack of information or the complex nature of the benefits. These benefits include:
   a) revenues for the budget from more efficient customs operations on seizure and sale of
       contraband goods;
   b) extra customs revenues from streamlining customs duty exemptions (to be seen from
       the further reduction of discrepancy between the statutory and effective weighted
       average customs duty rate),
   c) benefits and costs associated with the growth of exports and imports,
   d) public and private benefits stemming from the improved investment climate in the
       country, etc.

4. The proposed project costs for the government should have consisted of: (a) co-financing
   of the IBRD loan from tax collections; and (b) payment of interest and repayment of
   principal of the loan and financing of recurrent and maintenance costs.

5. The planned structure of costs on the whole turned out to be adequate and has been used
   for this analysis. However, the assumption that some costs for the government will also
   arise due to Russia’s accession to the WTO did not materialize.

Methodology

The applied method of costs and benefits analysis consists of (1) identification of the key
areas where the project results would be most visible, (2) identification of likely positive
benefits and costs for these areas, (3) selection of a set of quantitative indicators, which more
or less adequately characterize these costs and benefits.

Calculation of financial benefits
The financial benefits for the NWCD and CCD customs posts are as follows.
1)      Additional annual budget revenues from an extended dutiable base: US$3.6 billion.
This comes from an improvement of the overall compliance level by 10 percent due to the
reduction of unregistered foreign trade and expansion of the dutiable base. This development,
leaning on simplified, faster, risk-based computerized customs clearance procedures, are
estimated to bring US$3.6 billion to the budget per annum. It is assumed that the full benefit
accrues from 2012. It follows therefore that 10 percent improvement in the compliance rate
stipulated in the project, (which is an equivalent of the reduction of unregistered imports by
the same 10 percent), has reduced the discrepancy to 5.3 percent (=29.9-10%=26.9 = 5.45 –
10% = 5.3%). As a result of more efficient control over imports while providing strong
incentives for foreign trade companies to accurately report on their imports, the dutiable base
will increase by 0.996 percent due to the reduction of unregistered imports.

                                Dtb = Mcbr*(1-GAPt)/Mscc
                   Dtb =327,2 *(1-0.0585)/309.2 = 327.2 *(0.9415): 309.2 = 0.996%,
where Dtb – net increase in the dutiable base of the FCS; Mcbr – amount of imports from the
CBR balance of payments on average in 2001-2012; GAPt – import value discrepancy
between CBR and FCS; Mscc – amount of imports on average in 2001-2012 as reported by
FCS.



                                               45
Thus, the additional budget revenues generated by project customs in NWCD and CCD from
extended dutiable base will amount to:
                             Tbi = (T1i+ T2i+ T3i)*(I–1)*Li *Pcp

Based on data of 2012:
                 Tbi = (1659.7+55.4+655.0)*(0.0996)*0.613*0.793 = 114.8 billion Roubles
                                              (US$3.6 billion13),

where Tbi – stands for annual additional revenue from project customs in the NWCD and
CCD resulting from increased import tax base; T1i stands for VAT on imports; T2i stands for
excises on goods (products) imported to the RF territory; T3i stands for import duties (other
duties, taxes and fees of equivalent effect) paid on the territory of RF in 2012; I stands for the
growth rate of registered import tax base brought about by the compliance rate improvement;
Li stands for the share of the NWCD and CCD in total imports; Pcp stands for the share of
imports cleared by project customs in the NWCD and CCD.

2)     Additional annual revenues from enforcement measures: US$34.1 million.
Improved enforcement efficiency can be measured by the ratio of additional revenues to total
revenues generated by customs. Revenues from the enforcement measures were initially
expected to reach the EU average level of 3 percent by 2008. It follows from these data that
in 2006 the ratio of revenues from the enforcement measures to the total revenues transferred
by FCS to the federal budget was equal to 0.11 percent. In practice, this indicator has not
reached 3 percent, but increased only to 0.19 percent in 2012. This produces an additional
annual fiscal benefit of US$34.1 million in the NWCD and CCD:
                                        Te = R * (Et:Ea-1)* Lt *Ppt

                        Te=6486.7 * (0.19:0.11-1) *0.35*0.65= 1073.3 billion Rubles or US$34.1
                                                       million,

where Te – stands for annual additional revenues that better enforcement will generate; R is
the total amount of budget revenues transferred by the FCS to the federal budget in 2012; Et
stands target ratio of enforced customs collections to total collections (2012); Ea – actual
ratio of enforced customs collections to total SCC collections in 2006; Lt - share of the
NWCD and CCD in the amount of foreign trade volume processed; Ppt – share of project in
processed amount of foreign trade volume in the NWCD and CCD.

Spreading additional revenues over time was done in accordance with the long-term benefit
assumption as this type of benefits requires implementation of a whole range of institutional,
legal and IT measures.

In addition to PAD quantitative targets, the following indicators can be used to measure other
financial benefits from the project:

3)    Annual additional VAT collection from more efficient control over goods exports
and VAT refund claims: US$23.8 million.




13
     At the rate of 31.5 Rubles per USD.

                                                 46
An assumption was used at Project preparation that improved coordination between FCS,
Ministry of Taxes and Fees (MinTax) and other fiscal agencies would improve detection of
fraudulent export transactions and reduce the amount of unjustified refunds of export VAT.
Since it was the MinTax, which is in charge of VAT refunds, improvements here would be
reflected in better net collection of VAT to the budget by that agency. The estimated benefit
is US$23.8 million.

For the Project implementation period, the effect of improved information exchanges
between the customs authorities of Russia and foreign countries, as a result of the Project,
should be added to this assumption. The method of calculation was specified based on tax
audits carried out in the Russian Federation. The specified calculation was made on the basis
of actual amounts of VAT refunds to exporters (1,202 billion Rubles in 2011) 14 and
assessment of the share of unjustified VAT refund (based on tax audit data, unjustified
reimbursement of VAT comprised 80.9 billion Rubles or 6.7 percent of the actual refund in
2011). Another expert assessment used was the one that improvement of information
exchange between customs authorities and MinTax can reduce the amount of unjustified
reimbursement of VAT by 30 percent:
                                    Tr = 0,5*(Trf - Trp )*E * Le *Ppe
                Tr = 0.5* (210 - 93)*0.3*0.246*0.497 = 0.7 billion Rubles (US$23.8 million),
                                            Tr = (Trf*Trp )*E * Le *Ppe
                Tr = (1202*0.067)*0.3*0.246*0.497 = 2.95 billion Rubles (US$93.8 million),
where Tr – stands for annual additional revenues that better information exchange on VAT
refund claims between the NWCD and CCD and corresponding tax bodies will generate; Trf
stands for the amount of actually reimbursed VAT to exporters in 2011; Trp stands for
unjustified VAT refunds figure; E – coefficient of the potential improvements in detecting
fraudulent exports and VAT refund claims from better information exchange between
customs and tax authorities; Le - share of the NWCD and CCD in the amount of exports
processed; Ppe – share of project customs in processed amount of exports in the NWCD and
CCD.

4)      Annual additional revenues from improved legal and regulatory framework and
enhanced customs administration capacity: US$61.7 million. Based on the available
assessments, annual additional revenues to the federal budget from the improvement of the
legal and regulatory framework and enhancing the customs administration capacity (which
will allow better information exchange and more efficient customs control over goods
shipments at operations of transit, temporary import to the RF territory, etc.) will be 1.92
billion Rubles (US$61.7 million), achieved in the medium-term perspective.

Before Project implementation, the loopholes in the regulatory and legal framework and
statistical reporting do not permit to ensure that customs payments are paid in full when the
temporary import customs regulations are applied. Creation of the Customs Union and
Common Economic Space and accession of Russia to the World Trade Organization have
enhanced the effect from factors relating to transit of goods across the territory of the country.

Data on the identified amounts of unpaid customs payments were used to assess the financial
benefits in this area15:
      - in 2007 unpaid customs duties amounted to 5 billion Rubles;
         - in 2008 unpaid customs duties amounted to 1,3 billion Rubles;
         - in 2009 unpaid customs duties amounted to 0,92 billion Rubles;
         - in 2010 unpaid customs duties amounted to 0,67 billion Rubles;
         - in 2011 unpaid customs duties amounted to 0,73 billion Rubles;
         - in 2012 unpaid customs duties amounted to 1,4 billion Rubles;
In order to use this data to assess the financial effect, it is assumed that annual additional
revenues to the federal budget from the improved legal and regulatory framework and from
enhanced customs administration capacity resulting from the CDP are 25 percent of the
average reduction of the amount of unpaid customs payments over the period 2007-2012; the
full effect was achieved starting 2008 and is equally spread over years.

The annual financial benefit from the improved legal and regulatory framework and enhanced
customs administration capacity can be estimated as:
                                Tt = 1/7*(Tm + Tp )*1/2:Tt1*Lt* Pcp
                 Tt = 1/7*(1491.8+1198.7)*1/2:(5/122)*0.613*0.793 = 2.28 billion Rubles
                                                 (US$78.1 million),
                                             Tt = (Tm - Tp )*Lt* Pcp
                   Tt = (5.0-1.004)*0.613*0.793 = 1.92 billion Rubles (US$61.7 million),
where: Tt – amount of additional annual revenues for the two project customs departments
resulting from the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework and enhancing the
customs administration capacity; Tm – amount of unpaid payments in 2007; Tp – average
amount of unpaid payments over the Project effectiveness period (2008-2012); Tt1 – share of
customs offices inspected by the Accounts Chamber in the total number of customs offices;
Lt – share of the two project regional customs departments in total amount of imports; Pcp –
share of imports cleared by project customs in the NWCD and CCD.

Additional Expenses and Federal Budget Revenues Foregone
Some assessments of Project financial benefits which, according to the assumptions made at
Project preparation were to have led to additional expenses and foregone federal budget
revenues were based on erroneous assumptions and therefore require to be revised:

1) An assumption was made at Project preparation about reduction of federal revenues due to
adoption of GATT/WTO-compliant regulations on customs fees. Such estimation was based
on Article VIII of GATT 1994 establishing the principle, according to which all fees and
charges (other than duties) imposed in connection with importation or exportation shall be
limited in amount to the approximate cost of foreign trade related services rendered by
administrative agencies. The fees shall not represent an indirect protection of domestic

products or taxation for fiscal purposes. Usually, customs fee is a flat payment, the amount of
which is fixed at the level allowing coverage of the cost of investment in customs service
infrastructure and its maintenance. Currently, the amount of customs fee to be paid is decided
on the basis of goods value (ad valorem principle). It is not connected in any way with the
cost of serviced rendered by customs authorities to foreign trade companies and generates net
revenues for the budget.

At Project preparation, it was assumed that changes of the existing legal and regulatory
framework regulating collection of customs fees will be a necessary prerequisite of Russia’s
planned accession to WTO, which would lead to losses for the budget. The project was to
have assisted the Government of Russia and the SCC in meeting this requirement through
development of methodological, technological and information tools. However, it would be
wrong to attribute possible losses for the budget to the project itself since it has to be done
anyway with or without a project. This is exclusively for the purpose of full presentation of
all cost and benefits related to the project, that these foregone revenues are estimated here.

It follows from Table 3.2 that the accession of Russia to the WTO has resulted in a situation
where the growth of actual customs payments is much higher than the growth in investment
and operational costs, i.e. the forecast foregone revenues to the budget (at the stage of project
preparation).

Economic analysis

Project implementation benefits are not limited to financial ones alone. The project is
expected to have a favorable influence on the economic situation in the North-Western
Region and the Central Region and, subsequently, on the entire country through trade
facilitation, reduction of costs for importers and exporters and improving the investment
climate.

At the time of Project preparation, foreign trade participants incurred high transaction costs
due to deficiencies in the customs legislation, arbitrary interpretation of the customs laws by
customs officers and frequent changes in customs regulations. Unduly high customs fees,
facilitation fees and unjustifiably high customs broker fees drive these high costs. Better
transparency of customs agencies, the simplification and automation of customs procedures
and the improvement of the legal framework were embedded in the project. Project

implementation has secured reduced transaction costs and resulted in savings for foreign
trade participants.

The key economic benefits from reduction of transaction costs comprise the following:

Annual economic benefit for traders from reduced transaction costs: US$420.7 million.
The Project implementation itself, supported by other reforms (including the approval of the
Customs Code) contributed to speeding up customs clearance procedures. As a result, the
transaction costs and losses associated with long processing times diminished considerably
(among other reasons due to the implementation of the Concept for customs clearance and
control at sites located close to the RF state border, application of remote release technology
and adoption of electronic declarations). Taking into account that: (1) truck carriers account
only for 5 percent of total international cargo transportation, (2) as a result of Project
implementation and implementation of other government-funded customs development
activities, clearance times have been reduced from 10 days to 1 day, the economic benefit for
foreign trade participants from Project implementation will be at least US$420.7 million:
                           Ea = Lap * (10-1)/10 * Li * Pcp : Kt
                Ea = 48 * (10-1)/10 * 0.613 * 0.793 : 0.0364 = US$420.7 million.

where Ea – stands for the annual economic benefit associated with the speeding up of
customs clearance in project CD; Lap stands for current losses according to ASMAP; Li
stands for the share of the NWCD and CCD in import; Pcp stands for the share of imports
cleared by project customs in the NWCD and CCD; Kt stands for the truck share in total
cargo transportation (pipe transportation excluded) turnover.

Spreading this benefit over time was done in accordance with the long-term benefit
assumption as this type of benefits requires implementation of a whole range of institutional,
legal and IT measures under the project.

2) Annual economic benefit from reduced demand for customs brokers: US$44.3 million.
Another benefit arising from simplified customs procedures is the reduction in amounts paid
for the customs brokers services. At the beginning of the project, the services of customs
brokers cost approximately $200 per customs declaration. We assume that as a result of
simplified customs procedures, measures taken to adopt electronic declaration, etc. this
amount has dropped to US$50. Let us also assume that 20 percent out of 4.3217 million cargo
declarations processed in 2012 were processed by customs brokers. The summary share of
NWCD and CCD in this number of declarations will account for 43.1 percent.

Based on this information, the economic benefit from lesser demand for customs brokers’
services is estimated at US$ 44.3 million per annum, to be achieved in the medium term. The
following formula was used:
                   Eb = Lb        *     Pt     * Pb * Li       * Pcp

                      Eb = (200-100) * 2,200,000 *0.34 * 0.431 * 0.793 = US$25,565 million,

                      Eb =      Lb* Pt * Pb*Li * Pcp

                                                     50
                  Eb = (200-50) * 4.32 *0.2 * 0.431 * 0.793 = US$44.3 million,

where Eb – Eb stands for the annual economic benefit associated with the reduction of use of
customs brokers services in the NWCD and CCD; Lb stands for the benefit for foreign trade
companies from lower costs of customs brokers services per customs declaration; Pt stands
for the annual number of import declarations; Pb stands for the share of import declarations,
processed by customs brokers; Li stands for the share of the two CD in total amount of
processed import declarations; Pcp stands for the share of imports cleared by project customs
in the two CD.

3) The assumption about substantial savings for traders from lower customs fees due to
making customs fees legal and regulatory framework WTO/GATT-compliant turned out to
be unjustified. This benefit had to become a mirror reflection of losses for the budget from
the same development as discussed in the financial analysis. However, as follows from the
relevant section of the financial analysis, WTO accession has not affected the above costs and
benefits.

There are other economic benefits which have not been quantified. Two are worth
mentioning:
   a) Foreign trade growth. In the beginning of Project implementation, the growth of
      foreign trade was restrained due to legal, regulatory, operational, technological and
      staffing weaknesses in operations of the customs administration, in addition to basic –
      macroeconomic factors. Implementation of government-funded programs, among
      other things, in development of adequate trade oriented legal and regulatory
      framework, simplification of customs procedures, automation of customs technologies
      including electronic filing of customs declarations, and increase of customs officers’
      motivation, professionalism and integrity. As a result, there was growth of foreign
      trade, to a large extent. However, the financial effect of foreign trade growth turned to
      be of a dual nature: along with growth of customs revenues administered by the FCS,
      higher imports negatively affect the domestic tax base and corresponding internal tax
      revenues due to crowding out of noncompetitive domestic producers. It is impossible
      to evaluate the overall net effect ahead of time, therefore it is assumed that positive
      and negative financial benefits of foreign trade growth offset each other. The Project
      implementation has also contributed to these results.

   b) Growth of cargo transportation, port and other foreign trade-related commercial
      services as a result of foreign trade growth and simplification of customs procedures.
      Foreign trade growth stimulates the demand for transportation services leading to
      creation of new jobs, broadening of tax base and growth of customs duties and fees.
      Simplified and automated customs procedures together with risk management system
      (implemented with support of the Project) have shortened customs clearance time.
      This improved the competitiveness of Russian trade infrastructure companies,
      however did not result in reallocation of trade flows into Russian ports and increased
      share of foreign trade and associated transportation and other services they render at
      expense of infrastructure companies of neighboring countries, which are used for
      goods transit to Russia (Baltic states, Finland). This happened to a significant degree
      due to unpredictable growth of foreign trade, which cannot be handled by Russian
      infrastructure. Thus, here the assumption may remain as well that the growth of
      Russian carriers, infrastructure companies, etc. is compensated by the parallel growth
      of expenses for import of these services.

                                              51
The result of the estimation of Project costs and benefits and their net present value by each
Project year is provided in Table 3.3. The estimation is made for a period covering the
implementation and operating periods of the Project cycle. Taking into account the share of
financing of the CDP within the total amount spent on modernization and operation of
the Customs UAIS, the net present value of Project fiscal benefits is US$3.6 billion18,
while the net present value of project economic benefits (net of budget benefits) is
US$415.3 million.

Taking into account the net present value of budget expenses for Project implementation,
including co-financing costs, costs for payment of interests and Loan principal, and costs for
operation of the Customs information system (US$91.8 million), the Project has achieved a
high level of economic and fiscal effectiveness.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Project-financed surveys were performed in 2006, 2008-9, 2010, 2011 and 2012. A
detailed report was prepared and shared with the Bank. (See the project files.) The
report provides a nuanced picture of impressions by the trading community, other state
agencies, and customs staff on a variety of topics. The salient results are summarized
below.

The trading community reported generally positive or strongly positive impressions over
time (1200 respondents – from a country-wide and a broad manufacturing and natural
resource sample). See Table 5.1.

          system improves transparency of custom
          administration: “to a significant extent”



Customs staff reported somewhat more mixed or muted positive impressions over time
(180 respondents and 72 from the pilots). Presumably this reflects the burden of
affecting the modernization initiatives. See Table 5.2.

A comparative analysis in 2011 of the trading community’s responses to developments in
the pilot areas versus the overall customs administration indicate that pilot areas DO
NOT show advantages in speed of clearance, transparency or overall service quality.
However, respondents within the pilot areas DO indicate improvements in many areas /
factors (including speed of clearance, transparency, service quality). This suggests that
the pilot areas do not constitute a “controlled experiment” in that some of the important
innovations are system wide (such as those in the legal/regulatory/organizational
arrangements). Additionally, the modernization program remains a work-in-progress. So
many of the innovations to be deployed in the pilot region first (notably the UAIS) were
not yet in place or yet fully effective. This is consistent with the staff in the pilot areas
judging aspects of the modernization effort more positively than customs staff at large
(i.e., the effects of the modernization initiatives in the pilots had not yet fully worked
through to impacts on the trading community).

2011 narrative/textual interviews of “expert representatives” from state authorities,
professional associations, NGOs (180 respondents and 72 from the pilots) indicate that:
(a) The modernization program (international norms, information systems modernization,
e-declarations, staff training, etc.) is absolutely necessary. (b) The program is clearly a
work-in-progress which is thus difficult to definitively assess at this point. (c) Despite its
ambitious scope, the program coverage/implementation is less comprehensive than it
needs be to address the observed deficiencies in customs. (d) There are areas, such as
information sharing, for which the FCS systems remain disappointing. (e) Requirements
associated with e-signatures are not as streamlined as they could be.

External Survey Results. As analyzed by the Bank team and summarized in a July 2011
Europe & Central Asia Region Knowledge Brief (Volume 41), external surveys (Business
Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey – BEEPS; Logistics Performance Index
– LPI; and the World Economic Forum Enabling Trade Index – ETI) present a broadly
consistent and relatively encouraging picture of the performance of customs in the RF
over the period 2005-2010. Problems with customs regulations trend down in the BEEPS
and LPI data. LPI and ETI data indicate export clearance efficiency is higher than import

                                                   58
clearance (associated with revenue collection and community protection processes),
which is consistent with the internal data and the project-financed surveys. On
transparency and corruption, the external surveys diverged somewhat, with BEEPS
showing improvements and the LPI and ETI indicators showing higher or deteriorating
reported incidences (respectively). 2013 BEEPS data indicate a stalling of progress
between 2010-2013. The number of documents and time for import and for export show
improvement in only the time to export data. Costs to import and to export are up sharply
in 2013. 2012 LPI results indicate custom administration and cross-border trade
environment generally lag the Europe and Central Asia averages as well as Upper Middle
Income averages. In short, the CDP helped the RF move forward in terms of trade
facilitation and international orientation. However, much work remains to sustain and
further advance the reforms.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

A separate Stakeholder Workshop was not held. The CDP incorporated a sequence of in
depth stakeholder surveys in 2006, 2008-9, 2010, 2011 and 2012. (Please see Annex 5
for a summary of the findings.)

  Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

  Annex 2 summarized the FCS’s detailed implementation completion report and
  evaluation of project efficiency and effectiveness (see project files). Three issues in the
  Borrower’s ICR merit consideration:

i)    Ratings: A comparison of Bank and Borrower ratings (Table 7.1) indicates similar
      ratings on all aspects. The FCS ICR provides reasoned explanations for the ratings,
      while this ICR provides justifications for the Bank’s ratings.

   Borrower overall                Satisfactory          Satisfactory

ii)   Exogenous developments affecting implementation and impact: The major
      developments included (a) changes to the legal and institutional framework affecting
      customs’ operating environment such as the adoption of the Customs Code (2004),
      creation of the Customs Union and Common Economic Space (2010) and Russia’s
      2012 accession to the WTO; (b) laws to reform the public service (2003) and the
      civil service (2004) and their implementation (2003-2007 and 2008-2013), which
      resulted in new processes for competitive recruitment, performance evaluation and
      performance-based remuneration – these mainly affected the Human Resource
      Management and Training component; (c) public financial management reforms
      including the introduction from 2004 of medium-term expenditure planning and
      program- and results-based budgeting (when a Budget Process Reform Concept was
      adopted) – these facilitated the project’s results-based approach and increased the
      significance of the results framework and of results collection and reporting, but also
      led to some budget-reform related activities being financed from budget funds rather
      than from CDP resources; (d) administrative reforms (2004) which led to the creation
      of federal executive authorities including the transition of the SCC to the FCS and
      later – since 2008 – increased emphasis on provision of IT-enabled public services
      (the latter facilitating the introduction of electronic customs declarations earlier
      referred to) and increased the significance of electronic systems of interaction
      between the FCS and other federal entities since federal agencies were mandated to
      avoid demanding the same documents from service users and clients over and over
      again (2010 Law no. 210-FZ) and (e) increased federal emphasis on anti-corruption
      (through 2008 Law no. 273-FZ) which facilitated the use of project outputs on
      improving FCS integrity across the FCS to implement federal and sectoral anti-

                                              61
       corruption policy. Overall such exogenous developments positively impacted the
       project and especially the significance and sustainability of its results and outcomes.
       In addition, the FCS estimates that during the course of implementation, 208 external
       changes impacted information technology-related project activities and
       implementation timelines, affecting IT activities costing about US$87 million (about
       70% of the total cost of the IT component). The Bank agrees with the above
       assessment.

iii)   Underestimation of macroeconomic assumptions: The FCS points out that the
       differences were significant (Table 7.2) and affected the assessment of the project’s
       economic and financial costs and benefits. The Bank agrees with this assessment.

Annex 10. Summary of Appraisal Diagnostics and Project Activities

                                 Appraisal Diagnostics
The following recaps the appraisal diagnostic analysis of customs administration in the
Russian Federation (circa 2002):

   Legal Framework
    o The need to address the (then current) Customs Code’s ambiguities, loopholes,
       and high degree of discretion for individual customs officials and customs
       administration to interpret the Code; lack of support for (revenue) risk-based
       examination, electronic filing, streamlined procedures, and other inconsistencies
       with Kyoto and WTO norms as well as other trade-facilitation measures; the need
       to mitigate the administrative burdens and constraints on customs administration
       arising from the laws pertaining to VAT and excise administration, currency
       control, banking activity, procurement, and the enforcement of administrative
       penalties.

   Fiscal Policy and Practices
    o The need to expand the narrow base of custom revenue sources (in terms of firms
        and goods); the need to reduce the high level and complex structure of tariffs
        (including exemptions and preferences); the need to align custom fees with the
        corresponding administrative costs; the need to address the substantial stock and
        flow revenue arrears; the need to improve the less-than-robust revenue planning
        function (and reduce the pressure for customs to focus on fulfilling revenue
        targets and rather than its proper role in the confirmation, facilitation, and
        enforcement of trader/broker/traveler compliance to the Customs and Tax Codes).

   Customs Procedures
    o The need to streamline excessive goods clearance documentation requirements;
       the need to shift away from (some) arbitrary valuation methods; the need to
       address the limited additional revenue yield (assessments and penalties) arising
       the high rate of physical inspection; the need to fill gaps in valuation information
       and processing capacities that are required to support (revenue) risk-based
       selection of cargo for inspection; the need to strengthen the risk-based allocation
       of anti-smuggling personnel and resources; the need to strengthen VAT
       information exchange with RF State Tax Service (and abate VAT fraud); the need
       to expand traders’/brokers’ options for financial guarantees, securities and
       deferments; the need to expand cross-border harmonization of customs control of
       goods.

   Consultative Practices
    o The need to sustain and extend the good practices the SCC has adopted in trader
       community relations (including the SCC Advisory Council on Customs Policy,
       the relevant working groups of the Foreign Investment Advisory Council).


                                            65
   Accountability, Transparency, and Anti-Corruption
    o The need to develop and implement an integrated and cross-cutting administrative
       integrity program, including organizational responsibilities, human resource
       policies and practices, a code of ethics, technical and technological controls over
       administrative processes, legislative and regulatory improvements, as well as
       stakeholder relations and feedback mechanisms.

   Dispute Resolution
    o The need to strengthen SCC legal representation before the courts, as well as the
       courts’ understanding of the relevant Customs and Tax Codes (including issues
       arising from the CIS customs union); the need to strengthen the administrative
       appeals process (including clarifications to the new Code on Administrative
       Offenses, which will govern fines and penalties).

   Organization
    o The need to address financial and human resource rigidities imposed by the
       distinct legal identities of the customs bodies in the administrative subdivisions of
       the RF; the need to follow-up the review and standardization of the structure of
