                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to reform and modernize the Russian Customs administration, with a view to: (a) promote internationally acceptable
                         practices for processing of international trade flows by Customs, so as to further integrate the country into the world trading community, improve the
                         investment climate and secure the benefits from foreign and domestic investments in the economy; and (b) increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs
                         Code and ensure uniformity in its application, to support macro-economic stability and increase transparency, timely transfer of collected revenues to the
                         Federal budget, and equity and predictability in customs operations. The project would promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of
                         international trade flows by Customs by: (a) adopting Customs standards that facilitate trade through the implementation of procedures to expedite the
                         processing of low-risk transactions while improving the detection and prevention of contraband; (b) facilitating international commerce and accession of the
                         Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization (WTO); (c) fostering a stronger partnership between Customs and participants of foreign economic
                         activities; (d) transforming the mindset of SCC officers towards the trade activity from one of protection of the domestic economy to one of facilitating legitimate
                         international commerce; (e) implementing improved business processes and automated systems designed to increase efficiency and reduce discretion and
                         opportunities for rent seeking behavior; and (f) modernizing the Information Technology infrastructure of the SCC, and adopting standardized, highly automated
                         operational procedures, including electronic filing of declarations, which would reduce the level of discretion by customs officers, and e-Government facilities
                         for information and interaction with the trade community. The project would increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its
                         application by: (a) adopting standardized and automated procedures countrywide to facilitate voluntary compliance and reduce compliance costs; (b)
                         improving the knowledge and training of participants in foreign economic activities about the customs laws and procedures; (c) improving transparency,

                         uniformity and predictability of Customs actions; (d) implementing efficient dispute resolution procedures; (e) improving enforcement capacity against
                         smugglers and tax evaders through improved risk management, intelligence, investigation, improving efficiency of inspection activities, including post-release
                         audit of goods and vehicles; (f) further developing the organization of the SCC and its management systems to increase overall organizational effectiveness; (g)
                         enhancing professional integrity and skills of SCC officers; and (h) improving the conditions for countrywide training and retraining of SCC officers.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The key performance indicators show a significant improvement from the baseline values in 2003 through the first quarter of 2011. Values for
                         the percentage of import and non energy export declarations selected for physical inspection have declined 80% and 89% respectively over the life of the project. This exceeds the
                         end of project target values. Average customs clearance times at the border have been reduced from 45 minutes to 16 minutes, an improvement in efficiency of 63%. Similarly, the
                         average customs clearance time in lodging has been reduced from 40 hours to 7 hours, a reduction of 83%, exceeding the end of project target of a 50% reduction. The compliance
                         gap indicator also has exceeded the end of project target value. One indicator target remains to be met, the rate of enforced compliance, which showed progress in 2008 and 2009,
                         but most recent data show a slippage in 2010. Overall, the indicators show that the Russian Federation has made significant progress in meeting the project objectives, specifically by
                         increasing efficiency and reducing opportunities for rent seeking behavior.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project continues to being implemented well. Disbursements stand at USD 109 million or 78 %, up from 67% in November 2010. Recent developments warrant another two year
                         extension of the project. The Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is resulting in changes to the Customs Code and other regulations which have to be reflected in the
                         business applications funded under the project. In particular, changes will have to be made to components and sub-systems of the Unified Automated Information System currently
                         being implemented under the project. The World Bank has expressed its support to the extension in formal communications with the Federal Customs Service. The Ministry of
                         Economic Development provided its formal endorsement of the extension in March this year and a request for extension of the project was received from the Ministry of Finance in
                         June. An extension can be initiated on this basis.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
