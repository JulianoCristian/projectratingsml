                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to reform and modernize the Russian Customs administration, with a view to: (a) promote internationally acceptable practices for
                         processing of international trade flows by Customs, so as to further integrate the country into the world trading community, improve the investment climate and secure
                         the benefits from foreign and domestic investments in the economy; and (b) increase taxpayer compliance with the Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its
                         application, to support macro-economic stability and increase transparency, timely transfer of collected revenues to the Federal budget, and equity and predictability in
                         customs operations. The project would promote internationally acceptable practices for processing of international trade flows by Customs by: (a) adopting Customs
                         standards that facilitate trade through the implementation of procedures to expedite the processing of low-risk transactions while improving the detection and
                         prevention of contraband; (b) facilitating international commerce and accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organization (WTO); (c) fostering a
                         stronger partnership between Customs and participants of foreign economic activities; (d) transforming the mindset of SCC officers towards the trade activity from one
                         of protection of the domestic economy to one of facilitating legitimate international commerce; (e) implementing improved business processes and automated systems
                         designed to increase efficiency and reduce discretion and opportunities for rent seeking behavior; and (f) modernizing the Information Technology infrastructure of the
                         SCC, and adopting standardized, highly automated operational procedures, including electronic filing of declarations, which would reduce the level of discretion by
                         customs officers, and e-Government facilities for information and interaction with the trade community. The project would increase taxpayer compliance with the
                         Customs Code and ensure uniformity in its application by: (a) adopting standardized and automated procedures countrywide to facilitate voluntary compliance and
                         reduce compliance costs; (b) improving the knowledge and training of participants in foreign economic activities about the customs laws and procedures; (c) improving
                         transparency, uniformity and predictability of Customs actions; (d) implementing efficient dispute resolution procedures; (e) improving enforcement capacity against
                         smugglers and tax evaders through improved risk management, intelligence, investigation, improving efficiency of inspection activities, including post-release audit of
                         goods and vehicles; (f) further developing the organization of the SCC and its management systems to increase overall organizational effectiveness; (g) enhancing

                         professional integrity and skills of SCC officers; and (h) improving the conditions for countrywide training and retraining of SCC officers.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Key performance indicators show significant improvements through the second quarter of 2011 from the 2003 baseline values:
                         1. Values for the percentage of import and non-energy export declarations selected for physical inspection have declined 89% and 83% respectively over the life of the project - this
                         exceeds end-of-project target values.
                         2. Average customs clearance times at the border have been reduced from 45 minutes to 16 minutes, an improvement in efficiency of 64%.
                         3. The average customs clearance time in lodging has been reduced from 40 hours to 7.3 hours, a reduction of 82% - exceeding the end-of-project target of a 50% reduction.
                         4. The compliance gap indicator has also exceeded the end of project target value.

                         One indicator target remains to be met: the rate of enforced compliance. This showed progress in 2008 and 2009, but most recent data show a slippage in 2010. Data for 2011 is
                         awaited.

                         Overall, the indicators show that the Russian Federation has made significant progress in meeting the project objectives, specifically by increasing efficiency and reducing
                         opportunities for rent-seeking behavior.

                         Most procurement packages are procured and are in the process of being implemented.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project continues to be implemented well. Disbursements stand at USD 123.1 million or 88 %, up from 67% in November 2010.

                         Developments on the ground warranted another two-year extension of the project in June 2011. The Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is resulting in changes to
                         the Customs Code and other regulations which have to be reflected in the business applications funded under the project. In particular, changes have to be made to components and
                         sub-systems of the Unified Automated Information System currently being implemented under the project. The revised closing date is now June 30, 2013.
