satisfactory; risk to development outcome was moderate;\n            Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower performance\n            was also satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes:\n            customs (in fact all revenue administration) reforms can\n            succeed only with strong high level political will and\n            commitment complemented by sustained technical support from\n            the entity itself. A medium to long-term strategic vision,\n            owned by the implementing agency, is a prerequisite for\n            sustained revenue administration reform and\n            capacity-building. Successful customs reforms must address\n            institutional constraints to customs performance, and not\n            center reforms exclusively on information technology and\n            systems solutions. Business process re-engineering and\n            related automated applications must be fully (though\n            gradually) integrated throughout the customs administration,\n            with appropriate management of the organizational transition\n            (including human resource and training aspects) as central\n            elements of this process. Creation of a sustainable revenue\n            administration system requires changes to the policy/legal\n            and institutional frameworks as well as administrative\n            actions to support institutional reforms. Strong and\n            consistent support for customs modernization from the head\n            of customs is essential for sustained reform. A dedicated\n            project implementation/management team needs to work\n            effectively with key operational parts of customs in\n            supporting and coordinating reforms, rather than succumbing\n            to time-driven pressures and becoming directly involved in\n            implementing reforms. Appropriate sequencing of\n            reform/modernization activities is critical to their success\n            and to the achievement of intended development outcomes.\n            Complex, risky and longer-term public sector institutional\n            reforms can often benefit from World Bank support in\n            significant ways, not often appreciated or understood."}, "docdt": "2013-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
