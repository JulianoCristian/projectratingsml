REPORT AND REOOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR THE FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US $78.0 million
to India.
PART I - IIISTORICAL
2.        The Association made two credits, totalling IJS $75 million, to
finance the foreign exchange costs of the telecommunications expansion
program in India which was initiated during the Third Five-Year Plan
(1961-66). In addition, a combined Bank and Association project for
US $55 million was approved in June, 1969, to provide much of the foreign
exchange needed for the telecommunications program for the first three
years of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-743. At the same time, parallel
financing was obtained through a loan of US $32.5 million (later increased
to US $35 million) from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
to meet the cost of selected items over the whole five year program.
3.        The proposed credit would finance the foreign exchange requirements
necessary for the balance of the Fourth Plan period to complete the telecom-
munications expansion program being carried out and administered by Posts
and Telegraphs (P&T), a department of the Government of India (GCI).
4.        The project was appraised in November/December 1970.    At negotia-
tions in March,1971, the Borrower was represented by Mr. B.S. Rau, Member,
PIT Department; Mr. Uma Shankar, Deputy Director General (Accounts);
Mr. A.K. Gupta, Depu-ty Chief Engineer; and Mr. G.V. Ramakrishna, Joint
Secretary, Llupartment of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance.
U5.       The Bank has made 39 loans and the Association 30 credits of which
7 loan,,s and 9 credits 1are not yet fully disbursed.  The following is a sum-
mary st,atement of these loans and credits as at February 28, 1971:

Not yet effective
6.        There have been delays in disbursing against a number of projects
in India.  Disbursements under Loan 307-IN (C_llieries Project) to the Indian
Iron and Steel Company have been delayed due to technical and management dif-
ficulties faced by blie Company in executing the project, including the change
from the originally contemplated open pit method of coal excavation to shaft
drilling, delays in land acquisition,and more recently mining problems result-
ing from the unusual geological nature of the area; revised mining plans and
a new schedule for the execution of the project should now permit completion
of the project by June 30, 1974, the revised Closing Date. A more detailed
description of the difficulties encountered in this project is set out in my
rnemorandum of July 9, 1970, to the Executive Directors (R 70-135); since
-t'.en, in December,1970, a review mission visited the project and found that
the management of the project had improved, arnd' _onfirmed that the revised
ischedule is being maintained.



7.        Loan Nos. 41l-IN and 515-IN, both to ICICI, may require post-
ponement of their closing dates because of the slow rate of withdrawals
by sub-borrowers who slowed up investment during the 1966-68 recession.
Construction work on the Beas project (Credit 89-IN) was seriously delayed
by the after effects of the Indian-Pakistan War and by supply delays of
some major pieces of equipment. A mission reviewed this project in
December, 1970, and agreed upon a revised disbursement schedule, calling
for completion in 1971.  Disbursement under the Sixth Industrial Imports
Credit (Credit 182-IN) has been unexpectedly slow. At the time the Credit
was signed in April, 1970, it was expected that full disbursement would have
taken place by March 31, 1971; to start with, GOI was reluctant to make
commitments before the IDA Credit had been approved. Subsequently, import
licenses were issued sparingly and only to those priority industries, which
were unable to use bilateral aid. Furthermore, although production has
recovered somewhat from the 1966-68 recession, neither production nor import
requirements have grown as fast as was expected. Import licenses against
the full amount of the Credit have been issued, and full disbursement is
expected before the end of 1971. Tenders for major items of expenditure
under Tarai Seeds (Loan No. 614-IN) and Punjab Agriculture (Credit No. 203-IN)
have recently been approved. A mission is in India to review progress on
the Tenth Railways Project (Credit No. 162-IN).
8.        In the case of the Third Telecommunications Project (Loan lbo. 615-IN
and Credit No. 153-IN), which was approved in June,1969, only about US $14
million has been disbursed so far, but procurement action has been taken for
the full amount; we expect that disbursements will have reached US $50 million
by March,1972 and will be completed before the closing date (December 31,1972).
9.        Since 1957, IFC has made thirteen commitments in India totalling
US $42.3 million, of which US $34.0 million represents loans and US $8.1
million equity. As of February 28, 1971, US $15.7 million of this total had
been disbursed and US $14.7 million cancelled or repaid leaving US $11.9
million undisbursed. The largest commitment is a total of US $18.0 million
to Zuari Agro-Chemicals fox' a fertilizev plant in Goa.
10.       Negotiations have recently been completed on a proposed credit for
a second Power Transmission project. Other projects in various stages of
preparation for submission to the Executive Directors before June 30, 1971
are agricultural credit projects in Tamil Nadu and Haryana, Pochampad Irriga-
tion and Cochin Fertilizer.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROFOSED CREDIT
11.       Borrower:            India, acting by its President
Beneficiary:         Posts and Telegraphs Department of
the Government of India
Purposo:            To help F-inance the completion of the
PST's expansion program of its telecom-
irunicat-ions :facilities under the Fouirth
Five-Year Plan (196)9-74).



Amount:             US $78 million
Amortization:        In 50 years, including a 10-year period
of grace, through semi-annual installments
of i to 1% from June 15, 1981 through
December 15, 1990 and 13   from June 15,1991
through Decomber 15, 2020.
Service Charge:     3/4 of one percent per annum.
PART III - THE PROJECT
12.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Fourth Telecommunications
Project - India" (PU-64a) is attached.
13.       P&T is now approaching the mid-point of the Fourth Five-Year Plan
(1969-74), in which the telecommunications expansion program is estimated to
cost Rs. 4,888 million, or US $652 million equivalent, of which US $168 miilion
is required to meet foreign exchange costs. Of the total program costs, approx-
imately 45 percent will be met from internally generated funds with the remain-
der coming mainly from government loans including the proceeds of aid financing
from CIDA and IDA. Over the first three years of the program, the foreign ex-
change costs will be met from the Third Telecommunications Project (Loan 615-IN/
Credit 153-IN) totalling US $55 million and the Canadian credit of US $35 million
equivalent. The proposed credit for US $78 million would cover the foreign ex-
change requirements for the remaining two years of the Plan period. It would
finance direct imports amounting to US $26 million (including items such as
local exchange systems, coaxial cable, and two microwave systems) and indirect
imports amounting to US $52 million representing the foreign exchange content
of locally manufactured goods.
14.       The original Fourth Plan targets called for the connection of
600,000 new subscribers by March, 1974, to make a total of 1.35 million;
expanding long distance networks by radio and cable, to provide 26,000
additional trunk channels; increasing trunk exchange capacity; and ex-
tending facilities to permit an increase of 9,300 telex services. Some
of these targets have had to be lowered by about 10 percent on account of
supply difficulties but, generally speaking, performance has been satis-
factory and the revised schedule should be met.
15.       The size of the country, the wide dispersion of industry, and the
traffic between the Central Government and the 16 State capitals combine to
impose enormous demands on the telecommunications system. Over the last
decade, the system has expanded at a high rate compared with other develop-
ing countries. Nevertheless, only about two-thirds of present demand can
be met and the long distance network is seriously overloaded. In these
circumstances, the Telecommunications Branch has wisely decided to concen-
trate on achieving a balance between the number of subscribers connected
and the capacity of the system to meet their requirements. However, a
consequence of this approach will be that unsatisfied demand for nerw connec-
tions will probably double by 1974 to reach one million.



16.       Although technical management is sound, P&T has recognized the
need for improvement in the administration of the Telecommunications Branch,
and in particular in financial management. The Administrative Reforms Com-
mission has already submitted its recommendations on the reorganization of
the Telecommunications Branch and the recommendations are presently being
considered by the Government of India. P&T has agreed to discuss with the
Association the reforms which are finally proposed. On financial manage-
ment, P&T has been alive to the need for a proper commercial basis for
accounting to be developed. The Association has supported P&T's efforts
in this field but initially progress was slow, and it was not until 1965
that the review by consultants proposed under the first credit was completed.
Subsequently, it took some time for other departments of GOI to accept the
consultants proposals but finally these formed the basis of the program for
reorganization agreed to under the Third Telecommunications Project. Since
then progress has been satisfactory. Under the proposed credit, P&T has re-
affirmed its intention to maintain the new organization and procedures as
well as to introduce some further modifications. These improvements have
brought about a more realistic basis on which to judge performance. The
tariff covenant under the Third Project calling for a financial rate of
return of at least 11 percent has been satisfactorily maintained, and P&T
has agreed that the same tariff covenant should be applied under the pro-
posed credit. The internal financial rate of return is estimated at 16 percent.
17.       Procurement would follow established procedures.   Equipment to be
imported directly by P&T would be subject to international competitive bid-
ding. The foreign exchange content of purchases made by P&T from government
factories would be reimbursed in accordance with the formula set out in
para 3.18 of the appraisal report; and about US $7 million of proprietary
items wouldbe imported by these factories. This procedure follows that of
earlier projects. The output of government factories is competitive on an
international basis in terms of both price and quality. Moreover, the pur-
chasing procedures of factuarie, opera-ting under government regulations,
ensures that raw materials are bought at the best price available on the
international market. Experience with telecommunications projects has shown
that the lead time for much of the equipment can extend to as much as two
years.    If the proposed    credit is approved now, new supplies can be
expected to start arriving sometime between March and June, 1972, that is
to say, just when the supply of equipment under the third project would
have been completed.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Credit Agreement be-tween India and the Association, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the pro-
posed credi-t are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
19.       The draft agreement incorporates the procurement provisions explained
in paragraph 17 above and the rate of return covenant referred to in paragraph
16 above. No additional conditions of effectiveness have been included.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       The last economic report entitled "Econornic Situation and Prospect:,
of India" (SA-13a) was distributed on April 2h, 1970.   This roeport indicated
that the economy was moving out of' the recession,, brought about primarily
by the effect of two bad harvest years in 1965/66 and 1966/67.   It also re-
ported an encouraging improvement in the balanco of' paynents. Investrnent,
however, was not increasing as quickly as desired. Similar trends are ex-
pected to be shown in the economic report for 1971, which is presently being
prepared. India still requires substantial aid on concessionary terms for
economic development purposes.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Credit.
