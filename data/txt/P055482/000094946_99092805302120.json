The\n            components call for: 1) strengthening the public health\n            surveillance system, to be implemented nationally. It will\n            strengthen the Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS)\n            institutional capacity, in order to make informed decisions\n            on prevention control, better monitor changes in health\n            trends, and allocate resources effectively. 2) Improved\n            disease control, will be strengthened through institutional\n            building at provincial levels, to better monitor disease,\n            control and prevent such diseases. Namely, febrile\n            illnesses, such as tuberculosis and dengue, in high\n            incidence areas will be controlled, as well as other\n            infectious and emergent diseases. 3) The health promotion\n            component will strengthen MSAS capacity, to implement a\n            strategic promotion on health, through education, social\n            mobilization, and policy advocacy. Training will be provided\n            for dissemination practices, and required infrastructure\n            rehabilitation and equipment, will be provided under this\n            component. 4) Administrative costs will finance the Project\n            Coordinating Unit over a four year period."}, "docdt": "1999-09-24T00:00:00Z"}
