The lessons learned included the following:\n            (1) the Project showed that the achievements of the\n            activities and their sustainability were strengthened when\n            it was able to work in coordination with other national\n            agencies (INDEC, other Secretariats or Ministries); (2) the\n            usefulness of the funding mechanisms to finance the\n            Subprojects was apparent and although their social or\n            sanitary impact was reduced, they serve as producers of\n            local capabilities that strengthen the development of\n            national and provincial policies; (3) an adjustment of the\n            administrative procedures and the strengthening of local\n            management capacities is needed, in order to successfully\n            complete these sub-projects; (4) the strategy used through\n            the operational research projects and the support provided\n            to the municipalities made it possible to expand the public\n            capacity and mobilize civil society resources; and (5) one\n            of the principal lessons in the relation with the provinces\n            is the need to structure a national surveillance and health\n            promotion system with sufficient resources and active\n            presence beyond the weaknesses of the institutional capacity\n            of the provinces."}, "docdt": "2006-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
