Overall\n            World Bank and Borrower performances were rated marginally\n            satisfactory. These are some of the lessons learned: In\n            complex project designs, think through clearly priorities\n            and the sequencing of actions and build in implementation\n            flexibility--some project components will always advance\n            quickly and others will lag. When policy reforms are subject\n            to reversals and when elections will be held in the near\n            future, hold discussions with leaders of the sector in\n            opposition political parties. Include political experts on\n            preparation teams to provide guidance on minimizing the risk\n            of policy reversal and to advise on how best to appeal to\n            the interests of stakeholders and political actors who may\n            oppose or potentially oppose reforms. When a project expects\n            to significantly change behaviors and the rules of the game,\n            include institutional experts on preparation teams to advise\n            on strategies and priorities for doing so. When planning\n            large scale civil works in a country where the Bank lacks\n            much experience, engage local experts to lay out all the\n            steps, estimate the time involved with each, and advise on\n            how to reduce time. For complicated procurement, involve a\n            regional procurement adviser in an early mission to\n            participate in the solution of technical issues and to\n            emphasize to the Government the importance of procurement expertise."}, "docdt": "2001-11-08T00:00:00Z"}
