nation's changed and changing social and\n            economic needs; b) operates efficiently; and c) mobilizes\n            greater private finance and distributes the costs of\n            education more equitably. There are six components in this\n            project. First, Policy and Institutional Development will\n            support the introduction and strengthening of key policy and\n            administrative reforms in allocation of students and\n            finance; administration of higher education; teaching\n            programs; tuition charges and student loans; and private\n            higher education. Second, Higher Education Institutes\n            Investment Program will reduce costs by consolidating\n            single-purpose institutions into multi-faculty colleges and\n            universities. Third, Management Information System will\n            finance development of strategy and process redesign;\n            software development; upgrading of information technology\n            networks; and training. Fourth, Management Capacity\n            Development will support increased management capacity in\n            planning, financial management, information systems,\n            academic reform, and policy analysis. Fifth, Student Loan\n            Program will develop a loan program based on a state\n            guarantee of repayment. Sixth, Project Management and\n            Project Preparation Facility will finance the establishment\n            and operation of the Project Management Unit."}, "docdt": "1998-01-30T00:00:00Z"}
