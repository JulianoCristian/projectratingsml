Borrower                   Republic o f Malawi

Implementing Agency        MinistryofFinance
Amount                     SDR13.1 million (US$20.0 million).
Tranching                  One Tranche to be released at effectiveness.
Closing Date               30 June, 2008
Description                The proposed Grant is the first PRSC' to assist the reformprogram o fthe
                           Government o fMalawi (GoM) as it implements the Malawi Growth and
                           Development Strategy (MGDS). The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
                           (Report No. 38326-MW) envisages that over a period o f three years, there
                           could be a series o fthree proposed annual Development Policy Credits.
                           This Grant's reform program supports efforts by the Government inthe
                           following areas: (i)      functioning o f agricultural markets with a focus on the
                           establishment o f additional auction floors for agricultural products, and
                           having inplace a better targeted andmore private sector inclusive system
                           o fproviding fertilizers and seeds to farmers; (ii)     improving the business
                           environment through the establishment o f a commercial court; (iii)
                           economic governance with a focus on reforms that improve payroll
                           management and external financial accountability o f the GoM. The
                           operation draws on a new framework for budget support that has been
                           developed under the leadership o f the Government o f Malawi (GoM) with
                           six participating donors, including IDA. It comprises o f a new multi-year
                           Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) and a review process aimed
                           at reducing transaction costs for all parties involved. A revisedjoint
                           memorandumo f understandingi s expected to be entered into shortly.
Benefits                   PRSC-1 i s part o f a series o fthree operations. The first benefit o f PRSC-1
                           is that it lays a foundation for a mediumterm reform program to be
                           supported under the series. Secondly, it provides a framework for IDA to
                           stay engaged insome o f the reforms that were supported under the
                           previous structural adjustment credit but not yet completed. The whole
                           PRSC program also has expected benefits as follows: (i)            itwill contribute
                           towards the bridgingo f a financing gap that exists inthe implementation
                           o fthe Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS); (ii)                 the policy
                           and institutionalreformswill helpconsolidate the macroeconomic gains
                           that Malawi has registered over the last three years, (iii)       it will contribute
                           towards improving aid effectiveness bybeingpart o f a harmonized

 "PRSC program" will be used to describe a series of PRSCs.

         approach to budget support, (iv) the expected impact on agricultural
         incomes, employment generation inthe private sector, andpublic service
         deliverywill contributetowards the achievement of the millennium
         development goals (MDGs).
Risks    The mainrisks overlap for a significant part with the risks identified inthe
         CAS and are: (i)   Political: Notwithstanding significant progress on the
         reform agenda andthe demonstrated resolve inregainingcontrol over the
         macro economic situation, the Governmenthas a minorityinparliament,
         which constrains its ability to forcehlly implementreforms. The political
         risk is compounded bythe fact that the next general elections are duein
         less than two years time (before May 2009). As a result, government may
         not be bold enough to undertake some o f the reforms that are likelyto be
         controversial. To mitigate this risk, IDA and its partners are encouraging
         the authorities to engage with parliament and civil society to disseminate
         andmake the case for the supported reforms andpolicies. In addition, the
         reforms supported bythe PRSC are focusing on implementation and
         seeing through o freforms for which legal changes are not immediately
         required. (ii)  Governance related: Deteriorationingovernance could
         negatively affect the Government's willingness to implement economic
         reforms. In order to mitigate this risk IDA hasjoined the CABS as a way
         o f intensifyingthe dialogue and increasing its leverage to ensure good
         governance. In addition, to influencing governance through its policy
         dialogue, IDA also assists the Government through its Financial
         Management, Transparency, and Accountability Project (FIMTAP)
         operation instrengthening its capacity to reduce the public sector's
         vulnerability to corruption. (iii)  Macro economic: Several risks threaten
         Malawi's macroeconomic stability, and growth prospects. In addition to
         the political risks to the implementation o fthe reforms program(as
         discussed above), the two major dangers are (a) the occurrence o f terms o f
         trade and/or weather related shocks, and (b) the upcoming elections in
         2009 which might reduce the Government commitment to spending
         control. Either o fthese two risks could endanger the plannedreduction in
         domestic debt, which i s needed to allow greater private sector investment
         and boost economic growth. To mitigate these potential threats, IDA in
         collaborationwith other donors will be supporting efforts by the
         Government to diversify the economy andto adopt a comprehensive ex-
         ante risk mitigation andcontingencyplanfor reducingthe country's
         vulnerability to drought. In addition, the CABS partners, including IDA,
         have increased predictability o f funding through the adopted process and
         timingo freviews which assist GoMwith its budgetplanning. To
         mitigate the risks o f fiscal slippage due to political pressure inthe run-up
         to the 2009 elections, the PRSC program, incombination with the other
         CABS partners, supports the efforts by the Government to strengthen
         PFMsystems andto develop aNationalDebt Policy, which are expected
         to reducethe country's vulnerability to fiscal slippage. (iv) Utilization o f
         funds: A risk exists that the composition o fpublic expenditures maynot

be hlly consistent with MGDS priorities. To mitigate this threat, the PAF
includes indicators andtargets aimed at improving the composition o f
expenditures. Further, as presented inthis document, the PRSC will be
supporting a reform agenda aimed at improving the budget process, and
strengthen the linkages between the budget andthe MGDS. (v)
Administrative capacity and coordination: Malawi's relatively limited
Government administrative capacity and coordination among relevant line
ministries anddepartments, compounded by the impact o fHIV/AIDS on
humancapacity ingeneral, could leadto delays inthe implementation o f
key measures. To mitigate this potential coordination failure, the
implementationarrangementsof the CABS partners includes a steering
committee with representation of all relevant line ministries and
departments involved.

                                   I. INTRODUCTION

1.           This program document presents a proposed FirstPoverty Reduction Support
Grant (PRSC-1) to the Republic ofMalawi for SDR 13.1 million (US$20 million
equivalent), which i s the first ina series o fthree annual programmatic development
policy lending(DPL) operations, with a plannedtotal o fUS$75 million, to assist the
Government'sreform program insupport o fthe Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS).2 A new framework for budget support has beendeveloped under the
leadership o f the Government o f Malawi (GoM) with six participating donors, including
IDA.3 Itcomprises o fanewmulti-year Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), a
Joint Framework for Common Approach to BudgetSupport (CABS), and a review
process aimed at reducingtransaction cost for all parties involved. While the PRSC
operations togetherwith the contributionby the other CABS donors will provide
financial support for the implementation of the MGDS, each operation will disburse
against specific prior actions as identifiedinthe PAF.

2.           The proposed PRSC-1 selectively supports the reform efforts by the GoM in
the following areas (i)  hnctioning o f agricultural markets with a focus on the
establishment o f additional auction floors for agricultural products andhaving inplace a
better targeted and more private sector inclusive system o fproviding fertilizers and seeds
to farmers; (ii)  improvingthe business environment throughthe establishment o fa
commercial court; and (iii)    economic governance with a focus on reforms that improve
payroll management and external financial accountability o f the GoM.

3.           Malawi has made significant progress inthe past three years inrestoring
macroeconomic stability andwinning back the confidence o f donors. Since the current
Government came into office inMay 2004, it enforced strict fiscal discipline. The IMF
andthe Government agreedon a StaffMonitored Program (SMP) startingfrom July
2004. Following strong performance inthe implementation o f the SMP, a new Poverty
Reduction andGrowth Facility (PRGF) was approved inAugust 2005, andperformance
undertheprogramhasbeenbroadly ~atisfactory.~ 2005, the CABS donorsresumed
                                                         In
their assistanceto Malawi. The Government subsequentlyreachedthe HIPC completion
point inAugust 2006.

4.           A case canbemade for supporting Malawi's policy and institutionalreform
programs through a series of PovertyReduction Support Operations. The preparation o f
its first PRSP reflected a highlyparticipatory process that helpedinidentifying the key
development challenges that faced the country and its implementationprovided usefil
lessons on areas that are critical for Malawi to reduce poverty. Apart from restoring
macroeconomic stability, substantial reforms have also been undertaken to reduce

2007.

Commission, UnitedKingdom (DFID), Afiican DevelopmentBank, Norway and Sweden. The UNDP,
IMF andGermany(GTZ) have observer status. Irelandhas also expressedinterest to join the group.
 Malawi has already completedthree PRGFreviews, inFebruaryandAugust 2006, andinMarch2007,

corruption and strengthen public finance management. Notable governance-related
reforms have included the replacement in2003 o f the Public Finance andAudit Act to
provide separate Audit andPublic Financial Management Acts, thus increasingthe
independence and scope o fthe audit function; amendments in2004 o fthe Corrupt
Practices Act o f 1995, the development and operationalizationo f a new public
procurement system through the introduction o fnew legislationand regulations that
conform to international standards, andthe rolling out in2005 (after a long period o f
failed attempts inthe past) o f the IntegratedFinancial Management Information System
(IFMIS). The Government i s also continuing with the parastatal reform program that was
started under the previous structural adjustment credit. Inparticular, Malawi
Telecommunications Limitedwas privatized while ADMARC restructuringi s ongoing.
The country is now poisedto accelerate its pace o f growth andpoverty reduction. In
2006, the Government finalized the preparationo f a new PRSP, the Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy, whose main focus i s on accelerating growth as a strategy for
poverty reduction.

5.           .The proposed PRSCprogram aims to provide support to the Government as it
undertakes the necessary reforms for the successful implementation o fthe MGDS. In
particular, the PRSC will support policy changes that aim to create a conducive
environment for enhanced private sector-led growth while ensuring that vulnerability to
shocks i s dealt with at household as well as national level. It i s a programmatic
development lending operation that will provide financing insingle tranches on an annual
basis, insupport o f a program o freforms to be undertaken inthe medium-term. Itwill be
the Bank's instrument for providingbudget support to the Government withinthe context
o f the CABS arrangement. It is also envisaged that the PRSC program will have a
signaling effect inhelpingMalawi mobilize more resources that are critical to the
successful implementation o fthe MGDS.


                                   11.       COUNTRYCONTEXT

                                          A. CountryOverview

6.            Malawi i s a small country with population currently estimated at 12million
people and growing at an average o f 2 percent per annum.Average income per capita is
around US$160.5 With gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaging below 3 percent
this has translated into amodest 1percent increase inper capita incomes during 1996-
2005. Malawi also has relatively highinequalityinincome distribution, with a Gini
coefficient of 0.38. The poverty headcount was measured at 54 percent in2004/05
household survey, and has hardly changed since the previous household survey was
undertaken in 1997/98. Social indicators are also very weak. The maternalmortality ratio


5National Accounts estimates have beenrevised in2007. However, revised estimates were not yet
available at the time of writing, and therefore all National Accounts figures inthis document are based on
the old national account series. It should be pointed out, however, that the preliminary estimates from the
revised national accounts indicate that the level of GDP has been revisedupwards with an average o f
around 38 percent.


                                                     - 10-

i s currently at 984 per 100,000 live births and i s also one o f the highest inthe world.6
Nationwide, a staggering 44 percent o fpreschoolers are stunted (of which 18 percent are
severely stunted), irrespective o fhousehold income and level o f caloric intake.' Adult
literacy for males is 75 percent while that o f females is only 54 percent. A thirdo f the
population still uses unsafe water.

7.            Agriculture i s the mainstay o fthe economy, but i s very vulnerable to weather
shocks. The sector accounts for more than 80 percent ofMalawi's export earnings,
contributes 38 percent o f GDP, and supports 85 percent o f the population. Smallholders
makeup about three quarters o fagricultural production and are mostly engaged inrain-
fedmaizeproduction. The performance ofthe agricultural sector duringthe past decade
has beenhighly erratic due to the impact o frecurrent drought conditions, with the most
recent droughts in2001 and2005. Constrained by highreal interest rates (around 30
percent inreal terms between2001 and 2003), the manufacturingsector which has
averagedzero growth over the past decade, accounts for only 11percent o f GDP, and is
inward-orientedwith only 14percent o fmanufacturing output exported.

8.            There has beenlittle diversification o fthe economy, and Malawi's exports
remain heavily concentrated inagriculture, leaving the economy vulnerable to
fluctuations inagricultural commodity prices. Malawi i s landlocked andpoorly
integrated into the region, bothinterms o f trade andphysical infrastructure. Over recent
years, Malawi's export performance has lagged behindthe performance o f manyother
developing countries inthe region. Despitebeinga relatively open economy andhaving
non-reciprocal trade preferences with the EUand the US, exports grew by only 2 percent
inMalawiinthe past 10years (compared to 6.4 percent growthinworld exports). In
addition, trade remains highly dependent upon a limitedrange o fprimarycommodities
(mainly semi-processed tobacco, tea, and sugar; tobacco alone accounts for around 60
percent o f exports), reflecting limited success inpast Government policies to diversify
the export base out o fprimary product exports.

                            B. RecentEconomicDevelopmentsinMalawi

9.            Macroeconomic performanceunder the previous administration was
mediocre, as a result o fbothweather shocks andweak public expenditure management.
Economic growth has been volatile and feeble, averaging only about 3 percent between
1996 and 2005.' Mucho fthe poor economic performance has beendue to muted
smallholder agricultural production as a result o fweather shocks. The impact o f weather
shocks on the economy has been compounded by weak public expendituremanagement,
characterized by a series o f large fiscal deficits between 1999 and2004. Poor fiscal
management resultedinhighinflation, and a very rapid increase indomestic debt, which


  The total fertility ratio (per woman) is estimated to be 6.0, above the average for Africa, and partially
explains the highmaternal mortality ratio.
7 Stunted children are those children with a low ratio o f height for age. This indicates long-term or chronic
malnutrition.
  The combination o f the increased amount o f debt and the high interest rates meant that government's
domestic interest bill shot up to a massive 9.2 percent in2003/04 (or 40 percent o f revenues), thus
compromising the government's ability to allocate resources for critical poverty alleviating expenditures.


                                                     - 11-

increased from less than 3 percent in 1999/00 to 25 percent o f GDP in2003/04. The high
levels o f domestic borrowing pushedup interest rates, which remainedabove 20 percent
inrealterms between2000 and2004. Government borrowing also effectively `crowded
out' the funds for private investment inMalawi which dropped from 4.4 percent o f GDP
in1999to 1.5 percent in2003. Inaddition, continueddepreciationofthe exchange rate
over the past decade has increased the cost o fkey imports, such as fertilizer.

10.           The Government that came into office inMay 2004 has taken rapid steps to
improve the fiscal situation andpursue sustainable macroeconomic policies. The
administration has enforced strict fiscal discipline since 2004/05, and has already
established an unintemptedthree-year track record o f good macroeconomic
management. Improved macroeconomic management has beenreflected ingood
performance under the IMFprograms since June 2004, andMalawi recently completed
the third review o f the PRGFprogram inMarch2007.

11.           Reducingthe domestic debt has been the cornerstone o fthe fiscal strategy
embodied inthe Government's budgets over the past few years. Having inherited a
potentially unsustainable domestic debt spiral from the previous administration, the
Government has managed to reverse the trend. From a peak o f 25 percent o f GDP in
2003/04, domestic debt declined to 20 percent o f GDPby end2005/06, andi s projected
to fall to 14.8 percent by endJune 2007. This reduction has been achieved through a
substantial fiscal adjustment effort, which has resultedin(underlying) primarysurpluses,
allowing the domestic debt stock to decreaserapidly inreal terms.g

12.           The rapid improvement inthe (underlying) fiscal balance reflects a series o f
Government efforts to ensure sustainability o fpublic finances (see Table 2 for a summary
o f central government operations, and Annex 3 for details). Firstly,increased tax
revenues (from 14.1 percent o f GDP in2003/04 to 15.6 percent in2005/06) byrevising
the tax system in2005/06, to minimize any distortions and expand the tax base, as well as
strengthening tax administration and enforcement; secondly, improvements inthe ability
to forecast the wage bill (which was a source o f fiscal slippages during 2000-2004), by
introducing a wage reform in2004/05 to increase transparency and equity o fthe wage
structure, coupled by improvements inthe payroll management system; thirdly,
controllin expenditures (from 30.9 percent o f GDP 2003/04 to 26.3 percent in
2005/06)    1%bothby reducing non-priority expenditures, such as for State Residencies and


9The overall balance (including grants) has improved from -5.6% in2003/04 to -0.8% in2005106. Grants
have increased by 4.1 percent o f GDP during the same period(from 8.8% o f GDP in2003104to 12.9% o f
GDP in2005/06); however, the additional grants have largely beentied to finance additional expenditures
inhealth(underthe healthSWAP for 1.5% ofGDP) andthe humanitarianresponseto the2005 foodcrisis
(2.4% o f GDP). Hence, the domestic fiscal adjustment effort is best measured by the changes inthe
underlying balance. The `underlying balance' i s a measureo f the domestic adjustment effort which i s used
bythe IMF; specifically it is the domestic primarybalance, excluding maize operations andthe Health
SWAp. This indicator has moved from a deficit o f 1.3% o f GDP in2002103 and 0.6 in2003104, to a
surplus o f 1.3% o f GDP in2004/05 and 0.7% o f GDP in2005/06.
loThese numbers are net o f expenditures on the health SWAp, which i s donor financed and enters as an
increase inboth expenditures and grants; and net o f the maize imports for the 2005106 food crisis, also
largely financed by additional donor grants.

the Ministryo fForeign Affairs, andby allowing increases inother goods and services in
line with non-food inflation, rather thannominal GDP growth.

 13.          The above measuresreflect a strong political commitment to sustainable fiscal
policies andenforcement of fiscal discipline. Infact, while total revenues and grants
increased by 30 percent during2002/03 to 2006/07,'                 'total expenditures increased by
only 14percent. As can be seen fromAnnex 3, expenditure increases have been on
account o f increase inwages and salaries, pensions and gratuities, spending on fertilizer
subsidies, and development expenditure(both foreign anddomestic).                     l2

 14.          Consequently macroeconomic performance has rapidly improved over the
past few years. An improvedmacroeconomic environment and good weather resultedin
better thanhistorical average GDP growth in2004 when growth was at 5.1 percent and in
2006 when growth reached 8.4 percent, partially as a rebound from the severe drought
that hit Malawi in2005 (limitingGDP growth at 1.9 per~ent);'~and in2007 growthi s
projected at 5.7 percent (Table 1). Inflation declined from 17 percent at end-February
2006 to 9 percent at end-March 2007. With inflation and government borrowing
declining, the Central Bank has gradually reduced the nominal discount rate from 45
percent inSeptember 2003 to 17.5 percent inAugust 2007. As interest rates have been
declining, private investment has increased back to 3.7 percent o f GDP in2006.

 15.          Malawi also reached the HIPC Completion Point inAugust 2006 and
subsequently qualified for the MDRI. This resultedina decline o fMalawi's debt-to-
exports ratio from 229 percent to 32 percent. The nominal exchange rate has remained
fairly stable vis-a-vis the U S dollar (at around MK 140=USD l),                   initially as a result o f
Central Bank interventionsin2005/06, andmore recently reflecting a stronger real
exchange rate (from HIPC completionpoint andMDRIdebt relief). Gross foreign
exchange reserves at the Central Bankremain very low, however, with import cover at
 1.6 months o f imports as o fDecember 2006.




''Overthe  same period, grants increased from 7 percent to 18 percent o f GDP, mainly on account o f the
restorationo f donor confidence inMalawi following the change o f government in2004.
**The expenditure   control was also the result o f significant reforms inPublic Financial Management
(PFM) systems since 2004/05; inaddition to the payroll management reforms mentioned above, the IFMIS
i s now operational inall major districts (at the central level); about 1500government accounts by line
ministries have beenclosed and a centralized government account has been enforced.
l3 As aresult ofthe drought, national output ofmaize, which is Malawi's mainstaple crop, was 30 percent
lower than in2004.

            16.          Inadditionto poor fiscalperformance andexternal shocks, economic growth
            has also been significantly hampered by the impact o fHIV/AIDS. The adult prevalence
            rate o fHIV/AIDS inMalawi at the end o f 2004 was estimated at 14.2 percent. Studies on
            the evolutiono fthe epidemics estimate that by2010, the numbero fpeople with
            HIV/AIDSmay reach2 million. Inaddition, life expectancy is expected to drop further
            from 38 to 35 duringthe next ten years. While the magnitude o f the effect o fthe
            epidemic on GDP growth andper capita income differsinvarious studies depending on
            the model assumptions, there is strong consensusthat the epidemic is having a significant
            adverse impact on growth and p ~ v e r t y . 'Over the past few years, the Government has
                                                              ~
            improvedthe institutional and policy framework to combat HIV/AIDS, by establishing
            the NationalAids Commission(NAC), protecting financing for HIV/AIDS related
            activities, carrying out several information campaigns, andmainstreamingthe HIV/AIDS
            strategy inall Ministries. With funding from the three major international donors for
            HIV/AIDS (the Global Fund, PEPFAR andthe World Bank), since 2005 the Government
            has also beenimplementing successfully aprogram to rapidly expand provision o fART.
            The Government i s now seeking to secure fundingfor this program beyond 2009/10.

                                                C.Macroeconomic Outlook

            17.          The medium-termoutlook i s generally positive, providedthat the
            Government's macroeconomic program i s maintainedandprogress i s made ininsulating
            the economy against weather risk. The Government's macroeconomic stabilization
            program, which i s supported by an IMFPRGF program, provides a good basis for
            accelerated growth. Annual output growth is projectedto increase to approximately 5.5
            percent over the near term, and to drop to 4.5 percent inthe medium term (inline with the

            14Most studies estimate that GDP growth is adversely impacted inthe region o f 1-2percent per year,
            through lower labor productivity, lower public and private savings, and reduced capital formation, as public
            expenditures are diverted to meet growing health demands.


                                                             - 14-

regional long term average). Other macroeconomic variables are projected to improve as
well. After risingto around 15.5 percent in2005, year-on-year inflationhas been
declining reaching 11percent as of end-2006, andthe annual average rate is projected to
drop to around 7 percent inthe mediumterm. Inline with the reductionininflation,
nominal interest rates have also been falling, with the latest reductionby the Central
Bank inthe Discount Rate from 25 percent to 20 percent inNovember2006. Onthe
current account, the Government has affirmed its commitment to a flexible exchange rate
policy, as requiredbythe monetary framework andMalawi's limited external reserves.
The authorities are aiming to increase minimumexternal reserves from 1.5 months o f
import cover as o f end-2006 to above 3 months inthe medium-term.

18.          While these projections are inline with the growth rates achieved since 2004,
they are rather optimistic when compared to the historical average referred to earlier, and
takinginto account the likely (negative) reboundfrom the two goodharvests in2006 and
2007. The projections assume that GDP will recover from a prolongedperiod o fpoor
performance, due to both a combination o f an improvedmacroeconomic environment,
which will reduce Government `crowding out' o fprivate sector investment, and
implementation o fthe Government's policies to support agriculture, improvethe business
environment, andincrease investments ininfrastructure, inline with the MGDS. The
projections also assume that measures are implemented to insulatethe economy from the
debilitating impact o fperiodic drought.

19.          Reducing the domestic debt will remainat the center ofthe Government's
macroeconomic program. The steady retirement o f domestic public debt has beenthe
cornerstone o fthe fiscal strategy embodied inthe Government's budgetssince 2004/05,
andis relaxing avery important constraint on growth, byreducinggovernment crowding
out o fprivate investment. As a result of the reduced public borrowing and the lower
interest rates, privateinvestment has already increased from a trough o f 1.5 percent o f
GDPin2003 to 3.7 percent o fGDP in2006, anda further increase is expected over the
next few years. The reductioninthe domestic debt is assumed to continue steadily inthe
next few years. Inline with the Government's fiscal strategy, the plansto shrink
domestic debt to around 11.3 percent by end-June 2008. The domestic debt is then
projectedto decrease to 8.6 percent in2008/09, and 4.9 percent in2009/10. Most o fthe
reduction will be achieved by maintaining fiscal discipline, thereby allowing a reduction
inthe realvalue ofthe domestic debt stock; the Government is also targetingamodest
nominal repayment inthe draft 2007/08 budget. Remainingon track with the fiscal
stabilizationprogram, underpinnedby the IMFPRGF, therefore, will be a key
requirement for fbture budget support disbursements.

20.          Inadditiontotheimprovedmacroeconomic environment, thereductionof
interest payments on domestic debt, andthe debt relief from the HIPC and MDRI
initiatives, are generating muchneeded fiscal space which can be usedto accelerate
growth. The domestic interest billhas already decreasedby almost 4 percent o f GDP
over the past three years and, assuming the Government stays the course with its
macroeconomic stabilization program, it i s expected to reduce by a further 3 percent over
the next three years. The authorities planto use some ofthis fiscal spaceto enhance
growth by focusing on sectors that are identified as key for medium-term growth inthe


                                           - 1 5 -

MGDS. It is envisaged that the driving force behind growth inthe medium term will be
increased smallholder agricultural productivity and agro-processing to meet domestic and
foreign demand. This will partlydepend on the ability to improve the functioning o f
agricultural input and output markets, which is supported bythe PRSC program.

21.         Inthe long-term, apart from increased agriculturalproductivity, the MGDS
indicates that sectors such as miningand tourism hold some potential, although detailed
diagnostic work to ascertain the extent o fthis potentiali s required. More generally, it is
believed that given a conducive environment, these and other sectors will contribute more
extensively to the economy. This will depend, however, on addressing constraints that the
private sector faces when doing business inMalawi. The proposed PRSC program will
support reforms to address the relevant constraints.

22.          It should benotedthat the projections assumethe implementation o famuch
broader reformprogram o fwhich the measures to be supported under the PRSC are only
a part. They also assume the implementationo f investment programs invarious sectors,
some which are still under preparation.

23.          It should also be highlightedthat there are risks which could threaten the
macroeconomic projections summarized above. Political pressures on government
spending and the country's vulnerability to external shocks could easily derail the
macroeconomic stabilizationprogram. Continued fiscal discipline i s requiredto achieve
the plannedreduction indomestic debt, but such discipline maybecome increasingly
difficult to maintain for the current minority Government as it i s heading into pre-election
mode (for the 2009 presidential andparliamentaryelections). Also, the country's
vulnerability to external shocks can easily disrupt, or at least prolong, the adjustment
period duringwhich the country i s paying an enormous interest burden.

                24.             With prudent external borrowing, soundpublic debt management, and
                effective use o fborrowed resources, Malawi's fbture risk o f external debt distress i s
                expected to be moderate. As mentioned earlier, Malawi reached completion point o fthe
                Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative inAugust 2006. As a result o f HIPC
                andthe Multilateral Debt ReliefInitiative (MDRI), external debt declined from 229
                percent o f exports to 32 percent, inend-2005 net present value (NPV) terms. As a share
                o f GDP, external debt stock decreased from 143 percent to 33 percent. While the
                sensitivityanalysis shows that Malawi's NPV o fdebt-to-exports profile is going to
                remainbelow the HIPC threshold under a numbero f shocks, it i s only so inthe event that
                the authorities maintain sound macroeconomic and external borrowing policies over the
                mediumand longterm andaccelerate the implementation o f structural reforms. As
                discussed, domestic debt reductionwill remain at the center o fthe Government
                macroeconomic program.

                       111.   THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

25.          The Government's program i s set out inthe MGDS. The strategy outlines the
Government's economic growth and development priorities for the five years between
2006/07 and 2010/11. It seeks to achieve the aspirations o fMalawi as defined inVision
2020 and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Itbuilds on the Malawi Poverty Reduction
Strategy (2002), and integrates a number o fnew sector strategies, policies andemerging
issues, such as landreform, publidprivate partnerships, nutrition andHIV/AIDS. The
MGDSis organized around six themes: Sustainable Economic Growth; SocialProtection;
Social Development; Management and Preventiono fNutritionDisorders, HIV and
AIDS; InfrastructureDevelopment; and Good Governance. Eachtheme specifies
medium-term outcomes and strategies to achieve them. This result frarnework, however,
has not yet been underpinnedby a comprehensive list o f indicators for monitoring and
evaluation.

26.          The MGDS recognizes that strong andsustainable economic growth i s key to
reducing poverty. As indicated earlier, the long-term vision o fthe MGDS i s to make
Malawimore production and export oriented. The strategy seeks to achieve growth rates
o f at least 6 percent a year. Inthe mediumterm, the MGDS concentrates on agriculture
as the driver o f growth. It focuses on increasing agricultural productivity and integrating
smallholder farmers into commercial activities. Inthe long term, the Government has also
identified four sectors with potential for high growth: tourism, mining, manufacturing,
and agro-processing. There is also emphasis on infrastructuredevelopment andthe need
to create a conducive environment for export-led growth, buildingon sound
macroeconomic and public expenditure management.

27.          The MGDS also acknowledges the role o fhuman development and social
protectionineconomic growth andpoverty reduction. With regardto human
development, the strategy recognizes that a healthy and educated population is necessary
ifMalawiisto achieve sustainable economic growth. Italso fully recognizesthe
importance o freversingHIV trends inMalawi, as part o f contribution to economic
growth. Inconnectionwith social protection, the MGDS highlightsthe importance o f
increasing the assets o fthe poor and vulnerable so they can contribute to and benefit from
economic growth. The Government i s reviewing its social protectionpolicyto protect
those that may be left out due to their inability to actively participate inthe development
process.

28.          The MGDSnotes that weak implementationcapacity incentral andlocal
government may impede delivery o fthe MGDS objectives andprevent additional
resources that mightbecome available (from debt relief, increased aid or domestic
revenues) from beingused effectively. The Government has undertaken an assessmento f
capacity at decentralized levels o f Government and i s developing a planto buildthis
capacity.

29.          Malawi will need a significant scaling up o f external financing ifit is to meet
the objectives o fthe MGDS. While the Government is puttinginplace measuresto


                                            - 18-

increase revenues from domestic sources, these efforts are unlikely to be adequate to
enable Malawi to meet the various performance targets that have been set inthe MGDS.
Increased budget support will therefore be essential, and the PRSC program aims to
contribute to the financing requiredfor successful implementation o fthe MGDS.


          IV.    BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

                    A.     Linksto the CountryAssistance Strategy

30.         The proposed PRSC program is anintegralpart o fthe Bank'sassistance
program to Malawi as outlined inthe CAS. The current CAS for Malawi was approved in
February2007 and covers a four year period (FY07-10). The CAS i s fully aligned to the
MGDS andis designed to help the Government achieve four key outcomes: improving
smallholder agricultural productivity and integration into ago-processing; put inplace a
foundation for long- term economic growth through improved infrastructure and
investment climate; reducing vulnerability at the household level to HIV/AIDS and
malnutrition; and sustaining improvements inexpenditure management, transparency and
accountability. Inachieving these outcomes, the CAS provides for a programmatic
development lending operationevery year over the CAS period. It i s envisaged that up to
a third o fthe Bank's financial assistance could be provided through DPL operations
duringthe CAS period.

31.         The CAS provides an indication o f the role that the DPLs are envisaged to
playinsupportingthe MGDS. The CAS envisages that there will be a gradual scale up o f
resources provided through policy credits, assuming continued strong policy performance
i s maintained. An advantage of back-loading the amounts i s that the Bank will be flexible
inresponding to any shocks that maythreaten the Government's medium-termprogram.
For example, instead o fpreparinga supplemental credit, the Bankwould simply respond
to a drought by scaling up the amount o fthe DPL inthe relevant year (as long as the
Government maintains an adequatemacroeconomic policy framework, and i s
implementingthe overallprograminamanner satisfactory to the Bank).Interms o f
policy areas, the CAS envisages that the DPLwould support policyreforms that seek to
reduce key risks to the development o fmarkets. Secondly, the DPL would support policy
reforms that create a stable and conducive environment for private sector growth.
Thirdly, the CAS also envisages that the DPLwould seek to support policy
implementation aimed at strengthening the institutions o fpublic management and
improving transparency and accountability. Finally, the DPL will also seek to ensure that
the policies o fthe Government do notjeopardize debt sustainability. The specific
outcomes of the CAS to which the PRSC i s aligned are presented inAnnex 3.

                                B. Coordinationwith the IMF

32.         There will be constant coordination with the IMF at all stages o fthe PRSC
process. Maintenance o f sound macroeconomic management will be a precondition for
the implementation o fthe PRSC program. Therefore, staffwill work closely with the
IMFteam inorder to be current on Governmentperformanceunder the PRGFprogram.

Duringthe identificationo fprior-actions andtriggers for the PRSCprogram, attention
has also been paid to the benchmarks under the PRGFprogram to avoid cross-
conditionality.

                  C. CollaborationEIarmonizationwith Other Donors

33.         The PRSCprogram isbeingimplementedwithin the framework o fthe CABS.
The CABS is a group o fdonors that have ajoint approach to the provision o fbudgetary
support to the Government o fMalawi. InSeptember 2005, the CABS group and G o M
agreed on a Joint Framework (JF) for budget support cooperation designed to formalize
their relationship. The JF i s an agreement on principles governing budget support
cooperation inMalawi. Some o f the principles governing this cooperation include
alignment to the country's poverty reduction strategy, joint reviews, andpredictability o f
funding.

34.         The CABS Joint Framework among other thingsprovides for a Performance
Assessment Framework (PAF) on which to base disbursementdecisions. The PAF
consists o f ajointly approved set o f indicators and targets for assessing Government
performance and progress inthe use o fbudget support. Eachindicator has an annual
target which the Government is expected to meet. The CABS undertakes two annual
reviews, one duringFebruary-March and another duringAugust-September. Both
reviewsare alignedto the budget cycle. The February-March review takes placejust
before the Government starts to prepare its budget.The review focuses on assessing
Government performance inachieving the targets for each indicator inthe PAF.
Decisions on whether to disbursebudget support andhow much are based on the
outcome o fthis review. The August-September review focuses on the annual budget that
will havejust beenapproved byParliament, public financial management issues, anda
preliminary assessment o fthe fiscal performance duringthe previous fiscal year. On a
rotating basis, one member o f the CABS acts as a secretariat for the group duringthese
semi-annual reviews.

35.          Inlinewiththe Paris agendaon aideffectiveness andharmonization, andas
envisaged inthe CAS, the Bank has started the process to sign up to the Joint Framework
in2007. TheBankhassuggestedsome revisionsto the CABS partners to strengthen the
JF. It has beenjointly agreed that the JF would be revised inthe Fall 2007, immediately
following the revision o f the PAF, and that the Bank would sign up upon completion o f
the revisions. Inthe meantime, the Bankwill follow the CABS review cycle.

36.          The proposed PRSC program will be IDA'Sinstrument for the provision o f
budget support under the CABS framework. Hence, IDAparticipatedinthe 2007
revision o fthe PAF, to align it closely with the MGDS, and identify suitable indicators
for 2008 and 2009. As part o fthe revision, the PAFhas been expanded to cover the
Government program insupport o freforms to foster economic growth (with a focus on
agriculture and business environment) and social protection, which complemented the
pre-existingindicatorson Public FinancialManagement, social sectors, and governance.
Inorder to maintainroughly constantthe total numberofindicators, however, pre-
existing indicatorswere substantially streamlined.

37.         Inthiscontext, theidentificationofthePRSC's prior actions andtriggershas
beendonejointly with existing CABS members, and the PRSC program is filly aligned
with the PAF. Interms o fPRSC-1, two prior actions were already inthe PAF for 2007,
while the remaining five prior actions support reforms which have been added to the PAF
duringthe 2007 revision, andare now part o fthe PAF for the next few years. All the
triggers for PRSC-2 andPRSC-3 are filly aligned with the PAF for 2008 and 2009.
Annex 4 contains a PAF with indicators and their respective targets for the period 2007 to
2009.

                        D.Relationshipto otherBankOperations

38.         The PRSC program will complement current andplanned Bank investment
operations inMalawi. Some o fthe current projects to which the PRSC is linkedinclude
the Community Based-Rural LandProject (CBRLP), the Irrigation, Landand
Agricultural Development Project (IRLADP), the Rural Infrastructure Services Project
(RISP), andthe FIMTAP.The PRSC programis also leveragingthe Business
Environment Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP) approved inMay
2007, and the technical assistancebeingprovided bythe Bank to Malawi's Social
Protectionand Disaster Management programs through the ESSD Trust Fundand WBI
involvement.

                        E.LessonsLearnedfromPreviousDPLs

39.         The experience from the most recent development lendingoperationhas been
incorporated. The ICR on the most recent DPL, the Fiscal Management and Accelerating
GrowthProgram (FIMAG), has ratedthe overall outcome as moderately satisfactory. The
FIMAG was a two tranche structural adjustmentcredit approved inApril 2004. The first
tranche o fU S 2 5 million was disbursed inSeptember 2004 and the second tranche (also
o fUS$25 million) was disbursed inApril 2006. The operation supported structural
reforms inthe following areas: (i)  fiscal management, (ii)  parastatal reforms, (iii)
                                                                                    land
policy and agriculture, and (iv) combating HIV/AIDS.

40.         There are two major lessons that have been learnt from FIMAG. First, the
project was not well focused, with too manypolicy actions spanningover many areas.
Thiswas especially problematic giventhe substantial capacity constraints faced by the
Government. It i s for this reason that the proposed operationhas only four components
and a few critical actions andtriggers. Secondly, some o fthe triggers inthe FIMAGwere
not sufficiently defined.As a result, it was difficult to agree with the Government
whether or not a particular trigger hadbeen met. Inthe proposed PRSC program, an
attempt has been made to define prior actions and triggers as clearly as possible.

                      V.       THE PROPOSEDPRSCPROGRAM


41.         The proposed PRSC program with a planned total resource envelope o f
US$75 million shall be composed o fthree annual grantskredits, as the case may be,
supporting a medium-term reform programwhich underpinsthe implementation o fthe
MGDS duringits first three years. This i s inline with the Malawi country assistance
strategy (CAS), which envisages a series o f annual PRSCs. An Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared after the thirdPRSC operation, andinformthe
design o f a possible successor PRSC program.

                                 A. DevelopmentObjectives

42.         The proposed PRSC program aims at contributingto the achievement o f
Malawi's medium-terndevelopment objectives as outlinedinthe MGDS.Inparticular, it is
designed to support the Government inpursuinga development strategy that aims at
accelerating growth while at the same time ensuring that the vulnerable are adequately
protected from shocks. Iti s therefore hopedthat at the end o fthe series, the support
program will have contributed towards increasedeconomic growthandpoverty reductionby
supportingimplementationofpolicyandinstitutional reforms that will leadto increased
agricultural productivity, increasedprivate sector investment,improvedhouseholdresilience
to shocks, and sustainedimprovementsinfiscal management.

                          B. Components of the ReformProgram

43*         Inorder to achieve the stateddevelopment objectives, thePRSCprogram is
organized into four components: (i)   Improving the Functioning o f Agricultural Markets;
(ii) Improving the Business Climate; (iii) with Vulnerability to Shocks; and, (iv)
                                            Dealing
Improving Economic Governance. The choice o f the program was guided by the
strategic relevance o fthe reforms inorder to accelerate growth and poverty reduction. It
was also selected such that the four components closely match the four CAS pillars (see
Section IV.A), resulting ina close alignment with the Bank's portfolio. It is worth
emphasizing, however, that the PRSC program i s embedded inthe PAF, which supports a
much wider reforms program, and i s monitoredjointly by the Government and the CABS
donors.

ComponentI:Improvinathe Functioning of Agricultural Markets

44.         This component contains aprogramo fpolicy andinstitutional changes aimed
at improving the functioning o f agricultural output and input markets. Well functioning
markets are necessary for farmers and agro-traders to operate efficiently andprofitably,
andto motivate farmers to scale up their investmentsandproduction. Specific areas o f
intervention supported by the PRSC program focus on improving Government
interventioninagricultural produce marketing, including arrangements for tobacco,
improving Government involvement infertilizer markets, and strengthening the operation
o f landmarkets.

Component2: Improvinathe Business Climate


                                            - 22 -

45.         The MGDS emphasizes that the private sector will be the engine o fgrowth in
Malawi. Inthis regard, one o f the sub-themes inthe strategyi s that o f creating an
enabling environment for private sector-led growth. Under this component, the PRSC
program will support reforms aimed at improving the legal and regulatory environment,
particularly with regardto the business licensing regime and access to commercial
justice.

Component 3: Dealing with Vulnerabilitv to Shocks

46.         Most households suffer from various types o f shocks that divert their energies
andresources away fromnormal economic activities. This has promptedthe
Government, donor institutions andnon-governmental organizations to establish social
protectionprograms for vulnerable households. However, these programs are not
properly coordinated, resulting inoverlapping geographical coverage and insome cases
conflicting approaches. Further, some o fthe categories o f vulnerable households have not
beentargeted by these programs. This component will therefore support reforms that seek
to improve the coordination, fimding, and coverage o f social protectionprograms in
Malawi.

Component 4: Improving Economic Governance

47.         The proposedpolicy actions under this component aim at strengthening public
financial management and corruptionprevention. Inparticular, the PRSC program aims
at supporting reforms for improving Malawi's budgetprocess, payroll and debt
management, timeliness and follow-up o f external audit.

                           C.BenefitsandExpectedImpacts

48.         The PRSC program is expected to bringseveral benefits to Malawi's
development program. Firstly, it will contribute to the bridgingo f a financing gap that
exists inthe implementationo fthe MGDS. Secondly, the specific policy and institutional
reforms that the program will support are expected to help consolidate the
macroeconomic gains that Malawi has registered over the last three years and broaden the
focus to a more structural agenda. Inparticular, it will ensure that improved
macroeconomic performance starts translating into real growth o fthe economy through
increased agricultural production and private sector investment. Thirdly, bybeing part o f
a harmonizedbudget support program, the PRSC programwill contribute towards
improving aid effectiveness inline with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
Further, through the Performance Assessment Framework, there will be an opportunity
for the IDA to stay engaged inpolicy dialogue even inareas where it may not be taking a
leadinsupporting the Government.

49.         These intermediate benefits are expected to result inincreased agricultural
production andprivate sector investment, greater coverage and efficiency o f social
protectionprograms, and an expansion inthe fiscal space as a result o fimprovements in
the management o fpublic resources. These will further leadto increased agricultural

incomes, employment, andpublic service delivery, and hence progress towards
achievement o f the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.

                               D.KeyAnalyticalUnderpinnings

50.          The preparation o fthe PRSC programhas been informed by several analytical
studies andreviews. The component on improving the fimctioning o f agricultural markets
has benefitedfrom the 2004 PSIA on ADMARC reforms, the 2004 Malawi Agricultural
Policy Options, the 2006 Tobacco PSIA and the study on options for restructuring
ADMARC prepared in2006. The 2004 PSIA on ADMARC reforms found that many
rural communities, particularly inremote areas hadbeenadversely affectedbythe
withdrawal o fADMARC due to financial andoperational difficulties. Hence, it
recommends limitingADMARC's role to maize trading inremote rural areas only, where
farmers do not have access to well-finctioning markets.l5The Government subsequently
commissioned a team o f consultants to prepare a Diagnostic Studyon Options for
Restructuringo fADMARC's Commercial and Social Operations. The study was
completedin2006 and confirmed that ADMARC's commercial operations should be
undertaken by a separate vehicle from its social marketingactivities. It also
recommended the closure o fADMARC's investment holding company (AIHC).

51.          The 2004 Malawi Agricultural Policy Options Study and the 2006 Tobacco
PSIA identified several weaknesses incurrent marketing andinstitutional arrangements
for tobacco, which hinder the efficiency o f the sector and limit the pass-through o f
internationalprices to smallholders: (i)       weak voice o f smallholders inthe
institutionaVgovemance structure o f sector's institutions; (ii)         limitedoperational
transparency and efficiency o f existing institutions; (iii)       highintermediation costs,
including o f existing levies; (iv) low on-farm productivity, due to limitedaccess to
knowledge, technology, inputs, and advice; (v) limitedcompetition indomestic
marketing,notably for smallholder tobacco production; (vi) little competition in
auctioning and processing.

52.          Limited access to inputswas identifiedinthe 2006 Poverty andVulnerability
Assessment (and earlier studies) as a major constraint towards improved agricultural
growth, and poverty reduction. Current levels o f fertilizer use inMalawi are too low and
action i s requiredto boost fertilizer uptakeand use o fhigh-yielding seeds, and reduce the
cost o fthese inputs, especially for poor smallholder farmers who currently cannot afford
them.

53.          Underimprovingthe business climate, the analytical underpinningshave
come from the Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) o f 2006 andthe 2006 Doing
Business Country Profile for Malawi. The I C A revealed a number o f areas that make it
difficult for the private sector to conduct business. These includedmacro-economic
instability, unavailability o f low cost finance, intermittent supply of electricity,
corruption, and cumbersome business licensing requirements. Also, the World Bank

15Some areas inMalawi suffer from poor accessibility by road transport and low volumes o f trade, and are
characterized by low presence o fprivate sector traders, which operate ina situation o f imperfect
competition (ADMARC PSIA 2004).


                                                   - 24 -

Doing Business Survey (DBS) report revealed that Malawi is lagging behindina number
of areas. For example, the 2006 DBS report revealed that it takes 22 steps, 185 days, and
costs 236 percent o fincome per capita to comply with business licensing andpermit
requirements. An Accounting andAuditing ROSC has recently beencompleted for
Malawi in2007, and highlightsrecommendations which could enhance the investment
climate inthe country.

54.          The extent to which Malawian households are vulnerable to exogenous shocks
andthe copingmechanisms employedwere analyzed and discussedindetail inthe 2006
Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (PVA). The P V A highlighted that most
households inMalawi are affected by pervasive risks and shocks, which cause and
perpetuatepoverty. The most common types o f shocks relate to weather shocks, which
result infood shortages and food price volatility, andhealth shocks, namelyillness and
death o f a householdmember, mainly due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The 2006 PVA
andthe Status Report onMalawi's SocialProtectionprepared in2007 highlightthe fact
that Malawi's social protectionprogrami s suffering from manydeficiencies as follows:
existing programs are poorly coordinated, the coverage o f programs i s not yet
comprehensive, and the Government's funding i s inadequate.

55.          The economic governance component has also been informed by a strong
analytical basis, including the 2003 Malawi Country Financial Accountability
Assessment, the 2004 HIPC AAP report, the 2007 Public Expenditure Review, as well as
the Public ExpenditureFinancialAccountability Framework (PEFA) reports financed by
the EUin2005 and2006.

56.          The foregoing studies have indicateda number o fweaknesses that have
contributedto Malawi's poor fiscal performance during 1999-2004. The PER 2007 states
that, inaddition to weak fiscal discipline, a major source o fpoor fiscal performance in
the past havebeen weaknesses inthe debt management system, which translated into
repeated underestimationo fthe domestic interest bill. Infact, the domestic interest bill
was underestimated by 1.7 percent o f GDP in 1999/00, by 1.5 percent o f GDP in
2000/01, 2.1 percent in2001/02, 2.8 percent in2002/03, and4.9 percent in2003/04.
Several weaknesses indebt management systems and institutions are identified. Firstly,
there i s no debt management policy to guide debt contracting decisions. Secondly, there
i s weak coordination between the Reserve Bank o f Malawi which is the Government's
agent for borrowing from the domestic money market, and the Ministry o f Finance. In
particular, the issuance o f Treasury Bills is rarely based on a properly coordinated
assessment o f the Government's liquidity needs. Thirdly, the Debt andAid Division o f
the Ministry o f Finance, which is supposed to coordinate all debt and aid related
transactions, suffers from weak staff capacity. Because o f these capacity constraints, the
Government does not analyze the costs or risks associated with the different financing
options. Finally, there are no regular reports submittedto Parliament on the situation o f
Malawi's debt portfolio. Poor management ofMalawi's debt portfolio also explains why
there have been discrepancies between budgeted and actual interest payments on
domestic debt during 1999-2004.




                                             - 25 -

57.           Weak management o fthe civil service pay roll has been another important
source o fpoor fiscal performance inMalawi. The PEFA2006 highlights that payroll
management, though improving, remains fairly weak inMalawi. The PER2007 also
highlightsthat weak wage billforecasting was one o fthe major contributing factors to the
increasingover- expenditure during 1999-2004, which translated into the increase in
domestic debt. For instance, the wage billwas underestimated by 0.7 percent o f GDP in
1999/00, by 0.5 percent o f GDP in2001/02, 1percent in2002/03, and0.5 percent in
2003/04. Further, a 1998 personnel audit revealed that, due to weaknesses inthe payroll
management system, around 5 percent o fthe civil service staff complement was
composed o f ghost workers. This implies that the Government has been incurring costs
estimated at MWKlOOmillion (about USD2.5 million) annually due to ghost workers.
The personnel audit also revealed that 20 percent o f civil servants were occupying
unauthorizedposts, costingthe Government approximately MWK277 million annually
(about USD7.5 million).

58.           Weaknesses inMalawi's external auditing system were highlighted inthe
Public Expenditure and FinancialAccountability Framework Assessments (PEFAs)
conducted in2005 and2006, and inthe HIPC AAP 2004. These assessmentsmainly
bemoaned the long delays inthe submission o f audit reports to Parliament for legislative
scrutiny, and lack o f follow-up by the executive branch on audit recommendations.

                                  E.The ProposedGrant(PRSC-1)

59.           The proposed poverty reduction support grant (PRSC-1) is the first inthe
three year PRSC program and aims at supporting actions already undertaken by the
Government inthree o f the four components o fthe program. The subsequent paragraphs
inthis sectionpresentbackgroundto the policyreformsincludingchallenges, measures
already undertaken, policy reforms being envisaged, andtheir likely impact. Some o fthe
measures already undertaken have been identified as prior-actions for PRSC-1while
some o fthe measuresbeing planned for the fbture constitute triggers for subsequent
operations. It shouldbe highlighted, however, that triggers for PRSC-3 are indicative
only andwill be refinednext year.16 A summary o fprior actions and triggers for
subsequent operations are presented inTable 3.

Component1:Improvingthe FunctioningofAgriculturalMarkets

60.           One o fthe medium-term objectives o f the MGDS i s increased agricultural
productivity inorder to increase farmers' incomes and ensure food security. The strategy
inthis regardidentifies low agriculturalprofitabilitydueto weak links to markets as one
o fthe main constraints. A major feature o fMalawi's agricultural markets has been
Government interventioninorder to correct for market failures, but often resulting in
increased distortions andcrowding out o fprivate sector activity.


16While it is useful to include indicative triggers to guide the dialogue with the authorities and other
partners, such an early identification is not intendedto introduce some unwantedrigidity. I t will be
important to be able to modulate the content of future operations inlight o f emerging priorities, new
information, or other factors.

61.          Policies under this component will complement current and planned Bank
operations inagriculture. Specifically, the PRSCprogram will complement the
agriculture investmentsand capacity building supported bythe Irrigation, Rural
Livelihoods, and Agricultural Development (IRLAD),and i s well aligned with the
plannedsector-wide program under preparation inagriculture. The reforms supportedby
the PRSC program will also support the landreforms provided under the Community
Based-Rural LandProject (CBRLP).

Improving thefunctioning of agricultural output markets: (a) ADMARC and maize
marketing

62.           Government's interventioninagricultural markets, has since the 1960s
centered on the operation o fthe national marketingboard, namelythe Agricultural
Development andMarketing Corporation (ADMARC). Over the years, however, the
ADMARC has become synonymous with financial and operational mismanagement
rather than focusing on the provision ofreadymarkets inrural remote areas shunned by
private traders due to hightransport costs and low volumes. Increasingly, following the
liberalizationo f agricultural marketing duringthe 1980s and 1 9 9 0 the      ~ ~corporation has
become a financial burden to the budgetand its subsidized operations have hindered the
growth o fprivate trading inurbanand semi-urban areas. Infact, although ADMARC's
mandate was to facilitate agricultural marketinginremote areas, currently ADMARC i s
operating everywhere, including inurbanareaswhere the private sector traders are
prevalent. Inaddition, ADMARC has also been involved inother non-core mandates.
For example, through AIHC, the institutionhad acquired shares invarious companies,
some o fwhich were not inthe agriculture business.

63.          In2004 the Government decidedto restructure ADMARC.I7 The
restructuringprocess was started under the FIMAGoperation (FY04), but is still ongoing.
As part o fthe restructuringprocess, in2007 the corporate office o fAIHC has been closed
down andAMC's shares inManica, Clark Cotton, Alexander Forbes, and Sugar
Corporation o fMalawi have been sold off. Further, underthe reform programapproved
by cabinet, ADMARC's role will be limitedto operating markets inrural remote areas. A
business plan was completed inMarch2007 which defines in greater detail how
ADMARC will be restructured. The planprovides a road-map on how ADMARC will
focus on providing marketingservices inareas where market failures exist. This will
among other things entail registeringADMARC as a public company limited by
guarantee andtransferring excess warehousing facilities to a new warehousing company,
the Malawi Agricultural Warehousingand Trading Company (MAWTCO). MAWTCO
will be a "for-profit" commercial enterprise involved inthe renting o fwarehousing
facilities. It will be registered as a public limited liability company under the Companies
Act.




l7The restructuringplans approved by Cabinet in2005 are broadly inline with the recommendations o f a
PSIA on ADMARC reforms carried out in2004, albeit envisaging a larger role for ADMARC in
agricultural marketing, notjust limited to maize marketing.

64.          PRSC-1 hasthereforeidentifiedas a prior action, the strategic refocusing
of ADMARC havingstartedbywinding downnon-corebusiness interests(shares in
Manica,Clark Cotton, Alexander Forbes,andSugar CorporationofMalawi)held
throughAIHC. Going forward, the trigger identifiedfor PRSC-2 will bethat MAWTCO
has been established andis operational The establishment andoperationalization o f
MAWTCO will entail the following: (i)         MAWTCO being incorporatedas a public
limitedliability company; (ii) Warehouse capacity beingtransferred from
                                   excess
ADMARC to MAWTCO; ii)Board o f MAWTCO beingconstituted to include keypublic
andprivate stakeholders; (iii) office beingestablished with requisiteequipment and
                                   Head

warehouse facilities initiated. There is as yet no trigger for PRSC-3, but this could be
added once progress inthe second year o fthe program has beenreviewed.

65.          As discussed above, the creation o fMAWTCO is part o fthe broader
ADMARC restructuringproposed inthe agreed business plans. Over the next fiscal year,
the Government expects to make substantial progress inimplementingthe restructuring
plan, suchthat (i)  ADMARC is incorporated as a Public Company Limitedby Guarantee;
(ii) ADMARCBoardisreconstitutedtoincludekeypublicandprivatestakeholders;

MAWTCO completed; (vii) Performance indicators for ADMARC identifiedand agreed
byits Board.

66.          These changes inthe size, role andoperation o fADMARC are expected to
foster, inthe medium-term, availability o f agricultural markets inthe rural areas, and the
growth o fprivate sector operators inagricultural produce marketing inurbanand semi-
urbanareas, leadingto increasedprofitability for the farmers andfaster poverty
reduction.

Improving thefunctioning of agricultural output markets: (b) tobacco marketing

67.          Tobacco is Malawi's main cash crop and foreign exchange earner, andits
production andmarketing has historically beenregulatedby separate arrangements,
centered on the operation o f a centralized auction system for its marketing. The
performance o f the sector since 1998 has beencharacterized by an erosion o fproductivity
and profitability margins inboth the smallholder and estate sub-sectors caused bythe
decline ininternational price and a reductioninyields andquality. This has ledto
frequent protests and disruption at the auction markets and ad hoc Government
interventionwhich have failed to resolve the underlyingproblems.18 Despite the anti-
smokinglobby, international demand is projectedto increase andMalawi should continue
to benefit from a cost advantage for both flue-cured andburleytobacco.




18Notably, the Government efforts to improve output prices at the floors throughthe imposition o f
minimumpriceshave notbeensuccessful.


                                                - 29 -

68.         Following discussions with stakeholders, the Government in2005 approved a
reform package to improve the hnctioning o fthe tobacco sector. The initialreforms
were supported bythe FIMAGoperationduring2005 and 2006, and entailed increasing
the representation o f smallholders inthe sector's institutions, substantial reduction in
levies (notably, the elimination of the mandatory TAMA membership fee), andthe
introduction o f contract farmingin2005/06 for burley tobacco, which i s mainlyproduced
bysmallholders.

69.         The process o freforms i s continuing under the PRSC program to improve
accessibility to markets by tobacco farmers, reduce domestic marketingcosts, andto
increase the operational transparency and efficiency o f existing public institutions.
Firstly, three satellite auction floors havebeen established in2006/07. These will reduce
transport costs for farmers, who currently have to travel long distances to deliver their
tobacco at the main auction floors (inMzuzu or Lilongwe), or have to sell their crop to
traders at much lower prices. The satellite auction floors will also provide farmers easier
access to the relatively more transparent market at the auction floors. Secondly, the
Government wants to improve the operation o f contract farming, to increase smallholder'
access to technology andreduce marketinginefficiencies. Inresponse to the concerns
related to the asymmetric marketingpower between farmers and (tobacco leaf) buyer
companies, the Government intends to commission an independent review o f contract
farminginMalawito improve current arrangements. Itis envisaged that once approved
by cabinet, recommendations from the independent review o fcontract farmingwill be
implemented in2008/09. Inaddition, as part o fthe reform program, the Government
intendsto carry out and implement the recommendations o fdetailed performanceaudits
o f each o fthe main sector institutions in2007/08.

70.          Giventhis reform program, PRSC-1has identified as a prior action the
establishment of three satellite tobacco auction floors. Inthe coming year, the
authorities will be working on the independent review o fthe contract farming system.
Therefore it i s inPRSC-3 that a corresponding trigger has been identified, namely:
Improved contract farming system operational (withperformance indicators to be
specified in2008 on the basis o frecommendations from the independent review o fthe
current system).

71.         These changes inmarketing and institutional arrangements are expected to
continue to improve the efficiency o f sector institutions and marketingchannels, and
therebyincrease pass-through o fborder prices to the farmers. While they constitute steps
intheright direction, however, the reforms arenot sufficient to increase significantly
farmers' profitability, and accelerate poverty reduction. Additional measures to increase
competition inmarketing channels andtechnology access by smallholders will be
required infuture years.

Improving thefunctioning of agricultural input markets: (a)fertilizer markets

72.          Since 1998/99 the Government runa TargetedInputProgram(TIP) aimed at
increasing fertilizer use by smallholders. Under the program, small quantities o f fertilizer
(known as `starter packs'), were distributedto households identified as poor. A strong


                                            - 30 -

case can be made for providing free fertilizer or a subsidyas a productivity enhancing
measure for the poorest households inMalawi (see PVA 2006). The program shouldbe
targeted to those who cannot afford fertilizer purchases inorder to minimize
displacement. Following concerns that the free distribution was not increasing farmers'
purchases o f fertilizer and was creating dependence, the TIP was transformed into a
targeted fertilizer and seedprice subsidy program inthe 2005/06 agricultural season,
designedto target 1.7 million poor smallholders.

73.         The design o f the new program, however, has raised different concerns.
Firstly,the expenditure on the new programwas double the amount inprevious years, at
around 3 percent o f GDP in2006/07, andmay not be sustainable. Secondly, the
subsidized inputswere distributedto farmers only through two parastatal organizations,
ADMARC andthe Smallholder Farmers Fertilizer Revolving Fundo fMalawi
(SFFRFM),leadingto a substantial fall incommercial sales o finputsto smallholder
farmers through private sector outlets, and threatening their existence. Infact, private
traders were uncertain about the amount o f fertilizer and seed the Government will
import and subsidize, which disruptstheir own import decisions.

74.         Inaddition, there areconcerns that the move from the TIPto a fertilizer
subsidy voucher in2005/06 i s also regressive, inthat it may leave out cash-constrained
smallholders that cannot afford to pay the subsidized price (andwill rather sell the
voucher inthe informal market). This gap incoverage o f the current voucher-subsidy
program, which omits cash-constrained small holders, ought to be addressedas part o f
the social protectionprograms. This may consist o f a re-introductiono f Starter Packs
andor cash assistancetargeted to the ultra poor.

75*         In2006/07, theprogramwas modified andimplementedwiththe involvement
o f the private sector. Inparticular, 28 percent o f subsidized fertilizer was sold through
private sector outlets. According to an evaluation study o fthe program, the involvement
o fthe private sector inthe program had apositive impact on the availability o f fertilizer
inthe country. However, basedon anecdotal evidence, the Governmenthas expressed
concerns about the qualityo f service provided by some o fthe private traders. While the
Government is committed to increasing participationo fprivate traders inthe
procurement anddistribution o f subsidized fertilizer, it would like to undertakea
performance assessment o fprivate sector involvement inthe program inorder to draw
performance indicators for the program. Increased private sector involvement in
subsequent years will be contingent on improved performance against these indicators. In
this context, the Governmenthas already beenholding discussions with the private sector
on how problems faced in2006/07 can be resolved. Consequently, in2007/08, the
Government has committed to at least maintaining the same level o fprivate sector
involvement inthe program as in2006/07.

76.         Inlightofthe above, theproposedPRSC-1recognizes as a prior-actionthe
fact that the GovernmentofMalawiimplementeda targetedfertilizer andseed
subsidy programwith 28 percentprivatesector participationinfertilizer
distribution. PRSC-2 will have one trigger, namely: "start performanceassessmento f
private sector involvement inwholesale andretail trade based on agreed performance


                                            - 31 -

indicators." The trigger for PRSC-3 will be: "improved functioning o f fertilizer markets
based on performance monitoring indicatorsbyDecember 2008." The trigger will be
specified interms of Government relatedperformance indicators to be defined in2008
after the performance assessment.

77.          It is worth highlightingthat the fertilizer subsidy is apolitically sensitive issue
inMalawi, andthat the pressure to expandthe Government's role inprovisionof
subsidized fertilizer (to ensure availability o f fertilizer at affordable prices) may increase
inthe run-upto the 2009 presidentialelections. Since the subsidyprogramis a significant
proportiono f the budget, andagricultural production (which inMalawi accounts for 40
percent o f the economy) i s much affected by the functioning o f fertilizer markets in
Malawi, it i s important that development partners stay engaged inthis policy dialogue
with the Government. The reforms inthe operationofthe fertilizer subsidy scheme
supported under this PRSC program, therefore, aim to facilitate a positive dialogue
betweenthe Government and the private sector. The expectation i s that following the
transition phase over the next few years, this dialogue may lead to a more market-friendly
Government policy towards private sector trade inagricultural inputs. Inthis context, the
development partners, including IDA, are discussing with the Government to identify a
satisfactory set o fpolicy interventions inagricultural inputsmarkets. Ideally this would
result inthe Cabinet approval o f a Fertilizer Policy which i s broadly shared by all
stakeholders, supports the growth o fprivate sector, takes a broadperspective on
increasingagricultural productivity, and includes a clear exit strategy for fertilizer
subsidies.

78.          Further, themost appropriate interventionsto reduce fertilizer costs inthe
long-term ina sustainable manner entail strengthening fertilizer markets through
structural poli~ies.'~    The Government is yet to articulate a more comprehensive medium-
term program, to improve the operation o f fertilizer marketsthrough structuralpolicies,
which can be supported through the PRSC program.

Improving thefunctioning of agricultural input markets: (b) land markets

79.          More than 60 percent ofrural households live on less than one hectare o f land,
even though about a third o f cultivable landi s not under use. This i s partlybecause the
landtaxation andrental systemdoes not discourage large landholders from leaving land
idle. Freehold landi s not taxed, while rentals on leasehold landhave been very low. The
capacity to collect landrent at the local level is also very weak.

80.          As part o fthe reformprogram supportedby the previousDPLoperation, the
Government agreed to increase landrents and strengthen the capacity o f local assemblies
to collect landrent. Inthis regard, twenty four district landofficers andfifty-five land
clerks have been recruited and deployed. This i s a significant development since any
upwardrevisions inlandrents andtaxes would be ineffectual without the capacityto
enforce them. Inthe medium-term, there are plans to establish landregistries inat least

19For instance, by creating a mechanism for collaborative logistical planning of imports, removing
transportation bottlenecks (and thereby reducing transport costs), facilitating credit provisionto
smallholders, and improving extension services.


                                                   - 32 -

four districts starting from 2008/09 so that landofficers know exactly who owns how
much land. Further, as part o f the previous DPL operation, the landrent on leasehold
landwas raisedfrom MWKSOhectareto MWKlOOOhectare. However, there havebeen
complaints bymostly smallholder farmers that the new rental level i s too high, andthe
reform was subsequentlysuspended. A study has now been conducted to review the
structure o f landrentals and taxes, including recommendations for what would be an
equitable structure o f landrents andtaxes. Following discussion o f the recommendations
by stakeholders, it is expected that the Cabinet will approve a new structure o flandrents
andtaxes by2008/09. While the details ofthe reform have not yet been defined, the aim
will be to renderthe structure of landrent andtaxes more equitable, with a view to
increasing access to landfor smallholders.

81.         Inaddition, following extensive consultations over the past decade, which led
to the adoption o f aNational LandPolicy in2002, a Land Billwas submitted to
Parliament inJune o f2006 to support implementation o fthe new landpolicy. However,
the Billhas since been temporarily withdrawn after legislators requestedthat the Billbe
submitted as a comprehensive package to include all other proposals made by the special
commission on LandReform. The Government plansto re-submitthe Billto Parliament
soon. Once approved, the Government plansto undertakefurther policy and institutional
changes aimedat improvingthe functioning o f landmarketswithin the new law, which
could be supported by the PRSC program infuture years. One ofthe new provisions o f
the Billallows individuals to have title deeds to landpreviouslyownedunder customary
landtenure. This means that once registered, the title o fthe owner will have filllegal
status andthe landmay be leased or used as security for a loan. Further, consistent with
the on-going decentralisation process, the Billconfers greater responsibility inthe
administrationo f land issues from the central government to districts andtraditional
authorities. One action that i s plannedto be undertaken once the Billbecomes law i s the
establishment o f LandAllocation Committees and Land Tribunals at the local level, to
resolve landownership issues at the local level.

82.         PRSC-1identifiesas aprior actionthe recruitmentanddeploymentof 24
DistrictLandOfficersand55 LandClerks. Since the authorities will inthe coming
year be finalizing preparations for the revision o fthe landtax system, a trigger has only
beenidentifiedfor PRSC-3, namely: "Cabinet approval o f an equitable landtaxation
structure for free hold landand an equitable landrent structure for agricultural leasehold
landbyDecember 2008."

83.         These changes inthe operation o fthe landmarkets are expected to increase
the costs associatedwith landhoarding, whichwill inturn force landholders to release
more landinto the market through sale, rental, or tenancy agreements thereby increasing
the area ofcultivated land.Increased cultivated landis expected to lead to higher
agricultural production and faster poverty reduction.

84.         Approval o f the LandBillwould complement to the landrent andtax policy
reforms by focusing more on property rights. Once the new LandLaw has been
approved, therefore, the PRSC program could also support the formalization o f
ownership rights, which would further improve the functioning o f land markets. Failure


                                            - 33 -

byParliament to approve the Land Bill, while not essential to achieve the expected end-
of-series outcome (from landreforms) under the PRSC program, would nevertheless
leave inplace an important constraint hinderingthe operation o f landmarkets, and
agricultural production inMalawi.

Component2: Improvingthe BusinessClimate

85.          The MGDShighlightsthe fact that the private sector will be the engine o f
growth inMalawi. Inthis regard, one o fthe sub-themes inthe strategy i s that o f creating
an enabling environment for private sector-led growth. As pointed out earlier, the I C A
and Doing Business Surveys have highlighted the various constraints to private sector
development inMalawi, one o fwhich has been an unstable macroeconomic environment.
Following progress inrestoring macroeconomic stability, the Government is now
focusing on a broadprogram o f `second generation' reforms inthe domestic business
environment which will seek to stimulate private sector investment and employment
creation.

86.          Some o f these reforms can be easily undertaken inthe short term while others
will require more time. The IDAhas recently approved the BESTAP, which supports the
achievement o f the Government's strategy o f facilitating private sector ledeconomic
growth through four mutually reinforcing components: (i)     Strengthening property rights
institutions andbusiness facilitation; (ii)strengthening private sector development
support institutions and services; (iii)promoting access to finance andproductivity; (iv)
capacity Buildingand ImplementationSupport. While the PRSC program specifically
supports key reforms under components (i)      and(ii)fBESTAP,progress towards the
                                                      o
PRSC outcomes is dependent on the implementation o fthe overall reforms program
supported by BESTAP.

Improving legal and regulatory environmentfor businesses

87.          Improving the legal and regulatory environment has been identified as one o f
the areas where reforms can proceed immediately. Malawi's business licensingregime is
currently so complex and cumbersome that it takes long periods for a new business to be
registered andstart operating. In2006, it took an average o f 185 days for a business to
get a license, one o f the highest inthe region. This discourages new entrants into the
formal sector. Inthis regard, the Government has started a process o f reviewing the
business licensing regime as a matter o fpriority so that laws facilitate business operations
rather than act as an impediment. Proposals coming out o f the review include reducing
the unnecessary multiplicity o ftrading licenses. For example, there are currently eight
types o f licenses for trading business, one for each category, such as wholesaling,
retailing, andtraveling agent. This is clearly not necessary since incases where the
businesses undertaken are on the same premises, one should ideally have a single
business license indicatingthe various types o ftrading activities to be involved in.There
are also plansto introduce a more simplified and fair licensingcost structure.

88.          Apart from reviewingthe business licensingregime, the Government will also
embark on a comprehensive review o f all other economic laws such as the Export


                                             - 34 -

Incentives Act, Taxation Act, Labour Relations Act, and Immigration Act. Inaddition,
the Government also plans to establish a one-stop shop for investment, exporting and
business licensing. Legislationfor the establishment o fthis institution has been drafted.

89.        Malawi's business environment has also beencharacterized by weak contract
enforcement and limitedaccessto commercialjustice. Inparticular, capacity inthe court
systemto deal with commercial type o f cases has been weak, partlydue to the absenceo f
specialized courts. Priority i s usually givento criminal and political cases. In2006, it
took an average o f 337 days to enforce a contract through the court system. Many
businesses are therefore reluctant to enter into contract arrangements except with the
most trusted clients. This limits the scope for business opportunities and growth. For
example, most small scale firms findit difficult to access commercial bank credit.

90.         Inordertodealwiththis constrainttoprivatesectordevelopment, a
Commercial Division o f the HighCourt has been established in2007 inorder to relieve
the current large backlog o f commercial cases inMalawi's court system and to strengthen
contract enforcement. Ruleso fProcedure for the court have been reviewed and gazetted,
premises havebeen secured, and four judges have been appointed.

91.         PRSC-1hasthereforeidentifiedthe establishmentof a Commercial
Divisionofthe HighCourtas prior action. While the ongoingreview o fthe business
licensing regime andthe establishment o f a commercial court will improve the legal and
regulatory environment, their impact will only be felt as the reforms become operational,
which will be monitored as part o fthe triggers insubsequent operations. For PRSC-2 the
trigger will be: "the average number o fdays to settle commercial disputesis reduced
from 337 to 290 or less." The trigger for PRSC-3 will be: "the average number of days to
get abusiness license is reduced from 185 days to 90 days or less."

92.        As the number o fdays to register abusiness, get a license, andsettle
commercial disputes reduces, it i s expected that the number o fbusinesses startingup per
monthwill increase inthe mediumterm. Together with improvements inother areas, it i s
expected that as more businesses start up, the share o fprivate sector investment inGDP
(which was 3.7 percent o f GDP in2006) will increase.

Improving energy supply andprovision

93 9       Inadditiontothepoorlegalandregulatoryenvironment, alargeshareofthe
firms inMalawi complain that intermittent supply o f electricity i s a critical constraint on
the growth and operations o f their businesses. The frequency o f energy shortages in
Malawi at present constitutes a real impediment to private sector development, and this
problem is likely to worsen inthe next few years unless the Government rapidly takes
decisive action.

94.        The shortages havebeen due mainly to the combination o ftwo factors:
shortage inpower supply availability and inefficient operation o f the ESCOMparastatal.
Unreliable electricity supply has mainlybeendue to damage caused to equipment at the
hydro electric power stations at Nkula, Kapichira, andTedzani Iand 11. Tedzani Iand I1


                                             - 35 -

stopped functioning in2001, Work is now underway to rehabilitatethese stations.
Additionally, it i s now appreciated that even with all the hydro electric power stations
fully operational, given future demandsof electric power, there will beneedfor increased
levels o fpower supply. Inthis regard, the Government i s consideringthe construction o f
additional power generation capacity inMalawi, as well as the construction o f an inter-
connector to the Southern Afi-ica power gridwhich would allow Malawi to import and
export electricity as needed.

95.          Inaddition, efficient management anda soundfinancial statusofMalawi's
power utility, ESCOM, will be critical to ensuring reliable supply o f electricity. Inthis
regard, it i s expected that ESCOM's Boardwill next fiscal year approve the company's
financial viability plan andmanagement improvement strategy. The preparation and
implementation o f a sound financial viability plan, includingmeasures to improve the
efficiency o f ESCOM and setting tariff levels which are consistent with financial
sustainabilityY2'i s required to complement the planned investments inpower generation
to link Malawi to the regionalpower pool and resolve the current bottlenecks inenergy
provision. Ifpreparationof the planis completed as envisaged, its implementationmay
be monitored under future PRSCs.

Component3: Dealingwith Vulnerabilityto Shocks

96.          The MGDS recognizes the importance o f dealingwith vulnerability to shocks
at household andnational levels. Major household level shocks inMalawi include
illnesses and deaths mostly due to HIV/AIDS, and crop failures mainlydue to droughts.
At nationallevel, the major shock is drought. The MGDS furtherhighlights the
importance o f designing social protectionprograms for the most vulnerable inorder to
ensure that they benefit from economic growth. It also highlightsthe impact o f climatic
shocks at national level on economic growth. Inthis regard, the strategy identifies the
lack o fprogram coordination and inadequate knowledge o fwho are the poor, where they
are located, and how best to target them, as some o f the key constraints to having an
efficient social protectionprogram. At national level, the strategy calls for puttingin
place adequatemeasures that go beyond emergency responses.

97.           The reforms supported by the PRSC under this component underpin the
technical assistancebeing provided bythe Bank to Malawi's Social Protectionand
Disaster Management programs through the ESSD Trust FundandWBI involvement.

Improving coordination and coverage of social protection programs

98.           Malawi has a complex systemo f safety nets programs, each operating
independently and varying over time. Recognizing the limitations o fthe existing system,
Malawi's Cabinet adopted a National Safety Net Strategy (NSNS) in2002, to rationalize
the manycompetingprogramsinto a centrally coordinated, Government-directed and
nationwideprogram. The strategy had four main components: Public Works Program
(PWP), Targeted Inputs Program (TIP), Targeted Nutrition Program(TNP) andDirect
*'AnElectricity Tariffs Study was conducted in2006 to explore the impact onthe poor o fpossible
increases inelectricity fees.

                                               - 36 -

Transfers Program(DTP). The Social ProtectionUnit (originally called, Safety Nets
Unit)was established to coordinate rationalization andprioritization ofeachofthe four
types o f safety nets (PWP, TIP, TNP and DTP). However, progress inrationalizing and
prioritizing safety nets interventionshas beenlimited. The 2006 PVA report concludes
that there has beenlittle progress inimprovingthe coordination and rationalizationo f
Safety Nets programs inMalawi, anddecisions on the various programs are still not
coordinated bythe Government. Competing programs still need to be rationalized with
respect to coverage andmodalities. Partlythis i s due to the poorly coordinated position o f
donors, which i s expressed ina broad array o frelatively uncoordinated safety net
instruments. The Government is aware o fthe difficulties andthe Social Protection Unit
(SPU) i s now actively coordinating the development o f a Social Protection Policy which
willprovide amore definitiveframework to rationalize the implementationo fvarious
safety nets programs.

99.         Poor coordination andlack o f comprehensiveness o fMalawi's social
protection programs has been due to weak capacity at the SPU mainly inthe form o f low
staffing levels, lack o f a comprehensive policy to guide the various interventions, and
inadequate funding. With regard to low staffing levels, a recruitment process has been
initiatedto increase staffing levels inthe unit.

100.        With regardto coordination, there has also beensignificant progress inthe
past year. Since 2006 the SPU has taken an active role incoordinating a pilot social cash
transfer program targeting the poorest decile o f the population inone district. The pilot
reflects improved Government leadership inthe coordination o f social protection
programs. Further, Social Protection Steering Committee and Technical Committees have
been established. The steering committee i s chaired by the Chief Secretary to the
Presidentand Cabinet andis composed o fhighlevel representatives from the
Government, NGOs and the donor community. The same institutions are representedin
the technical committeewhich serves the steering committee. These willbe the
overarching committees for the design and implementation o f coordinated social
protectionprograms. As already mentioned, work i s also underway to prepare a
comprehensive social protectionpolicythat will provide guidelines for coordination and
best practice principles to all players interested infinancing andimplementation o f social
protectionprograms. The policy i s expected to become operational in2007/08 after
cabinet approval inthe same year. Inthe interim, the Government has adopted a social
protection framework which was endorsed by donors andNGOs. The framework outlines
the principles that all institutions involved inthe implementation o fsocial protection
programs need to adhere to.

101.        Inorder to ensurethat socialprotectionprograms are adequately funded, there
are plans to establish a basket funding arrangementthat would draw the Government and
interested donors. On its part, the Government plans to create a budget line for social
protection programs and ensure that it allocates its contribution to the budget as per
Basket FundingArrangement.

102.        Buildingon the important steps inthe reformprocess carried out in2006/07,
the trigger for PRSC-2 is: "Cabinet approval o f a new SocialProtectionPolicy with a


                                             - 37 -

clear implementation program o f specific programs andbeginningits implementation."
For PRSC-3, the trigger i s "allocation inthe FY08/09budget for social protection
programs inaccordance with policies andprograms agreed upon in2007."

103.          Inthe long-run, improvedcoordination andcoverage ofsocial protection
programs are expected to improve households' resilience to shocks. Given the projected
economic growth, this will translate into reduced poverty levels inMalawi. However, in
the medium-term, it is hopedthat the measuresbeing supported bythe PRSC will leadto
a rationalization o f social protectionprograms andto increased Government funding.

Improving the national response to climatic shocks

104.          At anational level, Malawi's vulnerability to severe climatic shocks causes
disruptions to Malawi's development path. The Government has started a program o f
rehabilitationo firrigation schemes, with IDA assistanceunder the IRLAD project, which
will reduce Malawi's vulnerability to droughts inthe medium-tern. At present, however,
Malawi's economy is highlyvulnerable to weather shocks not only because o fthe direct
impact on agricultural production (andGDP), but also due to the indirect impact on
Government finances resulting from the unanticipatedneedfor emergency interventions
(which may translate into increased domestic borrowing), and increased pressure on the
current account because o fthe needfor exceptional food imports. Further, the long-term
impact o f the volatility i s substantial, as economic uncertainty hampersthe country's
ability to generate and/or attract productive investments, to effectively compete in
international markets, and, most important, to translate economic growth into
employment and income generation that benefit those who need it most.

105.          Mucho f the approach by the Government and donors inaddressing weather
shocks i s to react to an event, rather thanmanaging the risk ex-ante, resultingina less
efficient response replete with distortions, wasted resources andrent seeking. Inline
with the recommendations o fthe 2004 Weather Based Insurance studyon Malawi, andas
described inthe 2006 PVA, the Government o fMalawi has taken steps to improving the
ability o f its population to cope with weather related shocks.21 Starting in2005 the
Government has renewed efforts to scale up irrigation development. Inthe short- to
medium term, however, Malawi will still be vulnerable to severe droughts. Hence, the
Government, with technical assistance from the Bank's CRMG unit, i s exploring
innovative instruments to improve its ability to respond to droughts, buildingon the 2004
Weather Based Insurance study. Notably, in2005 the Government purchased an over-
the-counter option based on the South African SAFEX commodity exchange to help price
riskassociatedwiththe needto importadditional maize to respondto the 2005 drought
induced food crisis. The Government has beenconsidering the purchase o f national level
weather insurance from an international insurance company, to be implementedon a pilot
basis in2007/08.




21At the household level, Malawi started a pilot project in2005 through a privately funded farmer
organization (NASFAM) inwhich 900 groundnut farmers purchaseda weather based insurance policy. The
pilot has been scaled up to 3,000 groundnut farmers and has been extended to maize.


                                                   - 38 -

106.         Progress has also been made to improve the performance o fthe National Food
Reserve Agency (NFRA). The NFRA was set up to manage Malawi's strategic grain
reserves, which the country i s supposed to draw upon inthe event of a drought.
However, the institution has inthe past not beenvery effective inplayingthis role. An
institutional audit was conducted in2003 and some o f the recommendations are already
beingimplemented. Further, the NFRA is now inthe process o fpreparing a management
strategy andaction planfor the management o fthe Strategic Grain Reserves (SGRs),
based on the implementation of the findings from the 2003 audit. It i s expected that the
management strategy and action planwill be approved by Cabinet inFY2007/08. It is
hopedthat the management strategy will among other things define the role that the
NFRAwill beplaying inthe management ofphysical stocks andsynthetic stocks inlight
o f Government plans to continuepurchasingcall options and plans to buynational
weather insurance.

107.         Improvingthe Government ability to manage the risk o fmajor weather shocks
is critical because it negatively affects both economic growth and poverty reduction at the
household level. While several important steps have already been undertaken in
improvingthe nationalresponse to climatic shocks, Government is still inthe process o f
firmingup a comprehensive medium-termreformprogramwhich couldbe supportedby
future PRSCs.

Component4: ImprovingEconomicGovernance

108.         The MGDS identifies good governance as akeycross-cutting theme
anchoring the implementation o f the strategy. Amongst some o f the key sub-themes are
improved fiscal management and the fight against corruption.

109.         The PEFA assessmentsconducted in2005 and 2006 indicatedthat despite
recent progress, challenges still remain invarious areas such as budget process, payroll
anddebt management, andexternal audit. Specifically, the 2006 PEFAhighlighted
concerns over the lack o f linkage betweenthe Government's Strategic Plan (the MGDS)
andthe financial planningandbudgetingsystems, the needto fully integrate the
personnel andpayroll systems inIFMIS, and the weak parliamentary oversight and
external accountability o f the Executive. Inaddition, weaknesses indebt management
system were also highlightedby the 2004 HIPC AAP and the 2007 PER. Basedon the
findings of these reports, the Government hasprepared aPublic Finance andEconomic
Management (PFEM) Action Plan, which includes the keyreforms supported by the
PRSC program. The Bank, inclose collaboration with the IMF andthe other
development partners, i s strongly supportingthe implementation o f the P F M action plan
through the restructured FIMTAP project, with a focus on strengthening the IFMIS,
payroll management, procurement, accounting, and auditing(internal andexternal).

Improving the budgetprocess

110.         A major weakness inMalawi's budgetprocess at the moment is the weak
linkagebetween the budget andthe MGDS.At the beginning o f the budget preparation
cycle, Treasury sends out a circular requiring all line ministries anddepartments to ensure


                                             - 39 -

that their budgetsare based on the MGDS. However, inpractice, the final budgets that
are submitted have little resemblance to the priorities outlined inthe MGDS.

111.        Weak linkages betweenthe budget andthe MGDS are due to many factors.
Firstly, line ministries have indicatedthat there are no clear guidelines on how to actually
budget according to the MGDSpriorities. Secondly, there is no comprehensive budget
classification structure that could facilitate the link betweenthe MGDSpriorities andthe
budget, at least at an aggregated sectoral level. Thirdly, the MGDS annual progress
review is currently not properly linked to the budget process. Ideally, the MGDS annual
progress reviews should be hlly integrated into the budget calendar. Further, lack o f
timely provision o f allocation ceilings to line ministries anddepartments has left little
time for themto prepare their budgets inlinewith MGDSpriorities. Lastly, the budget
vetting system itselfi s weak. The Ministryo fEconomic PlanningandDevelopment
(MEPD) that is responsible for the preparation andmonitoring o fthe MGDS, has not
taken an active role invetting the budget submissions.

112.        There are several actions that the Government i s planningto undertaketo
improve the alignment o f the budget to the MGDS. Firstly, it intends to introduce a
budgetcalendar that incorporates allbudget related activities, including the MGDS
annual progress review. Secondly, a new Chart o fAccounts (COA) has been incorporated
inthe IFMIS. The COA is organized around four segments: (i)       responsibility/
accountability; (ii) performancerelated budget; (iii)   geographical analysis; and (iv)
accounts. However, according to a recent review o f the budget process carried out by
the IMF, the COA is not yet hlly consistent with the budget classification system.
Although budgetary allocations are classified, presented and approved on an output and
program basis, it i s almost impossible to monitor and report on the same basis during
budget implementation. This would inturnmake it difficult to monitor and report
progress inthe implementationo fthe MGDS. Therefore, the Government now plans to
revise the structure of the budgetclassificationand the associated Chart o f Accounts by
December 2008.

113.        There are no prior actions identified inPRSC-1. Support for reforms inthis
area will beginwith the next credit (PRSC-2) with the following trigger: "Introduce
budget calendar that incorporates all budgetrelated activities." The trigger for PRSC-3
will be "the finalization o fthe revisedstructure o fthe budget classification andthe
associated Chart of Accounts by December 2008."

114.        At the end o fthe programperiod, the expectation is that there will be
improved allocation and expenditure on priority activities identified inthe MGDS. This
will greatly improve chances o fmeetingthe strategy's medium-termgoals.

Improvingpayroll management

115.        As indicatedunder the section on analyticalunderpinnings, weaknessesin
payroll management have been one o f the contributing factors to poor fiscal management
during2000 to 2004. Difficulties have been due to several factors, includinga complex
remuneration policywhere as much as two-thirdso fthe take home pay was inthe form o f


                                              - 40 -

allowances, the lack o f a credible integrated system ofmanagingpersonnel andpayroll
records, andthe fact that it takes long periods o ftime for personnel records (and hence
payroll) to be updated whenever life events such as deaths, resignations occur.

116.          Significant steps havebeentakenby the Government to strengthen control o f
the payroll inrecent years, and additional actions are plannedunderthe PRSCprogram.
A civil service wage reformwas carried out inlate 2004, andentailed arationalization of
grades and salary levels, and a consolidationofmost non-discretionary allowances into
the wage. The Government also introduced a new system in September 2006 for
managingpersonnel andpayrollrecords, the HumanResource ManagementInformation
System(HRMIS), which ensuresthat payroll data is automatically updated eachtime
there i s a change to personnel data. A database o f all Government employees has also
been compiled in2006, which-once filly operational-will                     helpimprove payroll
management andmitigate problems of ghost workers, inaccurate wage projections,
unauthorized allowances, hirings, promotions and wage increases. As part o fthis
exercise, the Government has also reconciled payroll records with the backlog o f
personnel data as o fDecember 2006.

117.          As a result o fthe above measures, payroll management has improved in
recent years, as reflected ina smaller variance between projected andactual wage bill as
a percentage o f GDP. Additional work is plannedunder the PRSC to firther improve
payroll management by strengthening the HRMIS andits data base. Specifically, there
are plans to carry out an independent review o fthe HRMIS in2007 inorder to establish
its robustness. The Government also plans to undertake a personnel audit in2008 to
verify andupdate the payroll database." Finally, the Government is also contemplating
the decentralization o fthe HRMIS invarious ministriesinorder to reduce delays in
updatingpersonnel records.

118.          Given this policy reform program, the prior action to be supported by
PRSC-1is the Reconciliation of the payroll with the backlogof personneldata that
was undertaken by December 2006. The trigger for PRSC-2 will be conducting a
review o fthe HRMISandstarting implementation o f a time boundAction Plan. For
PRSC-3, the trigger will bethe carrying out o f a personnel audit o f the HRMIS database
byDecember 2008.

119.          At the endofthe programperiod, it is hopedthat these reforms will ensure
that the civil service payroll is clean andup to-date. It is also expected that inthe
medium-term, the variance between projected and actual wage bill, ifany, will be
minimal.

Improving timeliness andfollow-up of external audit

120.          An evaluationo fhow well the budget has beenexecuted is a critical element
o f sound public financial management. Inthis regard, the Malawi Public Audit Act
provides for internal auditing, external auditing and Parliamentaryscrutiny ofthe audit

22This exercise will include a census o fcivil service, i.e. physicalverification o fevery civil servant on the
payroll, and that their qualifications are appropriate for the positiodgrade.


                                                     - 41 -

reports. Although some progress has been made inthe area o f internal auditing, there are
still weaknesses inthe area o f external auditing. Firstly, due to limited humancapacity,
very few ministries anddepartments are audited ina year. Secondly, preparationo fthe
audit reports and submission to Parliamenttakes place with a few years of delay. Thirdly,
there i s usually no follow up on audit recommendations made by the auditor general and
the Public Accounts Committee o fParliament.

121.         Inorder to dealwiththeseproblems, the Government hasputinplaceseveral
initiatives. Firstly, the capacity o f the National Audit Office has beenstrengthened bythe
recruitment o f 60 new assistant auditors and 20 interns. This means that more ministries
will now be audited thaninthe past. Already, Government entities representing more
than 50 percent o f expenditures were audited for financial year 2004/05. This percentage
i s expected to increase firther inthe next few years. Secondly, the roll out o f IFMIS will
go a long way to ensuring the timeliness o f the final accounts. However, this will not be
realized immediatelybecause some of the reporting systems are yet to be completely
converted into the new software o f IFMIS.With the increase inthe staffing levels at the
National Audit Office, the Government plans to be able to submit the Audit Report to
Parliament within 10 months o f the end o f the fiscal year 2006/07. Inthe mediumterm,
the aim is to be able to submit these reports within 6 months as requiredby law. Finally,
the Government plans to improve on follow-up o frecommendations inthe Audit Reports.
Inthis regard,the Government plansto start producingreports outlining actions takenin
response to the recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee on the Audit
Report.

122.         PRSC-1identifiesas aprior actionthe fact that centralGoMentities
representing50 percentof expendituresfor financialyear 2004/05 havebeen
audited.The trigger for PRSC-2 is that the Audit Report on FY 2005/06 be submittedto
legislature by December 2007; while the trigger for PRSC-3 i s the production o f a report
by OPC onthe FY2004/05 audit related recommendations bythe Public Accounts
Committee.

123.         Bythe endo fthis PRSCprogram, it is hopedthat Malawiwill have amore
effective external audit system. Inparticular, it i s hopedthat the number o f audit queries
will significantly reduce, as will bepublic finds lost through fraud andtheft. This will
ensure that public resources are used for their intendedpurposes.

Improvingpublic debt management

124.         Reachingthe HIPC completionpoint inAugust 2006 led to a significant
reduction inMalawi's external debt. Total debt stock was reduced from USD3billionto
about USDO.5 billion. This represents a reductioninMalawi's debt-to-exports ratio from
229 percent to only 32 percent. With regardto domestic debt, although progress has been
made to reducing the stock inthe last two years through fiscal discipline, Malawi remains
heavily burdened. Malawi's domestic debt stock hadreached a recordhigho f 25 percent
o f GDPin2003/04. At 20 percent o f GDP in2005/06, the domestic debt stock is still a
potential source o f fiscal vulnerability because the thin financial sector could quickly lead
to an increase indomestic interest rates. As recommended inthe PER, dealing with the


                                               - 42 -

debt problem will require more than exercising fiscal discipline - systems o f debt
management would also needto be improved.

125.        Inorder to improve the management ofpublic debt, the Government is
planningto undertake a multi-year reformprogram. Firstly, it has conducted a
comprehensive and systematic debt management performance assessmentwith technical
assistance from the World Bank in2007. This exercise has helped identify strengths and
weaknesses o fMalawi's debt management system, and identifiedpossible areas for
improvement.

126.        Secondly, the Government does not yet have a comprehensive debt
management strategy, which would provide guidance to ensure that Malawi remains on a
fiscally sustainable path after having reached its H P C completion point. As a stop-gap
measure, the Government plans in2007 to develop and issue guidelines for the entire
public sector to ensure that new external borrowing i s sufficiently concessional and
accumulated within sustainable levels. At the same time, the Government has started
preparation o f a debt management policy, to be approved by Cabinet. The policywill
outline clear principles for the contraction o fbothdomestic as well as external debt, and
will also clarify the legal, institutional and administrative framework for public debt
management. Itwill also indicate the mechanisms to be established for improving
coordinationbetweenthe Reserve Bank o fMalawi and the Ministryo f Finance. The
expectation i s that the two institutions will work together indetermining and forecasting
liquidityneedso fthe Government whendecidinghow muchto borrow onthe domestic
market.Inthis context, the Government is currently inthe process o fcreatinga cash
management unit within the Ministryo f Finance, and establishing a Cash Management
Committeeto improve coordination between the Ministryo fFinance andthe Reserve
Bank inliquiditymanagement.

127.        Finally, the Government also plans to increase staffing levels and capacity in
the Debt and Aid Division(DAD)o fthe Ministry o fFinance. Further, the DADwill also
analyze the costs andrisks associated with different financing options and therefore
advise Government on a least-cost financing option. Finally, the DADwill bepreparing
debtmanagement reports for submission to Parliament.

128.        Since the authorities are this year working on finalizing the draft debt policy,
the PRSCprogram support will start next year with a trigger for PRSC-2 being cabinet
approval o f a Debt and Aid Management policy. For PRSC-3, the trigger will be
implementation o fmechanisms for effective coordinationbetweenMinistry o f Finance
andRBMbyDecember 2008.

129.        At the end o fthe program period, it is hoped that there will bereduced
variability between forecast and actual debt service payments, and also that together with
continued fiscal discipline, there will be further improvements inMalawi's debt
sustainability indicators.

BOX 1: THE PROPOSEDPRSC AND GOOD PRACTICEPRINCIPLES ON CONDITIONALITY

Principle 1: ReinforceOwnership

T h e proposed PRSC has beenprepared after consulting Government ministries and departments on specific
reformprograms that will be implementedinorder to achieve the medium-term goals as outlined inthe
MGDS. It i s out o f these reformprograms that prior actions andtriggers to be supported by the PRSC have
beenselected. Some ofthe prior-actions and triggers that will be supported bythe PRSC were already in
the PAF. Together with donors who belong to the CABS the specific policy and institutional changeshave
beentranslated into indicators and targets andpresentedinthe PAF. Although various stakeholders were
consulted indeveloping the MGDS which provides a framework for the PAF, the Government plans to
hold sensitization workshops on the PAF with more stakeholders so that ownership o f the indicators and
targets is broad-based.

Principle2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partnerson a coordinated
accountabilityframework

The CABS donors and the Government o f Malawihave signeda Joint Framework (JF) o f budget support
cooperation. One o f the principles contained inthe JF i s that o f carrying outjoint reviews. Every year one
o f the reviews focuses on assessingGovernment performance inmeeting the targets contained inthe PAF.
Disbursements o fbudgetary support are basedon a positive outcome o fthis review.

Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Bank support to country
circumstances

The CABS undertakes biannual reviews, one during February-March and another during August-
September. Bothreviews are aligned to the country's budget cycle. The February-March review takes place
just before the Government startsto prepare its budget. The review focuses on assessingGovernment
performance inachieving the targets for eachindicator inthe PAF. Decisions on whether to disburse
budget support andhow much are based on the outcome o f this review. The August-September review
focuses on the annual budget that will havejust beenapproved by Parliament, public financial management
issues, and a preliminary assessmento f the fiscal performance duringthe previous fiscal year.

Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresultsas conditionsfor disbursement

One o f the principles o f the Joint Framework ofbudget support cooperationis to have as few indicators in
the PAF as possible. Malawi's PAF has one o f the least number o f PAF indicators inthe region. The
triggers and actions for the proposed PRSC represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving
the program's project development objectives and the various outcomes.

Principle5: Conduct transparent progressreviewsconducive to predictable andperformance-based
financialsupport

Inorder to improve predictability ofbudgetary support from donors, the JFrequiresdonors to indicate
levels o fbudgetary support that they are planning to disburse well inadvance o f the start o fthe fiscal year,
such that the amounts can be included inthe Budget submittedto Parliament. Once the main annual PAF
review inFebruary-March has beenconcluded, all the CABS donors inMalawi indicate to the Government
how muchthey're planning to disburseinthe following fiscal year. The Government uses this information
during the budget preparationprocess.

                          VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                A. Povertyand social impact


130.        It is expected that the policy and institutional reforms beingsupportedbythe
operationwill contribute towardsthe reduction o fpoverty. This section focuses on those
policies that have the potential to have the most significant positive as well as adverse
effects, and what the authorities are planningto enhance the positive effects and mitigate
the negative ones.

131.        Reforms being undertaken inADMARC are intendedto help reduce poverty
among rural households. This is becausethe main aim of the reforms i s to ensure that
ADMARC concentrates inareas which are currently not being served by the private
sector. As shown by the PSIA undertaken in2004, it i s inthe rural areas that ADMARC
marketing activities are needed. It i s possible, however, that some areasmay end up
havingreduced or no access to marketingservices as a result o fmistakes inthe
rationalization process. As a mitigating measure, ADMARC'S monitoring and evaluation
capacity will be strengthened to minimize the possibility o f areas which are neither
served byADMARC nor bythe private sector.

132.        The restructuringo fADMARC will inevitably leadto the retrenchingof
significant numberso f staff. Carefbl attention has beenpaid to determining a severance
package for staff to be retrenched. Further, a program i s being put inplace for helpingthe
retrenched staff findnew means o f livelihood.

133.        The involvement o fthe private sector inthe fertilizer subsidyprogram is also
expected to have a beneficial impact on the poor. According to an evaluation study o f the
2006/07 fertilizer subsidyprogram, the participation o fthe private sector inthe sale o f
subsidized fertilizer improved availability o f fertilizer inthe rural areas. However, the
same study also found that most private traders concentrated inareas which were more
easily accessible, and that some traders were accepting subsidy vouchers inexchange for
goods other than fertilizers and seeds. As a mitigating measure, the Government i s
discussing with the private traders to agree on performance indicators, which will
determine the extent of their participation infbture programs.

134.        Reforms inthe landtaxation andlandrent structure aim to promote equity,
andtherefore expected to benefit the poor. The revisions inthe landrent follow
complaints by farmers that the new land rent which hadbeen increased from KSOiha to
K1,OOOka was too high.A study has beencarried out on the likely impact o f various
levels o frents on farm incomes under different farming systems. However, although the
reform is meant to discourage large landholders from leavinglandidle, this may have a
perverse impact of making landmore expensive for the poor. As a mitigating measure,
the Government is currently piloting a community based landdistribution program
funded by IDA in four districts. Under the program, unused landi s acquired and re-
distributedto those households with no land.



                                             - 45 -

                     B. Implementation,Monitoring,andEvaluation

135.        The institutional arrangements for the preparation and execution ofthe PRSC
fall withinthe framework of the CABS. Onthe Government side, the CABS group is
served by a secretariat which i s situated inthe Debt andAid Division o f the Ministryof
Finance. The secretariat coordinates preparation o fthe PAF, implementation, assessment
andrevision. For these activities, the secretariat mobilizes the relevantpeopleinvarious
ministries anddepartments. These are organized into thematic groups based on the areas
covered bythe PAF.

136.        The program will be monitored and evaluated through the CABS review
cycle. As mentioned earlier, the CABS group undertakes two annual reviews, one during
February-March and another duringAugust-September. Apart from looking at the annual
budgetthat will havejust beenapproved byParliament,the August-September review
also undertakes a preliminary assessmento fthe progress made andlikelihood o fmeeting
the targets inthe PAF. The February-March review then undertakes a comprehensive
assessmento fperformance against the targets, and the findings ofthe assessmentprovide
a basis for makingdisbursement decisions.

137.        The general M&Esystem has improved inrecent years although weaknesses
remain. Monitoring andEvaluation ofthe MGDS is coordinated by the M&E Divisionin
the Ministryo fEconomic Planningand Development. An M&Emaster planandroad
map to its implementation were approved in2005. Implementationo f the roadmap i s
being supported by ajoint program o f support with basket funding from the European
Commission, DFID, and UNDP. Under the program, M&E officers have beenrecruited,
trained and deployed inall the district assemblies o f the country. This will improve
collection o f data from the field for monitoring the MGDS. M&Edivisions have also
beenestablished inmost line ministries. The mainweakness remaining is that the
indicators currently identified for monitoring the implementation o fthe MGDS are not
comprehensive enough for the M&E system to provide data that could also be used for
assessing the indicators inthe PAF. As such, data on some o fthe indicators still has to be
collectedon an ad hoc basis. The CABS partnersare working with the Government to
address this weakness.

                                    C.FiduciaryAspects

138.        While weaknesses remain, overall, the team is satisfied that the public finance
management system inMalawi is satisfactory to support this operation.

Public Financial Management System

139.        Two Public Expenditure FinancialAccountability Framework Assessments
(PEFAs) havebeen conducted inrecent years, in2005 and2006, respectively. The 2006
assessment found improvements ina numbero f areas, mainly inrelation to the improved
fiscal discipline introducedby the new Government, andmore recently, the
implementation o f the IntegratedFinancialManagement Information System (IFMIS),
which have ledto tighter expenditure controls and timely reporting. The main


                                            - 46 -

weaknesses were reportedinthe area o f internal and external auditing. Inparticular,
concerns were expressed about delays inthe production of audit reports andtheir
submission for legislative scrutiny. The assessment came up with several
recommendations which have been translated into a Public Finance andEconomic
Management (PFEM) Action Plan.

140.        Since the assessmentwas done, progress has been made ina numbero f areas.
Firstly, internal audit units are now functioning inall ministries andreports are issued
regularlyto the lineministries, the Ministryo fFinance andthe National Audit Office
(NAO). Secondly, the vacancy rate ininternal audit has beenreduced, the quality o f
internal auditors i s improving and the internal audit manualhas been completed. In
addition, a riskbased audit approach i s being introduced and a consultancy i s underway
to develop a risk management framework for selected ministries. With regardto external
audit, legislative scrutiny has improved significantly, with the PublicAccounts
Committee summoningcontrolling officers to respond to audit findings at public
hearings. Efforts will now be focused on timely submission o f audit reports to Parliament
andon follow-up to audit recommendations. Progress inthese areas andothers will be
monitoredby the CABS donors through the PAF.

141.    The 2004 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) found that in2002,
publicprocurement accounted for 16.2 per cent of GDP, that corruptioninprocurement
was widespread, capacity low and sanctions for corrupt practices were not effective. The
Government has, inresponse, attempted to comprehensively address these weaknesses. A
new Public Procurement Act, based on internationalprocurement standards became
operational in2004 with the establishment o fthe Office of the Director o f Public
Procurement (ODPP), headedby a Director andDeputyDirector appointed by the
President and approved by the Public Appointments Committee o fparliament. ODPP has
policy, standards and monitoringfunctions and does not directly procure. It has
supervisory oversight o f a decentralized procurement systemthat since 2006 has been
receiving intensive support from the World Bank, UNDP and USAID.This includes
training, by December 2007, o f almost 800 procurement staff o f Internal Procurement
Committees (IPCs) and Specialized Procurement Units (SPUs) inministries and
departments; establishment o f an ODPP Management Information System andwebsite;
developing the capacity within ODPP to undertake procurement audits; establishing
ministry,department andagency prior review procurement thresholds basedon capacity
as assessedby ODPP; establishment o f a referral systemfor mis-procurements identified
inthe ODPPpriorreview andprocurement monitoringprocessesto theMinistryof
Finance and the ACB for investigation; and, facilitation o fthe establishment o f a
professional body for procurement personnel. While challenges remain, there have been
significant advances inmoving the public procurement system towards acceptable
standards.

Funds Flow Arrangements

142.    An offsite assessmentwas conducted inJuly2001 followed byupdate
assessments inJuly 2003 and November 2005. The 2005 updateassessment concluded
that the RBMhad implementedmanyrecommendations o fthe 2003 safeguards


                                            - 47 -

assessment: (i) external audit opinion included a second signature from an office ina
               the
major financial center and the audit o fthe 2004 financial statements was completed
withinthree months following the endo fthe year; (ii)task force hadbeenappointed to
                                                        a
review the implementation o f International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and
(iii) capacityintheInternalAuditDepartment(IAD)hadbeenstrengthened.The
    staff
IADnowverifies programdatareportedto the IMFwiththe underlyingaccounting
records. However, the assessment also concluded that the role o fthe IAD inreviewing
data reportedto the IMF could be enhanced bythe IADreviewing procedures associated
with the datareportingprocess.

143.    However, the 2005 assessment also noted that two recommendations o fthe 2003
assessmentremainedoutstanding. These related to (i)    amendments to the RBMAct to
strengthen the legal structure andindependence o fthe RBMand (ii)       anaudit o fexternal
reserves under the control o fthe Treasury andmaintained inan account with Crown
Agents. Inaddition, the assessmentnoted that Board o fDirectors o fthe RBMhadbeen
dissolvedinAugust 2005 and that the Audit Committee was also no longer functional.

144.    Duringthe thirdPRGFreview, concludedinMarch2007, the authorities
committed themselves to revise the RBMAct and, as part o f a broader SADC initiative,
to grant the RBMgreater autonomy. The revised RBMAct i s expected to be presented to
Cabinet shortly. An audit o f external reserves under the control o f the Treasury and
maintained inan account with Crown Agents has beenundertaken as part o f a general
audit that the Crown Agents are required to undertake.A new RBMBoard o fDirectors
was appointed inMarch2006 and an Audit Committee reconstituted inthe same month.

                              D.DisbursementandAuditing

145.        Upon Grant effectiveness, expected inOctober 2007, a single tranche of SDR
13.1 million (US$20 million equivalent) will be made available to the Government o f
Malawi. The grant will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for Development
Policy Lending. Inparticular, the untiedbalance o fpaymentshudget support will be
disbursed against satisfactory implementation o fthe development policyprogram and not
tied to any specific purchases andno procurement requirements will be needed. It i s
envisaged that there will be two further single-tranche, annual PRCSs to support the
implementationo f the Program.

146.        The proceeds o fthe Grant, at the request o fthe Government, will be deposited
byIDAinto anaccount designated bythe Recipient andwhich forms part o fthe country's
official foreign exchange reserves. The local currency funds generated from the foreign
exchange sales will be deposited inthe Malawi Government Consolidated Account (MG1
Account) at the RBMand will go towards financing the Government budget. Throughthe
Ministry o fFinance, the Recipient will provide within 30 days o freceiving the grant
proceeds, a written confirmation to the IDA when the amount has been credited to the
ForeignExchange Deposit Account andthe Consolidated Account (MG1Account). The
Recipient will also ensure that all withdrawals from the Consolidated Account (MG1
Account) are for budgetedpublic expenditures, except for items on IDA'Snegative list.

Agreement, IDAwill require the Government to promptly uponnotice form IDA, refund
an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to IDA.Amounts refunded to IDA upon
such request shall be cancelled.

147.       The following arrangementssupport the requirements relatedto fiduciary
assurance:

    0  Foreignreserve account. The Government will acknowledge to IDA receipt o f the
       money into the foreign reserve account and the crediting o fthe amount inlocal
       currency to the Consolidated Account. While no external audit will be required, it
       is expected that the confirmation o freceipt will be countersigned by the
       authorized signatories, who are the Secretary to the Treasury and the Accountant
       General.

    0  Public (Government) accounts. The Auditor General is required by law to produce
       hisannualreport to Parliamentonthepublic accounts within 6 months ofthe
       financial year-end. IDAwill have access to these reports.

    0  Reserve Bank o fMalawi. The annual entity financial statements o fthe Reserve
       Banko fMalawi, audited inaccordance with internationalauditing standards as
       promulgatedby the International Federation o fAccountants, are publicly
       available.

148.       The use o fIDAresources for budgetary expenditure is subject to audit bythe
National Audit Office as part o fthe annual execution report. As mentioned earlier,
budget support donors are assisting the Government ofMalawi instrengtheningthe
N A O.

                                E.EnvironmentalAspects

149.       The program ingeneral has no direct environmental impacts. Inorder to
carefully assess environmental aspects o fthe PRSC program, the team has carried out a
formal environmentalassessmentusingthe DPL toolkit.

150.       The assessmenthighlighted that the PRSC supportedreforms intobacco
marketing could potentially put significant pressure on the environment. Improved
marketing efficiency and contract farming o ftobacco, resulting inimproved price
incentives inthe tobacco industry, are likely to lead to greater use o f firewood for curing
tobacco, andthereby to further loss o f forest. Malawi has a very highrate o f deforestation
andthese reforms will increase the pressure onthe existing forest resources.

151.       The Government i s aware of the problem, andas a mitigation measure, as part
o fthe MGDS, it plans to replant andrehabilitate 150,000 hectares o f softwood and
50,000 hectares o fhardwood timber inthe central and southern region where the rate o f
deforestation i s highest. The projected reforestation program, however, i s very
ambitious, and the currently limitedfinancial and human resources devoted to this
program (through the Forestry Department) will needto be scaled up considerably to



                                            - 4 9 -

achieve that target. Other options could also be pursued to mitigate this problem. One is
to enforce the requirement that tobacco growers keep 10percent o f their land as a
woodlot. The other is to look at alternative sources of energy for curing. The Ministryo f
Agriculture is looking for partners to review more efficient curing systems, including the
use o f some renewable sources and eventually to develop andimplement them. That
mightalso beworth investigating further. As part o ffiture PRSC operations, therefore,
the Bankwill explore with the Government possible ways to mitigate the environmental
impacts o ftobacco production.

152.        As part o f the environmental assessment, the Bank also reviewed the possible
impact o f PRSC-supported reforms inADMARC and agricultural marketing, increased
fertilizer use, land-rent and taxation, and improving the cost o f doing business, but found
that the negative environmental impacts o fthese reforms is likely to be minimal.

                                   F.Risks andMitigation

153.        The main risks overlap for a significant part with the risks identifiedinthe
CAS and are as follows:

154.        Political: Notwithstanding significant progress on the reform agenda and the
demonstrated resolve inregaining control over the macro economic situation, the
Government has a minority inparliament,which constrains its ability to forcefully
implementreforms. This riskis compoundedbythe fact that Malawi the next general
election are due intwo years time (before May 2009) and political campaigning seems to
have started. As a result, the Government may not be bold enoughto undertake some o f
the reforms that are likely to be controversial. Inthis regard, reforms relating to
ADMARC restructuring, the fertilizer subsidyprogram, and landpolicy pose some risks
to the program because o f their long standingpolitical sensitivity. To mitigate this risk,
the Government is inthe process o forganizingworkshops inorder to get buy-infrom
stakeholders outside Government on the proposed reforms. IDA and its partners will be
supporting the authorities inthis process with financial as well as technical assistanceas
required. Inaddition, the reforms supported by the PRSC program are focusing on
implementation and seeing through o f reforms for which legal changes are not
(immediately) required.

155.        Governance related: Deterioration in governance could negatively affect the
Government's willingness to implement economic reforms. Inorder to mitigate this risk
IDAhasjoined the CABS as a way ofintensifyingthe dialogue andincreasingits
leverage to ensure good governance. Inaddition, to influencing governance through its
policy dialogue, IDA also assists the authorities through its FIMTAP operationto
strengthen the capacity within the Government to reduce its vulnerability to corruption.

156.        Macroeconomic performance: Several risks threaten Malawi's
macroeconomic stability, and growth prospects. Inaddition to the political risks to the
implementation o f the reforms program (as discussedabove), the two major dangers are
(i) occurrenceoftermsoftradeand/orweatherrelatedshocks,and(ii) upcoming
   the                                                                       the
elections in2009 which mightreduce the Government commitment to spending control.


                                             - 50 -

Eithero fthese two risks could endanger the plannedreduction indomestic debt, whichis
needed to allow greater private sector investment and boost economic growth.

157.        To mitigate the country's vulnerability to external shocks, the PRSC in
combination with the other CABS donors supports the Government's efforts to diversify
the economy andto adopt acomprehensive ex-ante riskmitigation and contingencyplan
for reducingthe country's vulnerability to drought. Further, the CABS partners,
including IDA, have increased predictability o f donor funding through the adopted
process and timing o f reviewswhich assist the Government with its budgetplanning.

158.        To mitigate the risks of fiscal slippage dueto politicalpressure inthe run-up
to the 2009 elections, the PRSC program, incombinationwith the other CABS donors,
supports the efforts bythe Government to strengthen PFM systems and to develop a
National DebtPolicy, which are expected to reduce the country's vulnerability to fiscal
slippage.

159.        Utilization o f funds: A risk exists that the composition of public expenditures
may not be fully consistent with MGDSpriorities. To mitigate this threat, the PAF
includes indicators andtargets aimed at improving the composition o f expenditures.
Further, as presented inthis document, the PRSC will be supporting a reform agenda
aimed at improving the budgetprocess, andstrengthen the linkages between the budget
andthe MGDS.

160.       Administrative capacity andcoordination: Malawi's relatively limited
Government administrative capacity and coordination among relevant line ministries and
departments, compounded by the impact of HIV/AIDS on humancapacity ingeneral,
could leadto delays inthe implementation o fkey measures. To mitigate this potential
coordination failure, the implementation arrangements o fthe CABS includes a steering
committee with representation o f all relevant line ministries and departmentsinvolved.

Dear MrZoellick,

                   MALAWI: LETTER OF DEVELOPMENTPOLICY

1.        On behalf of the Government o f Malawi, Iwrite to request for the first Poverty
Reduction Support Grant (PRSC-1) of US$20 million equivalent from the International
Development Association (IDA) in support of a policy and institutional reform agenda
whose framework has been provided for in the Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy (MGDS), Malawi's second poverty reduction strategy paper. The proposed
PRSC-1 will serve two purposes: (i)     it will help the Government bridge a financing gap
that exists inthe implementationof the MGDS through the provision of funds the policy
and institutional reforms required for the MGDS to meet its medium-term poverty
reduction goals; and (ii)  it will be a source of foreign exchange which Malawi needs to
fillinanexistingbalanceofpaymentsfinancinggap.

2.        The proposed PRSC-1 will support policy and institutional changes in the
following areas: (i) Agriculture and land reform; (ii) Sector Development; and

establishment o f satellite auction floors for tobacco, and involving the private sector in
the fertilizer and seed subsidy program. In land reform, the proposed PRSC-1 will
support the hiring o f land officers and clerks in the districts in order to enhance local
capacity for collecting land rent while in private sector development, the reforms
supported will include the establishment o f a commercial division in the High Court o f
Malawi and the streamlining o f the business licensing regime. In economic governance,
the measures to be undertaken aim at improving the management o f the pay roll which
has been a source o f fiscal overruns. More details on the proposed reforms to be
supported under PRSC-1 are set out inPartC of this letter.

A. Recent Macroeconomic Performance

3.      Malawi has made significant progress in restoring macroeconomic stability. The
current administration which came to power in May 2004 inherited a highly unstable
macroeconomic situation. Inflation had reached 30 percent in 2000. Domestic debt had
risen to a record 25 percent o f GDP infiscal year 2003/04, with interest rates reaching as
highas 45 percent. The fiscal balance includingtransfers was aroundnegative 10percent
o f GDP. This led to a severe crowding out of private sector investment by Government
borrowing. As a result o f the fiscal slippages under the previous administration, an
International Monetary Fund(IMF) Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) program
went off-track in early 2004 and subsequently expired towards the end o f the year.
Similarly, due to poor macroeconomic management and failure to fulfill other structural
measures, Malawi struggled to reach the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
completion point, having reached the decision point in December 2000. Exacerbated by
poor rains, economic growth was very sluggish, averaging just around 1.6 percent
between 2000 and 2004.

4.      Against this poor performance, when the new administration came into office, it
took rapid steps to improve the fiscal situation and pursue sustainable macroeconomic
policies. Strict fiscal discipline was introduced in the management o f public resources,
and macroeconomic performance improved under the auspices o f an IMF' Staff
Monitored Program (SMP). The successful implementation o f the SMP led to an
agreement with the IMF on a new PRGF program in August 2005. After successfully
completing two reviews, Malawi finally reached the HIPC completion point in August
2006. This reduced Malawi's external debt stock from 229 percent o f exports to 32
percent, inend-2005 net present value terms.

5.      Other macroeconomic indicators have also shown noticeable improvements.
Buoyed by a bumper harvest last year, year-on-year inflation reached 9.2 percent in
January 2007, the first time it has hit single digit in four years. As o f May, inflation had
reached 7.9 percent. Domestic debt is projected to fall down to around 16.5 percent o f
GDP by the end of the 2006/07 fiscal year. The Bank Rate is down to 20 percent while
interest rates on the Treasury bill market are around 16 percent on average. Despite a
severe drought, the economy still registered positive growth in 2005, albeit only 1.9
percent. In2006, the economy i s projected to grow at 8.4 percent.

B. The MalawiGrowth andDevelopment Strategy

6.      In November 2006, the Government of Malawi finalized its second poverty
reduction strategy, the MGDS, which covers the period 2006 to 2011, prepared using
participatory processes.' The strategy's overall objective is to reduce poverty through
economic growth and i s organized around five thematic areas as follows: (i)sustainable
economic growth, (ii)social protection and disaster risk management; (iii)social
development; (iv) infrastructure development; and (v) good governance. From these
thematic areas, the strategy has identified six key focus areas that are seen as central to
achieving the strategy's overall objective o f reducing poverty through economic growth.
These focus areas are agriculture and food security; infrastructure development; energy
generation and supply; imgation and water development; integrated rural development;
andprevention and management o fnutrition disorders, HIV andAIDS.

7.      The MGDS emphasizes the need for Malawi to register sustained private sector
and export-led growth in order to make a noticeable dent on poverty. The long-term
vision o f the MGDS is to transform Malawi from a predominantly importing and
consuming country into a predominantly producing and exporting country. It seeks to
achieve growthrates o f at least 6 percent a year. The strategy concentrates on agriculture
as the driver o f growth. It focuses on increasing agricultural productivity and integrating
smallholder farmers into commercial activities. Inthe longterm, the Government has also
identified four sectors with potential for high growth: tourism, mining, manufacturing,
and agro-processing.

8.      The MGDS also acknowledges the role o f social development in health,
education, economic empowerment and social protection among others. It recognizes
that a healthy and educated population is necessary if Malawi i s to achieve sustainable
economic growth. The strategy further recognizes the importance of increasingthe assets
o f the poor and vulnerable so they can contribute to and benefit from economic growth.
The Government has put plans in place to protect those that may be left out due to their
inability to actively participate inthe development process. Finally, the MGDS also aims
at consolidating the gains registered in macroeconomic performance through improved
governance.

9.      The strategy has identified long-term goals, medium-term outcomes, and
constraints to achieving these outcomes. It then outlines the strategies and key actions
that will contribute towards achieving the defined outcomes. Implementation o f the
strategies and actions will entail undertaking capital investments, maintenance o f assets,
and implementation o f policy and institutional reforms. However, in this endeavor,
Malawi i s faced with the challenge o f mobilizing resources to implement the MGDS.
Although the various strategies andactions have beenprioritized, there exists a financing
gap for the Government to implement even the top priorities, and hence this request for
financing.

C. ReformsImplementedSince2004

10.     Malawi last received financial assistance from IDA inthe form o f a two-tranche
Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) which supported the Fiscal Management and
Accelerating Growth (FIMAG) program. The first tranche was released in September
2004 while the second tranche was released inApril 2006. The Credit was insupport o f
reforms in the following areas: (i)  fiscal management; (ii) parastatal reforms; (iii) land
policy and agriculture; and (iv) combating HIV/AIDS.              The reforms in fiscal
management were designed to strengthen the Government's                 capacity to meet
macroeconomic stabilization targets while protecting the crucial pro-poor expenditures,
and improving the delivery o f social services by accelerating fiscal decentralization. The
parastatal reforms were aimed at reducing the burden on the budget as well as improving
the delivery o f key infrastructure services. Reforms in agriculture were designed to
contribute to growth by increasing the returns to smallholder farmers by creating better
functioning land, tobacco and maize markets. Finally, the reforms in HN/AIDS, which
were carried out intandem with the Malawi HIV/AIDS Project (MAP),were focused on
creating the policy and institutional framework for channeling increased resources and
strengthening institutions for mitigatingthe health and social impacts of HIV/AIDS.

11.     Significant progress was made in these areas. Inthe area o f fiscal management,
the new Public Finance Management Act was operationalized by issuing Treasury
Instructions and by creating a fully functional Internal Audit Unit and the Directorate of
Public Procurement. Inorder to improve expenditure monitoring, the Government began
to regularly submit the Quarterly Expenditure Reports (QERs) to the Cabinet Committee
on the Economy and the Budget and Finance Committee of Parliament, and post on the
web the actual and budgeted pro-poor expenditures within six weeks of the end o f the
quarter.   In addition to considerable progress in budget formulation and expenditure
management, important steps were also taken towards fiscal decentralization.

12.     In the area of parastatal reforms, the objective was to reduce the risk o f fiscal
shocks and improve their operational efficiency. The risk o f fiscal shocks was reduced
by strictly controlling parastatal borrowing. A comprehensive program of reconciliation
o f arrears was prepared and a program for their elimination was launched with cabinet
approval. The operational efficiency o f parastatals was improvedby making progress on
the privatization program. The sale of Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL),
initiated under the FIMAG operation was successfully concluded, and Blantyre Milling,
Alexander Forbes, Malawi International Transport Company (MITCO), Manica and the
Sugar Corporation o f Malawi were all brought to the point o f sale. Inparallel, a revised
Divestiture Sequence Plan (DSP) was prepared supported by technical assistance from a
restructured Privatization and Utility Reform Program (PURP) operation o f the
Association'. Towards the next phase o f privatizations, the Government has already
obtained parliamentary approval for the Electricity bill and the Energy Regulation bill
prepared in line with the cabinet approved power policy. Finally, the Government has

recently launched a passenger obligation study for Shire Bus Lines, to determine the
extent of subsidies required for unviable routes. Once this study i s concluded, an
informationmemorandum willbe issuedfor Shire Bus Lines.

13.     Within agriculture, the FIMAG supported Government inthe implementation of a
three track program for accelerating agricultural growth. First, to improve the efficiency
o f land use, the Government' prepared a new land bill that has been submitted to
Parliament for approval. Ground rents on leasehold land were progressively increased
from MKSO/Ha to MK1000/Ha and the land rent collection was decentralized. The
Government has completed a comprehensive review of the land tax system that also
includes potential taxation of freehold land. Specific proposals for a restructuring of
taxation are currently being discussed.    The Government's initiatives for land policy
reforms are being supported by the IDA financed Community Based Rural Land
Development Project (CBRLDP).           Second, the Government has made significant
progress in reducing costs and improving the efficiency of the tobacco supply chain.
Third, to improve food security, the Government has prepared a comprehensive food
security policy and i s inthe process ofreformingADMARC.

 14.    The Government's reform program in combating HIV/AIDS focused on
strengthening the institutional and policy framework.        As part of the measures to
strengthen institutions, the trust deed for the National Aids Commission WAC) was
finalized; an HN/AIDSmainstreaming strategy for local authorities was prepared; and,
HIV/AIDScoordinators were appointed inall Ministries. Inan effort to protect financing
to HJY/AIDS related activities, fiom FY2004/2005 onwards a separate budget line for
HIVIAIDS related expenditures was created in each ministry budget and these
expenditures were classified and monitoredas pro-poor expenditures. Finally, budgetary
allocations to the NAC basket fhding were protected.

D.Specific Reformsto beImplemented

 15.     In line with the MGDS, and in consultation with the Government, IDA has
 outlined its proposed medium-term support to Malawi the 2007-2011 Country Assistance
 Strategy. In this context, Iwould like to highlight the various reforms that the
Government o f Malawi intends to undertakenotjust for purposes of the proposedPRSC-
 1to which this financing request directly relates, but also under subsequentPRSCs so as
to presenta holistic pictureofthe Government's reformprogram.

 (i) Agriculture and Land Reforms

 16.          According to the MGDS, improving agriculture productivity will be key to
 ensuring that Malawi achievesthe 6 percent annual growth rate that is necessaryto make
a noticeable dent on poverty. Inthis regard, some of the policies will involve improving
the functioning of output and input markets. The envisaged reforms will ensure that
 farmers have better access to markets, improvedprice incentives, andincreaseduptakeof
fertilizers and seeds. Most of the reforms are a continuation of policy and institutional
changes supported by IDA under FIMAG.

17.           In the output markets, the Government plans to finish the restructuring o f
ADMARC based on the principles contained in a paper that was approved by Cabinet in
January 2006. Based on the recommendations outlined in the approved Cabinet paper,
ADMARC will undergo a strategic refocusing so that it concentrates on its core mandate,
which i s the provision o f marketing services. This strategic refocusing has started with
the winding down of ADMARC's non-core business interests held through the
ADMARC Investment Holding Company (AIHC). The corporate office o f AIHC has
been closed down and AIHC's shares in Manica, Clark Cotton, Alexander Forbes, and
The Sugar Corporation o f Malawi have been sold off. This is a prior action proposed to
be supported underPRSC-1.

18.           The Government also plans to improve ADMARC's efficiency by focusing
its marketing services in areas with market failures. In this regard, excess warehousing
space will be transferred to a new publicly owned but commercially oriented company
that will be involved inthe leasing o f warehousing space, the Malawi Warehousing and
Trading Company (MAWTCO). Details o f how the restructured ADMARC and the
warehousing company will operate have been outlined in business plans produced for
eachproposed entity. Itis envisaged that inthe next few months, substantial progress will
be made in restructuring ADMARC as follows: (i)         incorporation o f ADMARC as a
Public Company Limited by Guarantee; (ii)reconstitution o f the ADMARC Board o f
Directors to include key public and private stakeholders; (iii)  establishment o f a single
point o f supervision of ADMARC within the Government; (iv) retrenchment o f staff as
outlined in business plan completed; (v) sale o f fixed property and obsolete vehicles as
outlined inbusiness plan completed; (vi) transfer o f assets to MAWTCO completed; (vii)
performance indicators identified and agreed by ADMARC's Board o f Directors. With
regard to the establishment and operationalization o f the warehousing company, the
Government plans to undertake the following actions: (i)      MAWTCO incorporated as a
public limited liability company; (ii)excess warehouse capacity transferred from
ADMARC to MAWTCO; (iii) o f Directors for MAWTCO constituted to include
                                Board
keypublic and private stakeholders; (iv) head office established with requisite equipment
and vehicles; (v) leasing of warehouse facilities initiated; (vi) refurbishment of
warehouse facilities initiated.

19.           In tobacco marketing, the Government is keen to ensure that returns on
produce increase. Inthis connection, it plans to build on progress made in undertaking
policy measures agreed by stakeholders in 2005 on improving the functioning o f the
tobacco sector. The Government has already established three satellite auction floors in
Kabwafu, Mpasadzi, and Mgodi in order to improve accessibility to markets by tobacco
farmers and reduce domestic marketing costs, which is a prior action proposed to be
supported under PRSC-1. The Government would also like to improve the operation o f
contract farming in order to increase smallholder' access to technology and reduce
marketing inefficiencies.    To this end, the Government plans to review the current
contract farming system in order to see how it can be improved. Once approved by
Cabinet, the recommendations coming out o f the review will then be implemented. In
addition, as part o f the reform program, the Government intends to carry out and




                                          - 57 -

implement the recommendations o f detailed performance audits of each o f the main
tobacco sector institutions.

20.            Increased usage o f fertilizers and seeds has always been key to improving
agricultural productivity inMalawi. However, accessto these inputs by most smallholder
farmers has been a challenge due to their highcost. A s a result, the Government started
implementing a targeted fertilizer and seed price subsidy program in the 2005/06
agricultural season, designed to target 1.7 million poor smallholders. Procurement o f the
inputs and their distribution has mainly been done by public sector institutions:
ADMARC and the Smallholder Farmers Fertilizer Revolving Fund of Malawi,
SFFRFM). However, this has lead to a substantial fall in commercial sales o f inputs to
smallholder farmers through private sector outlets. This would firther jeopardize future
availability o f fertilizer fiom commercial outlets for those farmers not benefitingfiom the
subsidy. Inthis regard, the Government plans to ensure participationofprivate traders in
the program. Already, during the 2006/07 agricultural season, 28 percent o f subsidized
fertilizer was sold through private sector outlets, and is a prior action proposed to be
supported under PRSC-1.          However, due to concerns about the quality o f service
provided by some of the private traders, the Government plans to undertake a
performance assessment o f private sector involvement in the program in order to draw
performance indicators for the program.           Increased private sector involvement in
subsequentyears will be contingent onperformance against these indicators.

21.            The Government also plans to continue with land reforms embarked upon
under FIMAG. Inparticular, it will continue to ensure that the land tax system does not
encourage landholders to leave their land idle. As indicated above, the ground rents on
leasehold land were progressively increased from MWKSOhectare to MWK1000hectare
between 2004 and 2005. However, there have been complaints by farmers that the new
rental level i s too high. The new rate has therefore been suspended. A study has now
been conducted to review the structure o f land rentals and taxes, and has made some
recommendations regarding an equitable structure of land rents and taxes. The
 Government plans to hold consultations on the findings and recommendations o f the
 study before Cabinet can approve the new structure o flandrents and taxes.

 22.           Apart from increasing land rents and taxes, Government would also like to
 ensure that there i s adequate capacity to collect these rents and taxes. The Government is
 therefore continuing with the process o f decentralizing the process o f collecting rents and
 taxes. To this end, Twenty four district land offtcers and 55 land clerks have been
recruited and deployed, also a prior action proposed to be supported under PRSC-1. In
 the medium- term, plans are to establish land registries in at least four districts so that
 landofficers know exactly who owns how much land. Inaddition, the Government plans
to ensure that the Land Bill which was submitted to Parliament in June o f 2006 gets
 enacted. Once approved, the Government plans to undertake further policy and
 institutional changes aimed at improving the functioning o f land markets within the new
 law, such as confemng greater responsibility inthe administration o f land issues from the
central government to districts and traditional authorities. This would entail the




                                               - 58 -

establishment o f local Land Allocation Committees and Land Tribunals, to resolve land
ownership issues at the local level.

(ii)Private Sedor DevelopmentReforms

23.          The MGDS also emphasizes the need for Malawi to improve its business
climate in order to ensure private-sector led growth. Inthis regard, Government plans to
undertake several measures to improve the legal and regulatory environment for
businesses. For example, Malawi's business licensingregime i s currently so complex and
cumbersome that it takes long periods of time for a new business to be registered and to
start operating. This discourages new entrants into the formal sector. In this regard, the
Government has started a process o f reviewing the business licensing regime so that laws
facilitate business operations rather than act as an impediment. Proposals coming out o f
the review include reducingthe unnecessarymultiplicityof various categories ofbusiness
licenses. There are also plans to introduce a more simplified and fair licensing cost
structure. The new licensing regime (and related new cost structure) will be gazetted
soon.

24.           The Government also plans to embark on a comprehensive review of all
economic laws, including the Business Licensing Act. Examples of some of the other
laws to be revised include Export Incentives Act, Taxation Act, Labour Relations Act,
and ImmigrationAct. In addition, the government also plans to establish a one-stop shop
for investment, exporting and business licensing. Legislationfor the establishment of this
institution has already been drafted.

25.           Malawi's business environment has also been characterized by weak
contract enforcement and limited access to commercialjustice. Inparticular, capacity in
the court system to deal with commercial type of cases has been weak, partly due to the
absence of specialized courts. In 2006, it took an average o f 337 days to enforce a
contract through the court system. Many businesses are therefore reluctant to enter into
contract arrangements except with the most trusted clients. This limits the scope for
business opportunities and growth. Inorder to deal with this constraint to private sector
development, a Commercial Division of the High Court has been established in 2007 in
order to relieve the current large backlog o f commercial cases in Malawi's court system
and to strengthen contract enforcement. This i s a prior action proposed to be supported
under PRSC-I. Rules of Procedure for the court have been reviewed and gazetted,
premises havebeen secured, andjudges have started hearingcases.

(iii)SocialProtectionReforms

26.           The MGDS also recognizes the importance o f dealing with vulnerability to
shocks at household and national levels. Major shocks include drought, illnesses and
deaths mostly due to HIV/AIDS.         The strategy further highlights the importance o f
designing social protectionprograms for the most vulnerable in order to ensure that they
benefit from economic growth. Challenges that Malawi has been facing in the
implementation o f social protection programs include poor coordination and lack o f




                                             - 59 -

comprehensiveness in coverage. These have mostly been due to weak capacity at the
Social Protection Unit (SPU) mainly in the form of low staffing levels, lack of a
comprehensive policy to guide the various interventions, and inadequate funding. With
regard to low staffing levels, a recruitment process has been initiated to increase staffing
levels inthe unit.

27.           For purposes o f coordination, there has also been significant progress inthe
past year. Firstly, the Social Protection Unit has since 2006 been coordinating the
implementation o f a pilot cash transfer program in Mchinji. Funding and technical
assistance has been provided by UNICEF and MASAF but has drawn various
stakeholders including the Ministryo f Gender and Child Development, and the National
AIDS Commission in its design and implementation. Secondly, a Social Protection
Steering Committee and a Technical Committee have been established. The steering
committee is chairedby the Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet andis composed
o fhighlevel representatives from the Government, NGOs and the donor community. The
same institutions are represented in the technical committee which serves the steering
committee. Thirdly, work i s underway to prepare a comprehensive social protection
policy. It is expected that this policy will be comprehensive in its coverage, to include
new cash transfer programs and support to HIV/AIDS care. The policy will become
operational in 2007108 after cabinet approval in the same year. In the interim, the
Government has adopted a social protection framework endorsed by donors and NGOs.
The framework outlines the principles that all institutions involved inthe implementation
o f social protectionprograms needto adhere to.

28.            Inorder to ensure that social protectionprograms are adequately funded, the
Government plans to create a budget line and allocate funds for social protection
programs both from its own resources and those o f interested development partners in
accordance with agreedbasket funding arrangements.

(iv) Public Sector and Finance Management Reforms

29.            In order to consolidate the gains achieved in restoring macroeconomic
stability, the Government plansto undertake several policy reforms inthe area o f budget
process, payroll management, external auditing, debt management, and cormption
prevention. With regard to the budget process, the reforms seek to set a foundation for
improved linkages between the budget and the MGDS. First, it intends to introduce a
budget calendar that incorporates all budget related activities, including the MGDS
annual progress review. Secondly, the Government plans to revise the structure o f the
budget classification and the associated Chart o f Accounts so that the two are fully
consistent with each other. This will make it easier to monitor and report progress on the
implementation o fthe MGDS.

30.            The Government would also like to continue with reforms it has been
undertaking with regard to the public sector wage system. The focus is now on
strengthening the management o f the payroll in order to reduce wastage o f public
finances through ghost workers. In this regard, Government introduced a new system in




                                             - 60 -

September 2006 for managing personnel and payroll records, the Human Resource
Management Information System (HRMIS) to replace the then existing system, the
Personnel, Payroll, Pensions and Advances Integration (PPPAI) which among other
weaknesses, could not update the payroll whenever there was a change to some personnel
records. For the system to operate with clean data, the Government embarked on a data
reconciliation exercise of payroll with the backlog o f personnel data which was finalized
towards the end of last year, and i s a prior action proposed to be supported under PRSC-
1. The Government also plans to carry out an independent review o fthe HRMISinorder
to establish its robustness. Once this exercise i s accomplished, a payroll audit will be
undertaken in order to see what the payroll looks like since the introduction of the
HRMIS.3 Finally, the Government is also contemplating the decentralization of the
HRMISinvarious ministriesinorder to reduce delays inupdatingpersonnel records.

31.             Although progress has been made in reducing the stock o f external and
internal debt inthe last two years, Malawi remains heavily burdened with domestic debt.
Further, there is need to have inplace measuresto ensure that Malawi does not buildup
unsustainable levels of external debt again. Dealing with the debt problem will require
more than exercising fiscal discipline - systems o f debt management would also need to
be improved. In order to improve the management of public debt, the Government is
planning to undertake a multi-year reform program. First, it has conducted a
comprehensive and systematic debt management performance assessment with technical
assistance from the World Bank in 2007. This exercise has provided a systematic
assessment of strengths and weaknesses o f Malawi's debt management system, and
identifiedpossible areas for improvement. Secondly, the Government plans to finalize the
debt management policy that i s currently in draft form and have it approved by cabinet.
The policy will outline clear guidelines for contracting o f both domestic as well as
external debt.

32.             The Government also plans to increase staffing levels and capacity in the
Debt and Aid Division (DAD) o f the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and will establish
mechanisms to improve the coordination between the Reserve Bank o f Malawi and the
MinistryofFinance. The expectation isthat the MOFwill among other things work with
the Reserve Bank o f Malawi in determining and forecasting liquidity needs of the
government when deciding how much to borrow on the domestic market. The MOF,
through the DAD, will also analyze the costs and risksassociated with different financing
options and therefore advise the Government on least-cost financing options. Finally, the
DADwillbepreparing debt management reports for submissionto Parliament.

33.             An evaluation o fhow well the budget hasbeen executed is a critical element
o f sound public financial management. Inthis connection, the Malawi Public Audit Act
provides for internal auditing, external auditing and Parliamentary scrutiny of the audit
reports. Although some progress has been made inthe area of internal auditing, there are
still weaknesses inthe area o f external auditing. Firstly, due to limited human capacity,
very few ministries and departments are audited in a year. Secondly, preparation o f the

 This exercise will include a census of civil service, Le. physical verification ofevery civil servant on the
payroll, and that their qualifications are appropriate for the positiodgrade.

audit reports and submission to Parliament takes place with a few years o f delay. Thirdly,
there i s usually no follow up on audit recommendations made by the auditor general and
the Public Accounts Committee o f Parliament.

34.           In order to deal with these problems, the govemment has put in place
several measures. Firstly, the capacity o fthe National Audit Office has been strengthened
by the recruitment o f 60 new assistant auditors and 20 interns. This means that more
ministries will now be audited than inthe past. Already, more than 50 percent o f central
Government entities were audited for financial year 2004105, which i s a prior action
proposed to be supported under PRSC-1. This percentage is expected to increase further
inthe next few years. Secondly, the roll out of IFMISwill go a longway to ensuringthe
timeliness o f the final accounts. However, this will not be realized immediatelybecause
some o f the reporting systems are yet to be completely converted into the new software
o f IFMIS. With the increase in the staffing levels at the National Audit Office, the
Government plans to be able to submit Audit Reports to Parliament within 10 months o f
the end o f the fiscal year 2006/07. Inthe medium term, the aim is to be able to submit
these reports within 6 months as required by law. Finally, the Government plans to
improve on follow-up o f recommendations in the Audit Reports. In this regard, the
Government will start producing reports indicating actions taken by ministries and
departments on audit relatedrecommendations by the Public Accounts Committee.

35.           Finally, the Government also plans to step up efforts in the area o f
corruption prevention. The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has been involved in
conducting public accountability workshops aimed at educating people in various public
institutions on various aspects o f corruption. In some institutions, the ACB has helped
develop anti-corruption policies. However, there i s recognition that reforms need to be
undertaken in certain public institutions in order to reduce the likelihood o f corruption
taking place in those institutions. Such reforms would focus on changing administrative
systems andprocedures that currently provide a conducive environment for corruption to
take place. In this regard, the ACB plans to undertake corruption risk assessments in
selected institutions, where corruption i s most severe according to the baseline survey, in
order to identify weaknesses in procedures and systems in such institutions that may be
responsible for high incidences o f corruption. The plan i s to undertake risk assessments
and implement their recommendations in at least one public institution in 2007 and
additional two by end o f 2008. Further, the ACB also plans to ensure that the respective
public institutions implement the recommendations coming out of these riskassessments.
Inthis regard, a list ofpriority recommendations will bedrawnout between the ACB and
the concerned institutions.

36.           Iamconfidentthattheoutlinedpolicies,programsandreformswillcreatea
conducive environment for the effective and efficient utilization o f any assistance the
IDA may provide, towards enabling the Government to implement its poverty reduction
goals as set out inthe MGDS.

                                       August 24,2007

Thisnoteprovides an assessment of Malawi 's macroeconomic conditions and outlook,based
on information available through July 2007. Macroeconomicperformance has remained
satigactoty andpolicy implementation, norwithstandingsome slippages,remains broadly
consistent with the authorities 'macroeconomic objectives. Theauthorities continue to
implement their economicprogram, which is beingsupported by a three-year arrangement
under theIMF'sPoverty Reducrion and Growth Facility (PRGF), but thedelay in the
passage of thebudget owing to thepolitical i m p s e has k e n delaying Board considemtion
of thefourth review.

The ExecutiveBoard approvedthe authorities' requestfor a three-year PRGFarrangement
on August 5,2005, and completedthe third review togetherwiththe 2006 Article IV
consultationon March 14,2007.

Macroeconomicperformancecontinuesto bestrong and vulnerability to shocksis
decreasing. Backedby goodweather conditions,a supportive internationalenvironment,and
generallystrongpoiicyimplementation,growthwas highat 7.9 percentin 2WM, and 12-
monthinflation fell to 7.4 percentinJuly 2007, below programprojechons.Although
internationalreseryesremainlow,they increasedto 1 3 monthsof importsby endJune2007,
andcredit to the privatesector roseto 24 percentofGDP comparedwith 20 percentofGDP
a year ago. Publicdebt, foreign anddomestic,has fallen as a share of GDP.

Theapproval of a budget for 2007/08 (JulyJune) consistentwith the macroeconomic
framework supported by the PRGFarrangement is beingdelayeddue to anongoing
politicalImpasse.Passageofthe budget, whose keyfiscal objectiveis reducingthe domestic
debt burden, is a prior actionfor IMFExecutiveBoardconsiderationof the fourth review.If
the authoritiespass thebudget for 2007/08 inlinewith the programandkeeptheir
macroeconomicand sbucturalreformprogramon track, and otherremainingissuescan be
resolved,Boardreviewofthe programcouldtake placebeforeyear end.

Improvementsin budgetformulation and execution and structural reforms under the
pragramhavebeen slower than expected. Discretionaryspending for 2006/07 was
somewhat higher thanbudgeted.Basedon preliminarydata,the endJune 2007 indicative
target on discretionary spendingwas missedby MK4.2 billion(0.9 percent of GDP).This
matchedhigher-than-budgeteddomesticrevenues.Domestic financingnonetheless looksto
be abovetarget, partlybecauseofinaccurateprojectionsof debt serviceand administrative
delaysinreceiving a IDA loan, for whichthe adjusterinthe programis onIy partial.Despite
the slippage on domesticborrowing, the ratioofdebt to GDP fell to 12.4 percentofGDPat
end-June 2007, comparedto 14.4 percent ofGDP the previousyear4Some structuralreforms,
especially inpublicfinancial management,have beendelayedbut are now progressing;

TheRBMmetkey monetarytargetson netdQlneSthassets (IVDA) and netforeign

for mostlyseasonalinterventions.Since mid-2006, the bilateralnominalU.S.dollar
exchange rate and the real effective exchange rate have beenbroadlystable. Staffhasnot
found indications ofadministrativerestrictionson the exchangerate or of an intensification
ofthe multiplecumncy practice. The RBM has notreportedany privateexternal payment
mars, and spreadsbetweenthe buyandsell exchangeratesofferedby commercialbanks
andthe foreignexchange bureaushave trendeddownwardsincetheirpeakin spring2006. As
inflation falls to targeted levels,it will be important that the authorities allow their managed
floatingexchange rate system to operate, while continuingto build internationalreservesto
morecomfortablelevels. Promotinga stronger and more efficient financialsystem is also a
priority. The recentlyinitiated(July 2007) FinancialSector Assessment Programwill help
further this objective.
