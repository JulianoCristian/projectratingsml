Strategy\n            (MGDS). The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (Report No.\n            38326-MW) envisages that over a period of three years, there\n            could be a series o f three proposed annual Development\n            Policy Credits. This Grant's reform program supports\n            efforts by the Government in the following areas: (i)\n            functioning of agricultural markets with a focus on the\n            establishment of additional auction floors for agricultural\n            products, and having in place a better targeted and more\n            private sector inclusive system of providing fertilizers and\n            seeds to farmers; (ii) improving the business environment\n            through the establishment of a commercial court; (iii)\n            economic governance with a focus on reforms that improve\n            payroll management and external financial accountability of\n            the GoM. The operation draws on a new framework for budget\n            support that has been developed under the leadership of the\n            Government of Malawi (GoM) with six participating donors,\n            including IDA. It comprises of a new multi-year Performance\n            Assessment Framework (PAF) and a review process aimed at\n            reducing transaction costs for all parties involved. A\n            revised joint memorandum of understanding is expected to be\n            entered into shortly."}, "docdt": "2007-09-19T00:00:00Z"}
