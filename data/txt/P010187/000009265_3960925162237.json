The project achieved\n            most of its objectives, its impact on institutional\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and both the Bank and Borrower acted satisfactorily. Several\n            lessons can be learned from this project. First, projects to\n            increase bulk water supply to major urban centers can\n            increase the supplier's revenue generating capacity and\n            improve service levels to consumers by including secondary\n            distribution network components. Second, provision of a\n            continuous supply of water at workable pressures must\n            precede any phased program of domestic metering. Third,\n            institutional development is possible, even in unpromising\n            conditions, with sustained technical assistance and training\n            inputs over an extended period. Fourth, further dialogue\n            between the Association and the Borrower is necessary to\n            minimize delays in approvals from the government. Lastly,\n            achieving full financial viability may have to be approached\n            gradually at first when working with a new agency and\n            consolidating formerly dispersed functions for the first\n            time in a large and rapidly growing city."}, "docdt": "1993-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
