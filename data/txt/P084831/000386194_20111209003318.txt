 1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

  1.1 Context at Appraisal
. Country and Sector Background: At appraisal, the country's energy intensity of 0.38 tons of oil
  equivalent per thousand U.S. dollars of GDP (at the Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate), was
  more than twice the average value for the European Union and exceeded by a considerable margin the
  energy intensity of the transition economies in Europe. ·Bulgaria's potential to achieve significant
  energy savings in a cost-effective manner was estimated as high as 50% of total annual energy
  demand for existing building stock, 40% for district heating and 30% for industry. Although the most
  promising low-cost energy saving projects-i.e. payback time of less than three years, had been
  included in the Government of Bulgaria's (GoB) medium-term National Energy Saving Action Plan
  (2001-2003), very few of them had been carried out. During 2001-2003, commercially financed
  energy efficiency (EE) investments amounted to US$13 million, a mere 5% of the annual
  requirements for EE investments included in the National Energy Saving Program to 2010.

Barriers to energy efficiency: In 2004 potential investors faced serious barriers to the uptake of
commercial EE (mance jn Bulgaria: (i) commercial bank intermediation relative to the size of the
economy was low by international standards. Insufficient competition allowed banks to manage risks
by limiting lending volume, demanding high collateralization (200% and higher), charging high
interest rates to local businesses (between 10% and 18%, despite inflation being contained at 4%),
focusing on short-term lending (with loan maturities of 1-2 years) and investing in low-risk
government securities; (ii) the inefficiency of the judicial system made recovery of debt or seizure of
collateral a long process. The perceived high credit risk hurt especially the SMEs, housing
cooperatives, municipalities, hospitals and other similar energy consumers, which may not have had a
significant credit history or lacked suitable collateral values associated with EE projects. Approval of
credit applications took months; (iii) commercial banks were generally not familiar with commercial
and.technical issues involved in EE projects. The combination of financial and technical skills needed
for the preparation of sound EE business plans to develop bankable EE projects was largely missing.
The size of EE projects wasgeneraUy small relative to energy supply projects with which they often
had to compete for financing. Commercial banks perceived the risks and transaction costs of EE
projects as too high; and (iv) innovative financing, such as energy performance contracting, was
hardly used. Third-party bundling into a financially viable package of projects that are individually
too small to justify an energy performance contracting arrangement can be effective in attracting
capital for projects deemed too small for financial institutions. There was also no mature and
competitive energy service industry, with most of the private energy service companies (ESCOs)
having small operations and balance sheets .

.Rationale for Bank assistance: The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Bulgaria in effect at
 appraisal was designed to support Bulgaria with reforms that assisted the country in meeting its
 European Union (ED) accession requirements concerning BE and environmental protection. The
 energy sector was considered to be lagging behind in meeting the BE and environmental requirements
 ofthe EU.

GEF financing was attractive due to the emission reduction potential offered by EE-initiatives in
Bulgaria. The country's significant energy inefficiency and strong financing barriers to EE, along
with the Government's credible commitment to address them, provided a compelling case for a GEF-
supported contingent finance operation in Bulgaria that aimed to build a sustained market-based
capacity to develop and finance EE projects on commercial terms under the proposed Bulgaria
Energy Efficiency Fund (BEEF). The Energy Efficiency Act, adopted in 2004, aimed to foster broad-



                                                   1
based, sustainable commercial financing for EE projects. The BEEF, a commercially oriented
revolving EE Fund, was established in accordance with Chapter 4 of the Act to demonstrate the
financial profitability of investment~ in the EE sector. GEF support toward the initial capitalization
was considered critical for the establishment of BEEF; without this support, the BEEF. project would
not have proceeded in a rea~onable time frame. The Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism
(MEET) was the primary implementing agency of BEEF and the recipient of the GEF grant.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators
The objective of the project was to increase the demand for and supply of EE projects and
services in Bulgaria. The project would support a large increase in EE investments in Bulgaria
through development of a self-sustaining, market-based fmancing mechanism, which can provide
sustainable and increasing reductions in GHG emissions without relying on public subsidy.

This market-based financing mechanism, the BEEF, was designed to mitigate the perceived high risk
and transaction costs of initial EE investments by directly supporting the implementation of a
growing number of EE projects on fully commercial terms, demonstrating means to overcome current
barriers and make profits on such projects. At least half of the benefits of BEEF-supported projects
had to come from measurable energy savings. The BEEF was also designed to foster, through
demonstration and explicit partnership, expanded investments by other market participants, such as
commercial banks, ESCOs and leasing companies.

The key indicators were:

GEO (Outcome-level) indicators

    1. Emergence of a competitive, self-sustainable national EE market demonstrated by:
       • Number of financial institutions engaged in EE project financing, with a target increase
         from 2 to 10;
       • Number of ESCOs engaged in EE project development and implementation, with a target
         increase from 18 to 40;
       • Number of EE projects and associated investment volume with commercial banks
         participating in fmancing with BEEF,. with a target of $48 million· in cumulative BEEF
         leveraged EE investments composed of $31 million from guarantees and $17 million
         from loans;
       • Energy savings (over lifeofEE investments) of 1.03 mtoe; and
       • CUmulative BEEF-supported project life CO2 emission reductions of3.6m tons CO2 •

   2. Financial sustainability of BEEF defined as self-financing percentage: 100% by 2010.

Intermediate (Output-level/results) indicators:
    3. Proactive development of a critical mass of commercial EE projects and financing of
       US$50m from 2005 to 2009.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
On the user side, the beneficiaries of EE investments are (i) SMEs, mostly in the industrial and
service sectors, (ii) muniCipalities, and (iii) housing cooperatives/associations as potential subproject
clients (project sponsors).
                      •                                            ,   •                                y




On the supply side' beneficiaries are (i) equipment/materials manufacturers, building design and.
retrofit contractors, ESCOs and EE consultancies as busmess partne,rs; and (ii) companies in the
fmancial sectQr,particularly banks, mortgage and leasing c0t:Ilpan~es as co.,financiers.

1.S OriginalCom.ponents
GEF financing of USSlO million was to be used to (i) provide seed capital for BEEF; (ii) defray
initial set.;up and operating costs until BEEF reached financial sel(.,sufficiency; and (iii) partially
defray initial ~Qsts of EE capacity' building (projectdeveloPIllent, financial packaging, etc.). The
project had three components:                                                           .

    •   PartialCredit Guarantees (pCG) to share in the credit risk of EE finance transactions and to
        improve loan terms forsub,.project .sponsors. A Guarantee Account (GA) was to be
        established in a competitively selected commercial bank. The GA -was to earn income
        through interest from the reserve account balance along with guarantee fees to cover potential
        guarantee loss claims. -The indicative GEFamount for the GA was USS4..50 million,
        expected to trigger a total of USS3 L 12 million. Individual guarantee commitments were not
        to exceed the equivalentofUS$500,OOO(the guarantee liability limit).

    •   Investment (Sub.,Loan) Financing Facility to co.,finance baI$lbLe EEprojects oq a
        commercial lending basis. The indicative GEF amount for the Loan Account was USS4.00
        million that was expected to trigger investments of {jS$16.34 million.

    •   Technical Assistance (TA): to initially finance on a grant basis a portion of EE project
        development, capacity building, information barrier removal and administration costs of the
        Fund .. USSIS Imllioti in GEF funds was allocated for this purpose; ,
The initial allocation of GEF funds for loan financing and guarantees, respectively, was indicative
since BEEF was designed asa fle,uble facility. Marketdemand for BEEF's two financing-instruments

1.6 Revised Components
The components were not revised.

1.7 Ot"er lIignifica,ntehanges .
There were no changes in the proj~ct's design, scope and scale, anp impleIDentation arrangements. In
November 2008, due to a lack of demand for guarantees, US$2 million was transferred from the
Guarantee AccQunt to the Loan Account-Since the distribution of funds shown in the PAD between
the two instruments was indicative, this did not represent a revision, but an adjustment. to market
demand in accordance with the philosophy and modality of the project. Also, from the TA.,finance
window USS342,112 was transferred to the Loan Account prior to the project's closure (March
2010).

 2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
 Building on lessons lellrned. At the time of appraisal, the project design represented what was
 considered "best practice" for EE-programs in Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, the project's
 quality at entry .was rated highly satisfactory by the World Bank's Quality Assurance Group which
 stated that the project's preparation process can be considered a good example of what needs to be
 done early in the project design to ensure successful implementation. The design of the project was
 inspired by GEF's Romania EE Project and by the IFC/GEF-supported HungaryEE Co-Financing
 Program (HEECP) and also incorporated lessons from the USAID-financed Municipal EE Program in
 Bulgaria~ The latter project provided partial credit guarantees (pCG) in favor of the United Bulgarian
 Bank (UBB) for small.,.scale municipal EE projects. However, the USAID-t'inanced project had
 suffered from two shortcomings: the non-revolving nature .of the PCG facility and the monopolistic
 position ofUBB, which kept the interest rate and collateral requirements at relatively high levels.

 Collecdon 0/ baseline dllta. A GEFproject preparation grant (PDF-B) was used to develop a

 improvement in street lighting, installation of heat exchangers, and automatic temperature control.

 Advllnce idendflClldon 0/11 pipeline 0/ projects to invest in. The PDF-B identified a pipeline of
 viable EE projects for funding prior to the approval of the. project. This allowed BEEF to finance
 projects immediately after Project effectiveness and to obtain early, quantifiable results.

 The consultlldon pr(JCtlflS was comprehensive. In June 2002, the project concept was presented to the
 NGO community at a workshop .. During the EE market assessment, top management and energy
 managers of companies in the industrial, serviceand.municipal sectors as well ESCOs were engaged,
 supporting both information dissemination and init,ial project pipeline development.

The most important factor for risk mitigation, which was included in the design of the project was
flexibility with regard to the use of BEEF financing instruments. BEEF could provide loans directly
to project developers (commercial finance objective: to demonstrate to banks the commercial viability
of investments in EE), or as co-tinancmg to commercial bank loans (commercial finance objective: to
draw banks into finance who without the assurance provided through the; quality control of BEEF's
technicalexpernse would have found iqoo J;'isky to engage in EE-finance, particularly of ESCO-
finance) .. BEEF could also provide. guarantees· as project PCGs or as portfolio guarantees. Finally,
the BEEF provided flexibility in terms ofu~ingavailable funds.for either guarantees or for loans.

1.1lmpiementatiQD
The project was not iestructured(except a technical restructuring to reallocate guarantee funds to the
loan facility) and was never at risk. The Mid·Term Review carried out in November 2007 favorably
assessed project implementation, as well as the initiatives and instruments that had been launched.

The following factors affected project implelJlentation:

Changes in operating context
The context for BEEF's operation changed dramatically as soon as the project started.

    • . An initiative of the Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Agency, to accredit energy auditing
     . companies, resulted in an increase in the number of ESCO companies.

    •   The purchase by foreign banks of majority shares in the major Bulgarian commercial banks
        resulted in the latter getting access to "unlimited credit" from their foreign partner banks.

    •   Parallel donor initiatives inEE finance: TheEBRD launched three EE-finance lines, two
        providing a combination of credit lines and investment subsidies to participating banks and
        their EE-loan take~, and a third providing credit to an ESCO-fmance company.

All three developments promoted the achievement ofthe ultimate goal of establishing sustainable EE-
operations in Bulgaria, and added more competition to the EE market-place.

The accreditation of energy auditors strengthened the credibility of EE-investment projects,. and
reduced the risk of non-performing projects. This reduced the attractiveness for banks to collaborate
with BEEF inco-fmancing EE-investments in order to benefit from the technical expertise of BEEF
inEE.                                  .

Shortly aiterproject inception several Bulgarian.banks were taken over py foreign banks, which had
two impacts   on  BEEF's operation.. First, liquidity shortages that may have existed at the time of
project design and appraisal disappeared, reducing the need for BEEF loan finance. Second, fierce
competition for market shares drove down interest rates and margins to such low levels that banks
saw no room for adjusting a guarantee fee within the margins.. In addition, as the. EE market
developed, .banks became familiar with the commercial and technical issues in· EE fmancing, thus
lowering the perceived risks in connection with weak client/project credit profiles. As a result, BEEF
had to reduce its guarantee fee to a very low 0.1 % in order to secure clients for its guarantee products.

EBRD's Bulgaria Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Credit Line (BEERECL) for on-lending
to private sector companies for industrial energy efficiency and small scale renewable energy projects
was launched in 2004. United Bulgarian Bank (UBB), later UniCredit Bulbank,and. Allianz Bank
Bulgaria participated in the credit line. EBRD provided credit finance of [55 million. A CBS million

grant from the Kozloduy International Decommissioning ~dSupport Fund (KIDSF) provided free
consulting'sex:vices to borrowers and gave them a cOmpletion subsidy up to 15% of the' BEERECL
loan' amount for energy efficiency or 20% for renewable energy.  '

In 2005, EBRD launched the Bulgaria Residential Energy Efficiency Credit line (BREECL) to
finance small-scale· residential' energy efficiency piojects~ replacing windows; insulating outdoor
walls and roofs; and installing heat pUmps, solar thermal collectors and high-efficiency gas and
biomass boilers. EBRD provided a [50 million loan, and KIDSFadded a grant finance facilityof
G4.6 million. Both lenders increased their financial contributions in 2008. The Grant facility
provides a completion fee to sub-borrowers, which is deducted from the loan' principal,and
completion fees paid to participating banks. Since BEEF does nofofferUlVestment grants, investors
preferred to seek loans from· banks that participated in this scheme: BEEF"signed ·two general
framework agreements in 2006 (UBB AD and Bulbank AD) and three in '2007 (EnCouragement Bank,
HVB Bank Biochim and International Asset Bank). In 2010, 2 new framework agreements were
signed in 2010 with Bank DSK and with Tokuda Bank. Of all.framework agreements signed, only
three became clients / collaborating partners of BEEF.

It was a great disappointment for BEEF management that it lacked Government support to get grant
financing from KIDSF to put it on equal footing with the EBRD supported mechanisms.

In 2008, EBRD provided a senior loan of Olmillion to the Energy and Energy Savings Fund SPV
(EESF), a special purpose investment company, set up in 2006 to finance the ESCO services business
of the construction and engineering group Enemona, its major shareholder; EESF uses:theproceeds of
the loan to purchase receivables from energy performance contracts carried out by Enemona in the
industrial and public sectors including kindergartens, schools, hospitals and other municipal
buildings. This development cost BEEF business since Enemona'was one·of itsiprivate.minority
shareholders and a major client.· However, Enemonacontinued to be a client.of,BEEF, but at reduced
scale; through ESCO-projects portfolio guarantees issued toEESF..

Thus, BEEF faced donor-supported competition in four business .areas: residential buildings,
industrial EE, public buildings, and ESCOs.

Negtltive ftletol'S for EE;.investment climate in BiilgtlrUr
The EE-investment climate was affected negatively by the following factors:

    •   Rapid acceleration of EE investment costs (labor & insulation materials) lengthened
        significantly paybacks of energy retrofit projects, requiring more client co-financing and
        decreasing client willingness to' undertake' projects, ·orreduced project size.' By 2008 the .
        construction cost index in Bulgaria bad almost doubled compared to 2004, when the project
        was appraised.

    •   Lack of a legal frameWork to' create 'a market for''EE investments in multi-apartment
        buildingi There was a significant delay' in the adoption by Parliament of an Act stipulating
        the creation of Condominium Associations inmultt;'apartment buildings. This Act provides
        the legal provisions allowing for the creation of legal entities that can contract with energy
        supply companies and other service providers. When it was finally adopted in 2010, the Act
        left it to the condominium owners to decide whether or not they wanted to establish an
        Association. As a result, only a few Associations have been created so far. In addition, the
        poor financial situation of many families living in multi-apartment buildings is preventing.




                                                    7
        these families from taking any kind of loans; a situation that could have been mitigated by an
        EE subsidy scheme for low-income households but such a scheme has never been introduced.

Positive factors during project implementation:
That BEEF could survive as a viable financial mechanism in these adverse circumstances is a tribute
to the built-in flexibility of the initial project design and to the quality of BEEF's contracted Fund
Manager (FM) who managed to adjust BEEF's interventions to the market conditions, whilst testing
the market's acceptance of various new finance. products along the way. Close Bank supervision also
played an important role in helping identify and tackle key strategic issues and ensured ownership and
coordination with Government counterparts, especially during the early implementation of the
project. In addition, the increase in energy prices from 2004 to 2008 reduced the payback periods on
EE investments and ensured that public interest in EE savings was strengthened. Positive factors
supporting project implementation include:

Efficient Governance:
    • The inclusion of a person on BEEF's Board with a strong background in finance helped to
        introduce and apply professional risk evaluation methods (to be used in determining interest
        rates according to project risks) and risk management measures.
    • The fund raising campaigns, launched in 2005 and 2007, managed to secure BGN 400,000
        (US$270,000) from private donors such as a private Bank, an energy company (Lukoil), and
        Enemona JSC, which is one of the largest ESCOs in Bulgaria and joined the donors assembly
        of BEEF.

Correct and early identification of changing market conditions and risks:
   • Already in late 2006 the PM drew the correct conclusion that insufficient demand existed for
        the US$4.5 million fund allocation for peGs and that leaving about US$1-1.5 million in the
        Guarantee account would be enough to maintain its peG business. BEEF managed in the
        following years to sell a limited number of project PCGs and a greater number of portfolio
        guarantees. Yet, it had to lower its PCG-fees to the non-commercial rate of 0.1 % to find
        takers, and even then, it would only succeed after some hard selling efforts. In some cases
        project developers backed off from guarantee deals after the requests had been processed and
        instead received loans from banks that would accept their project without a guarantee.
        Overall, the market indicated that banks rarely require PCGs for small projects; the BGN
        800,000 limit thus made PCGs unattractive for commercial banks.
   • Already in 2007 the FM also correctly identified the obstacles in concluding deals with
        commercial banks for co-flnancing. Banks are not interested in BEEF co-financing of small
        projects as the transaction costs become too high relative to the loan amount. The co-
        fmancing of large projects, on the other hand, is beyond the scope of BEEF.

Flexible adjustment of means and instruments to reality:
    .. PM offered credit products with attractive financing conditions for the initial BEEF projects
        in order to develop a sustainable project pipeline in the early years of the Fund. As an initial
        approach, this was the most efficient way to provide an attractive set of services.
    • BEEF found a niche market: financing EE projects for public buildings owned either by local
        authorities (administration buildings, schools, etc.) hospitals or universities, and street
        lightning. To reduce the administrative burden on municipalities when fmancing EE projects,
        the FM asked the Ministry of Economy to initiate changes in the Energy Efficiency Act.
        Adopted in June 2007, the revised Energy Efficiency Act stipulates that local authorities are
        not obliged to carry out procurement procedures when seeking financing for EE projects; they
        can directly negotiate with BEEF.



                                                  8
    • . Despite EBRD's ESCO loan, BEEF maintained Enemona as a customer by providing loans
        for the implementation of ESCO projects and portfolio guarantees to a pool of 29 ESCO
        contracts that were loan-financed by a commercial bank with which BEEF had a
        collaboration agreement.

Development and introduction of innovative finance products:
   • Through its information campaign and media initiatives, BEEF promoted ESCO contracting
       as a means of effectively implementing and managing EE investments. Three ESCOs entered
       the market with BEEF's technical assistance and financing. BEEF's ESCO portfolio
       guarantee scheme provides an ESCO with a guarantee against defaults and a liquidity
       guarantee to cover disruptions in the flow of receivables: BEEF guarantees that it will cover
       up to 5% of defaults and delayed payments under the portfolio. In theory, this provides a
       20: 1 leveraging ratio.
   • In 2006 BEEF introduced two other innovative guarantee schemes, which have not yet
       generated any interest among investors: (i) a Residential Portfolio Guarantee scheme covers
       the first 5% of defaults on individual end-user loans used to finance a joint EE project for a
       building block (or portfolio of blocks) and (ii) a standardized financing product with the
       International Asset Bank for EE, "Energy Asset" under which a PCG from BEEF covers up to
       80%-ofthe principal of a credit (maximum BGN 800,000).

Close and effective supervision from the Bank:
    • The Bank has been proactive in identifYing key issues that needed to be tackled during
        implementation. The early identification of these obstacles helped to orient BEEF's strategic
        choices and allowed for their successful resolution in a timely manner. For instance, the
        Bank's intervention helped to quickly resolve the poor communication between the first
        Executive Director (ED) of BEEF and the Management Board (MB), thus enhancing
        prospects for project success. Overall, the Bank's oversight and intervention during project
        implementation was appropriate, well-coordinated, and satisfactory to aU stakeholders.
   • The Bank also played a catalytic role in ensuring that the Government's strong ownership
        translated into tangible actions. The establishment of BEEF as an integral part of the national
        /policy framework for Energy Efficiency and the Government's early fmancial contribution
        through the budget to cover the initial set up costs for BEEF were a clear measure of the
        effective working relationships and strong GoB ownership.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. Step-by-step monitoring, verification and evaluation were critical in this project, and
were to be conducted by BEEF. The format, contents and frequency of implementation progress
reports were agreed upon and were included in the Project Implementation Plan (pIP), They formed
an integral part of the project financial and management reports (FMR). Detailed, quantified output
and outcome indicators were defined in the PAD against which project progress could be monitored.
Since market transformation was the end goal of the project, with the individual BEEF-finance.d
projects being instruments towards this, the outcome indicators included outcomes: number of FIs
involved in EE-finance; number of ESCOs operating on the market; that only to a limited extent
could be attributed to the specific efforts of BEEF. The others-EE investments leveraged by BEEF.
energy savings, C02-emission reductions, self-financing ratio of BEEF-were concrete and could be
used to measure BEEF performance.

M &E implementation. BEEF regularly collected data according to both the technical and financial
indicators of supported projects, reported in a detailed manner on individual project costs, EE-
measures, energy savings by fuel and estimated C02-emission reductions. These data were closely



                                                  9
monitored and the actual figures were compared with the target values. The Bank also conducted bi-
annual project monitoring missions.

M&E utilization. The data collected were evaluated and used to inform decision-making. For
example, the verification of the financial savings achieved from a typical package of EE investments
enabled the loan taker to cover the amortization payments of the loan. This data was then used to
determine the loan tenor to be offered on a standard basis by BEEF. While individual measures
within an investment package could have pay-back periods longer than the tenor of the loan,the pay-
back period for the package as a whole could not be longer than the loan tenor. Evaluation also led to
the reallocation of funds from the guarantee account to the loan account.
The formula for calculating the self-financing ratio of BEEF - current revenue divided by current
operating costs - is somewhat misleading because it does not take into account the impact of inflation
on the real value of the equity capital base of BEEF. A more correct formula to apply if the purpose is
to measure the sustainability of BEEF as an operating entity, is to make an annual inflation
adjustment to the capital base to keep it constant in real value, and to add the cost of that inflation
adjustment to the operating costs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial management. The financial arrangements for the project were:
    e    BEEF financed only up to 75% of the cost of an investment project; the remaining cost had to
         be provided by the project sponsor. By June 20 I 0, BEEF had awarded 81 loans, with another
         four to five loans in the process of final approval. Monthly repayments under the sub-loan
         agreements began in 2006. A number of payment delays, but no defaults, have been recorded
         so far.
    e   BEEF has entered into 31 guarantee deals, amounting to BON 3.04 million. BEEF has a
        maximum limit of BON 800,000 for its first loss portfolio guarantee product, which covers
        the first 5% of losses on a loan portfolio. Very few payment requests were triggered from
        guaranteed projects, and most of these led to later payments by borrowers to BEEF. Thus
        they concerned a delay in payments, not loan defaults.

The OEF grant financial management covenants have been consistently complied with by BEEF. All
annual audit reports have been submitted on time, with clean audit opinions and have been acceptable
to the Bank. The final audit report covering the first half of 2010 (the project closed on March 31,
2010 and the disbursement grace period expired at the end of June 2010) was submitted on time, with
a clean opinion and has been accepted by the Bank. All semi-annual un-audited Interim Financial
Reports (IFRs), including those for the first half of 2010, have been submitted on time by BEEF,
reviewed and accepted by the Bank.

Procurement. There were no serious procurement issues during implementation. The ISRs
throughout the project implementation gave a rating of satisfactory.

Environmental safeguards. The EA category for this project was FI (Financial Intermediary).
Compliance with the Bank's EA requirements was greatly facilitated by the capacity already built in-
country to comply with the EU Directives. Nonetheless, the Bank required an Operations Manual
(OM) for BEEF to meet the Bank's standard requirements for FI projects, including a detailed
Environmental Chapter defining the process of compliance with the Bank's standards. The OM also
ensured adherence to all local ordinances in the design and construction of client projects. The strong
technical know-how of BEEF staff and the excellent reporting systems of BEEF ensured compliance;
the staff team included an environmental specialist. There were no significant deviations or waivers


                                                 10
from the Bank's safeguards. Compliance with the Environmental Assessment policy was considered
satisfactory throughout implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The World Bank consistently advocated for a significant increase in the funds for BEEF in order to
allow it to continue and scale up its level of operations-and BEEF's business plan for 2010~onwards
identifies a rangle of options for this. The FM's fund identification efforts have so far led to the
negotiation of []:1.0 million in financial support from the Government and EBRD, with negotiations
expected to be finalized by the end of 2010. The support program would include a LlS million
contribution by the Government from KIDSF to provide start-up and capacity building support to
participating local authorities; and a [20 million loan from EBRD to BEEF to finance among others,
municipal entities providing energy saving services to their cities; or finance to ESCQs by providing
long term funds based on the receivables due under Energy Performance Contracts (EPC). The
proposed financing program has two important implications for BEEF's sustainability:

    •   It will expand its scale of operations, which has obvious consequences for its medium- term
        institutional and financial sustainability.

    •   The "purchasing of receivables" function will correspond well to BEEF's position as a single
        fund without retail outlets. To be efficient, retail lending requires retail outlets,

In addition to supporting this new market segment, BEEF will also continue its traditional lending
activities. These activities would be funded by current loan repayments, thus demonstrating BEEF's
relevance in the EE market and the achievement of its self-financing target.

The MoEE envisages changes in the governance structure for BEEF that will further enhance its 100g-
term sustainability. It intends to move away from the contracted FM-concept and instead employ
staff under BEEF, where the Director as well as staff are paid a base salary plus a performance-based
bonus.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project objectives were clear, relevant, and important to Bulgaria's economic development. They
were appropriate to the needs of the country's energy sector. GHG em.ission reduction through energy
efficiency remains a very relevant objective for Bulgaria, which still in 2010 has a large untapped
energy savings potential. The project was, and remains, consistent with the Bank's assistance strategy
for Bulgaria.

BEEF's role and functions in promoting increased commercial bank finance for investments in EE
varied during implementation from those originally foreseen when the projectwas designed:
    • The co-flnancing function became irrelevant in a large and relatively mature EE market,
        which developed faster than initially foreseen. The size of EE loans is too sma!! to anow
        banks to pursue consortium financing as a means to spread risk. Good EE             expertise is
        available on the open market for services, and some EERD projects even provide it free
        charge to clients; this reduces the attractiveness of having a finance partner like BEEF who
        has the technical EE expertise that commercial banks lack.
    • There does not seem to be a substantial market demand for the PeG-provider function either.
        The public sector clients making up the bulk of ESCO customers proved                 be low
        risk. Individual homeowners investing in EE provide strong collateral                        of


                                                  11
        their horne. The financial sector dedicated to EE projects in Bulgaria is relatively unaffected
        by the present world financial crisis; thus there is no need for PCGs to un-clog frozen finance
        arteries.

What remains are three useful functions:
  • Finance provider of last resort to credit-worthy developers. offering a commercially viable
        project which banks are unwilling or too slow to finance. Some borrowers of EE loans from
       BEEF had been frustrated in their attempts to get a loan from commercial banks for an
       investment. As the repayment record on BEEF's loan portfolio shows, these were
       creditworthy borrowers. Thus, BEEF has a direct finance role to play in some market niches
       such as public buildings. In addition, the fact that BEEF can get borrowers to accept loans
       for EE that are not accompanied by investment subsidies demonstrates to the Government
       that grants may be used more effectively for other purposes.
  • Financing ESCOs by purchasing receivables from performance contracts. BEEF has the
       perfect combination of technical and finance expertise for this task.
  • EE-finance advocacy junction. ESCOs successfully market their services to public and
       private clients. It is reasonable to assume that the active involvement of an honest broker like
       BEEF in energy finance seminars reinforces the trustworthiness of ESCO marketing
       campaigns. Government policy makers can draw on BEEF's unique and unbiased expertise
       in knowing the issues involved in EE finance inside out.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
At the end of the project in June 2010:
    • BEEF had awarded 81 loans. The total loan volume by BEEF was US$16 million and the
        totalleveragt;d investment by BEEF's loans was US$24 million. BEEF has calculated the
        lifetime energy savings at 0.09 Mtoe, and the GHG-savings at 0.9 MtC02e•
    • BEEF had entered 31 guarantee deals covering US$ 2 million. The total leveraged investment
        reached US$16 million. BEEF has calculated the resulting lifetime energy savings at 0.04
        Mtoe, and the GHG-savings at 0.2 MtC02e •

The financial self-sufficiency ratio of BEEF defined as "annual income from project operations in the
form of fees and payments of interest from borrowers I BEEF annual operating costs" was 133% in
2009. The table below shows the project's achievement with regard to the key performance
indicators mentioned in the main text of the PAD.

 The costs involved in EE investments have been reasonable given the market's development, but
 were higher than originally estimated during the design phase.. Compared to the expected "industrial"
 project pipeline, BEEF-supported projects were predominantly in the public buildings sector,
 including thermal refurbishment of schools, kindergartens, hospitals, and universities. Another factor
 affecting the fmancial profitability of EE investments was the significant increase in construction
 costs during the implementation phase. Between 2004 and 2009, the construction cost index in
 Bulgaria rose from 92 to 141,Qr by 53%, thus meaning that energy savings for the invested US
 dollars would be lower. As a result, the average payback time of BEEF's portfolio was between four
 to five years, in comparison to the three years forecasted in the PAD. Also, the economic rate of
 return was 10% lower, but remained at very profitable levels. In addition, the projects yielded
 additional benefits that lower the economic pay-back rate even further: many projects were
 retrofitting projects yielding important additional benefits in terms of user comfort/amenities and
 visual improvements (see beneficiary survey below).

The analysis of BEEF financial performance includes the five years of implementation during which
the GEF funds (US$ 9.65 million) were disbursed. During this period, GEF resources mobilized total
co-financing of US$28 million, bringing the total available financing to US$ 39 million (excluding
the TA component), which yields a leverage ratio of4.0 compared to 4.8 forecasted in the PAD. The
associated abatement cost per ton of C02 works out to as low as USS8.4, assuming the full amount of
the GEF grant asa proxy for the incremental cost.

The Net Asset Value (NAV) model which was used in the PAD as a proxy measure of BEEF
profitability was calculated for the ICR based on the financial characteristics of the Fund's portfolio
during implementation. BEEF increased the value of its assets since income fees and the interest
earned were higher than the cost of the Fund's administration and project defaults (close to zero). The
cost of fund administration ofUSSl.l million amounts to a very reasonable 11% of the total cost of
GEF's contribution of US$ 10 rriillion. The NAV of BEEF increased from USSlO.5 million to USS12
million in 2010. However, the leveraging impact of BEEF funds can be better evaluated over a 15-
year period (the project design life) which includes the reflows from its lending and guarantee
operations. With the repeated revolution of the funds, and assuming BEEF is able to maintain its
current default rate, the project's NAV is expected to reach about USS 19 million (see details in
Annex 3).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
GEO rating: Satisfactory



                                                  14
The GEO rating of Satisfactory is based on the following:
    • The project has been successful in supporting an increase in EE investments in Bulgaria by
       supporting the development and implementation of financially viable EE projects, which
       provide sustainable reductions of GHG emissions without relying on public subsidy. BEEF
       has achieved a market transformation through the demonstration of commercial viability of
       EE investments on a large scale.
    • The project contributed to financing a total of 112 projects, with a total investment ofUS$ 39
       million, or 80% of the initial target. The success in leveraging these investments results from
       BEEF's capability of making appropriate financial products available to the market, such as
       credit lines, that effectively addressed credit risk barriers in the most difficult market
       segments for EE investments in Bulgaria. As noted above, BEEF became a finance provider
       of last resort for credit-worthy developers-such as local municipal governments and other
       public institutions-for which commercial banks were unwilling or too slow to finance.
       Without the intervention of the project, it is likely that little progress would have been made
       in EE financing for public sector developers. In fact, in a consumer satisfaction survey, 43%
       of respondents indicated that BEEF helped them in taking the final investment decision to
       implement the EE project. Most notably, all BEEF investments were financed in commercial
       terms, whereas most of the other 'commercial' EE investments in Bulgaria relied on some
       kind of public subsidy. BEEF's investments resulted in sustainable reductions of energy
       consumption. That BEEF-supported EE investments led to lower energy savings than
       expected in the PAD (by 87%) is not an indication of serious project under-performance.
       Rather, it is evidence of the well-known difficulty of predicting dramatic changes in market
       conditions. The fact that the costs of EE materials and services beyond the rate of inflation
       was one causal factor for under-performance, that BEEF focused on less profitable market
       segments, another. Boosted by EU accession the labor and material costs in construction
       increased by 56% between 2004 and 2009, meaning that energy savings for the US dollar
       invested would be lower compared to the PAD forecast. In addition, lower hanging fruits of
       EE investments in industry went to commercial bank finance as industries asked their regular
       bank partners for finance; others went to banks collaborating with EBRD who could offer
       investment grants. This led BEEF to provide EE financIng for the public sector, where
       projects usually are less profitable with higher payback times. Yet, increasing the EE of
      public buildings is a necessary task if global climate targets are to be achieved. That one
      donor takes care of the' lower hanging fruits and another donor of the higher, does not make
      the contribution of the latter less important for global environmental objectives. One can
      argue that donor-supported projects should focus on developing the more difficult markets,
      since the easier ones are likely to be developed by the market in any case. Finally, the weak
      demand for·PCG also translated into a lower leverage of BEEF's resources.
   • The realized GHG emissions savings reached 30% of the target. Despite lower energy
      savings, GHG emission reductions are proportionally higher than initially forecasted in the
      PAD. The realized share of electrioity in saved energy consumption was higher than
      estimated in the year 2004 model calculations. For the calculation of energy savings, the
      final energy content is used; whereas the calculated C02-emission reduction is based on the
      gross energy content. Therefore, the target achievement for C02-reduction is better than for
      energy savings.
   • The successful increase in the number of ESCOs from 14 to 39 (95% of the target) and of
      banks extending loans to EE projects from two to 13 (130% of the target) can only to a
      limited extent be ascribed to BEEF. Other factors played an important role, including (i) the
      take-over of Bulgarian banks by foreign banks eager to expand operations in Bulgaria, (ii) the




                                                 15
         increase in international fuel prices and domestic energy prices; and (iii) the availability of
         grant-supported EBRD loan finance.
     •   Unlike similar EE funds elsewhere in the region BEEF has been successful as a· financing
         mechanism and has achieved its self-flnanclng target despite a dramatic change in market
         conditions. BEEF would be able to continue its operations-although at lower activity levels,
         thus demonstrating the project's sustainability. In addition, EBRD's interest in making use of
         BEEF as a vehicle to provide finance to ESCOs is proof of the project's initial good
         performance and relevance to further expand investments in the EE market in Bulgaria.
     •   Some fmance instruments developed by BEEF have remained unexploited due to lack of
         Government regulations and social support schemes (e.g., the residential housing guarantee
         scheme). Once the Government introduces reforms, the instruments can yield GEO-benefits
         whether offered by BEEF or by another institution.

The last Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) from March 2010 rated the project as
Moderately Satisfactory on its GEO indicators. Since then the following changed circumstances have
informed the decision on an upgrading to Satisfactory: (i) MEET has adopted the proposed Plan for
Sustainable Future Operation of BEEF, (ii) the FM has been given a legal basis to continue operating
the fund for as long as it tflkes for the BEEF Board to implement a new FM structure, (iii) the EBRD
has started preparing for an active involvement in BEEF, including the provision of equity andlor
debt thus addressing the recapitalization issue, (iv) there is very advanced negotiations with KIDSF
on a grant support to complement ,the aforementioned EBRD financial contribution-a total of
EUR30 million is being discussed, and (v) detailed analysis of the project's outcome indicators has
shown that lifetime C02 emission reductions will be at a level of 1.1 mtC02 equivalent, which is
roughly three times higher than what was assumed in March. As a result, the concerns about the
sustainability of the project raised in the latest ISR have beenJargely dispelled.

The project has therefore largely achieved its GEO as expressed through the two main outcome
indicators included in the Results Framework, i.e. (1) emergence of a competitive and sustainable
national EE market in Bulgaria and (2) financial sustainability of BEEF's operation. In this context
the lower than expected GHG reduction from the project supported investments is less significant
since it does not threaten the sustainability of future EE investments given that the effectiveness of
BEEF's investments is satisfactory with an incremental abatement cost of less tl}an US$9 per ton
C02.                                             .

3.5 OverarcJiing Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The energy cost reductions have a direct impact on the affordability of energy services for end-users.
According to .the survey, BEEF clients reported significant decreases in their energy pills and were
able to direct scarce financial resources to other pressing needs. The support to the retrofitting of
schools, kindergardens, and hospitaLs also provided social benefits on top of the energy-cost reduction
benefits. These social benefits include improved working conditions such as comfortable indoor
temperatures during the winter season. In addition, the demonstration effect of EE projects has
resulted in increased awareness about EE measures by final beneficiaries, including an increased
social acceptance of what was referred to as a 'green behavior' in the beneficiary survey carried out
for the purpose of this Completion Report. For instance, about 74% of people interviewed indicated
that their behavior had changed and that they are actively pursuing EE measures in their personal
lives.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
EE market participants have benefited from the project's demonstration                   of the main
institutional strengthening results came from the creation ESCOs                               by the
TA funds from BEEF, thus contributing to the development of an .-1-h",,,,·,,+              which due
to strong competition between the firms is an efficient service provider. BEEF has also contributed to
build and disseminate know-how on EE investments in Bulgaria.                                   active
participation in seminars, and other events, BEEF has increased awareness

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary S~rvey
A final beneficiary satisfaction survey was commissioned
assess the impact of EE projects financed by BEEF in terms of
through improvement in indoor air quality, indoor temperature and lighting,
indoor comfort; (ii) increased awareness of EE; and (iii) increased affordability

The findings of the survey indicate a high level of consumer                                   BEEF's
performance during project preparation and implementation, as well as
project. As a result, the beneficiaries stated that it is very likely that they
a partner to their colleagues (95.2%) and that if they were to finance another EE project, they would
work with BEEF again (95.2%). Moreover, for most of the Fund's partners, close contact with
competent and knowledgeable staff was a crucial factor in        me     process             investment
decision.

 4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low or Negligible

The energy savings from the rather straightforward refurbishment measures and boiler improvements
are certain to continue during their economic and technical lifetime. The continuation of BEEF's
involvement in EE-finance is also certain, partly due to the revenue generated from repayments on
loans. The Fund's sustainability would be enhanced if its upcoming engagement with EBRD
materializes. Thus, further energy efficiency improvements andGHG emission reductions will be
achieved, making the achievement of the project's development objective all the more certain. More
broadly, BEEF's sustainability is ensured by the Government's support to its continuation as
witnessed by the latest revision of the Energy Savings. Act (200S), which recognizes BEEF as an
important tool to meet its GHG commitments. More recently the Government has demonstrated its
commitment to the continuation of the Fund's activities by ensuring that the staff at BEEF will
continue to work under a new FM-contract.

The risks to sustaining the operation of BEEF are related with its upcoming engagement with EBRD.
Without this engagement, BEEF would need to scale down significantly its annual lending, from
about US$4 million to about US$2.3 million.

5. Assessment of Bank and Recipient Performance

S.l Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfacory

The ICR team rates the Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the
project as highly satisfactory. The Bank took into account the adequacy of project design and all
major relevant aspects, such as technical, environmental, financial, economic, and institutional,
including procurement and financial management. A number of alternatives were considered for the
project design and the· Bank made maximum use of transfer of experience from similar projects in
other Eastern European countries.

The project belongs to the category of highly innovative projects. As in all innovative projects, there
are risks that some innovations fail; that was also the case for BEEF. That the vision of the future
was flawed can be ascribed to the uncertainty of forecasting the future and not to flaws in the logical
thinking leading to the development of the concepts. The PAD adequately underlined the need for
flexibility during implementation with regard to product pricing and with regard to choice of
instruments.


                                                   18
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory.

Positive aspects:
    • The Bank allocated sufficient bu'dget and staff resources, and the project was adequately
         supervised. The task team paid semi-annual visits to the project and prepared Aide-
         Memoires and letters to alert the Ministry about issues found during project execution, in
         particular the need to identify additional sources of funding to strengthen the capital base of
         BEEF.
    • In October 2006 the Seventh Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) rated the
         supervision of the project as highly satisfactory, The panel considered that the team's
         proactive supervision during the early implementation phase was key not only to
         implementation but to achieving the project objectives. Bank intervention allowed a quick
         resolution of the poor communication between the first Executive Director (ED) of BEEF and
        the Management Board (MB). The quick intervention of the Bank was appropriate, well-
        coordinated, and satisfactory to all stakeholders. It resulted in the replacement of the first ED
        with a more proactive ED who enjoyed the respect and trust of the MB. The project's Highly
        Satisfactory rating was repeated during the October 2008 Quality Assessment of the Lending
        Portfolio (QALP) review, in which the panel noted that "the Task Team has been extremely
        proactive, comprises staff knowledgeable about the requirements of the project and
        conversant with the mistakes made in similar projects, and has had strong support from the
        Management" .
   • The Bank provided guidance and oversight in the preparation of the operational manual for
        BEEF, the final version of which was completed in 2007, and in the development of the
        annual as well as the post-project business plan by the FM of BEEF. The Bank's procurement
        and financial management staff worked closely with the FM's staff to explain the rules and
        procedures to be applied during project implementation, with regard to procurement of goods
        and works, and selection of consultants, as well as audit requirements, based on the grant
        agreement. The financial management aspects of BEEF were carefully reviewed, and specific
        recommendations to strengthen the financial management system were made. Shortcomings
        in accounting software were quickly identified and resolved successfully.
   • An environmental specialist conducted a mission to monitor the quality of the procedures for
        environmental compliance in the manual.
   • The Bank continued to assist the FM with the development and introduction of new finance
       products, such as the ESCO portfolio guarantee scheme and the guarantee scheme for multi-
       apartment buildings                               '
   • The Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project
       both in terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation.

Negative aspects:
   • The Bank was somewhat slow in adjusting the project philosophy to the realities of the
       market. Already in 2006 the FM drew attention to the limited demand for guarantees and
       recommended to reduce the amount in the guarantee account to US$I.5-2 million. The Bank
       Aide-Memoire of September 2007 noted that "The Partial Credit Guarantee (pCG) has not
       yet been utilized". Yet, only in November 2008 was agreement reached to transfer US$2
       million from the GA to the LA.

         It    The project would have benefited from updating the Results Framework at the mid-term
               review to better reflect the reduction in estimated savings.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
 Rating: Satisfactory

 Based on the highly satisfactory rating during the preparation phases and the satisfactory rating
 during implementation the overall rating is Satisfactory.

 5.2 Recipient
 (a) Government Performance
 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

 Positive aspects:
     •        The Government demonstrated its strong commitment at the project's outset by (i) including
              the promotion of BE activities as an integral part of the nationallegallpolicy framework; (ii)
              contributing very early, significant budget funds for setting up the BEEF; and (iii) appointing
              to· the MB of BEEF, highly qualified and dedicated officials, who were proactive in
              supporting the objectives of the project and providing guidance on technical aspects of
              finance, but left the management of the fund to an executive director.
     •        Hiring of a well qualified FM team, comprising Bulgarian locals, with strong
              financiallbanking and project development skills, and insistence on having a strong executive
              director (ED), which required changing the first appointment.
     •        Two provisions in the new Energy Efficiency Act, adopted by the Parliament in October
              2008: (i) According to the Act, energy intensive industries and companies are obliged to
              implement energy efficiency investments. In case these companies are unable to meet the set
              energy efficiency targets, they are required to pay a penalty which will flow to BEEF to
              support energy efficiency projects. This may facilitate additional capitalization of BEEF, and
              (ii) Municipalities can enter into direct loan negotiations with BEEF without having to
              conduct a formal financing tender first.
    •         MEET shows interest in the continued operation of BEEF and supports involvement from
              EBRDIKIOSF, which will be critical for a scaling up of operations.

Negative aspects:
    •         Whereas in the beginning, the GoB was proactive and directly involved in providing finance
              to BEEF's start-up capital, its involvement was reduced gradually so that by the end of the
              project then~ was a lack of ownership. The Ministry did not assist BEEF in its efforts to
              increase its capital base, despite all Bank supervision Aide-Memoires recommending that it
              pay attention to the need for additional finance. It did not support BEEF either in the effort to
              get access to grant finance from KIOSF, or to equity finance contributions from energy
              distribution companies with EE-promotion obligations.
    •         The Ministry could have done more to actively assist BEEF in getting involved in the co-
              financing of EE-projects with EU cohesion and structural funds

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The performance of the BEEF-FM was satisfactory. The above sections have drawn attention to the
strong performance of the FM in financial management, in introducing new finance products and in
finding market niches in a market conteKt that turned out to be different from what was expected at



                                                        20
the tiPle of project approval. Also in marketing, BEEF tested more than the conventional "regional
awareness seminar approaches": Since BEEF faced difficulties in penetrating the corporate market, it
hired in October 2006 a professional marketing firm, specialized in industrial entities, to enhance its
market research and outreach efforts. The firm was to approach businesses operating in various
regions of Bulgaria to gauge the level of interest in EE projects and facilitate deals of interested
businesses with BEEF; and be rewarded for each deal with a bonus. As result of the efforts, the
number of corporate projects increased.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Recipient Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Whereas the Ministry's ownership was evident at the project's outset, its active support decreased
over time and it was late in taking action to secure re-capitalization for BEEF. However, the ongoing
EBRDIKIDSF negotiations will likely lead to a significant increase in BEEF's financial resources and
facilitate a scale-up of BEEF activities. This fact and the satisfactory performance of the PM
throughout the implementation period lead to an overall Recipient performance rating of Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Lesson 1: Before introducing a new instrument on the market, carefully determine the basic
assumptions for why and under which circumstances the instrument is intended to work and then
make a careful reality check in the form of a market survey. Often, a new approach tested
successfully in one country has less successful outcomes when introduced in another country. During
implementation check whether a new instrument performs as expected and covers a perceived need.

Lesson 2:    Innovative projects are particularly vulnerable to developments in the external
~nvironment   that are different from what was expected at appraisal. A mid-term review should
carefully analyze whether the original project philosophy still holds. BEEF was foreseen to co-
finance with commercial banks. As such it did not succeed. Yet, it found a niche for itself on the
market providing loans to EE-projects and actively supporting the preparation of EE-projects.
Nevertheless, the question was never asked what kind of instrument BEEF is in 2010 and what its
most useful strategic role is in the present and future Bulgarian context.

Lesson 3: BEEF's loan activities were expected to be provided primarily in the form of co-finance
with. commercial banks. Co-finance for commercial banks is attractive as a risk diversification
instrument only in the case of very large projects, where a bank does not want to become over-
exposed to a client. EE finance projects are relatively small sized projects - BEEF's loans are
typically in the range of US$250,000 to US$500,000. A commercial bank is not interested in
dividing such small loans between two co-financing banks as it would increase its transaction costs
per loan amount.

Lesson 4: Lured by supposedly high leveraging ratios, publicly backed guarantees have become a
popular choice for finance-sector engagement programs. The design of the project was based on the
expectation that commercial banks in many cases would ask for a partial credit guarantee as a
condition to enter into EE finance. However, how PCGs perform is extremely contextual1y
dependent. It is well-known that PCGs can be important for loans to SMEs, to high-cost specialized
buildings, to critical infrastructure projects and to capital intensive new, rather untested technologies.
In deep, sophisticated financial markets, PCGs are used as fine-tuning instruments to reduce total
costs of capital. Although success stories can be found, experiences with PCGs for "smaller scale"
EE & RE projects have been disappointing in several emerging economies. peGs are not well-


                                                   21
known nor understood, and therefore, not in much demand. This was the situation also in the
Bulgarian finance community, which did not see much need for a PCG when financing EE-projects.
Public sector borrowers have good repayment records; for the corporate sector seeking EE loans,
loans would be provided based on their balance sheets and the banks' previous experience with loans
to these parties. Leveraging ratios that are not adjusted for "free rider-effects" exaggerate the impact
of PCGs on the engagement of commercial finance. The simple arithmetic that a 5% first loss
guarantee triggers a 20-fold of commercial lending does not take into account that a large share of the
"triggered finance" would have come forw:ard in any case. In Bulgaria, very hard selling and non-
commercial fee rates of 0.1 % were needed in order to induce banks to purchase PCGs. Nor did
consumers benefit from lower costs of loans covered by a guarantee.

Lesson 5: The development of the market for EE in the multi-apartment building sector depends on
the creation of well-functioning condominium associations and on the introduction of "energy
poverty" schemes to solve the issue of poor households living in those apartment buildings that are
unable to access loans to pay for their share of the total cost of the EE investment. General portfolio
PCGs for ESCO-projects cannot solve that issue.

Lesson 6: In countries, like Bulgaria, with high energy saving potential, sufficient scope exists for the
financing and implementation ofEE projects without investment grant support.

 Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
 The economic and financial performance of the project depended primarily on two factors: (i) quality
 of the design as a financial facility; and (ii) quality of the portfolio. Against these criteria, the
 financial facility has functioned relatively well during the implementation period supporting
 profitable investments, although realized energy savings were lower than expected.


      1. EE market Assessment and i~itial hypothesis

 The economic and financial analysis in the PAD was based on a preliminary market assessment
 which included an indicative portfolio of EE projects, mostly in the industrial sector. This pipeline
 indicated favorable financial and environmental characteristics based on high operating cost savings
 from EE investments.

         consumer benefits from amenities and local and global environmental benefits

Compared to this "industrial" project pipeline, BEEF-supported projects were predominantly in the
public buildings sector, including thermal refurbishment of schools, kindergartens, hospitals, and
universities. While this sector represents the second largest potential for energy savings in Bulgaria l ,
it is also characterized by less favorable financial conditions than the industrial sector due to the
predominance of high-cost measures (with long payback times) such as replacement of windows.

Another factor affecting the financial profitability of EE investments was the significant increase in
construction costs during the implementation phase. According to Eurostaf, between 2004 and 2009
the construction cost index in Bulgaria rose from 92 to 141, or by 53%, thus meaning that energy
savings for the invested US$ would be lower. At the closing date of the project, energy savings
reached only 0.11 million tons of oil equivalent, or 13% of the target value.

As a result, the average payback time of BEEF's portfolio was between 4-5 years, compared to 3
years as forecast in the PAD. Also, the financial rate of return was lower by 10% than initially
foreseen but remained at acceptable levels.                   .




I The public buildings sector accounts for the second largest share of potential energy savings (40%) after the industrial
sector (46%), and residential buildings (15%).

PCGs.


    2. BEEF's economie and flnaneial performanee

The anaJy:sis of BEEF financial pe,formance includes the five years of implementation during which
the GEF funds{USS 9.65 million)were disbursed. During this period. GEF resources mobilized total
co-finaric~g of USS28 million, bringing the total available. financing to USS 39 million {excluding
the TA coniponent), which yields a leverage ratio of 4.0 compared to 4.8 forecasted in the PAD. The
assOciated abatement cost per ton of C02 works out to as tow as USS8.4, assuming the full amount of
the GEF grant as a proxy for the incremental cost.                                         '

However" the economic performance of BEEF can be better measured if the analysis is made over the
project's de$ign life' of 15' years, which includes the cash reflows from its lending and guarantee
operations. Between 2005 and 2015, the total financing mobilized is forecast to reach USSI9 million.

NetA-sset Value

The Net Asset Value (NAV) model which was used in the PAD as a proxy measure of BEEF's
profitability was calculated for the ICR based on the financial characteristics of the Fund's portfolio
during implementation;

The initial asset value of BEEF in 2005 was ofUS$ 10.5 million, compared to the US$ 17.55 million
estimated at the appraisal due to lower than expected contributions from other donors and market
participants to the Fund's capitalization. Despite the lower initial capitalization, BEEF increased the
value of its assets since income fees and the interests earned were higher than the cost of the Fund's
administration and project defaults (close to zero). The NAV of BEEF over the lifetime of the project
increases to about US$ 19 million. While the NA V from the guarantee facility slightly declines due to
a low deal flow and guarantee fees, the NAV of the loan facility is projected to increase (see graph
below).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey

Background and Context
On behalf of the World Bank and BEEF, OtK Bulgaria conducted a survey among beneficiary
representatives in August, 2010. The main aim of the survey was to define the satisfaction of BEEF
clients with the services received as well as to understand more about the way the project had
impacted their EE behaviour. By the end of year 2009 BEEF n8.d participated in the financing of 77
energy efficiency projects.                                                                  .

The target projects were selected among the 67 out of the total of 77 projects that had at least one
winter season of operational experience after the rehabilitation. The respondents that participated in
the survey represent BEEF's main customer groups, i.e. municipalities and corporate clients.

 BEEF relations
 BEEF has developed a corporate web site, where detailed information can be accessed by current and
 potential clients. Moreover, BEEF representatives continuously participate in seminars and
 confererices'about sustainable energy and energy efficiency. The survey shows that most of BEEF's
 clients, learned,. about the possibility of fmancing EE through the BEEF website
·http://WWW.bgeef.comldisplay.aspx (47.6%), while other learned aJ:>out BEEF through professional
 networks (33.3%).                          .

BEEF seems to be.a good strategic partner for Bulgarian municipalities and companies. 42.91'10 of
respondents saythalBEEF helped them in taking the final decision to implement their EE project.
BEEF is also 'provid~g technical information on how to design the project and helping to demonstrate

Most respondents state. that BEEF provided sufficient information regarding the credit terms and that
they were well infornted about tlleprocedure and documentation of financing. This meant a fairly
short time required to decide whether to apply for a BEEF credit.         .

 The implementation of the projects was mostly considered as satisfactory, meaning that the projects
 were brought to an end on time and did not affect the working process of beneficiaries.

Based on the positive experience and satisfaction with the implementation of their own. EE projeCt
many beneficiaries became advocates of BEEF and have promoted it as a fmancial possibility to
colleagues and partners (100%); The interviewed representatives declared that they are very likely to
recommend BEEF as a financing partner (95.2%) and if they were to finance another EE project, they
would use the fund again (95.2%). Moreover, for the predotriinant share of BEEF's beneficiaries, the
contact with BEEF was crucial in the process of making the. final decision to invest in the project.
BEEF achieved this through frequent consultations and providing documentation and assistance with
procedural issues of project implementation.

Savings, Comfort,. Functionality

 The survey shows that BEEF's clients all perceive that they have more affordable energy bills after
.the .implementation of the project. Furthermore, most have stated that social comfort improved in
 terms of building aesthetics, better working environment and higher indoor temperatures during the
 winter season. The majority of respondents have stated that the building's functionality has improved.

Conclusion ud Reco......endation
The survey data show$that BEEF is seen as a reliable partner and a good alternative to traditional'
banks for financing BE projects. However, the survey shows three areas where there is room for
improvements:
    1. Providing more sources of information about BEEF's existence and .activities and giving
       more possibilities to potential clients to access detailed information;
   2. Shortening of the period required for approvai of funding; and
   3. mcreasing emphasis on improved street lighting projects.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop
Annex 7. Summary of Recipient's IeR

Comments by Mr. LulinRadulov, Chairman of the Board of BEEF:

1.     Assessment of the operation's objective, design, implementation, and operational
experience;
Bulgaria has the highest energy intensity in the EU and the improvement of energy efficiency is the
first priority for the country. The Energy Efficiency Fund's objective is to support Bulgaria in
mobilizing f\mds for financing efficiency programmes and measures in the field of consumption. It
was designed and implemented as a public private partnership. Its operation during the last five years
has been concentrated mainly on small projects related to energy efficiency of buildings. The limited
assets and disinterestedness of the industry (because of the low energy prices) impeded the activities
of the Fund in industry.

2.      Assessment of the outcome/result of the operation against the agreed objectives;
The Fund implemented a number of projects and, to some extent, attracted the interest of other
institutions (EBRD, EIB, private banks) in energy efficiency.
It should be noted, however, that the economic crisis was not the reason for the limited interest of the
private Bulgarian funding institutions and companies, as during the first three years of the. Fund's
operation the economic development conditions were very active. Most likely, this was a result of the
lack of national responsiveness of the private capital and passiveness of the Ministry of Economy and
Energy.

3.      Evaluation of the recipient's own performance during the preparation and implementation
of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that may be helpful in the future;
The Ministry of Economy and Energy was actively involved in the preparation phase. There was a
room to desire larger scale support from the Ministry for ensuring more sources of funding.
The Ministry should become the active party; it must keep constant dialogue with the private sector in
order to involve it into national initiatives.              .

4.     Evaluation of· the performance of the World Bank during the preparation· and
implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness of their relationships, with special
emphasis on lessons learned
Except for the initial funding from GEF the World Bank succeeded to convince the Austrian
government to contribute 1.5 MEuro to the Fund. The World Bank was providing constant help to
the Management Board and the Consultants, particularly in the first phase, in order to ensure correct
financial control and smooth start of the operation. The Bank also made efforts to urge the Ministry
of Economy and Energy to investigate more actively the potential sources of funding for the Fund.

5.      Evaluation of the proposed arrangements for future operation of the project.
I can mention the following characteristics of the operation, which would help outlining some
measures for future, more effective operation:
    4. The operation of the Fund should be better balanced with regard to the types of projects:
       buildings, industry, transport. In the portfolio of executed and ongoing projects there are few
       industrial and no transport projects. This is the Consultant's responsibility. More efforts
       should be put to activities promoting efficiency of industrial and transport sectors.




                                                  34
 5. The limited funding made the operation· costs component (Consultants) too·high and imposed
    greater price of the loans - similar to the loans conditions of commercial banks and, in some
    cases, not competitive against the EBRD money, which is using grants from the EU.
 6. The portfolio can be extended by RES projects, which are characterized with high efficiency.
    For inStance, projects for production of distributed heat, regardless of the source (solar
    irradiation/biomass, biogas etc), which replace electril:ity, are the'most efficient among all .
    possible implementations. Their energy performance indicatorS .are very high, locations are
    next to· the consumers, which means that there are no losses.          .
 7. 'The activities of the Fund may include promotion of the deployment of RES utilization,
     particularly of biomass, through providing support to the private companies in establishing
     distribution network for pellets and energy chips.
 8. The Ministry should redirect part of the received EU money to capitalization of the Fund.
    This will reduce the relative costs of the management and will make the Fund more
    competitive.
 9. The Ministry should keep active dialogue with the economic subjects (it is the Ministry of
    Economy.)
. 10. Tariffs are. of utmost importance,however,this problem. is out of consideration, particularly
      in Bulgaria - the country with loWest level of energy prices in the whole EU.

Annex 8. Comments ofCofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
Comments by Asari· Efiong, Principal Product Development Manager, Energy Efficiency and
Climate Change, EBRD

BEEF has made a robust contribution to the Energy Efficiency market in Bulgaria since its inception
in 2005. Changes in the EnergyEfficiencyAct adopted in June 2007, which enabled local authorities
to negotiate directly with BEEF proved particularly efficient and have allowed BEEF to become a
highly effective funding channel in the promotion of energy efficiency particularly in its established
niche, public buildings,· where there is an absence of commercial financing.


The BEEF has also acted as a major catalyst for the development of the ESCO market in Bulgaria not
just through its various marketing initiatives but also its technical assistance programmes and targeted
suite of products e.g. the ESCO portfolio guarantees.


The EBRD is considering a possible future involvement in the BEEF fund primarily to continue and
build upon the development of the private ESCO market in Bulgaria which BEEF has been
instrumental in. The idea would be to put in place additional financing instruments to incentivise
private companies in the engineering and construction sectors to enter the ESCO market supported by
a range of possibilities for the financing of Energy Performance (EnPC) contracts as well· as the EE
financing instruments (loans/ partial credit guarantees/ portfolio guarantees) currently offered by
BEEF.
