The\n            project is focused on the development and implementation of\n            financially profitable EE projects, which can provide\n            sustainable and increasing reductions in greenhouse gas\n            (GHG) emissions, without relying on public subsidies. In\n            compliance with the country's environmental\n            legislation, and Bank's operational directives,\n            institutional arrangements and processes will follow\n            environmental management practices on proposed subprojects,\n            which entails a screening criteria based on questionnaires,\n            to identify the respective environmental categories.\n            Exceptions or disputed cases entail two situations: 1) if\n            the Bank disagrees with the Bulgarian authorities to exclude\n            a subproject from the process of an environmental impact\n            assessment, disagreements will be communicated, and the Bank\n            may require the procedure for environmental assessment\n            category B to be applied, in which case an environmental\n            management plan will be prepared in collaboration with the\n            developer/investor; and, 2) subprojects that influence\n            natural habitats, cultural property, or other aspects in\n            conflict with the Bank's safeguards, then the greater\n            protection offered by Bank policies to such resources will\n            govern, and the Bank may require mitigation measures to\n            comply with its procedures. Mitigation measures include:\n            international standard environmental practices for crude oil\n            refineries, wastes disposal from oil spills, and/or\n            lubricants; appropriate installations for heat power plants\n            and other combustion plants, as well as for processing\n            exposed nuclear fuels; adequate installations for the\n            production of cast iron and steel, as well as processing\n            installations in ferrous metal foundries; likewise, adequacy\n            installations concerning non-ferrous crude metals from ores,\n            for surface treatment of metals, and plastics, for\n            extraction and processing of asbestos containing products,\n            and, for integral chemical industrial production, including\n            cellulose, cement, glass, mineral substances, ceramic, and\n            raw hides production; moreover, slaughter houses and farms\n            for intensive breeding shall comply with standard\n            regulations; hazardous wastes will be disposed of at\n            selected sites, or incinerated, or undergo chemical\n            treatments as needed; and, extraction of ground waters will\n            be in accordance with local regulations, following waste\n            water treatment practices."}, "docdt": "2004-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
