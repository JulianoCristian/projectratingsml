A. STRATEGICCONTEXT AND RATIONALE



1.1. Excessiveenergy intensity vastpotentialfor energy savings
                                   -

Compared with the vast majority o f the European countries, Bulgaria i s an outlier in terms of
energy intensity o f its economy (see table in Annex 1). At 0.38 ton o f oil equivalent per
thousand US$ of GDP (at the Purchasing Power Parity exchange rate), the country's energy
intensity is more than twice the average value for the European Union. It also exceeds by a
considerable margin the energy intensity o f the transition economies in Europe. The extreme
energy inefficiency is due in part to specific circumstances o f Bulgaria, including over-
stimulated electricity demand because of historically heavy reliance on grossly underpriced
electricity for heating, the virtual lack of low-pressure natural gas market and delays in
modernizingthe district heating systems. Consumption o f electricity i s particularly wasteful. In
2001, Bulgaria's electricity intensity o f GDP was seven times higher than the OECD average,
four times higher thanthat o fHungaryandTurkey, and60% higher thanthat o fRomania.

Mirroring the large energy inefficiency, the environmental impact o f Bulgaria's economy i s
disproportionately high. Interms o f C02 emissions per unit o f GDP, Bulgaria is s
by Russia andUkraine among the Europeantransition economies. Inefficient energy utilization
i s one o f the reasons for the existence of environmental "hot spots" in the country (e.g., Devnya,
Maritsa-Iztok, Galabovo-Radnevoya) where ambient air quality often does not meet national and
World HealthOrganization standards.

Because o f the current low efficiency base, Bulgaria has a vast potential to achieve significant
energy efficiency (EE) gains in a cost-effective manner. The saving potential i s as highas 50%
for existingbuilding stock, 40% for district heating and 30% for industry. The industrialsector
accounts for more thanhalfo f the savings potential. The Government's NationaZEnergy Saving
Program to 2010 (adopted in2001) identified a vast potential for energy saving and specified a
large number o f specific EE programs and measures for the various end-use sectors with
combined energy savings amounting to 1.4 million tons of oil equivalent per year (or about 15%
o ftotal final energyconsumption) and C02 emissions reduction o f 5.6 milliontons per year. The
most promising low-cost energy saving projects (with payback time o f less than 3 years) were
            inthe Government's medium-term National Energy Saving Action PZan (2001-2003),
but very few projects have actually been carried out. During 2001-2003, the commercially
financed EE investments amounted to US$13 million, a mere 5% o f the annual requirements for
EE investments included in the National Energy Saving Program to 2010. This is a good
indicator ofthe striking size o f the EE finance gap inBulgaria.

1.2 Barriers to energy efficiency

Albeit opportunities for "win-win" projects @e., ones bringing environmental benefits and
sufficient financial returns) are abundant given the disproportionately large scope for EE
improvements, Bulgaria's EE market is still underdeveloped, failing to produce the needed
volume o finvestment capital. The most seriousbarriers to uptake o f commercialEE finance are:



                                                   1

Difficult access to finance.           Commercial bank intermediation relative to the size o f the
Bulgarianeconomy is low by any standard, partly as a lingeringconsequence ofthe collapse o f
the bankingsystem duringthe severe economic and financial crisis o f 1996-1997. The corporate
sector's access to credit i s low by international standards and i s still below the level reached
before the 1996-1997 bankingcrisis. Commercial bankshave managedrisks by limitinglending
volume, demandinghighcollateralization (200% andhigher), charging highinterest rates to local
businesses (between 10% and 18%, despite inflation being contained lately at 4%), focusing on
short-term lending (with loan maturities o f 1-2 years) and investing in low-risk government
securities. Loans depend primarily on collateral and less so on proven cash flows. Insufficient
competition allows banks to keep credit low while maintaininghighmargins. Instead o f turning
to bank borrowing, small- and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) inBulgaria rely primarilyon
cash. The loanportfolio o fbanks is still simple, consisting largely of working capital loans with
short maturities and available mostly to well-established firms.' The extreme inefficiency o f the
Bulgarianjudicial system makes recovery ofdebt or seizure of collateral a long-winded process.
The perceived high credit risk hurts especially the SMEs, housing cooperatives, municipalities,
hospitals and other similar energy consumers, which may not have a significant credit history or
lack suitable collateral values associatedwith EEprojects. Approval o f credit applications takes
months.

Perception of high risk for EE projects. InBulgaria, there is a considerable gap between the
real andperceived risk bybankswith respect to EEprojects. Commercial banks are generally not
familiar with commercial and technical issues involved inEE projects andperceive the risks and
transaction costs o f EE projects as too high. Benefits o f these projects are often seen as
"environmental" and "social" andthere is skepticism about their financial profitability. The staff
inmany financial institutions has no experience indealing with EE investments whose benefits
are largely intangible (operating cost savings), favoring instead the more familiar energy supply
projects that yield tangible output and revenue increases. Another barrier to the financing o f EE
projects is their generally small size relative to energy supply projects with which they often
must compete for financing. Because o f the proportionally higher transaction costs, a small EE
project may be o f no interest to banks or it must have a higher rate o f return for the size o f the
return to be highenough for the financial institution to outweighthe transaction costs. Clearly, a
proven track record o f commercially profitableEEprojects i s required to convince lenders that a
numberof risks are only perceived and can be managed, and that the initial costs of getting into
this specializedbusinessare worth incurring or canbe partially avoided due to prior experience.

Weak capacity to develop bankable EE projects. The combination o f financial and technical
skills needed for the preparation o f sound EE business plans are largely missing in Bulgaria.
Typically there is weak commercial orientation among technical staff and a widespread lack of
understandingof financial packaging of projects and isolation fi-om financial institutions. An
organization with a limited history o f commercial borrowing will almost inevitably also have
limited experience in developing compelling business plans.                   SMEs are too small to have

specialist staff experienced inbusiness planpreparation. A poorly constructed businessplan i s a
frequent cause o f an otherwise good project beingrejectedby financial institutions.

Lack of innovative EE financing.           Innovative financing, such as energy performance
contracting, i s hardlyused inBulgariaalbeit it canbe effective inattracting the necessary capital,
often for projects that are deemedtoo small or risky for financial institutions. This may require
"project pooling" by a third party where projects that are individually too small to justify an
energy performance contracting arrangement are bundledto make a financially viable package.
However, there is no mature and competitive energy service industry in Bulgaria, with most of
the private energy service companies (ESCOs) havingsmall operations andbalance sheets. They
tend to suffer from insufficient credibility and trust by both the energy users and the financial
institutions that they can deliver the promised energylfinancial savings. There is a financing
vicious circle, whereby the low credibility and reputation o f small ESCOs prevent them from
attracting financing partners, let alone receiving competitive financing terms from commercial
banks. Modem project-finance concepts (e.g., off-balance sheet financing, equipment leasing)
are not widespread. This results in typically higher cost o f capital and in the inability to hedge
the uncertainty o f energy savings.      The availability o f credit guarantees for performance
contracting could be a factor in reducing the credit risk profile o f energy performance contracts
and hence in assisting such projects to have access to commercial lending at market interest
rates.

Information barriers. Information on EE technologies, the effectiveness o f EE measures,
project development and financing techniques i s largely lacking in Bulgaria, partly because of
the lack o f strong institutional focal point within the government for effective information
dissemination, including "good practices."      The lack o f good information to consumers, the
energy service sector and the financial institutionsmeans that many cost-effective opportunities
for EE investments are missed.

Weak financial incentives for end-users.         In Bulgaria, energy consumption has long been
subsidized, with end-user prices kept well below full cost-recovery levels for some consumer
groups. This has encouragedinefficient or downright wasteful consumptionpatterns.

1.3. Governmentstrategy

Historically, energy policies in Bulgaria were heavily supply-oriented, emphasizing increased
energy production and positioningthe country as the energy center of the Balkans. EE policies
were largely based on top-down administrative and legal regulation (standards, consumption
quotas, etc.) and failed to tackle the country's serious EE problems in a comprehensive manner.
There was a virtual lack o f central responsibilityfor EEpolicy and implementation with the state
EnergyEfficiencyAgency (EEA) unequipped with adequatepolicy-makingcapacity and failing
to act as a national center of excellence for EE. Furthermore, even most o f the identified EE
projects remainedunimplemented due to serious shortage o f funding and the lack o f EE finance
market. The reform-oriented government in office since 2001 i s undertaking serious efforts to
address this legacy by moving (i)    from policy formulation to implementation; (ii) a focus
                                                                                     from
on supply side EE to the demand side; (iii)  from isolated EE projects to coherent programs; (iv)
from an ineffective EEA to a national center o f excellence inpolicy and implementation; and (v)



                                                  3

from almost exclusive finding from the government and bilateral donors to an EE finance
market.

                 ent's Energy Strategy (adopted in July 20 2), the National Energy Saving Action
Plan (adopted in2003) andthe new EEAct (dated March 5,2004) reflect these new priorities as
follows:

        Assigningwithin the overall energystrategy akey priority to improved energy efficiency
        to (i)    increase industrial competitiveness; (ii) European Union (EU) EE and
                                                                     meet
         environmental requirements: and (iii)          mitigate the environmental impact of energy use
        through market-basedmechanisms and incentives.

         Strengthening the Government's policy-making and implementation capacity by
        restructuring the EEA under the Ministry o f Energy and Energy Resources, moving it
         from project managementto highlevelpolicy makingandmonitoring.

         Creating a supportive policy framework for EE, especially through addressing price
         distortions inthe economy and adjusting energy prices to cost-recovery levels on the fast
         track, thereby strengthening the financial incentive for EE.3 The move towards cost-
         recovery tariffs i s critical for achieving market sustainability for the proposedproject.

         Promoting the emergence o f an EE finance market by the establishment o f a
         commercially oriented revolving EE Fund to demonstrate the financial profitability of
         investments in the EE sector, thereby catalyzing the creation o f a broad-based,
         sustainable commercial financing for EE projects. The proposed project will provide
         GEF support for this specific initiativeofthe GOB.

2. Rationale for GEF involvement

The sector issuesnoted above, inparticular the extreme energyinefficiency and strong financing
barriers to EE, along with the Government's credible commitment to address them, provides a
compelling case for a GEF-supported contingent finance operation4 in Bulgaria for building a
sustainedmarket-based capacity to develop and finance EE projects on commercial terms under
      roposed Bulgaria EnergyEfficiency Fund(BEEF or Fund):



* Bulgaria's EE-related obligations to be met for EU membership are specified under chapter 14 (energy) and
chapter 22 (environment) of the EU acquis. Under these chapters, the GOB undertook to align national legislation
andregulationwiththe relevant environmental andEEdirectives ofthe EU.
 After a period o f inaction, inrecent years the GOB has embarked on an aggressive tariffrebalancing strategy under
the Bank-supported Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL). Under the PAL, the GOB has undertaken to raise the
residential electricity tanffs by more than 1.5-fold and residential heat tariffs by 1.3-fold over a three-year period
(2002-2004). Residential electricity tariffs in the second half o f 2004 stood 30% higher than industrial tariffs (in
2001, they were 10%lower), roughly reaching the cost-recovery level.
  Contingent finance instruments such as partial credit guarantees and revolving loan funds allow for highly cost-
effective approachesto overcoming financial barriers to otherwise viable projects benefiting the global environment,
while at the same time leveraging mainstream private and/or public capital for investments in climate-friendly
technologies.


                                                          4

    0  GEF's lead participation i s critical for the establishment o f BEEF. Without GEF's
       significant contributionto the initial capitalization, the Fundproject would not procee
       a reasonable time frame.      Under this scenario, a certain degree of progress, e.g., on
       capacity building and some investments financed mostly from internal funds would
       occur, but broad-based commercially viable EE investments would remain suppressed, as
       the basic problems (financiers' perception of high risk and high transaction costs, weak
       capacity to develop bankable projects, etc.) which have impeded investment in the past
       would remain largely unresolved. All previous attempts to address these barriers either
       failed (e.g., the grossly under-resourced and poorly designed state-directed National EE
       Fundestablished in 1998 and abolished in 1999)or was unable to reach a "critical mass"
       of sustainability (e.g., the USAD-supported MunicipalEEProject).


    0  GEF contribution to BEEF allows to leverage a high volume of additional financial
       resources. BEEFprovides very highleverage (nearly five times over the first five years
       and 19 times over 15 years) for GEF funds via (i) involvement of commercial
                                                                 direct
       banks in profitable EE projects under co-financing and partial credit guarantee
       arrangements; (ii)  building capacity for EE in the financial and energy services sectors;
       and(iii) economy-wide demonstration value offinancially viable EEprojects.
                  the


    0  The underlying conceptual design of the project applies the principle of contingent
       finance promoted by GEF.           The contingent finance modality o f BEEF offers
       exceptionally high energy savings (and associated reduction o f GHG emissions) per
       dollar of BEEF'S capitalization while preserving and possibly increasing the initial
       capital value o fthe Fund. After successful implementation ofthe project, remaining GEF
       resources in BEEF could be made available for potential use in other priority GHG
       reduction efforts inBulgaria.


    0  The concept o f commercially oriented, revolving EEFundi s replicable regionally. Most
        of the transition economies face largely similar conditions, including high energy
        intensity, huge scope for "win-win" EE projects due to past under-investment and
       perverse incentives, and the severe financing gap constraining         e implementation of
        these investments.

The project i s proposed to the GEF under Operational Program No. 5 (OP-5): Removal of
Barriers to Energy Efficiency and Energy Conservation.             The specific strategic priorities
supported by project in the context o f the GEF Business Plan for FY04-06 are:                S1 -
transformation o f markets for high-volume, commercial, low-GHG products or processes; and
S2 - increasedaccess to local sources o f financing. The relevance o f the proposed project for S2
i s especially strong since it focuses on mobilizing the resources o f local commercial banks and
other private financiers by removing actual andperceived barriers to EEinvestments. Under S2,
revolving funds are characterized as one of the proven mechanisms in addressing the financing
barriers to EE.

3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

3.1. Bulgaria's international obligationsunder climateprotection

The proposed project will help enable Bulgaria to meet its obligations under the UnitedNations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).            Bulgaria ratified the UNFCCC in
March 1995. Bulgaria signed a Host-Country Agreement with the Bank's Prototype Carbon
Fund (PCF) and is implementing a biomass utilization project with PCF support. The GOB
supports the Joint Implementation (JI) mechanisms under the UNFCCC. In2000, a JI Unit for
joint EE projects with Bulgarian and Dutch participation was established. In 2002, a similar
agreementwas signed with Austria.

The project will also contribute to achieving the Government's objectives under its
Environmental Strategy and Action Plan (approved in 2001) inwhich the huge potential for EE
improvement was identified as a key target area for GHG reduction.            The Ministry of
Environment and Water expressed strong support for the project and the GEF Focal Point
endorsedit inMarch2003.

3.2. Sector-related WorldBank CountryAssistanceStrategy

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, dated May 31, 2002) i s designed to support
Bulgariawith reforms that will assist the country inmeetingits European Union (EU) accession
requirements concerning EE and environmental protection.         The energy sector has been
considered a laggard inmeetingthe EE and environmental requirements o f the EU. Inits annual
reports on Bulgaria's progress towards accession, the European Commission has repeatedly
expressed serious concern about the very low level o f EE and called for the development and
implementation o f a broad-based EE program inBulgaria as a matter o f strategic policy priority
and a requirement of EU accession. A recent Bank report, Bulgaria: Energy-Environment
Review (November 2001)' identifiedimprovedEE as a keypolicy challenge facing the Bulgarian
economy in the years ahead. The Review demonstrated that efficient energy use is a viable
alternative to the rampant expansion of energy supply.       The CAS points out that energy
utilization should be addressed as a matter o f urgency and highpriority in order to bring about
the large efficiency gains and the associated environmental benefits. In this context, the CAS
 explicitly includes an EE project to be supported by the GEF. The CAS also has an
 environmental development objective to support Bulgaria in maintainingheadroom for tradable
carbon. Reduction of GHG emissions may be purchased by PCF and the OECD countries under
 separate trading arrangements with governments and/or private entities.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

 1. GlobalEnvironmental Objective

 The global environmental objective o f the project is to support a large increase in EE
 investments in Bulgaria through development o f self-sustaining, market-based financing
mechanisms.      The project's goal is focused on the development and implementation of




                                                6

financially profitable EE projects, which can provide sustainable and increasing reductions in
GHGemissions without relyingonpublic subsidy.

The project would achieve this objective by mitigating the perceived highrisk and transaction
costs o f initial EE investments and overcoming the current barriers to investment through the
creation of a revolving EE Fund for the development and financing o f commercially viable
projects and capacity buildingsupport. The Fundwould directly support the implementation of a
growing number of EE projects on fully commercial terms, demonstrating means to overcome
current barriers and make profits on such projects. At least half o f the benefits o f BEEF-
supported projects should come from measurable energy savings. The project will also foster,
through both demonstration and explicit partnership, expanded investment by other market
participants, such as commercial banks, ESCOs and leasing companies. Without the intervention
of the project to overcome the financing barriers on a sustainable basis, it i s likely that little
progress would be made inEE investment inthe years to come, as has been the case inthe past
de~ade.~

Performance indicators with respectto the project objective include:

         Number o f EE projects and associated investment volume with commercial b
         participatinginfinancing with BEEF.

         Measurablereduction o fGHG emissions from participatingsectors and sub-borrowers.

         Number o f financial institutions engagedinEEproject financing.

         Number o fESCOs engagedinEEproject development and implementation.

         Development o f a critical mass of commercial EEproject development and financing and
         subsequent emergence o f a competitive, self-sustainable national EE market - the pivotal
         long-term success indicator o fBEEF.

2. Project components
(see also Annex 4)

GEF financing of US$10 million is being sought under Operational Program 5 to support the
establishment and operation o f BEEF as a commercially oriented finance facility in a public-
private partnership. As a market facilitator, the Fund would combine both technical project
development capacity and financial structuring capacity into one entity, thereby addressing the
current weak capacity to develop bankable EEprojects. Specifically, GEF funds will used to (i)



* Very limited investment inEEprojects is believed to be the mainreason why inthe 1990s the energy intensity of
GDP fell only marginally in Bulgaria, in contrast with most o f the transition economies where it declined
considerably (e.g., 40% inPoland and 20% inthe Czech Republic). (Source: Energy Strategy of Bulgaria, Ministry
of Energy and Energy Resources, Sofia, March2002.) This is despite the fact that Bulgaria's energy intensity is one
o f the highest among the transition economies (surpassed only by Russia and Ukraine), thus having a
disproportionately large energy-saving potential.


                                                       7

provide seed capital for BEEF; (ii) initial set-up and operating costs until BEEF reaches
                                      defray
financial self-sufficiency; and (iii)partially defray initial costs o f EE capacity building (project
development, financial packaging, etc.).

Designed as a flexible, market demand-driven facility, BEEF would make available both loans
and partial credit guarantees for EEprojects. As discussedbelow (sections B.3 and B.4), at this
time Bulgaria needs these financial products to address both liquidity and credit risk barriers to
EE financing.      This was confirmed by initial market sounding performed during project
preparation. Notwithstanding rapid growth of credit supply lately, there are indications o f still-
insufficient capital market liquidity. Interest rates are still high (between 10% and 18%) despite
inflation being contained (at 4%). Commercial bank intermediation relative to the size of the
economy i s low by any standard, partly as a lingering consequence o f the severe
economic/financial crisis o f 1996-1997. The corporate sector's access to credit (other than short-
term working capital credit) is still below the level reached before the crisis. Limited co-
financing by BEEF is expected to have a catalytic effect on commercial funding particularly in
the early years, thus attracting rather thancrowdingout private financing.

BEEF is designed with built-in fungibility o f funds between the two facilities in response to
changing financial market conditions and early implementation experience. It i s expected that
over time, with gradually improving capital market liquidity, especially in connection with
Bulgaria's prospective accession to the EU, the demand for BEEF support will shift in favor of
credit enhancement (guarantees). The split between the two windows in the financing plan is
indicative only, the actual proportion will be largely market-determined and in favor o f the
guaranteesover time.

Flexible combinations of the two modes o f financing are possible: direct loans accompanied by
co-financing from other sources, including commercial banks, supported by a BEEF guarantee.
The Fund Manager is expected to make rational choices about the appropriate financing
instruments based on specific project circumstances, overall project portfolio management
considerations, proper risk allocation among project partners, and evolution o f the domestic
financial market. Thus, BEEF's program structure (reflected in the Operations Manual {OM])
allows for procedures and financing mechanisms to be adjusted based on changing market
conditions, demands and early implementation experience.

Under the post-EU accession scenario of much improved capital liquidity, one possibility to be
considered is the complete phase-out o f the loan facility with a corresponding increase in the
volume of guarantee transactions. The market demand trends for loan and guarantees shall be
closely tracked under the project monitoring plan to allow for timely adjustments in BEEF's
financing strategy.

Initially, the Fundwould consist o fthree components:


    0    Partial Credit Guarantees (PCG): to share inthe credit risk o fEE finance transactions and
         to improve loanterms for sub-project sponsors.

    0    Investment(Sub-Loan) Financing: to co-finance bankable EE projects on a commercial
         lendingbasis.


                                                  8

    0     Technical Assistance: to initially finance on a grant basis a portion of EE project
          development, capacity building, information barrier removal and administration costs of
          the Fund.

The table below summarizes by component the indicative project cost estimates and related
indicative financing plan.

Component I: Partial Credit Guarantees (indicative amount: US$31.1 million, of which
US$4.50 million from GEF).6 Most commercial financiers inBulgaria are reluctant to finance
EE transactions due to their unfamiliaritywith such projects and perceived weak client/project
credit profiles.     This facility (the GuaranteeAccount [GA]) will be used for credit enhancement
purposes to share in the credit risk o f EE finance transactions typically up to 70% o f the
outstanding loan principal o f the financial institution involved on apari passu basis (up to 30%
on aJirst loss ba~is).~ competitively priced guarantee fee would be charged based on the risk
                              A
level, with higher risk projects beingchargedhigher fees.

BEEF will act as a credit guarantor, issuing various PCGproducts based on predefined criteria
included in the OM and BEEF's risk tolerance capacity.'                            The can help offset Fund
administration costs and possible defaults. Reserves must be liquid to individual guarantee
commitments shall not exceed the equivalent o f US$500,000 (the guarantee liability limit). The
GA will be established ina competitively selected commercial bank. The GA will earn income
through interest from the reserve account balance along with guarantee fees, which cover
potentialguaranteeloss claims.

Within thirty days of a guarantee call payment, BEEF shall provide to MEER and the Bank a
written report indicating the reasons for the default, its recovery plan and its assessment o f the
probability o f recovery o f the amounts in default and thereafter implement the recovery plan
approved by BEEF's Management Board. If any amounts are determined by BEEF to be
irrevocable, obtain the approval o fMEER andthe Bankto write off such amounts.

Conditions are suitable in Bulgaria for the guarantee instrument to be successful. Banks are in
process o f improving liquidityand there is some, albeit still marginal, baseline market activity in
credit guarantees (notably, the MunicipalEEProgram) serving as a positive reference.                        ,




  The size o f the PCG window is based on the assumption that contributions to the Fund by the GOB, bilateral
donors and other financiers would be split ina roughly 60140 proportion between the guarantee and loan windows.
This i s an indicative ratio. The actual split will be determined mostly by market demands for the two products.
'Up  to 70% is anindicative range. However, full (100%) guarantees will not be provided to avoid the moral hazard
of high riskprojects. As banks gain experience with the actual portfolio performance o fEE investments (real riskof
defaults), the level ofpartialguarantee coverage requiredto overcome their perceived risk is expected to decrease.
  The range or credit guarantees can includepari passu or first loss, accelerable or non-accelerable products. Under
pari passu, inthe event ofpayment default there are proportional claims over debt recovery betweenBEEF and the
commercial creditor, while under "first loss" BEEF would be receive what remains o f the recovered debt after the
creditor satisfied its claim. Under an accelerable PCG, the guarantees could be paid out to the maximum coverage
amount at the time o f the payment default, while under the non-accelerable type guarantee payments are made in
accordance with the original credit repayment schedule. BEEF's risk exposure (on a present value basis) is smaller
under the non-accelerable guarantee.

Component 2: Investment (Sub-Loan) Financing (indicative amount: US$I6.34 million, of
which US$4.00 million from GEF). Under this facility (the Loan Account), sub-loans will be
made on a commercial basis to creditworthy customers that will revolve with interest and
principalpayments into BEEF for additional loans. Indicative lendingguidelines are as follows:

         pipeline development (including partial support for audits) and project evaluation,
         workshops and seminars for potential co-financiers and clients, marketing and

BEEF will manage a sufficiently diverse portfolio in terms of sectors and risks while ensuring
that at least half of the benefits in every project come from measurable energy savings. Likely
eligible transactions would include investments inprojects aimed at improving EE inbuildings
(e.g., through modernization o f heat exchanger substations, heating insulation), industrial
processes, municipal facilities (e.g., street lighting) and other energy end-use applications (e.g.,
lighting, boiler and small cogeneration systems, energy management control systems, power
factor correction measures, air compressors, steamtraps, fuel switching).


3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
(see Annex 2 for more details)

3.1. General lessons

Experience from GEF's overall EE portfolio suggests that even in countries where the local
financial market has sufficient size and liquidity, consumers and investors may have limited



  The contingent loanmay be structured as a temporary liquidityback-stop facility. For example, when a borrower
falls into a temporary cash deficiency, BEEF could provide a contingent loan to make up for the shortfall for the
debt service to a commercial bank.


                                                      11

access to local financial institutions due to perceptions o fhighrisk, hightransaction cost, lack of
institutional infrastructure and project development capacity or lack of awareness regarding
technologies and their technicaVfinancia1 performance characteristics.               Supporting financial
intermediaries and providing risk-sharing instruments to financial institutions (credit risk
guarantees and other contingent finance instruments) can be cost-effective ways o f addressing
these barriers. Microcredit, commercial loan guarantees for ESCOs and revolving loan funds
have all been successfully demonstrated in completed GEF projects. With the focus on local
financial markets and institutions, such projects have a high likelihood o f sustainability and
replication. lo

Apart from the GEF operations, lessons learned from EE Fund experiencesworldwide highlight
the importance of: (i)   keeping the Funddesign simple and allowing for some program flexibility
to adjust to changing market conditions, demands and initial implementation experience; (ii)
transparency o f Fund management procedures; (iii)avoidance o f political interference,
government micro-management and subsidized interest rates; (iv) reliance on existing market
participants in building strong partnerships and alliances with financial institutions, ESCOs,
consultants and equipment vendors; (v) portfolio diversification; (vi) emphasis on projects with
highratesofreturn; (vii) bundlingof smallprojects; (viii) proactive FundManager incentivized
in identifylngnew business and helping applicants improve the quality of their proposals; (ix)
building a strong pipeline o f finance-ready projects early on; (x) sharing of risks and incentives
among all project partners; and (xi) integration o f financial and technical expertise for the
development of a viable project portfolio. These good practice lessonshave been accommodated
to the maximum possible extent inthe design ofthe proposedproject.

3.2. Lessondaperiencefrom selected relevantEEprojects

Bulgaria Municipal EE Program. This USAID-funded project has provided partial credit
guarantees (PCG) in favor o f the United Bulgarian Bank (UBB) for small-scale municipal EE
projects. About two dozen projects (totaling about US$10 million) have been funded with an
average payback time o f three years.              Although the Program has been successful in
demonstrating the possibility o f commercial EE financing in Bulgaria, it has failed to reach a
critical mass for sustainability through developing or catalyzing a large number of additional
projects at the national level.         The non-revolving nature o f the PCG facility has been a
shortcoming. Another design problem i s the financing monopoly position o f UBB, which kept
the interest rate and collateral requirements at relatively highlevels. A more efficient approach
i s to work with multiple banks, forcing them to actively compete for bankable EE projects and
offer the best possible financing terms to project sponsors.

Hungary EE Co-FinancingProgram (HEECP). The IFC/GEF-supported HEECP is designed to
 overcome barriers to EE project finance and development via a PCG program to share in the
 credit risk o f EE operations undertaken by domestic financial institutions and a TA program to
help prepare projects and aid general EE market development. HEECP has now a strong



 loImportant good practice lessons from the World Bank's GEF EE portfolio were outlined ina recent Bank report
 "World BankGEF EnergyEficiency Portfolio ReviewandPractitioners'Handbook"(January 2004).



                                                     12

pipeline o f projects with an average size of US$250,000. HEECP has been instrumental in
establishing active competition between Hungarian banks to develop and market project
financing products. The TA program i s designed to be flexible and results-oriented responding
to and directly supporting the specific needs of the individual ESCOs and financial institutions
executing the transactions supported by the facility. Because o f the wide range o f end-user
sectors, niche financial products have been developed. Another important lesson learnt under
HEECP i s the streamlined credit approval process which minimizes transaction costs. Building
on the model successfully demonstrated under HEECP, IFC is implementing a new PCGproject
with co-financingfrom GEF called Commercializing EE Finance (CEEF) for five EUaccession
countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, LatviaandLithuania).

Romania EE Project (GEF). In some respects, BEEF i s an application o f the concept o f the
Romanian project. Both projects involve a revolving fund. Like in Romania, inadequate bank
liquiditycalls for the inclusiono fa loan component inBEEF. However, BEEFwill also provide
PCGs, thus considerably enhancing the contingent finance nature of the project. Experience
under the Municipal EE Program in Bulgaria, HEECP and CEEF confirms the need for a
guarantee instrument in the current stage of development of Bulgaria's commercial banking
sector characterized by highly risk-averse behavior.                   During the initial market sounding,
Bulgarian commercial banks indicated a strong preference for credit risk coverage prior to
shiftingto non-guaranteeddebt financing ofEEprojects.

4. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

Several alternative project approacheswere considered, including:

    e    Stand-alone I3RD loan or blend (IBRD loan/GEF grant). This possibility was not
         pursued after receivingstrong indications about the lack o fwillingness o f the Ministry o f
         Finance to provide sovereign guarantees to newprojects inthe energy sector.

    e    Dedicated EE credit line administered through financial intermediaries. Experiences
         with BRD, IFC and EBRD credit lines indicate that they have suffered from slow
         disbursement or cancellation o f funds.'* Generally, commercial banks are not familiar
         with assessingthe financial aspectso fEEprojects and lack trust that they can deliver the
         promised energy and financial savings.                Lack of experience and expertise in EE
         efficiency lead to risk-averse lending, hightransaction costs, excessive threshold rate o f
         return requirements and over-collateralization.             The fundamental problem with credit
         lines i s that they do not address such key EE barriers as weak project development
         capacity andthe perception ofhighproject risk andtransaction costs.




  For example, under IBRD's Hungary Industrial and Energy Conservation Project only a small fraction o f the
dedicated EE c r d t line was disbursed. InRomania, the EBFWEUPHARE-hnded credit line faded due to a lack
of interest and lack of commitment to the project by the local bank partner in the scheme. The bank had little EE
expertise and no strong incentive to develop this specialized business. No significant experience is available yet on
EBRD's new credit line opened in2004 with several Bulgarianbanks. The pilot facility is designed to helppromote
EEandrenewable energy projects inprivate sector businesses(see also Annex 2, section 2).



                                                          13

   0   Support solely for ESCOs. Lack o f ESCOs is not a major concern in Bulgaria as about
       two dozen exist. However, overall they perform a small volume EE businessbecause o f
       their limited ability to raise equity capital and secure sufficient project financing at
       affordable terms.       The BEEF will help to strengthen Bulgaria' ESCO industry by
       mitigatingthe perceivedhighrisk andtransaction costs for EEoperations.


   0   Equityfunds. This approachremains rather uncommon. Ina couple o f cases, GEF funds
       were provided as equity to ESCOs, but concerns arose over access to debt finance,
       divestment protocol and legal issues. The IFC/GEF Renewable Energy and EE Fund
       (REEF), a global private equity knd establishedin 1977, has been unable to perform as
       hoped. The Fundwas closed in2002 andthe project is beingrestructured.


   0   Direct funding for specijic EE projects. While some demonstration effect could be
       expected from extending loans to some Bulgarian business entities for selected high
       impact EEprojects, this approach fails to address the broader systemic shortcoming: lack
       o f functioning EE finance market in the country. Therefore, this approach would not
       develop sustainableEE financing, let alonebringingabout apermanent market impact.


   0   BEEF as loanfacility only. This approachwas taken for the GEF-supported Romania EE
       Fund. This is justified if inadequate capital market liquidity is the key obstacle to EE
       financing. However, the Project Team concluded--in agreement with Bulgarian
       stakeholders, including commercial banks contacted under initial market sounding--that
       the loan window should be complemented by a guarantee component in view of weak
       client and project credit profiles o f EE investments as perceived by the banks. Several
       major banks'2 signaled a strong preference for a specific risk management tool to allow
       EEprojects to be funded that otherwise might not be funded because of credit concerns.
       In fact, it is expected that with prospective improvements in banking liquidity, the
       demandfor BEEF support will increasingly shift infavor ofthe guarantees, which have a
       higher finance leveraging impact than loans.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

The GOB undertook to co-financing BEEF's seed capital in the amount of BGN 3.0 million
(USSl.8 equivalent). Prior to negotiations, the Bankreceived satisfactory documentary evidence
that on December 15, 2004 MEER transferred BGN 3.0 million to BEEF's account opened at
Biochim Commercial Bank.

In accordance with the indicative project financing plan (see table above), a total of US$5.50
million in donor support is being sought in contributions to BEEF's seed capital. Additionally,
small TA (US$0.25 million equivalent) i s expected from EUPHARE to support capacity

building and training activities to be defined in detail. As not all co-financing resources are
needed at project start-up (when the portfolio i s relatively small), some will be raised later as
BEEF's project portfolio builds up. The financing partnerships will be structured as parallel
financing, with each donor concluding a separate contribution agreement with the responsible
agency of the GOB for BEEF, the Ministry o f Energy and Energy Resources (MEER), which i s
in charge of coordinating the partnership arrangements. The nature of these agreements is
expected to vary fiom donor to donor. The Government of Austria undertook to contribute EUR
1.5 million (about US$1.8 million) ingrant to BEEF's seed capital.

Since GEF funds and co-financiers' funds will not be commingled, procurement and
disbursements under the project will not be influenced by the specific co-financing
arrangements. Some bilateral donors may require that their resources in the Fund be used for
self-standing projects.

The project is closely coordinated with other major development partners (UNDP, USAID,
EBRD, EUBHARE)involved inadvancingthe EE agendainBulgaria. The primary aim of the
coordination is to exchange information and to avoid the duplicationo f donor efforts. A limited
indicative pipeline o f EE projects developed under UNDP-GEF Gabrovo pilot project has been
shared with the project team to inform o f the key performance characteristics o f an illustrative
subset of "initial years" municipal EE portfolio. UNDP i s developing a proposal for a Bulgaria
GEF project focusing on EE-awareness and capacity buildingto develop bankable EE projects,
including those for potential BEEF financing. This UNDP operation needs to be closely
coordinated with the TA component of the subject project. Close working relation has already
been established with the BulgarianNGO, EnEffect, which is the proposed implementingagency
for the UNDP project. Close collaboration was established with the USAIDBulgariaMunicipal
EEProgram under which a strong pipeline(inexcess o fUS$l0 million) was developed. A part
of this pipeline is expected to be eligible for loan financing or partial credit guarantees under
BEEF. There have been regular information exchanges with the EBRDunder its ongoing EE
credit line project. EUPHARE is part o f the project financing plan under the T A component.
Looking ahead, the Bank intends to propose a formalized coordination betweenthe major donors
concerned inthe framework ofsemi-annual donor coordination meetings.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

2.1. Governancestructure of BEEF

The project beneficiary is the Bulgaria Energy Efficiency Fund which was established on
November 5, 2004, under public-private partnershippursuant to the EE Act (chapter 4, section
1). BEEF is an independent legal entity specialized in financing EE investments on a
commercial basis. The recipient o f the GEF grant on behalf o f the GOB will be MEER with
which the World Bank concludes a Grant Agreement. The final grant beneficiary will be BEEF
under a Subsidiary Grant Agreement withMEER and a Project Agreement with the Bank. Duly
executed Subsidiary Grant Agreement is a condition for grant effectiveness. Details of the
govemance structure, including appointment and compensation arrangements for BEEF staff and
the Management Board(MB), are includedinBEEF's Legal Statute (LS) and Operations Manual
(OM) [both are in the Project File]. A key design principle was to keep BEEF simple and



                                                15

flexible, avoiding complex procedures and structure.       The O M contains a set o f standard
operating policies and procedures for BEEF. Adoption by BEEF (MB) o f an O M acceptable to
the Bank is a condition of disbursement through BEEF. BEEF should carry out the project in
                 the OM. The LS and the M shall not be amended wi out prior concurrence
o fthe Bank.

The followingkey features are included inthe L S and OM:

Management Board. BEEF is governed by a MB, which determines, in association with the
key donors, BEEF's general strategy andpolicies, decides by majority vote on the proposals for
project financing/guarantees, appoints the Fund Manager (FM), approves BEEF's annual
operational budget, and oversees all BEEF operations. The Board consists of seven members
from the public and private sectors as follows: (i) representatives appointed by the Minister
                                                    two
o f MEER (one from the EEA); (ii) representative appointed by the Minister of Environment
                                     a
and Water; and (iii) representatives of the private sector with good reputation and solid
                       four
financial background and skills in EE. The private sector members were selected from
concerned stakeholders in a special meeting convened by the Chair of the Board pursuant to the
EEAct andthe LS.

The appointed representative of MEER i s the first Chair of the MB, a mandate that he/she shall
hold for two years. The Chair shall have good reputation, strong management skills and a basic
understanding of EE finance. Upon expiry o f the first Chair's mandate, the members o f the
Board shall elect a new Chair from amongst the members of the Board for one year. The tenure
of the members o f the Board is two years. All appointments, including the Chair, are subject to
prior consultation with the Bank. The first Chairman was appointed on September 1, 2004,
following prior consultation with the Bank. The MB was constituted on November 12, 2004,
after proper consultation with the Bank.

Fund Manager.       The day-to-day activity o f BEEF is administered by a professional FM
appointed by the Board following a competitive selection process in compliance with Bank
procurement rules. Appointment o f the FM i s subject to "no objection" from the Bank, which
will finance the salaries of Fundstaff inthe first five years when the Fundis not yet financially
self-sufficient.

The FM consists o f a small core team o f technical and financial experts in EE project
development and finance as well as limited technical support staff. The FM team i s headed by
the Executive Director who representsBEEF and interacts directly with the Board. The FMwill
need to outsource some technical and financial services to consultants to minimize overhead
costs. The FMis engagedunder a five-year performance contract, which is subject to review and
negotiations after two years, and may be extended beyond five years if required, and subject to
successful performance. The FM should be incentivized to be proactive in identifymg high
volumes of successful projects and helping applicants improve the quality o f their proposals.
    e FMremuneration includes a retainer fee, deal origination (or closing) fee and a success fee.
The retainer fee is partly fixed and partly depends on performance; it will be paid from the TA
component during the first four years and thereafter from the Fund's income.            The deal
originatiodclosing fee will be paid by borrowers in line with prevailing market norms and



                                                16

practices in Bulgaria. The success fee will be paid from revenues o f the Fundat the end of the
contract period. The performance-based retainer fee includes incentives for expanding the client
base of the Fund, while at the same time ensuring that defaults are minimized. After year 5,
there i s an option for BEEF to negotiate an additional three-year contract. Appointment o f the
FMunderterms satisfactoryto the Bank is acondition granteffectiveness.

It is expected that BEEF will administer GEF funds for about 15 years.13 According to the
financial model developed for the project, this implementation time is sufficient to demonstrate
successful operation. Thereafter, the private financial sector can fully take over funding for EE
on a sustainable basis (for details o f the proposed GEF exit strategy, see section C.4.3 below).
The World Bankproject implementation periodWill last five years, duringwhich GEF funds will
have been fully disbursed. After World Bank project closure, MEER will conduct appropriate
monitoring and oversight of BEEF'S performance as provided under the Subsidiary Grant
Agreement.




l3Fifteen years is an indicative time frame. An earlier closure may be feasible, especially if BEEF achieves a
sustainable market impact well before 15 years.

2.2. ClientRelationship

Reflecting international good practice, BEEF will be designed as a one-stop shop and client-
friendly entity. Accordingly, its internal procedures will have to be streamlined, in order to
provide efficient services in project development and financing.             The two-tier governance
structure should work as smoothly as possible. The Executive Director o f the FM team is the
public face o fBEEF for the clients (subproject sponsors) and co-financing partners.

During project preparation, a number of Bulgarian commercial banks were contacted to inform
them of the new business opportunities under the proposedproject andto gauge their interest in
working with BEEFas co-financing partner^.'^ The banks indicated a strong desire to cooperate
with the Fund. BEEF is expected to conclude General Framework Agreements (GFA) with
selected financial institutions. The GFA would include guidelines on project eligibility, financial
products offered, feasibility and credit risk assessment procedures between the financing
partners, project approval, reporting and monitoring. Specific provisions for each project are to
be defined inthe individual transaction agreements. The GFA may provide clauses enabling the
client to sign only one contract andhavingto deal only with one provider of financial services.

Inorder to informclients onservicesprovidedbyBEEF,a coherent communication strategywill
be developed and implementedwithin six months after the selection o f the FM. As part of the
strategy, a Web site for BEEFpromotion will be put inplace to provide information to potential
clients to determine whether they are eligible for BEEF'S financial services. Through this
medium and other more traditional means such as workshops and mass media, the potential
clients and financing partners will be informed on the benefits of EE investments, eligibility
criteria for projects, loadguarantee conditions (interest rate/guarantee fee, repayment time
schedule, collateral, environmental and monitoring requirements), BEEF procedures for project
development support (energy audit, business plan preparation, training opportunities, etc.) and
loadguarantee approval.

Selectedpartners such as professional and employers associations, ESCOs andbusiness advisory
centers will be contacted and informed about BEEF services. Duringthe initial implementation
period o f the project, these stakeholders and partners will be exposed, through workshops and
seminars, to BEEF objectives and procedures so as to develop proposals targeted at the
requirements of the Fund. The FMwill also work with appropriate partners inthe development
o f innovative financing techniques (e.g., pooling o f small projects) to provide financing for less
creditworthy clients. For the first projects, the Fund may cover the total cost of developing
bankable project proposals, thereafter however the clients will have to contribute to the
development, with their share o fthe cost rolled into the financing arrangements.




l4 The banks are as follows: United Bulgarian Bank, Bulbank, Raiffeisenbank, HVB Biochim, OTP/DSK, SG
Expressbank, Post Bank. For more details, see the report "Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund: Co-financing
Proposal" inthe Project File.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomeshesults

                  d evaluation system will be put in place to assess the project's effectiveness
during implementationand after the project is completed. A results monitoring framework (see
Annex 3 for details) was set up focusing on the global development objective to be achieved and
the intermediate andor final results expected from implementing each individual project
component. The framework includes specific and monitorable performance indicators such as
the number of ESCOs and financial institutions entering the EE market, EE investments
leveraged by BEEF and the associated GHG emission reduction, and financial sustainability of
BEEF.

Inthe early years, itis expectedthat anumber ofimplementation issueswill arisethat needto be
addressed quickly. Initial project proposals will test the robustness o f the BEEFprocedures and
the FM's capacity to follow them. Therefore, intensive efforts must be made to closely monitor
and assess these initial transactions andto adjust procedures as requiredand use early successes
to further market the Fund. BEEF'Scredibility will depend on its ability to generate successful
projects, which then should be widely disseminated.

Project monitoring and evaluation activities will be carried out under the responsibility ofBEEF,
which will submit semi-annual project reports to the Bank. A simple management information
system for project monitoring and evaluation will be developedby the FM, covering, inter alia,
the projectpipeline, amount invested, loans not requiringguarantees, cost-sharing with financing
partners, cost-effectiveness ofprojects, defaults, fund reflows, energy saved and GHGreduction.

BEEF shall review with the Bank all proposals considered for sub-loan financing andPCGs and
receive the approval of the Bank prior to its entering into financing agreements inits first year o f
operation.

Not later than December 31 o f each year during project execution, commencing on December
31, 2005, BEEF shall furnish to the Bank and MEER a draR annual business plan and
incorporate the Bank's recommendations prior to submitting it to the Management Board for
approval.     ,



Byno later than October 31o f eachyear, commencingon October 31, 2005, until completion of
the project, BEEF shall furnish to the Bank for its approval a draft annual budget and adopt the
agreedbudget prior to December 31o fthat respective year.

BEEFwill be required to continue reportingperformance to the GOB after World Bank project
closure. Over time, monitoring/evaluation reports should cover the broader market impact and
indicators tracking the development of a sustainable national EE market based on periodic
market surveys.

A significant Bank supervision effort will be required, particularly during the first two-three
years when BEEF will establish itself and its operations and coordination with the co-financier
will be developed. It is expected that about 15 staff-weeks of effort each year for the first three
years and about 10 staff-weeks each year thereafter will be required for supervision by the Bank.



                                                 19

A mid-term review will be carried out to assess overall project progress. This review will
include an in-depthassessment of the institutionaland financial sustainability o f BEEF, its initial
impact on the broader EE sector and the lessons learnt. Based on the outcome o f the mid-term
review, the Bank will advise BEEF and the GOB to take measures to ensure that the project is
successfully completed.

4. SustainabilityandReplicability       1




4.1. Sustainability

The project is expected to yield sustainable EE and global environmental benefits through: (i)
building capacity for EE in the financial and energy services sectors; (ii)establishing and
demonstrating the financial profitability o f EE investments; and (iii)
                                                                     catalyzing through explicit
business partnerships substantial commercial financing for EE projects. The project concept is
basedon the principlesof commercially viable operation. After the initial GEF capitalization of
the Fund is expensed, its further operation will be supported through repayments by the project
borrowers.

The overarching objective of BEEFis to builda sustainedmarket-basedcapacity to develop and
finance EE operations on commercial terms. Therefore, the long-term successo f BEEF is linked
to the emergence of a competitive, self-sustainable national EE market in Bulgaria. This market
is expected to grow and mature even when BEEF'Sguarantee and loan facilities are no longer
available to support new transactions. BEEF will have fulfilled its role o f introducing financial
institutions to a sizable untapped business potential and helping both ESCOs and financial
institutions to develop their capacity to exploit that potential.

The initial disproportionately large benefits expected from the project in terms o f low cost of
COz emission reduction may not be possible to sustain for an extended period o f time as the
availability o f cheap carbon reductions should gradually decline over time. However, this will
occur only inasmuch as the available "early win" possibilities for GHG reductions are
successfully utilized.

4.2. DomesticScale-up Strategy and Replicability

Duringthe first five years (the World Bank project period), the value of BEEF-facilitated EE
investments is estimated at US$48 million, which is a fraction of the overall EE market in
Bulgaria, The potential for national scale-up after World Bank project closure is considerable
given the large value (US260 million) EE investments with a payback period o f up to three
years identified but unrealized under the government's medium term National Energy Saving
Action Plan. Scale-up activities are integral part of the project and include specifically the
following: (i)after Bank project closure, BEEF will administer on a revolving basis the GEF
funds for additional ten years under GOB oversight (duringthis period about US$146million of
additional EE investments are expected to be mobilized by BEEF); (ii)       intensive nationwide
marketing of Fund products to targeted clients and offering services to build broad-based
capacity for development and packaging o f bankable EE projects; (iii)active information
dissemination by BEEF about successful EE projects, highlighting financial benefits for



                                                  20

subproject sponsors and commercial co-financing partners; (iv) continued Bank dialogue with
the GOB on fwther strengthening the enabling policy framework for economy-wide EE
implementation; and (v) Bank-initiated donor coordination with a view to synergize existing
efforts (e.g., between the proposed capacity building-focused UNDP project and the finance-
focused subject project), ensuring that they together lead to a sustainedmarket transformation.

With its focus on local financial markets and institutions, the project has a high potential for
cross-country replication. Most o f the transition economies face largely similar conditions,
including high energy intensity, vast scope for "win-win" EE projects due to past under-
investment and wasteful consumption patterns, and the severe financing gap constraining the
implementation ofviable EE investments.

4.3. GEF exit strategy

The ultimate exit strategy for GEF funds should dependon the success o f the project. The GOB,
BEEF and the Bank shall agree the specific exit strategy in year four or five of project
implementation. At that time, based on initial performance characteristics (deal flow, average
payback time, etc.) o f the early years portfolio, longer term projections o f BEEF'Sfinancial
performance will be morerobust, thus allowingto better estimate the amount o f funds remaining
inBEEFafter a 15-year period, theindicative life ofthe Fund. GEF fundswillbedisbursed over
a period of four years. After World Bank project closure inyear five, BEEF will administer the
funds for about ten more years under GOB (MEER) oversight. MEER and BEEF shall prepare
andreview with the Bank, not later than six months before the grant closing date, a planfor the
continued achievement o f the objectives of the project. The plan shall include an exist strategy
for the GEF funds remaininginBEEFuponits closure (inyear 15).

By the year four or five, much improved liquidity and increased financial institution entry into
the EE market are expected to reduce the demand for BEEF loans. The demand for credit
enhancement may also recede over the longer term as commercial financiers become more
familiar with EE projects and the actual default risk proves to be smaller than initially
~erceived.'~  At thisjuncture, onepossible exit strategyisto withdraw or sellthe "GEF shares" in
BEEF through a transparent process once a set o f criteria indicating satisfactory outcome have
been met, and for those funds to be used by the GOB for mutually agreed GHG mitigation
projects that are inline with the GEF global objectives.

Ifmonitoringandevaluationreportsindicatethattheprogramobjectivesarenotbeingmet
andor BEEF i s not likely to reach self-financing by 2010, the following scenarios could be
considered: (i)  ifthere arereasonableprospectsofreachingself-financing inthe subsequent two-
three years, then explore other sources o f funding for meeting Fund operating costs, including
adjusting operating costs to match the available resources; and (ii)          close the project earlier than
scheduled, especially if there is no strong possibility that the program objectives can be met


 ''Hungary's experience shows the gap between real versus perceived risk by financial institutions. In 1991-2000,
the Hungarian EE Credit Fund (HEECP) made more than 450 loans and only ten borrowers defaulted. Excellent
payment performance has been demonstrated also under HEECP (with total losses on the outstanding loans
guaranteed representing less than 2% o fthe total loanvalue guaranteed).

within a reasonable period of time with appropriate remedial measures. In this case, any
unutilized GEF              s will be returned to GEF at the close of the project, and the funds recovered
                            allowed to be utilized for other GHG mitigation activities by GOB in
                             BankandGEF.

5. Critical risks and possiblecontroversial aspects

BEEF will face several challenges in establishing itself as a self-sustaining commercial vehicle
for EE financing and inachieving a broad-basedmarket impact inthe longrun. Recognizing the
existence of these risks, the project design incorporates corresponding mitigation measures to
managethese risks to the extent possible. Weighing all key risk factors, the project was given an
overall ratingo f "substantial risk."

The following general good practice risk management tools were applied: (i)                        Flexibility: BEEF
i s designed with adequate built-in flexibility to adjust internal procedures, implementation
capacity, business strategy, financial products offered, targeted clients and business partners to
changing conditions; (ii)         Risk sharing: BEEF's design incorporates the principle o f sharing risks
among all project partners (i.e., commercial lenders, ESCOs, equipment suppliers, project
sponsors) to avoid moral hazard, based on comparative advantages of the participants (i.e.,
technical risks to ESCOs, credit risks to b                s, equipment performance risks to suppliers,
operating risks to end-users); and (iii)        Incentives: recognizing that an effective proactive FM i s
key to success, BEEF includes a competitive remuneration package with incentives for
successfulperformance.

The main risk factors and the propose mitigation measures are outlined below. The deal flow
merits special attention. Basedon international experience, havinga sufficient deal flow is a key
challenge for the proposed project. To address this risk, a strong pipeline o f finance-ready
projects needs to be built early on. Therefore, both the GEF project preparation grant (which
includes pipeline development as a stand-alone task) and the T A component o f the project were
designedto support activities ininitial pipeline development.

APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses
(for more details, see Annex 9 andAnnex 15)

Initial Years Project Pipeline. Inorder to gauge the market potential for EE projects that can
be supported by BEEF inthe early years, a preliminary market assessment was carried out and
an indicative project portfolio was developed based on technical and financial feasibility
evaluation. The portfolio includes 44 projects with a total investment cost o f about US$29
million, covering a range o f economic sectors.

The pipeline shows favorable financial and environmental characteristics based on high
operatingcost savings fiom the EEinvestments. The key summary indicators are as follows:


    0   Average simplepayback time: 2.9 years
    0   Financial InternalRate o fReturn: 33%
    0   Annual financial savings: about US$10million

Projected Performance of BEEF. To estimate the potential impact o f BEEF on EE
investments and the resulting GHG reduction impact, a financial model was developed. BEEF
will work in a revolvingmode, meaningthat loan repayments (including interest) are reinvested
into new loans and guarantees. Since the guarantee facility will cover typically about 50% of a
commercial loan, the amount o f financial resourcesmobilizedbyit would be twice the amount of
the guarantee. The Fund is expected to attract additional co-financing in the form o f equity
contributions (minimum 10% o f total investment costs) from the sub-project borrowers and non-
guaranteed co-financing from commercial banks. Based on these assumptions, projections
indicate that inthe first five years, BEEFwould mobilize co-financing inthe amount of US$39.5
million, bringing the total available financing to US$47.8 million (excluding TA).          This
corresponds to a leveraging ratio o f 4.8. However, the leveraging impact o f the GEF funds can
be better evaluated over a 15-year period (BEEF'Sindicative lifetime) which includes the effect
of cash re-flows from lending and guarantee operations. With the repeated revolution o f funds,
the total financing mobilized i s forecast to reach US$193.6 million over 15 years, corresponding
to a leveraging ratio o f 19.

Asset Value of BEEF. The initial asset value o f BEEF is estimated at US$17.55 million. The
value o f this asset can rise ifthe income from BEEF operations (comprised o f interest income of
the revolving loan facility, guarantee fees and interest eamed on reserve hnds in the guarantee
facility) is greater than the costs of Fund administration and project defaults. The final year
(year 15) Net Asset Value (NAV) o f BEEF is projected to grow to US$21.1 million under the
base case scenario. BEEFis expectedto achieve financial self-sufficiency by 2010.

Sensitivity Analysis. Scenarios were run to test the robustness o f the Fund's performance and
identifythe key impact variables. The sensitivity analysiswas performed for the aggregatevalue
of Fundtransactions and the NAV with respect to the following variables: credit spread, default
rate, guarantee fee and deal flow. The results suggest that both the cumulative volume o f BEEF
transactions and the NAV are sufficiently robust. The credit spread is a relatively sensitive
variable, but even assuming a 40% decrease in its level relative to the base case value, the 15-
year cumulative value o f BEEF transactions, at US$95 million, is six times higher the Fund's
initial capitalization (US$15.8 million), standing only 10% lower than the base case. Regarding




                                                  26

the NAVYeven under a 40% decrease in the credit spread, at US$17.6 million, it i s larger than
the Fund's initial capitalization.

One o f the main risk factors is the potential failure to fully utilize its assets for lack o f high
quality bankable projects andor insufficient attractivenesso f the terms and conditions offeredby
the Fund. The Fundrequires a large enough deal flow to generate sufficient revenues to cover
overhead and operating costs as well as to generate sufficient momentum to ensure sustainability
inthe EE lending market. A strong initial deal flow considerably improves Fundperformance
andquickens sustainability, thus devoting sufficient TA to buildinga strong pipeline of finance-
ready projects early on i s of great importance. Equally important i s to market intensively the
Fundproducts to targeted clients andoffer help inthepackagingofbankable projects.

2. Technical

N/A

3. Fiduciary

FinancialManagement

A review was undertaken to determine whether the financial management arrangements for the
project are acceptableto the Bank.

A Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) for Bulgaria was carried out in2003.
The CFAA report concludes that Bulgaria has a well developed-system and structure of public
financial management that relies heavily on informationtechnology (such as in the area o f cash
management), and has independent external audits and parliamentary oversight committees.
Sound legislation exists to prepare, implement and monitor the state budget. A major remaining
issue, from the perspective of usinggovernment financial management systems inBank-financed
projects, is the implementation o f a single unified Financial Management Information System,
which is currently in progress. Given the current state o f public financial management in
Bulgaria, the CFAA assesses both the global fiduciary risk to the government and the overall
fiduciary risk to Bankproject funds as low.

For an initial period (prior to BEEF's becoming operational and having in place acceptable
financial management arrangements), the disbursement and financial management arrangements
of GEF funds inrelationto the TA component will be carried out bythe FinancialDepartment of
MEER. Based on the results o f financial management assessment, the MEER has adequate
financial management arrangements in place to manage the upfront expenditures in relation to
the establishment of BEEF. Accordingly, it has been concluded that the interim financial
management arrangements of the project are acceptable to the Bank and satisfy the Bank's
minimumfinancial managementrequirements for the management ofTA component only.

Once BEEFbecomes operational with adequate financial management arrangements inplace, it
will assume responsibility for the implementation of the TA component.                Prior to any
disbursement for the T A and the two other project components, BEEF's Financial Management



                                               27

System (FMS) will need to be assessed as satisfactory to the Bank. A FMS satisfactory to the
Bank i s a condition of disbursementthrough BEEF.

4. Social

No negative social impact is anticipated to result from the project. The project is expected to
facilitate the emergence and growth of a robust national EE industry. By investing in energy
saving measures private sector SMEs will be able to reduce their operating costs and improve
competitiveness in domestic and extemal markets. Thus, the population will benefit through
increase in employment. EE projects in the municipal and commercial sectors are expected to
make basic public services more affordable and better quality, improving the comfort o f the
general population. Demand-side EE investments inthe residential sector may bring significant
social benefits by mitigating the impact of steep increases in residential energy prices while
improving the comfort level.I6               The general population will benefit from the positive
environmental impacts of the project. Overall, higher end-use efficiency creates a positive link
between environmental and social outcomes.

Key project stakeholder groups are as follows: (i) mostly inthe industrial and the service
                                                              SMEs
sector, municipalities and housing cooperatives/associations as potential subproject clients
(project sponsors); (ii)equipmenvmaterials manufacturers, building design and retrofit
contractors, ESCOs and EE consultancies as business partners; (iii)                 companies in the financial
sector, particularly banks, mortgage and leasing companies as co-financiers; and (iv) local
environmental andEE advocacy groups andNGOs.

Duringproject preparation, most of these stakeholderswere consulted to seek their views on the
objectives and design of BEEF and to generate interest inthe facility. InJune 2002, the project
concept was presented to the NGO community ina special workshop. Further outreach actions,
including an investors' workshop, are planned.                       Broad-based participation and public
involvement are incorporated in the project design. Organized outreach and public information
campaigns are includedinthe TA component. Primarily, the FundManager will be incharge of
these activities. In addition, during the EE market assessment, top management and energy
managers o f companies in the industrial, service and municipal sectors as well ESCOs were
engaged with the purpose of both information dissemination and initial project pipeline
development. (Themarket assessment reports are inthe Project File.)

5. Environment

The environmental impacts o f the proposed project are related to the EE investments supported
byBEEF. No significant negative environmental impacts will be causedbythe project, which is
specifically designed to mitigate GHG emissions through energy savings. Only those projects
are eligible for BEEF support for which at least half o f the financial benefits come from
measurable energy savings. The actually achieved energy saving and GHG emission reduction



l6The share o f energy utilities inthe expenditure budget of the average Bulgarianhousehold stood at 12% inrecent
years and is expected to rise substantially under the ongoing tariff-rebalancing program o f the GOB. This share is
muchhigher for the poor (e.g., more than one-third of pensioners' income is spent on energy bills inwinter months).


                                                        28

will be systematically monitored by BEEF'S MB and the Bank.                 Competitively selected
independent experts will be engaged to verify the reported energy savings and GHG data for
each subproject on an annual basis. This requirement is included in the Operations Manual
(OM).

Likely subproject candidates are: street lighting improvements, installation of heat exchangers
and automatic temperature control and metering in district heating systems, improved thermal
insulation o f buildings, replacement o f network pipes, fuel switching, power factor correction,
reconstruction o f boilers, installation o f small co-generation units, economizers, steam traps and
fuel switching. Typically, the subprojects are expected to be relatively small. With investment
costs generally not higher than US$1 million, none o f them will have any adverse large-scale,
significant and/or irreversible environmental impacts.

The Bank's environmental category assigned to the project is "Financial Intermediary" (FI). In
an FIproject, specific subprojects are identifiedduring implementation and the responsibilityfor
environmental due diligence of subprojects lies with the FI, in this case, BEEF. The OM
includes an Environmental Chapter describing the process for environmental assessment o f the
subprojects.

As described in the Environmental Chapter, compliance with Bulgarian environmental law,
policies and procedures will be, in most cases, a necessary and sufficient condition for the
Bank's endorsemento f financing of subprojects underBEEF. Inrecent years, Bulgariahasmade
considerable progress in adapting its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system to
international norms.     According to the European Commission's 2003 Regular Report on
Bulgaria 's Progress Towards Accession, Bulgaria has attained a good degree o f legislative
alignment with the EUEnvironmental Directives, and pre-accession negotiations on Chapter 22
(environment) were closed. Provisions of the EU Directive on EIA, which have binding and
mandatory power, were found compatible with those under the Bank's OP 4.01. Emissions will
be within limits set byBulgarianlaw.

Environmental Assessment Process. The Fund Manager o f BEEF will include at least one
staff q~alified'~to deal with the EIA and environmental management aspects o f the subprojects
supported by BEEF. Under the Environmental Chapter, every subproject proposal should
contain a questionnaire completed by the project sponsor to determine the applicable course of
action inaccordancewith the table below.

BEEFwill not finance subprojects which fall within the scopeofAnnex 1o fthe BulgarianEPA,
which are considered comparable to the Bank's Category A projects. Further details are inthe
Environmental Chapter o fthe OM disclosed at InfoShop@worldbank.org.

There are two principal situations where exceptions may have to bemade from the procedure
described above. First, when the Bank determines that the Bank's Category B i s appropriate to a
given subproject and disagreeswith the decision o fthe Bulgarian authorities to exempt the

                        BULGARIA:ENERGYEFFICIENCYPROJECT

1. Countryand Sector Context

Compared with the vast majority of the European countries, Bulgaria is an outlier in terms of
energy intensity of its economy (see table below). At 0.38 ton of oil equivalent per thousand
US$ of GDP (at the Purchase Power Parityexchange rate), the country's energy intensity is more
than twice the average value for the European Union. It also exceeds by a considerable margin
the energy intensity o f the transition economies in Europe. The extreme energy inefficiency is
due in part to specific circumstances of Bulgaria, including over-stimulated electricity demand
because o f historically heavy reliance on grossly underpriced electricity for heating, the virtual
lack of low-pressure natural gas market and delays in modernizing the district heating systems.
Consumption of electricity is particularly wasteful. In 2001, Bulgaria's electricity intensity of
GDPwas seven times higher thanthe OECD average, four times higher thanthat ofHungaryand
Turkey, and 60% higher than that ofRomania.

Nom-OECD Countries 2000-2001, OECD, Paris, 2003; 2003 World Development Indicators, World Bank,
Washington, 2003.

Mirroring the large energy inefficiency, the environmental impact of Bulgaria's economy is
disproportionately high. In terms of COZemissions per unit of GDP, Bulgaria is surpassed only
by Russia andUkraine amongthe European transition economies. Inefficient energy utilization



                                                   32

i s one o f the reasons for the existence o f environmental "hot spots" inthe country (e.g., Devnya,
Maritsa-Iztok, Galabovo-Radnevoya) where ambient air quality often does not meet national and
World HealthOrganization standards.

Because o f the current low efficiency base, Bulgaria has a vast potential to achieve significant
EEgains ina cost-effective manner. The savingpotential is as highas 50% for existingbuilding
stock, 40% for district .heating and 30% for industry. The industrial sector accounts for more
than halfofthe savings potential. The Government's National Energy Saving Program to 2010
identified a vast potential for energy saving and specified a large number of specific EE
programs andmeasures for the various end-use sectorswith combined energy savings amounting
to 1.4 million tons o f oil equivalent per year (or about 15% of total final energy consumption)
and COz emissions reduction of 5.6 million tons per year. The most promising low-cost energy
saving projects (with payback time o f less than 3 years) were included in the medium-term
National Energy Saving Action Plan (2001-20031, but very few projects have actually been
carried out. During2001-2003, the commercially financed EE investments amounted to US$13
million, which i s only 5% of the annual requirements for EE investments included in the
National Energy Saving Program to 2010. This discrepancy i s a good indicator o f the large size
ofthe EEfinance gap inBulgaria.

2. Barriers toEnergy Eflciency

Albeit opportunities for "win-win" projects (i.e., ones bringing environmental benefits and
adequate sufficient financial returns) are abundant given the disproportionately large scope for
EE improvements, Bulgaria's EEmarket is still underdeveloped, failing to produce the needed
volume of investment capital. The most serious barriers to the uptake o f commercial EE finance
are:

Difficult    access to finance.     Commercial bank intermediation relative to the size of the
Bulgarian economy is low by any standard, partly as a lingeringconsequenceofthe collapse of
the bankingsystem duringthe severe economic and financial crisis of 1996-1997. The corporate
sector's access to credit i s low by international standards and i s still below the level reached
before the 1996-1997 bankingcrisis. Commercial banks have managed risks by limitinglending
volume, demanding high collateralization (200% and higher), charging highinterest rates (14%-
 18%, despite inflation being contained lately at 4%), focusing on short-term lending (with loan
maturities o f 1-2 years) and investinginlow-risk government securities. Loans dependprimarily
on collateral and less so on proven cash flows. Weak competition allows banks to keep credit
low while maintaining high margins. Instead o f turning to bank borrowing, SMEs in Bulgaria
rely primarilyon cash. The loanportfolio o fbanks is still simple, consisting largely of working
capital loans with short maturities and available mostly to well-established firms. The extreme
inefficiency of the Bulgarianjudicial system makes recovery of debt or seizure o f collateral a
long-winded process. The perceived high credit risk hurts especially strongly the SMEs, multi-
family housing, municipalities, hospitals and other similar energy consumers, which may not
have a significant credit history or lack suitable collateral values associatedwith EEprojects.

Perception of high risk for EE projects. InBulgaria, there is a considerable gap between the
real and perceived risk by banks with respect to EE projects. Commercial banks are generally



                                                   33

  not familiar with commercial and technical issues involved inEE projects and perceive the risks
  and transaction costs of EE projects as too high. Benefits of these projects are often seen as
  "environmental" and "social" and there is skepticism about their financial profitability. The staff
  inmany financial institutions has no experience indealing with EE investments whose benefits
  are largely intangible (operating cost savings), favoring instead the more familiar energy supply
  projects that yield tangible output andrevenue increases. Another barrier to the financing o f EE
  projects is their generally small size relative to energy supply projects with which they often
  must compete for financing. Because o f the proportionally higher transaction costs, a small EE
  project may be no interest to banks or it must have a higher rate o f return for the size o f the
  returnto be highenough for the financial institutionto outweigh the transaction costs. Clearly, a
  proventrack record o f commercially profitableEE projects i s required to convince lenders that a
  number o f risks are only perceived and can be managed, and that the initial costs o f getting into
   this specializedbusinessare worth incurring or can be partially avoided due to prior experience.

  Weak capacity to develop bankable EE projects. The combination o f financial and technical
   skills needed for the preparation of sound EE business plans are largely missing in Bulgaria.
   Typically there is weak commercial orientation among technical staff and a widespread lack of
   understanding o f financial packaging o f projects and isolation from financial institutions. An
   organization with a limited history o f commercial borrowing will almost inevitably also have
   limited experience in developing compelling business plans.           SMEs are too small to have
   specialist staff experienced inbusiness planpreparation. A poorly constructed business plan is a
   frequent causeo f an otherwise goodproject beingrejectedby financial institutions.

   Lack of innovative EE financing.            Innovative financing, such as energy performance
   contracting, i s hardly used inBulgaria albeit it canbe effectiveinattracting the necessarycapital,
   often for projects that are deemed too small or risky for financial institutions. This may require
   "project pooling'' by a third party where projects that are individually too small to justify an
   energy performance contracting arrangement are bundled to make a financially viable package.
   However, there is no mature and competitive energy service industry in Bulgaria, with most of
   the private ESCOs having small operations and balance sheets. They tend to suffer from
   insufficient credibility and trust by both the energy users and the financial institutions that they
   can deliver the promised energy/financial savings.     There i s a financing vicious circle, whereby
   the low credibility and reputation of small ESCOs prevent them from attracting financing
   partners, let alone receiving competitive financing terms from commercial banks. Modem
   project-finance concepts (e.g.,     off-balance sheet financing,      equipment leasing) are not
   widespread. This results in typically higher cost o f capital and in the inability to hedge the
   uncertainty o f energy savings. The availability o f credit guarantees for performance contracting
   could be a factor inreducingthe credit risk profile o f energy performance contracts andhence in
   assisting suchprojects to have access to commercial lending at market interest rates.

   Information gap. Information on EE technologies, effectiveness o f EE measures, project
   development and financing techniques is largely lacking in Bulgaria, partly because o f the lack
   of strong institutionalfocal point within the government for effective informationdissemination,
   including "good practices.''    The lack of user-friendly information to consumers, the energy
.  service sector and the financial institutions means that many cost-effective opportunities for EE
   investments are missed.



                                                     34

Weak financial incentives for end-users. In Bulgaria, energy consumption has long been
subsidized, with end-user prices kept below full cost-recovery levels for some consumer groups.
This has encouraged inefficient or downright wasteful consumption patterns.

The proposed project is addressing these barriers through (i)  mobilizing the resources of local
commercial banks and other private financiers by removing actual and perceived barriers to EE
investments; and (ii)
                    buildingcapacity for EEproject development andfinancing techniques.

                       BULGARIA: ENERGYEFFICIENCY PROJECT


1. Bank-supported

The Word Bankhasbeen involvedinthe energysector inBulgariathrough several activities, and
the design o fBEEFhasbenefited from the broadknowledge gained through these activities. The
key activities include:


       0    Energy and Environment Review (October 2002). This study highlighted the policy
            importance of promoting EE, especially in the context o f the associated
            environmental benefits, the EUenvironmental requirements andthe Kyoto Protocol.

       0    District Heating (DH) Strategy (August 2000). The Bank assisted in the preparation
            o f the govenunent strategy which includes significant policy (tariff adjustments,
            subsidy removal, disconnection policy, etc.) and demand-side measures (metering,
            etc.) to improvethe currentlylow EEperformance ofthe DHsector.

       0    Water Companies Modernizationand Restructuring Project (closed on December 31,
            2002). Through the DHcomponent ofthe loan, about 6,000 sub-stations (one-quarter
            o f the total national stock) were rehabilitated resulting in better demand-side
            managementand fuel savings.

       0    District Heating Project (under implementation). The rehabilitationand the demand-
            side management measures in Sofia and Pernik heating systems will result in
            substantial reduction innetwork heat losses and averagehouseholdheat consumption.
            There will be significant associatedenvironmental benefits.

       0    Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL, under implementation).               The energy
            component o f the PAL includes significant policy (including a thee-year tariff
            adjustment schedule for residential electricity and DH) and demand-side measures
            (under the DH component) yielding substantial energy savings. These and other
            energy sector reforms are expectedto reduce Bulgaria's energy intensity 15% by end-
            2005 comparedto the level at end-2001.

       0    Wood Residue to Energy Project (PCF project under implementation). The aims to
            reduce emissions o f GHG generated in Svilosa through (i)   substitution of coal with
            residual wood as a &el for power and heat generation; and (ii)   savings o f methane
            emissions from residual wood waste.


2. Other (non-Bank)

UNDP-implementedEE Program. The UNDP championedthe EEagendainBulgariathrough
the Gabrovo pilot project and subsequent development o f a network o f demonstration zones for
energy efficient municipalities that currently counts 39 municipalities and 6 regional municipal
associations. This network was created following an education project funded by the UNDP and
a small GEF grant.       The project has demonstrated the usefulness of EE awareness within
municipalities. Also, a number of business plans have been developed for bankable EE projects,


                                                36

focusing on street lighting and schools. Presently, the UNDP is planning a follow-on proposal
(UNDP/GEF Public-Private Partnerships for EE Project) to fhther strengthen local capacity to
develop and finance the bankable projects originally identified. Inthis context, UNDP-GEFhas
indicated that it would welcome the opportunity created by BEEF to finance these bankable
projects. In addition, UNDP-GEFwill engage with the Bank in discussions regardingthe TA
component o fthe proposedproject, especially conceming capacity building.

The SAVE I1 Study. The Study on the Implementation of a Widespread ETiergy Saving
Program in Bulgaria (2001) provided an in-depth review o f Bulgaria's energy conservation
opportunities and identified a vast potential for energy savings. A Study's long-term energy-
saving program include more than 80 EE measures in various end-use sectors with combined
energysavings o f 1.4 mtoe/year (or about 15% of total final energy consumption) and associated
COZ emissions reduction o f 5.6 million tons per year. The most promising low-cost energy
saving projects (with payback time of less than 3 years) were included inthe three-year (2001-
2003) National Enera Saving Action Plan. However, very few o f these projects (about 5%)
have materialized due to a lack o f financing.

USAID Municipal EE Program. The US-based company Electrotek Concepts developed
small-scale operations under the Program, which hasprovidedpartial credit guarantees (PCG) in
favor o f the United Bulgarian Bank (UBB) for small municipal EE projects. About two dozen
projects have been funded with an average payback time o f three years. Although the Program
has been successful in demonstrating the possibility o f commercial EE financing in Bulgaria, it
has failed to reach a critical mass for sustainability through developing a large number of
additional projects at the national level."       A major shortcoming has been the financing
monopoly o f UBB under the Program. The non-revolving nature o f the PCG facility has also
beenproblematic.

EBRD Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Credit Line. In March 2004, the EBRD
extended credit lines to participating Bulgarian banks for on-lending to the private sector
enterprisesfor industrialEE and small renewable energyprojects. EBRDfunds of up to EUR 50
million are complemented by the Kozloduy International Decommissioning and Support Fund
(KIDSF) grant funding to provide technical assistance for project development, promotion of
better energymanagement andprovision o fthe sub-borrowers with financial incentives (grant) to
undertakeEEinvestments.

IFC/GEF Hungary EE Co-FinancingProgram (HEECP). HEECP (launched in 1997) was
designed to overcome barriers to EE project finance and development via a PCG program to
share in' the credit risk o f EE undertaken by domestic financial institutions (FIs) and a TA
program to help prepare EEprojects and aid general EEmarket development. HEECP hasnow a
strong pipeline o f projects with an average project size o f US$250,000. HEECP has been
instrumental inestablishing active competition between Hungarianbanks to develop and market
EEproject financingproducts in order to capture shares of the new EE segment inthe financial

sector. The TA program is designed to be flexible and results-oriented responding to and
directly supporting the specific needs of the individual ESCOs and FIs which actually execute
the transactions supported by the facility. Because of the wide range of end-user sectors, niche
financial products have been developed under HEECP for EE financing for multi-family
housing, municipal street-lighting, district heating, ,industrial cogeneration and hospitals, with
financing offered both directly to end-users and to ESCOs. Another important lesson learnt
under HEECP is the streamlined credit approval process which minimizes transaction costs
associated with the FIs' participation. Building on the model successfully demonstrated under
HEECP, IFC is implementing a new PCG project with co-financing from GEF called
Commercializing EE Finance for five transition countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia,
Latvia andLithuania).

Romania EE Project (GEF). Insome respects, the BEEFproject is an application o f the same
project concept in a country with a relatively larger energy saving potential and a somewhat
stronger (but far fkom self-sustained) EE finance market to build on. Both projects involve a
revolving fund. Like inRomania (but unlike inHungary), inadequatebank liquiditycalls for the
inclusion o f a loan window in the design of BEEF for Bulgaria. However, in addition to loans,
BEEF will provide PCGs, thus considerably enhancing the contingent finance nature of the
project. The limitedexperience under the USAID Program and HEECP inHungary underscore
the need for a guarantee instrument in the current stage o f development o f Bulgaria's banking
sector characterized by highly risk-averse behavior. During initial market assessment, several
commercial banks indicated a strong preference for some form o f credit risk coverage before
shifting to straight loan financing o f EEprojects. BEEF'Smost salient improvement vis-&vis the
USAID Program i s the engagement of multiple commercial banks to actively compete with one
another for providing the best financial terms to the borrowers. This lesson is also drawn from
HEECP in Hungary. In addition, the Romania EE project has exposed the risk of adopting a
possibly inefficient remuneration package for the Fund Manager.            Initial implementation
experience argues for a smaller fixed fee and a higher perfonnance-based retainer.

3. General lessondaperiencefrom EEprojects worldwide

Experience from GEF's overall EE portfolio suggests that even in countries where the local
financial market has sufficient size and liquidity, consumers and investors may have limited
access to local FIs due to perceptions o f high risk, high transaction cost, lack o f institutional
infrastructure and project development capacity or lack o f awarenessregarding technologies and
their technical and financial performance characteristics. Supporting financial intermediaries
and providing risk-sharinginstruments to FIs (ie., credit risk guarantees and other contingent
finance instruments) can be cost-effective ways o f addressing these barriers.       Microcredit,
commercial loan guarantees for ESCOs and revolving loan fimds have all been successfully
demonstrated in completed GEF projects.         With the focus on local financial markets and
institutions, suchprojects have a highlikelihoodo f sustainability andreplicability.

Apart from the GEF, lessons learned from EE Fund experience worldwide highlight the
importance o f transparency of Fundmanagement procedures, avoidance o f political interference
and subsidized interest rates, the need to rely on existing market participants, portfolio
diversification, emphasis on projects with high rates o f retum, bundling o f small projects,

proactivity o f the Fund Manager, and integration of financial and technical expertise for the
development of a sound project portfolio. These and the earlier-noted lessons were reflected in
the project concept of BEEF and were largely incorporated inthe detailed design of the Fund's
Operations Manual.

                              Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                       BULGARIA:ENERGYEFFICIENCY PROJECT

Theprojectwill support the establishmentandinitial operationofthe BulgariaEnergyEfficiency
Fundas a commercially oriented finance facility under public-private partnership. As a market
facilitator, BEEF will combine technical project development capacity, financial structuring
capacity and market-based financing into one entity, thereby addressing both the current weak
capacity to develop bankable EE projects and the severe lack of financing for EE investments.
Specifically, GEF h d s inthe amount of US10 million will be used to (i)         provide seed capital
for BEEF; (ii)   defray initial set-up and operating costs until BEEF reaches financial self-
sufficiency; and (iii) partially defray initial costs o f EE capacity building (project development,
financial packaging, etc.).

Designed as a flexible, market demand-driven facility, BEEF would make available both loans
and partial credit guarantees for EE projects. At this time, Bulgaria needs these financial
products to addressboth liquidityand credit risk barriers to EE financing. Flexiblecombinations
of the two financing modes are possible: direct loans accompanied by co-financing from other
sources, including commercial banks, supported by a BEEF guarantee. The FM is expected to
make rational choices about the appropriate financing instruments based on specific project
circumstances, overall project portfolio management considerations, proper risk allocation
among all partners, and evolution o f the domestic financial market. Thus, BEEF'Sprogram
design should allow for procedures and financing mechanisms to be adjusted based on changing
market conditions, demands and early implementation experience. Inthis context, it is expected
that over time, with gradually improving capital market liquidity, the demandfor BEEF support
will shift infavor ofcredit enhancement (guarantees).

Initially, the Fundwould consist o fthree components:


     0   PartialCredit Guarantees: to share inthe credit risk o fEE finance transactions andto
         improve loanterms for subproject sponsors.

     0   Investment (Sub-loan) Financing: to co-finance bankable EEprojects on a commercial
         basis.

         Technical Assistance: to initially finance on a grant basis a portiono fEEproject
         development, capacity buildingand administration costs o fthe Fund.

Component I: Partial Credit Guarantees (indicative amount: US$31.12 million, of which
US$4.50 million from GEF). Most commercial financiers in Bulgaria are reluctant to finance
EE transactions due to their unfamiliaritywith such projects and perceived weak client/project
credit profiles. This facility (the Guarantee Account [GA]) will be used for credit enhancement
purposes to share inthe credit risk o f EE finance transactions up to 70% o f the outstanding loan
principal o f the financial institution involved. A competitively priced guarantee fee would be
charged based on the risk level, with higher risk projects being charged higher fees. Minimum
10%of the total project costsmustbeborne bythe sub-project sponsors.




                                                  44

BEEF will act as credit guarantor, issuing PCGs based on predefined criteria and appraisal
methods included in the Operations Manual. The individual guarantee commitments shall not
exceed the equivalent o f US$500,000 (the guarantee liability limit). The GA will be held in a
competitively selected commercial bank. The GA will earn income through interest fi-om the
reserve account balance along with guarantee fees, which can help offset Fund administration
costs and some defaults.

Conditions are suitable inBulgaria for the guarantee instrument to be successful. A number of
banks are in the process o f improving liquidity and there is some, albeit still marginal, baseline
market activity inguarantees (notably, the Municipal EE Program, see section 3.2) serving as a
positivereference.

Component 2: Investment (Sub-loan) Financing (indicative amount: US$l6.34 million, of
which US$4.00millionfiom GEF). Underthis facility (Loan Account), loans will bemade on a
commercial basis to creditworthy customers that will revolve with interest and principal
payments into BEEF for additional loans. Indicative lendingguidelines are as follows:

       The projects are expected to be in the range o f US$50,000 to US$Z,OOO,OOO.         Projects
       outside this range are not excluded, however, financing for projects with large
       contribution fi-om the Fund would have to ensure adequate risk coverage, including
       sharing of risks with commercial financiers. While very small projects (much less than
       US$lOO,OOO) are not excluded, BEEF and FIs may not be interested in them because of
       the high transaction costs. This situation may require "project pooling" by a third party
       where projects that are individually too small are bundled to make a financially viable
       package.

       BEEF loans would typically be made on a co-financing basis, Le., incombination with
       commercial bank loans and equity financing (a minimum o f 10% o f the total project
       costs) by the subproject sponsors.

       GEF fhds can be placed in afirst-loss position to the commercial funds in order to
       reduce risks and increase incentives for commercial co-financiers inthe early years.

       A well-diversifiedportfolio ofprojects to assure a balancedriskheturnto BEEF.

       Projects with relatively short payback time (generally not longer than three to four years).

       At leasthalfo fthe project's benefits should come from measurable energy savings.

       The energy saving technology must bewell proveninthe proposed application.

BEEFis expectedto provide the following loanproducts:

       Cash-flow basedterm loans made directly to end-users.

       Cash-flow basedloans made to ESCOs on a project-by-project basis.

       Performance loans where BEEF partners with a supplier consortium and offers a total
       project package including engineering, equipment and financing.




                                                45

Inaddition, project financial support may include equipment leasing, payment for services(e.g.,
bridge financing for ESCOs to support investment grade energy audit costs) and various
combinations o fthese.

Since GEF funds and co-financiers' funds will not be commingled, procurement and
disbursements under the project will not be influenced by the specific eo-financing
arrangements. For example, in a paraZZeZ co-financing arrangement, each co-financier retains
control o f own funds and coordinates with the FM with respect to sharing the deal flow, due
diligence, consultants and structuring concepts and harmonizing the terms o f financing among
different financing sources, so that the client signs only one financing contract and interfaces
with a single point of contact, the FM. In a direct co-financing arrangement, the co-financier
would establish a dedicated account over which the FMwould have control. Inthis case, the FM
is empowered to make disbursements from the account for any eligible transaction (within the
context of the General Framework Agreement between BEEF and the co-financier) without the
expressconsent o fthe co-financier.

Component 3: Technical Assistance (indicative amount: US$2.05 million, of which US$1.50
million from GEF). This component covers the followingtwo broad areas:

    0   Capacity Building: to h d activities in initial project pipeline development (including
        partial support for audits) and project evaluation, workshops for potential co-financiers
        and clients, marketing and dissemination ofinformation, training for the FMandpartners
        of the Fund (banks, ESCOs, consultants, etc.) in EE project development and financing
        techniques.

    0   Fund Administration: to finance set-up and running costs o f the Fund, including the
        salaries o f Fund staff, during the first five years when the Fund is not yet fully self-
        financing.

The TA activities will be carried out under the general responsibility of the FM. The annual
businessplanprepared by the FMwill identify andspecify the need for such activities.

BEEF will manage a sufficiently diverse portfolio interms of sectors and risks while ensuring
that at least half o f the benefits in every project come from measurable energy savings. Likely
eligible transactions would include investments inprojects aimed at improving EE inbuildings
(e.g., through modernization of heat exchanger substations, heating insulation), industrial
processes, municipal facilities (e.g., street lighting) and other energy end-use applications (e.g.,
lighting, boiler and small cogeneration systems, energy management control systems, power
factor correction measures, air compressors, steam traps, fuel switching).

                       BULGARIA:ENERGYEFFICIENCY PROJECT

The project beneficiary is the Bulgaria Energy Efficiency Fund established in public-private
partnership pursuant to the Energy Efficiency Act (chapter 4, section 1).            BEEF is an
independent legal entity specialized in financing EE investments on a commercial basis. The
immediate recipient of the GEF grant on behalf of the GOB will be the Ministry of Energy and
Energy Resources (MEER) with which the Bank concludes a Grant Agreement.                The final
recipient of the grant will be BEEF under a Subsidiary Grant Agreement with MEER and a
Project Agreement with the Bank. Details of the governance structure, including appointment
and compensation arrangements for BEEF staff and members o f the Management Board (MB),
are elaborated in the Legal Statute (LS) and Operations Manual (OM) of BEEF. A key design
principle is to keep BEEF simple and flexible, avoiding complex procedures and structure. The
following key features are includedinthe L S andOM:

ManagementBoard. BEEF is governed by the MB, which determines, in association with the
key donors, BEEF's general strategy and policies, decides by majority vote on the proposals for
project financinglguarantees, appoints the Fund Manager (FM), approves BEEF's annual
operational budget and oversees all BEEF operations. The MB consists of seven members from
the public and private sectors as follows: (i) representatives appointed by the Minister of
                                                  two
MEER (one fkom the EEA); (ii)representative appointed by the Minister of Environment and
                                   a
Water; and (iii) representatives of the private sector with good reputation and proven EE
                  four
skills.   In November 2004, the private sector members were selected fkom concerned
stakeholders ina special meeting convened by the Chair o f the Boardpursuant to the EE Act and
the L S following prior consultation with the Bank.

The appointed representative of MEER is the first Chairman of the Board, a mandate to be held
for two years.    H e was appointed in November 2004 after prior consultation with the Bank.
Upon expiry of the first Chairman's mandate, the members of the Board shall elect a new
Chairman from amongst the members of the Board for one year.            The tenure of the Board
members is two years.       All appointments, including the Chairman, are subject to prior
consultation with the Bank.

Fund Manager. The day-to-day activity of BEEF is administered by a professional FMteam
appointed by the Board following a competitive selection process in compliance with Bank
procurement rules. Appointment of the FM i s subject to approval of the Bank, which will
finance  the salaries of Fund staff inthe first five years when the Fundis not yet financially self-
sufficient.   The FM team is headed by an Executive Director who is the general legal
representative of BEEF.

The FM consists of a small core team of technical and financial experts in EE project
development plus limited technical support staff. The FMwill need to outsource some technical
and financial services to consultants to minimize overhead costs. The FM is engaged under a
five-year performance contract, which is subject to review and negotiations after two years, and
may be extended beyond five years ifrequired, and subject to successful performance. The FM
should be properly iiicentivized to be proactive in identifying high volumes of successful


                                                  48

projects and helping applicants improve the quality o f their proposals. The FM remuneration
includes a retainer fee, deal origination (or closing) fee and a success fee. The retainer fee i s
partly fixed and partly depends on performance; it will be paidfrom the TA component during
the first five years and from the Fund's income thereafter. The deal origination (closing) fee
may be charged to the borrowers in line with prevailing market practices in Bulgaria. The
success fee will be paid from net profits o f the Fund at the end o f the contract period. The
performance-based retainer includes incentives for expanding the client base of the Fund while
ensuring that defaults are minimized. After year 5, there is an option for BEEF to negotiate an
additional three-year contract.    The FM will be selected by, or reasonably soon after,
effectiveness o fthe project.

It is expected that BEEF will administer GEF funds for about 15 years. According to the
financial model developed for the project, this implementation time i s sufficient to demonstrate
successful operation. Thereafter, the private financial sector can fully take over hding for EE
on a sustainablebasis (for the proposed GEF exit strategy, see section C.4.3 below). The World
Bankproject implementationperiodwill last five years duringwhich GEF funds will havebeen
hlly disbursed. After Bank project closure, MEER will conduct appropriate monitoring of
BEEF's performance as providedunder the Subsidiary Grant Agreement.

Client Relationship. BEEF is designed to be a client-friendly entity. Accordingly, its intemal
procedures need to be streamlined in order to provide efficient services inproject development
andfinancing. The two-tier governancestructure should work as smoothly as possible. The FM
will be the public face o f BEEF for the clients (subproject sponsors) and co-financing partners.
The General Framework Agreement to be concluded between BEEF and selected financial
institutions may include clauses enabling the project client to sign only one contract and having
to deal only with one provider o f financial services. In order to inform clients on services
provided by BEEF, a coherent communication strategy will be developed and implemented
within six months after the selection o f the FM. As part o f the strategy, a Web site for BEEF
promotion will be established to provide information enabling potential clients to quickly
determine whether they are eligible for BEEF's financial services. Through this medium and
other more traditional means such as workshops, road shows, mass media, the potential clients
and financing partners will be informed on the benefits o f EEinvestments, eligibility criteria for
projects, loadguarantee conditions (interest rate/guarantee fee, repayment time schedule,
collateral, environmental and monitoring requirements),          BEEF procedures for project
development support (energy audit, business planpreparation, training, etc.) and loadguarantee
approval.

Selectedpartners such as professional and employers associations, ESCOs andbusiness advisory
centers will be contacted and informed on BEEF services. During the initial implementation
period of the project, these stakeholders and partners will be exposed, through workshops and
seminars, to BEEF objectives and procedures so as to develop proposals targeted at the
requirements o f the Fund. The FMwill also work with appropriate partners inthe development
of innovative financing techniques (e.g., pooling o f small projects) to provide financing for less
creditworthy clients. For the first projects, the Fund may cover the total cost o f developing
bankable proposals, thereafter however the clients will have to contribute to the development,
with their share ofthe cost rolledintothe financing arrangements.

                      BULGARIA:ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECT

1. Financialmanagement: countryissues

 A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Bulgaria was camed out in2003.
 The CFAA report concludes that Bulgaria has a well-developed system and structure of public
 financial management that relies heavily on information technology (such as inthe area of cash
 management), and has independent external audits and parliamentary oversight committees.
 Sound legislation exists to prepare, implement andmonitor the state budget. A major remaining
 issue, from the perspective of using government financial management systems in Bank-
 financed projects, is the implementation of a single unified Financial Management Information
 System, which i s currently inprogress. Given the current state o f public financial management
 inBulgaria, the CFAA assesses boththe global fiduciary risk to the government and the overall
 fiduciary risk to Bank project funds as low. BEEF, implementing this project, should develop a
 financial management system (FMS) able to meet the requirements of both Bulgarianstatutory
 legislation and the Bank.

2. Projectfinancial managementarrangements

Strengths and weaknesses

The strength of BEEF's F M S lies inthe use of the existing system of the Ministry of Energy and
Energy Resources (MEER) in the initial period (until BEEF becoming operational having in
place acceptable financial management arrangements). MEER has experiences in implementing
Bank trust funds, including satisfactory FMRs. The main potential weakness is that BEEF is a
new organization which does not have acceptable financial management arrangements and has
no prior experience with Bankprojects.

Implementing entity

The project beneficiary is BEEF established inpublic-private partnership pursuant to the Energy
Efficiency Act. BEEF is an autonomous legal entity specialized in financing EE investments in
Bulgaria on a commercial basis. BEEF will be the final recipient of the GEF grant through
MEER on the basis of a Subsidiary Grant Agreement and a Project Agreement with the Bank.
Details of the govemance structure, including appointment and compensation arrangements for
BEEFstaffand members of the Management Board(MB), are included inthe Legal Statute.

The day-to-day activity of BEEF is administered by a professional Fund Manager (FM)
appointed by the MB following a competitive selection process in compliance with Bank
procurement rules. The FM consists of a small core team of technical and financial experts in
EEproject development plus limited technical support staff.

For an initial period (prior to BEEF's becoming operational and having in place acceptable
financial management arrangements), the disbursement and financial management arrangements


                                               50

of GEF funds in relation to selected parts of the TA component will be carried out by the
Financial Department of MEER. Based on the results o f financial management assessment,
MEER has adequate financial management arrangements in place to manage the upfront
expenditures inrelation to the establishment o f BEEF. Accordingly, it has been concluded that
the interim financial management arrangements of the project are acceptable to the Bank and
satisfies the Bank's minimum financial managementrequirements for the management o fthe TA
component only.

Once BEEF becomes operational with adequate financial management arrangements inplace, it
will assume responsibility for the implementation of the TA component.             Prior to any
disbursement for the TA andthe two other project components (partial credit guarantees and sub-
loan financing), BEEF's FMS will need to be assessed as satisfactory to the Bank. A FMS
satisfactory to the Bankis a condition o f disbursement through BEEF.

Stafing

Currently, the FinancialDepartment of MEER has adequate staffing capacity to manage the T A
component ofthe project.

BEEF should appoint an experienced financial manager and financial assistant able to fulfill the
accounting and reporting needs of the project. The financial manager will be trained in Bank
procedures andrequirements, includingpreparation ofthe FinancialMonitoring Reports (FMRs).

Accountingpolicies andprocedures

The accounting books and records o f the project will be maintained on a cash basis. The
FinancialDepartment o f MEER, through its management o f other Bank projects, has appropriate
accounting policies and procedures and internal controls, including segregation of duties, for the
managemento fthe TA component.

A set of appropriate accounting procedures and internal controls for the management of the
project, includingauthorization and segregation of duties, are defined in BEEF's FMS Manual,
which was found acceptablebythe Bank. The Manualis inthe Project File aspart ofthe OM.

Internal audit

BEEFhasno internal audit function andno reliance will beplacedonthe internalaudit.

External audit arrangements

The project financial statements (including Statement o f Expenditures [SOEs] and Special
Accounts) will be audited each fiscal year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank in
accordance with standards on auditing and Terms o f Reference (TOR) acceptable to the Bank.
Inaddition, BEEF's financialstatementswillbeauditedeachfiscal yearbyindependent auditors
acceptable to the Bank inaccordance with standards and TOR agreedwith BEEF and acceptable
to the Bank andsubmittedwithin six months o fthe endo fthe fiscal year. The auditing standards



                                                 51

acceptable to the Bank are International Standards on Auditing promulgated by the International
Federation o f Accountants. The auditors acceptable to the Bank should be pre-qualified to audit
Bank-funded operations.       The TOR for the audit o f the project financial statements was
confirmed during negotiations. Not later than six months after grant effectiveness, BEEF shall
hireindependent auditors underterms satisfactory to the Bank.

The auditedproject financial statements and BEFF's financial statements will be providedto the
Bankwithin six months ofthe endof eachfiscal year and also at the closingofthe project. The
cost o f the audit will be financed from the T A component o f the GEF grant until BEEF reaches
self-financing.

Reporting and monitoring

BEEF will produce all financial reports and SOEs for the Bank using the same accounting
system which will serve statutory reporting purposes. Project management-oriented FMRs will
be used for project monitoring and supervision. BEEF will produce a full set of semi-annual
FMRs throughout the life of the Bank project. The format of the FMRs was agreed during
negotiations and includes:

Information systems

MEER uses a project accounting system which is based on the accounting software "Business
Management System" developed by the company Tonegan. The software was initially designed
to meet the specific needs and reporting requirements o f MEER, but was upgraded with
additional modules. The new elements o f the system allow for preparation of FMRs and
disbursement reports on project Special Account (SA) and Guarantee Account (GA), which
comply with the requirements o f the Bank. It was agreed during negotiations that MEER will
transfer its accounting software, capable of producingFMRs inthe format required by the Bank,
to BEEF following the appointment o fthe FM.

Action Plan

BEEF'SFMS should be acceptable to the Bank before disbursements, under the partial credit
guarantee and sub-loan financing components as well as the T A component (once its
managementi s transferred to BEEF from MEER), can start.

Supervision Plan

During project implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial management
arrangements in two main ways: (i) o f the semi-annual FMRs as well as the project's
                                       review
annual audited financial statements and the auditor's management letter; and (ii)    during the



                                                52

Bank's supervision missions, review of the project's financial management and disbursement
arrangements to ensure compliance with Bank requirements.          A Bank-accredited financial
management specialist will assist inthe supervision process.

3. Disbursement arrangements

GEFFundsFlows. GEF funds will flow from the Bank either via a SA onthe basis of SOEs or
by direct payment on the basis of direct payment withdrawal applications. BEEFwill open and
manage a SA in a bank acceptable to the World Bank. The authorized allocation o f the initial
deposit into the SA will be US$2.0 million. Supporting documentation for SOEs, including
completion reports and certificates, will be retained by BEEF and made available to the Bank
during project supervision. Withdrawal applications for the replenishments of the SAs will be
sent to the Bankmonthly or at least every three months.

Duringthe initialperiod (prior to BEEFbecomingoperational), MEER, the initial implementing
agency, shall open a SA in the National Bank o f Bulgaria for the purpose o f making
disbursements from the TA component to fund eligible expenditures for the establishment of
BEEF. The authorized allocation ofthe initialdeposit intothe SAwillbeUS$lOO,OOO.

At the request ofMEERandBEEFduringnegotiations, the currency ofthe two SAs isEuro.

Disbursement toward sub-loans (BEEF-supported investments under expenditure category 1, see
Table A below) will be made against sub-loan agreements approved by BEEF's MB. It is
expected that sub-borrowers will cover at least 10% of the costs of their projects. It will be
BEEF's responsibility to ensure that the sub-borrowers come up with their portion o f project
financing. Disbursements toward the FM retainer fee [category 3(a)] will not be made on the
basis of SOEs. Disbursements toward consultancy contracts [category 3(b)] will be made on the
basis o f SOEs, subject to a threshold o f US$lOO,OOO for firms and US$50,000 for individuals.
Disbursement toward incremental operating costs (category 4) will be made against SOEs and
the maximum limit each year will be 85% in,the first year, 80% inthe second year, 75% in the
thirdyear, 50% inthe fourthyear, 25% inthe fifthyear andzero thereafter. BEEFis expected to
achieve financial self-sufficiency by2010.

For the partial credit guarantee component (category 2), the disbursement o fthe entire allocation
(US$4.5 million) will be executed through a single deposit into BEEF's GA to be opened in a
bank acceptable to the World Bank. BEEFwill managethe GA, including, inter alia, payments
for called guarantees andrecovery o f amountspaid under called guarantees.

All ofthe withdrawalapplications for the Bank,includingthe single deposit into the GA, shall be
submitted byBEEFwith signature o f authorized persons.

Reallocation across expenditure categories i s possible under the Bank's standard procedures
when reasonablejustification isprovidedto the Bank.

                                     Annex 8: Procurement
                      BULGARIA: ENERGYEFFICIENCY PROJECT

The procurement o f services o f the GEF-financed components will be procured in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The project components not financed by the GEF will
be procured in accordance with the national procurement regulations o f the co-financing
institutions. The project elements, their estimatedcost andprocurement methods, andthe overall
project procurement plan are shown in the tables below. Additional procurement methods may
be deemed applicable in the future as the procurement plan for the project will be subject to
annual reviews by the Bank.

Procurement o f goods and works (andor supply and install packages as appropriate) under the
sub-loans and partial credit guarantees (PCG) will be conducted by the final beneficiaries (sub-
project sponsors). The FundManager (FM)will assist and supervise the final beneficiaries inthe
application o f the appropriate procurement methods. Consultant services cannot be financed
from the portion o fthe GEF grant allocated to sub-loans andPCGs (totaling US$8.5 million).

Contractsunder Sub-loans. For contracts financed from sub-loans, the following procurement
methods shall apply. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be required only ifthe
estimated value o f the contract exceeds US$3 million. Such contracts are expected to be rare.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) can be used ifthe estimated value of the contract does not
exceed US$3 million. For contracts below US$1 million, procurement can be conducted
according to Prudent Commercial Practices (PCP) provided these ensure a transparent process
and evaluation based on pre-disclosed criteria for award o f contract. The contractors and
suppliers selected for award should have adequate financial and technical resources to perform
the contract satisfactorily. Under PCP, the FM should ensure that procurement for contracts co-
financed by BEEF is performedon the basis o f at least three quotations. The first two contracts
and all subsequent contracts above US$1 million will be subject to the Bank's prior review.
Other contractswill be subject to ex-post review.

Contractsunder PCG. Procurement ofcontracts inwhich BEEFis involvedonly throughPCG
will beconductedinaccordancewithPCP or the procedureso fthe financiers as appropriate.

ConsultantServices. The procurement methods for these services are shown inTable Al. The
mainprocurement action inthis category is the selection ofthe FM, which will be conductedby
MEER (as initial project implementing agency) on a competitive basis in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelinesfor Selection andEmployment o f Consultants. This procurement i s underway
and selection of the FMis expected to be completed by May 2005. Several minor services may
also be procured by MEER until BEEF becomes operational. Capacity of MEER is considered
adequate for the procurement o f initial consultant services.    In the initial years, non-staff
operating expenses o f BEEFwill be financed under the incremental operating cost category with
procurement based on the annually approved budget and using competitive selection wherever
possible.

Training in procurement will be conducted for BEEF staff who will be directly involved in
procurement work. In addition, guidance will be provided on an ongoing basis by the Bank
project team.

                                                55

   The Bank will review, regardless of value, Terms of Reference of all consultant services
   financed from the GEF grant. Expenditures under the incremental operating costs category will
  be reviewed annually.

   Overall Procurement Risk Assessment: Average.           Frequency of procurement supervision
   missions proposed: one every six months (includes special procurement supervision for post-
   reviewlaudits).

The economic and financial performance o f the project depends primarily on two major factors:
(i) ofBEEF'Sdesignasfinancialfacility;and(ii) oftheprojectportfolio. Aslong
    quality                                                    quality
as the financial facility i s well hctioning and supportsprofitable investments, BEFFwill have a
high impact interms of energy savings and associated GHG emission reductions. Leveraging
large volumes o f co-financing will boost the project's performance, as it will increasethe volume
o f GHGemission reductions per dollar o f seed capital providedby GEF.

2. BEEF: FinancialPerformance Modeling Results

Methodology and key assumptions.             To estimate the potential impact o f BEEF on EE
investments and the resulting GHG reduction impact, a financial model was developed. Under
the base case (or reference) scenario, the following disbursement profile was assumed fiom the
total initialcapitalization for the loan and guarantee facilities o f BEEF over the first five years of
operation:




Both facilities will operate in a revolving mode, meaning that loan repayments (including
interest) are reinvested into new loans and guarantees. Since the guarantee facility will cover
only 50% o f any commercial loan it supports, the amount of financial resources mobilized by it
would be twice the amount o f the guarantee. The Fund i s expected to attract additional co-
financing inthe form of equity contributions (minimum 10%o f total investment costs) from the
subproject borrowers andnon-guaranteedco-financing from commercial banks.

The resulting loan and guaranteeas well as their combined transactions are shown below for the
expected 15 years of operation o fBEEF:

Baselinescenario, additionality and leveragingeffect. The amount o f financing mobilized, as
shown above, is considered additional to what would take place in the absence o f the project.
The underlyingassumption is that without the project, Bulgariawould maintaina moderate level
of EE investments. Historical data suggest that EE investment o f about US$13 million per year
and increasing annually by about 4% is a reasonable basis for the "without project" scenario.
The additionality impact of BEEF consists of mobilizing additional financial resources
(including its own initialcapital) for EE investments on top o f the baseline level. The degree to
which this catalytic financing role will be achieved is key to project success.

The analysis of BEEF'Sfinancial performance includes a projectionfor the first five years during
which the GEF funds (US$lO million) will be fully disbursed. Co-financing mobilized during




                                                         60

this period is projected at US$39.5 million, bringing the total available financing to US$47.8
million(excludingthe T A component), which yields a leveraging ratio of 4.8.

However, the leveraging impact o f the GEF funds can be better evaluated over a 15-year period
(BEEF's design lifetime) which includes the effect of cash reflows from its lending and
guarantee operations. With the repeatedrevolution o f the funds, the total financing mobilized is
forecast to reach US$193.6 million over 15 years, corresponding to a leveragingratio o f 19. The
associated unit abatement cost per ton o f COz works out to as low as US$0.68 per of COz
(assuming the full amount o f the GEF grant as a proxy for the incremental costs). The GHG
emission reductionover 15 years i s estimated at 14.7 milliontons of COZ,which was obtainedby
extrapolation on the basis o f the initial years pipeline. Alternative approaches to estimating the
incremental cost (e.g., counting only the "permanent write-offs" such as the TA component used
in non-contingent modality and permanent losses incurred by BEEF due to loan defaults and
called guarantees) would yield an even lower unit abatement cost,

                   AdditionalityofBEEFinEnergyEfficiencyInvestments




Asset value of BEEF. The initial asset value o f BEEF i s estimated at US$17.55 million,
including US$7.50 million for the revolving loan facility, US$8.30 million for the partial credit
guarantee facility and US$1.75 million for TA. The value of this asset can rise if the income
fi-om BEEF operations (comprised o f interest income o f the revolving loan facility, guarantee
fees and interest earned on reserve funds in the guarantee facility) i s greater than the costs of
Fundadministration andproject defaults.

The model used for this analysis relies on the concept of Net Asset Value (NAV), which is a
proxy measureofBEEF's profitability.       NAV ofthe project portfolio is equal to the cashbalance
in the revolving fund plus the Net Present Value of all future cash flows from the portfolio
investments. While the value o f BEEF as an asset is not as important as its ability to mobilize
overall EE financing, NAV i s a useful indicator to forecast and monitor. An excessive default


                                                  61

rate, for example, can reduce the asset value o f BEEF even when the overall volume of
operations increases.

The value o f the revolving loan facility, initially capitalized at US$7.5 million, is projected to
increase as shown below, depending on alternative assumptions about the interest rate charged
and the rate o f default on the loans extended:

Similarly, the value o f the guarantee facility, initially capitalized at US$8.3 million, is projected
to evolve as shown below, depending on alternative assumptions about the guarantee fee charged
andthe rate of default on the loans guaranteedbythe facility:

The NAV of BEEF (loan and guarantee facilities combined) is projected under three scenarios:
optimistic, realistic and pessimistic. As shown in the figure below, the NAV keeps growing
under the first two scenarios, but.a small decline is displayed under the pessimistic scenario
characterized by relatively compressed interest and guarantee fee earnings on the one hand and
relatively highlosses from defaults (assumed at 10%).

Sensitivity Analysis. Inadditionto the above cases, several other scenarios were runto test the
robustness of Fundperformance and to identify key variables which impact on the performance.
The sensitivity analysis was performed for the aggregate value of Fund transactions and the
NAV with respect to the following variables:

     0  Credit spread (interest rate marginover LIBOR)
     0  Default rate
     0  Guarantee fee
     0  Deal flow

These variables were tested in the range from - 40% to + 40%. The results are shown in the
figures below. They show that both the cumulative volume of BEEF transactions and the NAV
are relatively robust. The credit spread is the most sensitive variable, but even assuming a 40%
decrease in its level relative to the reference value (as under the realistic or reference scenario),
the 15-year cumulative value of BEEF transactions, at US$95 million, is six times higher the
Fund's initial capitalization (US$15.8 million), standing only 10% lower than the reference
value. Regarding NAV, even under a 40% decrease inthe credit spread, at US$17.6 million, it is
larger thanthe Fund's initial capitalization and only 17% smaller thanthe reference value.

Deal Flow. One of the main risks facing the Fund is the failure to utilize the assets due to
paucity of highquality bankable projects and/or insufficient attractiveness of the financing terms
offered by the Fund. The Fundrequires a large enough deal flow to generate sufficient revenues
to cover overhead and operating costs as well as to generate sufficient momentum to ensure
sustainability inthe market for EElendinginBulgaria. Inorder to assess the Fund's exposure to
an insufficient deal flow, two risk variants were applied:


    0  Variant 1:Relative to the reference case, only 50% of Fundassets are used inthe first 5
       years and no loans or guaranteesare granted afterwards.


    0  Variant 2: Relative to the reference case, only 50% of Fundassets are used inthe first 5
       years and the balance is disbursed till year 9 of operation.

The analysis (see figures below) shows that especially under Variant 1 the volume of BEEF
transactions would be too small to ensure sustainability and market transformation, therefore
closure o fthe Fundshould be seriously considered. Highinitialdeal flow considerably improves
Fundperformance and quickens sustainability, thus devoting sufficient TA to building a strong
pipelineof finance-ready projects early on is of great importance. This is a real possibility given
the demonstrated availability of a large pool of viable EE projects with short payback times.
Equally important is to market intensively the Fund's financial products to targeted clients and
offer help inthe packaging o fbankable projects.

                          BULGARIA: ENERGYEFFICIENCY PROJECT

The Bank's environmental safeguardpolicy is triggered by the project.

The environmental impacts of the project are related to the EE investments supported by BEEF.
No significant negative environmental impacts will be caused by the project, which is
specifically designed to mitigate GHG emissions through energy savings. Only those projects
are eligible for BEEF support for which at least half of the financial benefits come from
measurable energy savings.           Environmental benefits associated with these savings will be
systematically monitored and reported by BEEF. Likely subproject candidates are: street
lighting improvements, installation of heat exchangers and automatic temperature control and
metering in district heating systems, improved thermal insulation of buildings, replacement of
network pipes, fuel switching, power factor correction, reconstruction of boilers, installation of
small co-generation units, economizers, steam traps and fuel switching.            Typically, the
subprojects are expected to be relatively small. With investment costs generally not higher than
US$l million, none o f them will have any adverse large-scale, significant and irreversible
environmental impacts.

The Bank's environmental category assigned to the project is "Financial Intermediary" (FI). In
anFIproject, specific subprojects are identifiedduring implementation andthe responsibility for
environmental due diligence of subprojects lies with the FI, inthis case, BEEF.

As described in the environmental chapter of the Operations Manual (OM), compliance with
Bulgarian environmental law, policies and procedures will be, in most cases, a necessary and
sufficient condition for the Bank's endorsement of financing of subprojects under BEEF. In
recent years, Bulgaria has made considerable progress in adapting its Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) system to international norms. According to the European Commission's
2003 Regular Report on Bulgaria s Progress Towards Accession, Bulgaria has attained a good
degree o f legislative alignment with the EU Environmental Directives, and pre-accession
negotiations on Chapter 22 (environment) were closed. Provisions of the EU Directive on EIA,
which have bindingand mandatory power, were found compatible with those under the Bank's
OP 4.01. Emissions will bewithinlimits set by Bulgarianlaw.

EnvironmentalAssessment Process. The FundManager will include at least one staff hired"
to deal with the EIA and environmental management aspects o f the subprojects supported by
BEEF. Underthe Environmental Chapter ofthe OM, every subproject proposal should contain a
questionnaire completed by the developer/sponsor to determine the applicable course o f action in
accordancewiththe table below:

                             Category C -negligible        Obtain, andpresent to the Bankuponrequest, a
         rwhich EIAis not    adverse environmental         letter from the competent environmental
                             impact`risk.                  authority that EL4 for the subproject is not
                                                           required.




As the table shows, BEEFwill not finance subprojectswhich fall withinthe scope ofAnnex 1of
the Bulgarian EPA, which are considered comparable to the Bank's Category A projects.
Further details are available in the EnvironmentalChapter o f the OM, which was disclosed at
InfoShop@worldbank.org onNovember 22,2004.

There are two principal situations where exceptions may have to be made from the procedure
described above. First, when the Bank's environmental staff determines the Bank's Category B
i s appropriate to a given subproject and disagrees with the decision of the Bulgarian
environmental authorities to exempt the subproject from EIA. Unless the decision is reversed
and EIA is applied, an EnvironmentalManagement Plan shouldbe prepared as required by the
Bank for Category Bprojects. Second, incases where the Bankpolicies offer greater protection
to certain resources of international significance (some types o f natural habitats, cultural
property, etc.), the Bankmayrequire mitigationmeasuresconsistent the Bank's procedures.




   The ESS mustbe prepared both inBulgarian and inEnglish.

                                   Annex 15: IncrementalCost Analysis
                         BULGARIA: ENERGYEFFICIENCY PROJECT

Global Benefits. The global and local benefits from the project are summarized in Table A
below. The total costs o f the EE investmentsfacilitated by BEEF over its 15-year operation are
estimated at US$193.6 million (see Table B for the indicative scenario).                        Most of these
investments would likely remain unimplementeddue to the barriers highlighted inthe report (see
section A.1.2) andthe resulting large EE finance gap.22

Without GEF involvement, the baseline scenario includes a limited level o f investment in EE
financed from internal company h d s , donor assistance and commercial sources.                           Many
potentially viable investments would not materialize with the main financing and technical
capacity barriers remaininginplace.

To construct the baseline scenario for the incremental cost analysis, the projections from the
government's National Energy Saving Action Plan (see section A.1.3) were used with some
adjustments to reflect the actual record during the early period o f its implementation. In the
absence o f the GEF project, Bulgarian businesses can be expected to make EE investments of
about US$245 million over a 15-year period. This represents annual energy savings of 16.2
million GJ and avoided life-cycle GHG emissions o f 20.3 million tons of C02 (baseline
scenario). The GEF project i s expected to bring an estimated net increase in EE investment of
US$193.6 million over a 15-year period, resulting in an additional cumulative reduction o f 14.7
million tons o f C02.

Incremental Costs. The indicative initial years portfolio of EE projects has an estimated
investment costs of Us29.2 million and a weightedaverage payback period o f 2.9 years, with a
net present value of US$37.2 million (consultant report i s in the Project File).23 Extrapolating
this information to a US$193.6 million portfolio of EE projects (see Table C for details) with
similaror even somewhat longer payback periods would yield aNet PresentValue well inexcess
of US$50million, meaningthat the eventual incremental costs to Bulgariainimplementingthese
projects i s negative. However, it i s not the incremental cost to the Bulgarian entities that
preventstheseprojects from beingimplemented, butthe severebarriers to EEfinance.

Considering the methodological complexity o f a quantitative estimation of the costs o f barrier
removal, the practical solution applied here is to use the cost to the GEF as a proxy for the
incremental costs involved. Even though the financing instruments proposed inthis project fall
into the category of contingent finance (revolving loan hnd and a partial credit guarantee
facility), the entire U S 1 0 million GEF allocation for the project should be treated as an




22During 2001-2003, EE investments amounted to only 5% o f the annual EE investment requirements included in
the National Energy Saving Program to 2010. This is a good proxy for the exceptionally large EE finance gap in
Bulgaria.
23The indicative initial years portfolio (see Annex 7) consists o f bankable project candidates for which at least
preliminary technical and financial assessmentshave been carried out.

incremental cost. On the basis of these costs, the unit abatement cost for the GEF works out to
US$0.68 per ton of C02.

Local Benefits. The local benefits will be specific to the circumstances of the projects. The
major local benefit in most cases will be the value o f fuel saved due to increased EE. Inthose
cases where the project consists of switching to a cleaner fuel (e.g., natural gas) from a more
pollutingfuel (e.g., lignite), significant local environmental benefits are expected. Demand-side
EEinvestments inthe residential sector mayhave significant social benefits due to the mitigating
impact of these measures on household energy bills at a time of sharply increasing residential
energy prices and low disposable incomes.

BEEF'Simpact on the Bulgariancommercial banking sector is expected to be beneficial. The
Fundwould actively seek co-financing from the commercial banks. BEEF would operate as a
last-resort financier, extending credit on terms not more favorable than those available from
commercial banks.      Through project development support and partial risk mitigation, BEEF
wouldhelp openup a new line ofbusiness -EEfinance -for a number ofBulgarianbanks.
