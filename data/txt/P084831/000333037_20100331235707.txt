                                   Proposed Changes
                                  (1 page) if applicable:


a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

The main change is a reallocation of funds between categories, namely US$ 342,112.39
thousand from Category 3 (b) others of `Consultants services and training' to Category
(1) Sub-loans under Part B of the Project. This reallocation is required as assistance to
BEEF for financing projects in their pipeline since they have exhausted all funds
originally allocated to them under Category (1) under Part B of the project. Sub-loans
have been prepared and loan documents will be signed before the closing date.
