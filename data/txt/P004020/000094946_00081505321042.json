Still, key\n            lessons address the need to strengthen local capacity, not\n            only through technical assistance, which alone has limited\n            impact, but through appropriate civil service reforms, to\n            avoid the losses experienced in productivity, and output,\n            resulting from inexperienced officials, field consultants,\n            and contractors. This was exacerbated by the lack of\n            practical training, monitoring, and, non-supportive local\n            governments in establishing strong local capacities.\n            Consequently, construction quality suffered due to poor\n            quality control, and related institutional arrangements,\n            which diminished the effect on the lifetime of works, and of\n            course on the economic rate of return. Unfortunately,\n            incentives to encourage equipment ownership by contractors,\n            were not successful, neither were the interim steps taken to\n            introduce equipment privatization workshops, nor the use of\n            rational equipment rental rates. Hence, all income had to be\n            returned to the local government, where currently, adequate\n            equipment funding is not guaranteed. This reflects the need\n            to extend, and improve the pilot program for equipment\n            management workshop, under future highway projects. But the\n            long-term solution to this, lies in encouraging banks\n            lending to local contractors."}, "docdt": "2000-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
