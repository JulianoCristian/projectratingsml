F. Results Framework Analysis

The main objective of the project was to improve the quality of and access to economic
and physical infrastructure for private sector development. The core activities in the
project were to prepare for privatization and then privatize parts of the Electricity Supply
Commission of Malawi (ESCOM), Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) and
Lilongwe and Blantyre Water Boards and to establish the necessary regulatory capacity
in those sectors. Successful privatization of these utilities would have a significant
positive impact on the fiscal deficit and the climate for private business in Malawi.

The project specifically sought to: (a) support the development of divestiture options
and/or the implementation of the chosen methods for utility divestitures including: MTL,
electricity distribution and transmission, and water; (b) support regulatory institutions
through enhancing the operations of the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority

(MACRA) for postal and telecommunications regulation and the Electricity Council for
power regulation. Further, this component would also assist the government in evaluating
the benefits of and, if appropriate, in the establishment of a multi-sectoral regulatory
agency; (c) support postal sector by supporting the three year business plan of Malawi
Postal Corporation (MPC) in order to help the postal service progress towards full cost
recovery after its separation from MTL. The support provided would be through funding
of consultancy services for management support and training (through a twinning
arrangement with another postal administration), postal and office equipment, and
vehicles and; (d) provide pre-privatization assistance through provision of support in
restructuring activities in ESCOM and MTL.

Revised Project Development Objectives

Based on the recommendations from the Project Review in 2005, the Project
Development Objective (PDO) was formally restructured. The revised PDO was to
enhance the climate for private investment by reducing the state's direct participation in
the business sector. The revised PDO was well aligned to the Malawi Country Assistance
Strategy Outcome III - Improved Business Climate. The outcomes expected by end of the
project were: (i) reduction in state-subsidies to public enterprises from MK1.54 billion in
January 2001 to MK0.8 billion in December 2007 (in constant 2001 Malawi Kwacha);
and (ii) six fold increase in total number of telephone lines in the country from 40,000 to
240,000 by the closing date of December 31, 2007.

I. Disbursement Profile

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1      At the time of project design, Malawi had struggled to find solutions to the
many development challenges it has continually experienced for many years. In 1997-
1998 Malawi faced adverse developments in a number of areas critical to growth
including a decline in the pace of reforms and weakening of public expenditure controls.
While the government had identified private sector led growth as the key to economic
growth, the World Development Report (1997) had identified infrastructure bottlenecks
as a major constraint to the growth of the private sector.

1.1.2      To address these reforms, Government of Malawi began in 1997 a series of
reforms in key infrastructure sectors through a four point action plan: (i) liberalization of
markets where competition was feasible; (ii) privatization of public enterprises; (iii)
establishment/ strengthening of regulatory institutions to monitor compliance with new
sector policies and licensing; and (iv) improving access to services, especially by the
rural population.

1.1.3      The major sector issues at the time of project inception were:
           i) Telecommunications and Postal Sectors: The service coverage of the
           telecommunications was extremely poor, unreliable and expensive while
           postal services were limited to the delivery of mail to private letter boxes.

           ii) Power Sector: Lack of reliable power services and limited access to
           power were among the major constraints faced by the private sector. The
           Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi Limited's (ESCOM) inability to
           generate adequate funds for systems maintenance and required investment
           was a major challenge which was further exacerbated by its poor operating
           and financial performance.

           iii) Water Sector:    Provision of water services at affordable prices had not
           yet been extended to the urban poor, particularly in Lilongwe and Blantyre.
           The financial condition of the Water Boards had deteriorated in recent years
           despite tariff increases.

1.1.4      GoM and the World Bank had been engaged in dialogue regarding
infrastructure reform for a few years and this would be tackled by the creation of broad-
based labor intensive economic growth. GoM requested the International Development
Association (IDA) for a credit to fund transactions advisory services for large
privatization transactions which could not be financed from existing government
resources. The main objective of this request was to acquire a readily-accessible source
of funds. The Privatization and Utility Reform Project (PURP) project was designed as a
response to this government request and to address the identified constraints faced by the
government and private sector with regard to utility infrastructure services.

1.2 Original PDO and Key Indicators

1.2.1       As stated in the credit agreement, the objective of the project was to improve
the quality and access to economic and physical infrastructure for private sector
development (PSD). This objective was measured by the following indicators:

    i) Increase the number of working telephone lines from 40,000 to 150,000 by
        December 31, 2004;

    ii) Increase in percentage of population with grid-based electricity from 4 percent to
         6 percent by December 31, 2004;

    iii) Mail posted from one city for delivery in another city is delivered by the third day
         of posting will increase from 65 percent to 80 percent by December 31, 2004; and

    iv) Increase in the number of letters handled per staff per annum from 45,610 to
         62,903 by December 31, 2004

1.2.2       No specific indicators were identified for the water sector since the
privatization transactions were planned to occur at the end of the project.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

1.3.1       The project was restructured in 2005 to simplify it and to address the
underlying causes of slow disbursement. As stated in the Memorandum of the President
(MOP), its revised Project Development Objective (PDO) was to enhance the climate for
private investment by reducing the state's direct participation in the business sector. The
following key performance indicators were agreed during the restructuring:

    i) Privatization of MTL by December 31, 2006

    ii) Implementation of Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation
         (ADMARC) restructuring started by December 31, 2007

    iii) Increase the number of working telephone lines from 40,000 to 150,000 by
        December 31, 2004;

    iv) Mail posted from one city for delivery in another city is delivered by the third day
         of posting will increase from 65 percent to 80 percent by December 31, 2004; and

    v) Increase in the number of letters handled per staff per annum from 45,610 to
         62,903 by December 31, 2004




                                             2

   vi) State subsidies to public enterprises reduced (from MK1.54bn in January 2001) to
        MK0.8bn in December 2007 (in constant 2001 Malawi Kwacha).
1.3.2 The following are reasons why the project was restructured:

   i) By December 31, 2004, the project's original closing date, only 40 percent of the
        credit had disbursed with marginal progress registered on implementing the core
        program of preparing utilities in infrastructure sectors for privatization.

   ii) The restructuring sought to address the underlying causes of slow implementation
        progress, respond to new challenges facing the government in parastatal reform,
        incorporate lessons learned and improve the effectiveness of the program.

   iii) The project term was therefore also extended by two years as part of the
        restructuring as it had became apparent that the original four year life of the
        project would not be enough to complete the project activities.

1.4    Main Beneficiaries, original and revised

1.4.1       The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified the following beneficiaries:

        i)     Private Sector: sector reforms and associated liberalization and
        privatization would provide strong incentives for service delivery in the utility
        sectors which was one of the major constraints to private sector development;

        ii)    Local population: individual customers using utility services would gain
        from improved access, quantity and quality of services resulting from
        improvements in operational efficiency and network extension.

        iii)   Government: reduction of public expenditure in the utility sectors and
        increased tax revenue would free up scarce public resources for investment in
        social programs and other priority activities which were likely to accrue to the
        poorer parts of the population who were larger beneficiaries of government social
        programs.

1.5    Original Components

1.5.1       The total cost of the project was US$32.2 million equivalent (US$28.9 million
from IDA and US$3.3 million from the Borrower) and the following are the approved
components of the project as outlined in the PAD:

        i)     Privatization: This     component     was    focused     on   supporting the
        development of divesture options and/or the implementation of the chosen
        divesture methods for utility divestures, including: MTL, electricity distribution
        and transmission, and water. The component would fund consultancy services
        associated with at least seven identified non-utility divestures included in the
        Divesture Sequence Plan (ADMARC); Commercial Bank of Malawi; Air Malawi;



                                              3

        Malawi Rural Finance Corporation; Tourism Development and Investment
        Corporation; Malawi Housing Corporation; and Malawi Savings Bank).

        ii)     Support for Regulatory Institutions: The focus of this component was to
        help in enhancing the operations of the Malawi Communications Regulatory
        Authority (MACRA) for postal and telecommunications regulation, the Electricity
        Council for power regulation and the railways regulatory activities in the Ministry
        of Transport. This component would assist the government in evaluating the
        benefits of and, if appropriate, in the establishment of a multi-sectoral regulatory
        agency.

        iii)    Postal Sector Support: The component supported the three year business
        plan of Malawi Postal Corporation (MPC) in order to help the postal service
        progress towards full cost recovery after its separation from MTL. The support
        provided would be through consultancy services for management and training
        through a twinning arrangement with another postal administration, postal and
        office equipment, and vehicles. The government would provide a subvention
        over the project period to meet the interim financing gap arising from tariffs not
        increasing sufficiently to meet operating costs of MPC.

        iv)     Pre-Privatization Assistance: The objective of this component was to
        support restructuring activities: (a) in ESCOM ­ including the conducting of a
        tariff study, establishing a financial management system and separating the
        financial statements of the Strategic Business Units and the purchase of high
        voltage metering equipment; and (b) in MTL ­ ensuring that Year 2000
        compliance w achieved.

        v)      Implementation & Capacity Building: This component funded salaries and
        equipment for the Project Implementing Unit (PIU) and the Privatization
        Commission.


1.6    Revised Components

1.6.1       The restructured project retained the core components of the original program
which were necessary to meet the project's development objective satisfactorily, albeit
with streamlined activities. These core components were: (i) Privatization, (ii) Support to
Regulatory Institutions (iii) Pre-privatization Assistance, and, (iv) Implementation and
Capacity Building. The following two new components were added ­ (i)
Commercialization (which subsumed the original Postal Sector Support Component) and
(ii) Post-privatization Monitoring. In deciding which activities to retain in the
restructured project, the project sought to keep the core program and to carry only those
activities which were underpinned by a policy consensus between the IDA and GoM, and
which would be capable of successful execution within the project's extended closing
date of 31 December, 2007 and whose impact on the business climate and fiscal deficit
would be greatest.



                                              4

i) Privatization: This component supported the MTL privatization, which was
expected to be concluded by August 2005 but was concluded in December, 2005. It
supported the development of divestiture options and implementation of chosen
methods for utility divestitures including electricity transmission and distribution for
ESCOM, and a strengthened public awareness and stakeholder outreach campaign.
In addition, the component funded consultancy services for non-utility divestitures.

ii) Support for Regulatory Institutions: This component supported the creation and
strengthening    of   a  sound    regulatory   framework     and   capacity    for  the
telecommunications, energy and transport sectors. Under the project, GoM hired a
consultant to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of establishing multi-sector
regulators (MSRs).       The evaluation was completed and GoM adopted its
recommendations in favor of MSRs which yield scale economies in a small country
like Malawi. The component supported GoM's decision to proceed with the
establishment of MSRs in the communication, energy and transport sectors.

iii) Commercialization: This component funded consultants who prepared a
restructuring plan, human resources audit and retrenchment plan for ADMARC and
supported their implementation. Restructuring started in March 2006 following
cabinet approval of the consultants' recommendations. The assets of ADMARC
Investment Holding Corporation were privatized leaving the company to concentrate
on a core business of marketing agricultural commodities. The company has
retrenched more than 400 staff and sold off some of its redundant assets. The
restructuring plan called upon ADMARC to pass ownership of approximately 50
percent of its warehouses to a new company, the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing
and Trading Company (MAWTCO), for lease to the private sector. The component
also funded consultants who prepared business plans to underpin this transfer of
assets, and the establishment of the new warehouse leasing company. The project also
funded a consultancy outlining how a warehouse receipts system could be established
in conjunction with the expanded availability of warehouse space on the national
market. As a result of this consultancy, several private traders have expressed interest
in initiating warehouse leasing on their own. However, the formal establishment of
MAWTCO and transfer of ADMARC warehouse assets to the new leasing company
are still pending. The component continued to support MPC in its efforts to
implement full cost recovery and to introduce a sound corporate governance
framework. This support was provided through consultancy services for management
and training, postal and office equipment and vehicles.

iv) Pre-Privatization Assistance: This component continued to support the
restructuring of ESCOM, which involved dividing ESCOM into three autonomous
Strategic Business Units (SBUs) ­ generation, transmission and distribution. The
component also supported the acquisition by Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards of
new metering equipment to improve their billing systems. The restructuring on the
Water Boards to commercialize their operations and introduce leasing arrangements
is being supported under the Second National Water Development Project (P110157).

    The other beneficiary under this component was Malawi Savings Bank which was
    being prepared for privatization.

    v) Post-Privatization Monitoring (new component): This component would take on
    board the lessons learnt from implementing the project over the last four years and
    from successful privatization programs elsewhere. It would support Public Enterprise
    Reform Monitoring Unit (PERMU) through building its capacity to carry out its
    mandate of pre and post privatization monitoring.              The support would include
    provision of technical assistance, training and equipment, and financing a post
    privatization impact study.

    vi) Implementation & Capacity Building: Beneficiary agencies would continue to
    play an active role in project implementation. This component would fund salaries
    and equipment for the Project Implementing Unit (PIU) and the Privatization
    Commission. The project would continue to finance a team of high caliber local
    professionals including the project coordinator, procurement, financial management
    and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) specialists, operating and training costs for
    project staff and other stakeholders in the project.

original and revised components:

1.7.2       The Project Steering Committee (PSC) was reconstituted and strengthened by
including senior representatives of ministries that had a stake in the privatization
program. Political oversight of the privatization program remained in the President's
Office but technical oversight was delegated to the Ministry of Finance. The Minister of
Finance designated the Permanent Secretary in his Ministry to chair the PSC. The PSC
would provide overall guidance and ensure coordination and good working relations

 The XDR amount was 21.8 million but the USD equivalent fluctuated at different points in time to reflect
actual exchange rates.


                                               6

between the different agencies involved in the project. Under the restructured project, the
Project Coordinator reported to the Chairman of the PSC and not to the head of the
Privatization Commission (PC). These arrangements helped to improve the flow of
information between the Ministry of Finance and the PIU, and contributed to smoother
implementation of the project.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1       The project was prepared in line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
FY07­FY10 (P090777). The CAS noted that poverty alleviation could only be achieved
through broad based growth which depended on growth of private sector firms. Private
sector led growth was being constrained by poor quality of infrastructure and utility
service delivery. Private sector participation in ownership and management of the
infrastructure to improve service delivery was a key focus of the project.

2.1.2       At the time of preparation GoM had benefited from an Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) grant in support of privatization. Implementation of the grant
had demonstrated a degree of local ownership of the privatization process and adequate
capacity in the Privatization Commission (PC).

2.1.3       At project design government had shown some commitment through enacting
the Public Enterprises (Privatization) Act, funding the PC and developing relevant sector
policies using its own resources. A strong PC with a long term full time advisor would
ensure that there was adequate capacity to implement the program. In addition at project
design adequate provision was made for capacity building interventions e.g. through
short courses. Social costs of privatization would be met through appropriation from
privatization proceeds and direct government funding. To ensure a consistent approach
across sector reforms and privatization processes government would ensure involvement
of all key stakeholders and inclusion of World Bank sector staff in the project team.

2.1.4       The time and effort needed to prepare and execute significant privatization
transactions were underestimated from the outset. The key privatization activities were
in the utility infrastructure sectors where services have historically been provided by
state-owned monopolies with prices controlled by the government. The new paradigm
shift required structural and regulatory reforms to precede the actual privatization
transactions themselves. Progress was made with the relatively easier of these sectors
(telecommunications), whereas preparatory activities in the water and electricity sectors
(traditionally more complex and highly controversial to privatize) were in fact not
concluded by the close of the project. The time required to accomplish necessary pre-
privatization reforms in these utility sectors far exceeded the four years of original project
life.




                                               7

2.1.5       The level of public awareness and support required for the success of the
program was also underestimated from the beginning. When the program started, PC
officers travelled around the country and met with district officials and other
stakeholders. It was assumed that this would be enough to build public awareness and
political support for the program. The PC did not develop or institutionalize a sustained
Public Awareness Campaign (PAC) nor was any form of information dissemination
conducted.


2.2 Implementation

2.2.1       During project preparation, the World Bank did not consider adequately the
political economy of Malawi and the changeable nature of the government's policy
towards privatization. Within six months of project effectiveness (2000), GoM suspended
all privatization activities following political push back from the opposition. Again in
2004, following general elections, the new government suspended the privatization
program while new government officials familiarized themselves with the legal and
institutional framework for privatization. While the two reviews did not necessarily
mean a withdrawal of political support for the program, more than 12 months of
implementation time were lost between the two reviews, including the time it took to
rebuild momentum after each suspension was lifted. As a result, at subordinate levels of
government and within the public enterprises themselves, momentum for the reforms was
slow to pick up. The flexible nature of the project's design and its restructuring in 2005
meant the project could maintain its relevance in the face of volatile government
priorities.

2.2.2       Public awareness of the benefits of privatization was weak. The only activity
that could be identified as public awareness building was the periodic press briefings.
Over time, resistance to the program increased as people took the view that there was
inadequate consultation between the PC and its stakeholders. This led to slower
implementation. Recognizing the need for a robust Public Awareness Campaign (PAC),
GoM designed a communications strategy and PAC.                  The project supported
implementation of the PAC by funding media (television, radio and press) programs
targeting specific stakeholder groups such as members of Parliament, trade unions,
employees of state owned enterprises and civil society.

2.2.3       The PAC was implemented over the period July 2004-December 2005 and an
evaluation of its effectiveness was conducted in 2006. The evaluation study reported the
following findings:

    i) Awareness of Privatization: Overall, 87 percent of the people interviewed were
    now aware about `privatization' in comparison to 38 percent in 2003. Therefore, the
    goal of the Public Awareness Campaign on generating awareness of privatization
    program in Malawi was met. According to evaluation results, key factors that attract
    attention to privatization are employment, national economic issues, and specific
    privatization transactions.



                                              8

    ii) Attitudes and Perceptions towards Privatization: In the 2003 De Chazal Du Mée
    (DCDM), Ketchum and Top Ad baseline survey, attitudes towards privatization were
    negative. After the Public Awareness Campaign, though, attitudes had improved to
    the following levels: 25 percent of the people were now very favorable to the
    privatization program, 24 percent were favorable and 20 percent were neutral.
    Furthermore, only a combined percentage of 31 percent of the respondents gave
    negative attitude responses. Therefore among the public at large, there is a very
    significant shift of attitude about privatization from negative to positive levels.

    iii) Understanding of Public Awareness Campaign Messages: Evaluation results on
    understanding levels were spread as follows: 31 percent of respondents report very
    good understanding and 7 percent describe their understanding as excellent with 33
    percent at the neutral position. A much reduced total of 29 percent consider their
    understanding as poor or very poor.

2.2.4       Experience from implementing the project suggested that an improvement in
the project's governance mechanisms was required to help accelerate implementation.
The project implementing unit (PIU) reported to the Executive Director of the PC. The
PC was implementing the program with little or no engagement from GoM. This largely
explained the distance between the PC and GoM which contributed to delays in GoM
granting approvals for some privatization transactions. To deal with this, it was agreed
during restructuring that the project coordinating function would report to the Chairman
of the Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC was reconstituted to strengthen it by
including senior representatives of Ministries that had a stake in the privatization
program. Political oversight of the privatization program remained in the President's
Office but technical oversight was delegated to the Ministry of Finance.

2.2.5       The project experienced significant procurement delays during the first two
and half years, mainly as a result of lack of experienced procurement staff. For a period
of two years the PIU was manned by one individual. This was compounded by the fact
that staff in beneficiary agencies was not conversant with World Bank procurement
procedures and was reflected in a very slow disbursement rate. However, soon after mid
term review, the PIU was fully staffed. Apart from the recruitment of a new project
coordinator, two procurement officers and two financial management specialists were
recruited. The PIU had no M&E officer. Although it was agreed at restructuring that a
M&E specialist would be identified from existing staff to pay increased attention to this
aspect of project implementation, this function was the weakest within the PIU
throughout the project implementation.

2.2.6       The responsibility to reform and prepare public enterprises for privatization
rests with the Public Enterprises Reform and Monitoring Unit (PERMU) within the
Ministry of Finance. PERMU did not have adequate human or financial capacity to
execute its mandate. As a result, candidates for privatization were often in very poor
state thereby slowing and complicating the privatization transaction. It was therefore,

                                                  9

essential to address the inadequate GoM capacity for preparing and monitoring public
enterprises, in particular those enterprises that have been privatized, to ensure that the
new private owners comply with the terms of their sale agreements. This role was
ultimately being undertaken by the PC due to the limitations of PERMU. This function
remained weak throughout project implementation.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1       During the design of the project, the aspect of Monitoring and Evaluation was
not fully considered. This was evidenced by the lack of a Monitoring and Evaluation
Specialist among the PIU Staff or well articulated key performance indicators. Although
the results framework laid out the objectives, the monitoring and evaluation aspects were
put into place after the slow implementation progress reported at mid term review. It is
evident that the restructuring that was undertaken after four years of implementation
needed to be done much earlier had the M&E plan been designed and implemented from
the start.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1       At the project design stage, no major environmental impact was envisaged.
Some Public Enterprises on the Divestiture Sequence Plan (DSP) were recognized as a
possible source of pollution or other environmental problems related to ongoing or future
practices. It was therefore decided that rather than undertake a blanket environmental
assessment for all Public Enterprises (PEs) in one go, the task be done on case by case
basis. This would ensure that the results were more current and that the only those PEs
that needed environmental assessment would be subjected to it. Air Malawi for example
had an environmental audit undertaken at the time when the privatization seemed
imminent. Malawi Telecommunications Limited also had an environmental audit done.

2.4.2       The Borrower was able to produce audited reports within six months of the
accounting date, each year. None of the reports indicate significant accounting
breakdown. Issues raised in management letters were resolved and clarifications given to
IDA when necessary. During the first three years of the project the PIU did not have
dedicated procurement staff, leading to delays in project implementation. In 2003 the PC
employed full time procurement staff and thereafter procurement was done in full
consultation with IDA with each procurement method being undertaken pursuant to
thresholds in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA). The safeguard and fiduciary
requirements were therefore complied with as designed. Bank statements for the period
January 2008 to April 2008 had not yet been received from the government's commercial
bank and the government had not yet cleared the backlog of counterpart funds referred to
in 5.2.1 at the time of writing this Implementaiton Completion Report (ICR). Both issues
are facing other projects in the Malawi IDA portfolio and are being followed up.

2.5 Post-completion operations

2.5.1       GoM in consultation with other relevant stakeholders and IDA discussed the
future of Privatization in Malawi. It was recognized that there were still a few major
transactions that were required to be completed - mainly in water, transport and the
electricity sector. Although some studies have been completed in the electricity sector
industry, the work leading to actual private sector participation is yet to be done. As for
the water sector, a lot more work is needed to be done. The mode of private sector
participation being envisaged is that of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). The GoM and
IDA have therefore agreed that IDA funding would be made available to set up a PPP
framework, enact a PPP act and also finance a small team of professionals in the PPP
Unit.   These are already provided for in a newly launched Business Environment
Strengthening Technical Assistance Project (BESTAP).            It is envisaged that the
Privatization Commission will take a lead in the PPP framework; since the project
closing, the government has re-confirmed its commitment to the PC which now has a
mandate for PPPs in the energy, water, transport, and education sectors. Finally, the IDA
funded Regional Power Project is carrying forward the reforms in the electricity sector,
while the National Water Development Program is continuing the work in the water
sector.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 The revised PDO was to enhance the climate for private investment by reducing
the state's direct participation in the business sector. The revised PDO was well aligned
to the current Malawi CAS Outcome III that emphasizes improved business climate. The
project design was well aligned with the project objectives although in a few critical areas
­ M&E, project governance framework and PIU capacity and public awareness campaign
­ important lessons were learned which would need to be incorporated in any follow-up
project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1       The achievement of the project development objective is rated as Satisfactory.
As presented earlier, the revised PDO was to enhance the climate for private investment
by reducing the state's direct participation in the business sector. While the following
analysis will present the achievements based on the revised PDO (since the majority of
the credit was disbursed following restructuring), due consideration will be given to the
original PDO in the discussion to arrive at the overall rating. Rather than present a
component by component analysis, this section will asses the achievement of the PDO at
the following three levels:

Utility Privatization/Restructuring and Regulatory Reform

Malawi Telecommunication Limited

3.2.2      After a long lead time and a couple of unsuccessful attempts, the fixed line
operator, Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL), was finally privatized in
February 2006 with 80 percent of the ownership going to private majority Malawian
investors and the government retaining 20 percent with the plan to divest of this
remaining shareholding through a public offering on the Malawi Stock Exchange within
five years.   The investor included a management contract with a German telecom
company to provide the technical and managerial expertise necessary to run MTL in line
with international standards. The transaction yielded US$30 million in proceeds as well
as agreed on targets in financial performance, new technology investments, access and
quality of services.   As mentioned earlier, MTL was suffering from severe problems
including accumulated arrears to government and lenders, uncollected bills, long
connectivity times, and poor overall outreach with a fixed line tele-density rate at project
inception of 0.3 percent.

3.2.3      While a limited time had passed since the privatization transaction was
completed, MTL can already point to the following results:

   i)      Clearance of US$10 million in loans owed to government and payment of
           US$3 million in back taxes.
   ii)     Investment so far of US$20 million in new technologies, including fibre optic
           cable that would form the backbone of telecom infrastructure with plans to
           invest an additional US$80 million.
   iii)    A positive Earning Before Interest and Taxes by end 2007, two years earlier
           than planned.
   iv)     Introduction of itemized billing, wireless data, internet access, toll free lines,
           and pre-paid cards
   v)      Achievement of subscriber capacity to 230,111 at the beginning of 2008
           compared with 74,345 at the end of 2006 and a goal of 103,568 for that
           period. Approximately 60,000 of these lines are in the rural areas.

3.2.4      In terms of increase in actual fixed line subscribers (as opposed to subscriber
capacity), that has increased more modestly to reach 75,000 which compares favourably
with the start of the project (at 40,000) but is less than the 150,000 goal originally
envisaged. This however needs to be assessed in conjunction with the rapid growth in
mobile phones which resulted in an overall tele-density of 10 percent, representing over 1
million lines in total.

3.2.5      There remain challenges for MTL, chiefly in the area of improving quality
which has been affected by rising vandalism and technical incompatibility with other



                                            12

systems. There was also retrenchment of staff and concerns about long-term job security,
which management is trying to allay through training and job creation in new areas.
However, just two years on, it is evident that the privatization of MTL, which PURP
supported through financing of pre-privatization preparation activities, support to telecom
regulatory reform, and recruitment of transaction advisors, has been a positive and
important milestone for Malawi.

Malawi Posts Corporation

3.2.6       It was recognized at the outset that the Malawi Posts Corporation (MPC),
while not a candidate for outright privatization, needed to be restructured and put on a
commercially viable footing if it were to provide reliable, efficient, and cost-effective
services to the public. Over the life of the project, PURP financed significant capacity
building support to MPC which included:

        i)     Postal and IT Equipment: Purchase, delivery, and operation of mail
        transportation trucks and postal passenger vehicles; stamp machines and franking
        machines; postal boxes and vertical sorting frames; computer hardware and
        software for Track & Trace, and Management Information System and Counter
        Automation Systems.

        ii)    Human Resource and Institutional Development: Assistance has been
        given to MPC to train its staff in various fields, including long-term graduate
        training, corporate governance awareness, stakeholders workshop change
        management training for senior staff, and business plan development. Equally
        important was the housing of long-term consultants under a project funded
        twinning arrangement with British Royal Posts which resulted in reengineering of
        internal business processes and exchange of experiences.

3.2.7 As a result of these initiatives, MPC registered a significant improvement in
performance with intra-city mail delivered in one day, mail between cities delivered
within three days, and mail to rural areas within five days. Further, the project achieved
its impact indicator of increasing number of letters handled per staff per annum, which
stood at 65,000 as of December 2007, from 45,600 in 2001, a 42 percent increase since
the project started and more than the 62,903 target originally envisaged. Finally, since
2006, MPC no longer receives government subsidies, nor does it depend on cross-
subsidies from MTL, and it has diversified into related revenue generated services such
as internet access.

3.2.8 The agenda for MPC remains unfinished with the need to complete the
modernization process through the counter automation system. Also, despite registering
net consolidated profits, the majority of postal centers continue to be loss-making and
MPC still struggles to pay its licensing fee. It is true that further progress took longer
than anticipated and there were some adjustments such as the staff retrenchment that
PURP had financed.       However, MPC is now a much different institution than the
insolvent and nearly dysfunctional institution it was at project beginning.

Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi: ESCOM

3.2.9 PURP provided pre-privatization consultancy support to ESCOM. This included
a tariff study to review how to put tariffs on a sustainable path; an asset revaluation study
in preparation for the unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution units; and
a study of the accounting system. PURP also financed a review of the government's
strategy for restructuring ESCOM which produced new recommendations on how to
proceed. The study recommended unbundling ESCOM but maintaining the entities as
wholly-owned subsidiaries under a single holding company and seeking Private Sector
Participation (PSP) for the overall holding company. GOM has yet to take a decision on
these new recommendations. Implementation of the recommendation to procure and
install a combined accounting and asset management software was delayed by the
government to allow an incoming private partner to have a say in the type of systems to
be installed. PURP also provided high voltage metering equipment for the generation,
transmission and distribution interfaces. This equipment has been installed and is fully
operational.

3.2.10 Beyond this, the future status of ESCOM remains uncertain as a result of
continued delays in the implementation of, and subsequent review of the 2003 Power
Sector Strategy. The participation of the private sector in this sector is politically
sensitive, in part due to the expectation that there would be increased pressure to move
towards cost-reflective tariffs in order to attract PSP and the GoM continues to ponder the
best way forward. The latest actual data from 2006 indicates that ESCOM has 163,000
customers in total, of which 132,000 are residential. On the assumption that there are 2.28
million households in Malawi, this equates to a residential access rate of 5.5 percent.
While this may be slightly higher than at project start, the access rate remains very low
even compared to the Sub-Saharan average of 16 percent. Indeed, cuts in service and
frequent outages continue to act as a constraint on private sector growth and
competitiveness and the search for sustainable power sector reforms remains a work in
progress. The World Bank is carrying this work forward as part of the overall sector
dialogue and through an on-going project (Mozambique-Malawi Transmission
Interconnection Project) and preparation of another IDA Credit (Malawi Energy Sector
Development Project).


Blantyre and Lilongwe Water Boards

3.2.11      Following limited progress in achieving policy consensus around water sector
reforms in the early phase of the project, the work with the Blantyre and Lilongwe Water
Boards was dropped from PURP at project restructuring in 2005 and has now been
picked up under the National Water Development Program, an ongoing IDA funded
program.

Regulatory Reform

3.2.12        The review work for the establishment of a multi-sector regulator was
completed in 2004 with financing from a Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility
(PPIAF) grant. The conclusion of the study was (i) to strengthen the existing telecom
regulator, Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) and to establish two
new regulatory authorities: (ii) for energy & water (MWERA); (iii) for transport
(TRANSRA) The following section will briefly review these agencies and their current
status:

Telecom Regulation Malawi Communication Regulatory Authority

3.2.13 MACRA came into being as a result of the implementation of the 1998
Communication Act which aimed to liberalize the sector and to increase access, quality,
and affordability of telecom and postal services. The Act came into implementation in
2000 just as the PURP was being prepared. MACRA currently regulates the following
sectors: fixed and mobile phones, radio and television broadcasting, frequency spectrum
and postal services.         PURP provided the first set of capacity building activities to
MACRA. This included training to most staff which was undertaken in different centers
in the region and internationally on a range of topics such as licensing, management,
legal issues, and frequency management training.                    The project also financed the
Frequency Management Monitoring System which is now fully operational and has
boosted MACRA's ability to regulate the air waves and to oversee the industry's
expansion in an orderly fashion especially because radio technology is now providing
more cost effective solutions to telecommunication infrastructures.

3.2.14        Another significant purchase under PURP was the satellite based signal
distribution system. As a result of the privatization of MTL, it had become necessary to
provide an alternative signal distribution system for the radio and television public
broadcasters throughout the country. Previously the two institutions relied on the MTL
telephone network for the distribution virtually at no cost. The project provided a satellite
based signal distribution system. The system has an added advantage that it will provide
a faster roll out of the television and radio transmission since the signal may now be
received virtually anywhere via satellite and distributed terrestrially over communities.
This has positively contributed to provision of information throughout the Malawi
population and potentially to improved governance and awareness of development
challenges facing the country§.

3.2.15        On the revenue front, MACRA's income from licensing fees have increased
substantially since MTL's privatization. It also stands to gain from future planned
licenses to mobile operators and has started initiatives to rationalize spectrum usage to
phone and internet operators which should result in greater fees as these users compete
for usage rights.

§To take one example, as a result of this system, Parliament sessions are now broadcast live on TV and this
has resulted in much greater awareness and involvement by ordinary Malawians in the political process.


                                                    15

3.2.16      While MACRA has come a long way since its inception, it continues to need
further capacity support, especially in light of the changes brought about the rapid growth
in mobile phones, the privatization of MTL, and new technologies and means of
communications. However, it has emerged as a credible regulator and appears to be well-
positioned to continue to play a leading role in the telecom sector in the future.

Energy and Water Regulation

3.2.17      While the review recommended a combined water and energy regulator,
progress has been relatively faster in the energy regulation. As a result, a new agency,
the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) was established. (The long-term goals
remain the creation of a unified water and energy regulator.) It is envisioned that the new
Authority would help implement the goals of the 2003 Power Sector Reform Strategy,
namely improving access, quality, supply, and efficiency to electricity and open up the
sector to private participation.     PURP provided training to Electricity Council on
regulations, inspections, and tariffs

3.2.18      Even though the Energy Sector Act was passed in 2003, MERA continues to
be at a very early stage of development and is not yet functional. It has oversight over
electricity and petroleum but not the remaining energy sectors (gas, coal, renewable
energy). The necessary legislation for MERA was prepared only in December 2007 with
board members appointed in early 2008. Even though MERA is supposed to subsume
the Electricity Council and the Petroleum Control Commission, no staff has yet been
appointed at MERA.

Transport Regulation Transport Sector Regulatory Authority

3.2.19      Due to the non existence of the railways regulatory function within the
Ministry of Transport and the ongoing problems with the Railway Privatization that had
occurred before the project started, there was little progress in the transport regulatory
authority function and little support provided for this purpose under PURP.


Privatization of Commercial Enterprises

3.2.20      In addition to the major utility sectors covered in the previous section, PURP
was also to support the ongoing privatization program in general and to provide specific
in-depth privatization advice to several non-utility companies. Out of the initial list of
100 enterprises slated for privatization under the 1996 Privatization Act, 65 have been
successfully privatized. Nearly a third of those privatizations occurred during PURP
project period. Following the termination of United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) funding in 2001, PURP financed the secretariat (professional
staff of the Privatization Commission (PC), which was responsible for administering the
Privatization Program on behalf of GoM. The project also financed two resident long-
term advisors who provided technical advice and input into all the privatization



                                              16

transactions undertaken during that period. This financing enabled the PC to undertake
the following necessary tasks for each privatization transaction:

            · Preparation of Enterprise Information Memorandum covering state of the
               enterprise, asset value, and completion of audited financial statement
            · Valuation of shared and determination of selling price
            · Preparing and Publishing Bid Notices
            · Dealing with Underwriters and Lawyers
            · Coordinating and participating in steering committee evaluations of
               received bid

3.2.21      PURP project also provided support to post-privatization monitoring through
training to the Public Enterprise Reform Monitoring Unit (PERMU) staff at the Ministry
of Finance though that function was eventually taken over by the PC. Annex 5 provides
brief case study examples of the impact of privatization on individual enterprises. In
addition to supporting all privatization transactions, PURP supported specific studies and
pre-privatization assistance to the following enterprises:

Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC)

3.2.22 The project funded consultants who prepared restructuring plans for ADMARC,
and supported their implementation. Restructuring started in March 2006 following
cabinet approval of the consultants' recommendations. The assets of ADMARC
Investment Holding Corporation were privatized leaving the company to concentrate on a
core business of marketing agricultural commodities. The company has retrenched more
than 400 staff and sold off some of its redundant assets.

3.2.23 The restructuring plan called for ADMARC to concentrate on the provision of
marketing services in outlying areas of the country characterized by limited private sector
investment. These services were to be subsidized based on performance measures
designed to resolve market failures. However, the government ultimately decided that
ADMARC should operate as a commercial trading company without subsidy. In effect,
the company is being asked to cross-subsidize its operations ­ using profits generated in
well-established markets to offset possible losses in outlying areas. The success of this
strategy remains uncertain.

3.2.24 The restructuring plan called upon ADMARC to pass ownership of approximately
50 percent of its warehouses to a new company, the Malawi Agricultural Warehousing
and Trading Company (MAWTCO), for lease to the private sector. The project funded
consultants who prepared business plans to underpin this transfer of assets, and the
establishment of the new warehouse leasing company. The project also funded a
consultancy outlining how a warehouse receipts system could be established in
conjunction with the expanded availability of warehouse space on the national market. As
a result of this consultancy, several private traders have expressed interest in initiating
warehouse leasing on their own. However, the formal establishment of MAWTCO and
transfer of ADMARC warehouse assets to the new leasing company are still pending.



                                             17

Malawi Savings Bank and Malawi Rural Finance Corporation:

3.2.25     Studies were conducted on both these financial institutions. These included
options for privatization, commercialization and restructuring.        Both banks remain
publicly owned though future work will be carried out under the BESTAP project.

Air Malawi

3.2.26     Decisions on what to do with Air Malawi were delayed though the GoM
appears close to reaching a decision on privatization.

Overall Privatization Program Results

3.2.27     Beyond individual case studies, it is worth reflecting on the overall impact of
the privatization program in Malawi. The Privatization Impact Assessment Study of
2007 reached the following conclusions:

       i) The Privatization Program generated MK 5.7 billion in government proceeds
           and only one privatized company, the Central East Africa Railway, received
           any form of post privatization subsidy, through a loan guarantee.
       ii) Privatization has had a significant impact on financial market development,
           both through a more vibrant banking sector (as a result of the privatization of
           NBS Bank, Stanbic Bank, National Bank and NedBank) and the development
           of the Malawi Stock Exchange, with over 15,000 individuals now owning
           shares through the MSE. Indeed, with eight out of eleven stocks resulting
           from privatization listings, it can be argued that Medium Scale Enterprise
           (MSE) owes its existence and growth to the privatization program.
       iii) There is considerable evidence, especially in the dairy and grain milling
           sectors that Malawian consumers have benefitted from better-quality products,
           wider choice, more regular supplies, and stable prices
       iv) A majority of privatized enterprises are now paying taxes as well as their
           utility bills. Through a sample of 23 enterprises for which data was made
           available, taxes paid almost doubled following privatization.
       v) Excluding Ilovo Sugar, from a sample of 39 enterprises, the study concluded
           that more jobs were created after privatization than were lost as a result of the
           privatization process. A tracer study estimated that 62 percent of those who
           lost jobs found jobs within two years, with half finding new jobs within one
           month.

3.2.28     These are concrete outcomes to which PURP contributed through supporting
the privatization program for six out of the past ten years. However, the privatization
program has not been an unmitigated success as many transactions took much longer to
be concluded, some key enterprises (in the utility, transport, and financial sectors) remain



                                            18

fully in public hands and continue to suffer from poor performance, and there were
distinct periods when public and political support for the program were not present.

3.2.29       The question then is whether the reforms, privatizations, and restructurings
that were facilitated and supported by PURP resulted in a better climate for private
investment.

Broader Impact on Private Sector Development

3.2.30       In the decade leading up to the 2004 elections, economic growth had been
volatile and weak with GDP growth averaging 3 percent . Since then, the government
has enforced strict fiscal discipline and, as a result, macroeconomic performance has been
improving rapidly since June 2004.                Nevertheless, Malawi's business environment
remains restrictive, with its Doing Business ranking for 2007 at 127 out of 178
economies measured. This is in no small measure due to the ongoing infrastructure
constraints in the transport, water, and electricity sectors which PURP was designed to
address. The government has been committed to reforms in the business environment but
progress remains slow. It remains to be seen whether the privatization program will
result in fundamental or lasting changes to Malawi's economic base, which continues to
face structural challenges due to being land-locked and to a heavy reliance on agriculture.

3.2.31       Notwithstanding this, the impact of PURP on private investment and broader
PSD needs to be judged in light of Malawi's historical context and the country's situation
at project design. There is considerable evidence that the privatization program and the
regulatory reforms that PURP facilitated have resulted in new private investments. For
example, two-thirds of the privatized entities are now majority-owned by Malawians and
one-third by foreign investors, suggesting that the privatization process has stimulated
both domestic and foreign investment. There have also been notable cases of increased
investment as a direct result of privatization. As mentioned earlier, MTL's privatization is
expected to result in up to US$100 million in new investment. Other privatizations have
also resulted in increased investments or, at a minimum, a more efficient utilization of
assets.  **  Finally, the regulatory reforms that the progress has helped facilitate, most
clearly in telecom, but also, even if to a lesser extent, in energy. As mentioned earlier,
these early initiatives in major utility sectors are now being carried forward through
ongoing or planned Bank initiatives.

3.2.32       In conclusion, the private sector development agenda in Malawi remains a
work in progress. However, it is clear that PURP has helped lay the foundations and
building blocks for the emergence of a diverse, competitive, and broad-based private
sector in the country. Whether this long-term objective will be realized is the current and
future challenge for the Government of Malawi, its international partners in the donor
community, and the private sector itself.



**Other enterprise privatizations also resulted in significant investments, such as the Grain Milling which
resulted in US$ 15 million in new plant modernizations. See Annex for additional case studies.

3.3.1 The Table above summarizes the PURP's efficiency with reference to the period
after restructuring in 2005. Computing the ERR and financial returns by each component
was not done given overlaps, data limitations and the qualitative nature of most of the
components' outputs (largely relating to restructuring reforms in public utilities and the
sector's regulating institutions). Overall, however, the PURP project registered high
efficiency gains. The overall ERR and FRR of 117 percent and 76 percent respectively,
are way above the 33 percent weighted discount rate over the project's life since
restructuring.

3.3.2 The costs reflect the IDA and borrower's own financial support as well as the
subsidies and tax breaks. Benefits were calculated based on willingness to pay for the
incremental services provided by the privatized/restructured firms. Also cost savings
arising from retrenchments and productivity gains were taken into account. Privatization



                                                                                     CFi
  These are found using the Net present value formulation: NPV = 0 = CF0 +          (1+ r)n
Where NPV=Net Present value; CF0 = initial investment; CFi = net cash flow in period i; n = the number of years being
discounted; and r = the Internal rate of return (IRR) we are interested in finding. Both the ERR and FRR utilise the IRR
principle ­ interest rate at which the costs and benefits of the PURP project, over its life after restructuring in 2005, are
equal. The IRR converts into ERR when we consider the willingness by people to pay for services not traded yet like
the price of US$11 per land line people are ready to pay over the 100,000 land lines invested on by the consortium
Telecom Holdings; the incremental postage stamp price of over US$0.60 that people are willing to pay per letter after
restructuring. The ERR is also taking into account price controls and subsidies as distortionary costs that existed in the
system ­ amounts averaging around US$215,000 each year. On the other hand, the FRR factors out the distortionary
costs (subsidies and price controls) but instead only considers the expenditures and returns by the
privatised/restructured firms (including the savings of around US$5000 per month arising from retrenchments as well
as the productivity growth especially in the postal sector).

  The World Bank uses an ERR threshold of 10%.


                                                             20

proceeds along with the 30 percent rate corporate tax revenue arising from the privatized
firms' profits are not included in the ERR and IRR reported in the table above.

3.3.3 The Net Present Value (NPV) was not calculated since it was not calculated at
appraisal point thereby any calculations at completion would lack a comparison basis.
More importantly, NPVs are primarily used in choosing between two competing projects
while the ERR reflect s a project's efficiency hence more preferred under this analytical
context.

3.4 Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.4.1       The privatization programme resulted in increased access by the private sector
to markets that were not otherwise accessible. At the same time there was the inevitable
short term loss of jobs due to restructuring and rationalization in the privatized
enterprises. The overall outcome of the labour aspect is that more jobs were created.
Furthermore, the privatized enterprises ceased to use treasury resources and instead
contribute to the national budget through increased direct and indirect taxation.

3.4.2       The project provided specialized training to all the participating institutions.
Some of the training, especially for the regulatory institutions was of a specialized nature.
The capacity of the PC in particular was very much enhanced to the level that the
institution now has capacity to continue undertaking PPP functions. Apart from human
resource capacity building, some implementing agencies notably the regulatory
authorities and the Postal Corporation also received specialized equipment, Information
and Communication Technology (ICT) Systems and motor vehicles which are critical for
the success of their operations.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.5.1       Firstly, the beneficiary survey results indicated that the privatized firms had
improved quality of their goods and service delivery and hence their profitability. The
survey results indicated some financial injections which increased the enterprises' total
assets thus increasing their reach and profitability. Furthermore, most of these also
increased production capacity and increased the scope of production which would entail
increased economies.

3.5.2       In addition, the results of the survey indicated benefits accrued to the local
population despite some setbacks in a few enterprises.           The privatized enterprises
increased their production and other service providers were encouraged into the market,
increasing quality and choice of products and services for locals. The overall increase in
number of jobs after privatization in most enterprises indicates additional benefit to the
local population.

3.5.3       The extra tax revenue collected from the enterprises that indicated positive
returns and the reduction of state subsidies from K1.54bn to K0.8bn increased the



                                             21

Government's ability to invest in other priority areas and to improve the living standards
of the local population.

3.5.4       From the stakeholder workshops, it became obvious that trade unions in
particular, were concerned that the privatization process had not led to increased
efficiencies in some of the privatized companies and that the government had not been
sufficiently transparent in the use of privatization proceeds. The workshops also
highlighted the communications gap between the privatization project and its
stakeholders many of whom had no understanding of the benefits expected from
privatization. A significant number of Government Ministers voiced concerns that the
PIU was aloof from the government leading to perception that the project was not the
Government's but the World Bank's.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome (Rating: Modest)

4.1         The risk to development outcomes is modest. Ordinarily, once a public
enterprise has been privatised, there should be no need for continuing financial assistance
from the state. Similarly, under the commercialisation component - once a public
enterprise has been restructured and good governance, improved revenue base, increased
volume of business and cost effectiveness are established, this should lead to operations
breaking even or better. Finally, for the regulatory authorities, once the regulatory
functions have been strengthened by establishing the legal framework and institutional
capacity, the risk to its sustainability would be moderate/ modest.

4.2         Mitigating factors include GoM's commitment to move ahead with improving
the investment climate. The willingness to establish regulators in the critical economic
sectors will also help to build confidence locally and internationally. In both areas there is
a continuing need for IDA engagement in policy dialogue and in providing "how to"
services.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (Rating: Moderately satisfactory)

5.1.1       Generally the World Bank carried out a comprehensive analysis of key risks
and instituted adequate mitigation measures at the entry phase including drawing on the
lessons learned from similar reform projects. An important issue that was not fully
analysed was the time required to carry out reforms prior to undertaking certain
transactions. This meant that some envisaged project outputs and outcomes could not be
achieved within the life span of the project. Areas where the World Bank could have
done better are: establishing a PAC from the start of the project, the project's governance
framework and in ensuring adequate procurement and M&E capacity at the PIU from the
start.

Quality of Supervision (Rating: Satisfactory)

5.1.2       IDA made regular implementation support missions to the project. Reviews
of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Post Procurement Reviews (PPRs) by World
Bank staff provided continuous improvement and learning for Borrower staff. The World
Bank could have acted sooner to address the slow implementation problems in the early
stages of the project. The presence of the Task Team Leader in the country office from
2005 strengthened the communication between IDA and the Borrower. The response time
to requests for No Objection averaged four working days, with the exception of issues
which needed more careful analysis and very large procurements.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

5.1.3       The World Bank constantly monitored outputs, outcomes and the political
climate and, engaged GoM in dialogue that was at times very difficult. IDA was
influential in advising GoM on implementation and policy issues within the prevailing
political climate and economic outlook to keep the project on track to achieve its PDO.
The World Bank proactively undertook a restructuring of the project to address slow
implementation and disbursement. Although it did not appear to affect implementation, it
is noteworthy that the project changed Task Team Leaders three times in its seven year
life.


5.2 Borrower Performance
Government Performance (Rating: Moderately Satisfactory)

5.2.1       Although government showed commitment by enacting the Public Enterprise
(Privatization) Act in 1996, the privatization program was suspended twice, in 2001 and
2004. Slow progress in building consensus on key transactions like MTL, the power and
water utilities also affected project outcomes. In addition shortfalls of over US$900,000
on the subvention to MPC and a non functional steering committee prior to 2005 affected



                                            23

project progress. GoM was frequently in default on its contributions to project costs and
often very slow with decisions affecting privatization transactions.

5.2.2       Government, however, showed commitment through making significant
progress in making policy changes and implementing some of the reforms.


Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance (Rating: Satisfactory)

5.2.3       Although the PIU's performance in coordinating implementation was weak in
the first three years of project life, its performance was above average from 2003. Large
procurements were undertaken and politically sensitive transactions were cleared with
government. Its procurement and financial management staff constantly provided support
to project beneficiaries and sought to improve communication with the World Bank. The
PIU was proactive in noting changes in political temperature affecting project
implementation and recommending reallocation of resources where necessary without
jeopardizing attainment of project objectives.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance (Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory)

5.2.4       Although GoM achieved over 94 percent disbursement of the credit,
strengthened the envisaged regulatory framework, implemented the Postal Sector
Investment Programme its achievements on the privatization component were moderately
satisfactory due to slow progress on certain major transactions. Power and Water Sector
Reforms could not be fully implemented due to delays in building consensus among
stakeholders. Although there was considerable progress in facilitating future
implementation of the reforms, poor service levels in these sectors remain key challenges
to private sector led growth.


6. Lessons Learned
6.1         There is need for consensus on privatization issues especially with the policy
makers. A robust and well targeted public awareness program is critical to sustain public
support, especially for the larger, politically difficult transactions. In the second half of
the project implementation this aspect was very much reinforced leading to a speedier
implementation.

6.2         At the outset there was a need to have a dedicated M&E officer either within
the PIU or the PC to ease pressure on other staff in dealing with these issues and to be
able to identify implementation difficulties sooner rather than later.

6.3         Overestimation of capacity within the PC at project design meant that the
project did not have adequate procurement and financial management capacity in the first
three years of project life. This effectively delayed achievement of project outcomes and




                                               24

outputs. For the future it will be important to properly assess capacity specific to project
requirements.

6.4        A communications strategy that targets all key stakeholders and constantly
provides all relevant and accurate information in a timely matter is critical to the success
of reforms of this nature.

6.5        Project design and implementation should retain sufficient flexibility to reflect
changes in context and country priorities. The restructuring of PURP allowed the project
to remain relevant and use its resources to reflect a new stage in private sector
programming and development. This was greatly aided by the presence in country of the
TTL, an essential condition for sensitization to country conditions and policy dialogue.

  1   Divestiture of GoM      This component substantially met its objectives. In
      ownership in            2007 GoM sold 80 percent of its shares in MTL to
      telecommunications,     the private sector and out of the 100 public
      power, water and        enterprises originally approved on the DSP, 65 had
      other PEs               been privatized by the close of the project.     The
                              preparation of ESCOM for privatization has reached
                              a point where the strategies have been revalidated.
                              The actual transaction would however need to be
                              funded from government's own resources or from a
                              follow-up project.    As for the Water Boards, the
                              preparatory work was removed from this project
                              during restructuring and is being undertaken under
                              the recently approved Second National Water
                              Development Project (P110157).

                              The PC diversified seventy (70) public enterprises
                              that were on the Divestiture Sequence Plan, by the
                              close of the project. The original requirement was to
                              divest seven (7) PEs by 31 December, 2004 (the
                              original closing date of the project).

  2   Review of need for      Review of the need to establish multi-sectoral
      and, establishment of   regulator was undertaken using a PPIAF funding.
      multi-sectoral          Conclusion was to set up three MSR's; for (i)
      regulator (MSR) for     Telecommunications (ii) Energy and Water and (iii)
      utilities and public    Transport
      services

                              Telecommunications Regulator (MACRA) became
                              operational in 2000. The Energy Regulator (MERA)
                              was established soon after the project closed. The
                              Water component (become MWERA) would join as
                              soon as the sector was ready. The Transport
                              Regulator (TRANSRA) was yet to be established.




                                         28

  Strengthening of     MACRA received support on human resource
  regulatory functions development and the procurement of a spectrum
  in telecoms, posts,  monitoring and management system.
  power and railways   The former energy regulator (Electricity Council)
                       received support in human resource development and
                       the procurement of specialized power measurement
                       and monitoring equipment.
                       The Ministry of Transport was to undertake the
                       regulatory function for the railways sector. Due to
                       challenges in the establishment of the regulatory unit
                       this component did not receive any support.
3 Commercialization    By the close of the project 90 percent of mail posted
                       from one city was delivered to another city by the
                       third day compared to a target of 65 percent by the
                       close of project on 31 December, 2004.
                       By the close of the project, the number of letter
                       handled per staff member increased significantly
                       mainly due to the retrenchment of staff.
                       By the year 2005, the Malawi Postal Corporation
                       posted profits and has consistently done so thereafter.


4 Pre-privatization    This component met its objectives. Pre-privatization
  assistance           activities   for  MTL     and    for  ESCOM       were
                       satisfactorily completed. In the case of MTL, this led
                       to successful privatization of the public enterprise. In
                       the case of ESCOM, GoM is considering the options
                       put forward by consultants for unbundling ESCOM
                       and for revising its tariff structure.    Although an
                       accounting and asset management software were not
                       procured as recommended by consultants, it was
                       generally agreed that these items would be funded by
                       the strategic equity partner as experience showed that
                       these would normally be changed to suit the new
                       private owners/ operators.      The project provided
                       support to obtain Y2K compliant software and
                       resources to support the transaction advisory services.

                       Agricultural     Development        and     Marketing
                       Corporation     (ADMARC):       The   project   funded
                       consultants who prepared restructuring plans for
                       ADMARC, and supported their implementation.
                       Restructuring started in March 2006 following
                       cabinet      approval      of      the     consultants'
                       recommendations.      The     assets  of    ADMARC
                       Investment Holding Corporation were privatized


                                  29

                      leaving the company to concentrate on a core
                      business of marketing agricultural commodities. The
                      company has retrenched more than 400 staff and sold
                      off some of its redundant assets.

                      The restructuring plan called for ADMARC to
                      concentrate on the provision of marketing services in
                      outlying areas of the country characterized by limited
                      private sector investment. These services were to be
                      subsidized based on performance measures designed
                      to resolve market failures. However, the government
                      ultimately decided that ADMARC should operate as
                      a commercial trading company without subsidy. In
                      effect, the company is being asked to cross-subsidize
                      its operations ­ using profits generated in well-
                      established markets to offset possible losses in
                      outlying areas. The success of this strategy remains
                      uncertain.

                      The restructuring plan called upon ADMARC to pass
                      ownership of approximately 50% of its warehouses to
                      a    new    company,      the  Malawi     Agricultural
                      Warehousing and Trading Company (MAWTCO),
                      for lease to the private sector. The project funded
                      consultants who prepared business plans to underpin
                      this transfer of assets, and the establishment of the
                      new warehouse leasing company. The project also
                      funded a consultancy outlining how a warehouse
                      receipts system could be established in conjunction
                      with the expanded availability of warehouse space on
                      the national market. As a result of this consultancy,
                      several private traders have expressed interest in
                      initiating warehouse leasing on their own. However,
                      the formal establishment of MAWTCO and transfer
                      of ADMARC warehouse assets to the new leasing
                      company are still pending.

5 Post Privatization  This component marginally met its objectives. Post
  Monitoring          privatization monitoring, supposedly a function of
                      PERMU in the Ministry of Finance, was ultimately
                      being done by the PC because of a lack of capacity in
                      the Ministry of finance to do this. Not only did the
                      PC have limited resources with which to do this
                      function, it is not the ideal agency for it because of
                      potential conflict of interest.

6. Implementation &   This component fully met is objectives. The PIU had
   Capacity Building  highly trained and motivated staff who have gone on
                      to become the PIU for a similar IDA-funded project.
                      After a slow start, it is generally recognised that the
                      PIU performed to a very high standard.

    MALAWI: PRIVATIZATION AND UTILITY REFORM PROJECT (PURP)

The PURP project registered high efficiency gains with overall ERR and FRR gains of
117 percent and 76 percent respectively. These rates are way above the prevailing 15
percent central bank base lending rate and the 33 percent weighted discount rate over the
project's life since restructuring.

1. Benefits were calculated based on willingness to pay for the incremental services
provided by the privatized/restructured firms. Also cost savings arising from
retrenchments and productivity gains were taken into account. Privatization proceeds
along with the 30 percent rate corporate tax revenue arising from the privatized firms'
profits are not included in the ERR and IRR reported in the table above. If included, the
ERR and FRR would perform even better.

2. The costs reflect the IDA and borrower's own financial support as well as the subsidies
and tax breaks.

3. The ERR and FRR were calculated over the period 2005-2007 when the restructured
project was under implementation. The discounting rate at appraisal was circa 30 percent
but a weighted discount rate of 33 percent over the three year (2005-2007) period when
the restructured project was in operation, was used to compare against the ERR and FRR.

4. There were no NPVs, ERR and FRR calculated at appraisal making comparison with
the rates at completion impossible. Nevertheless, the project is shown to have achieved
high efficiency levels such that any differences between the appraisal and project's
completion point efficiency levels would have been insignificant and only reflecting
increases in capital investment costs over the project's life.

5. Given that the project was mostly providing technical assistance aimed at supporting
the privatization and utility reform process and building capacity for regulation, the
outputs are mostly relating to increases in service access and quality (see Annex 2).
Undoubtedly, not withstanding the costs relating to technical and allocative inefficiency,
including the shadow prices of the incremental quality and access benefits would have
improved the ERR and FRR gains reported in Section 3.3.

6. Further, a number of indirect economic benefits are more likely to accrue with a lag
and may not be easily captured in the efficiency estimates reported. These relate to
productivity gains; increased output (and hence profitability) resulting from additional
capital investments by the privatized/restructured firms; additional income from the net
creation of jobs; factor cost savings from the reduction of average production costs of the
privatized utility companies; and consumer surplus from improved access and quality of
utility services provided.

                            Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results

MALAWI: PRIVATIZATION AND UTILITY REFORM PROJECT (PURP)


The beneficiaries were categorized into three broad target groups: (i) Private sector (ii)
Local population and, (iii) the Government.

Private Sector: The project intended to provide strong incentives for improving service
delivery in the utility sectors which is currently one of the major constraints to private
sector development. The following were the survey results:

    i) Agrimal Malawi Limited, manufacturer of agriculture tools and equipment
         showed an increase in profitability with profit before tax in post-privatization
         period increasing by 121 percent as compared to pre-privatization.

    ii) Alexander Forbes, an Insurance Broking and Risk Management Enterprise, added
         two new employees and indicated capital injection resulting in a 25 percent
         increase in total assets and 88 percent increase in operating profits by 2007.

    iii) Auction Holdings, specialists in selling tobacco, the company had experienced
         financial problems but after privatization there was an increase in profit before tax
         of 550 percent.

    iv) Blantyre Lodge, accommodation and restaurant; the lodge now also serves as bus
         terminal. Management of the privatized company confirmed that post-
         privatization business is profitable.

    v) Bwemba Farm, a dairy farm and inactive farm prior to privatization; the farm is
         now active in dairy and beef production. Production was on average 28000 liters
         of milk and 2500kgs of beef and employment was at 50 (both from zero prior to
         privatization).

    vi) Chemicals and Marketing Limited, trading in agricultural chemicals, industrial
         chemicals and pharmaceutical lubricants; the company had started trading in
         maize seed as well post- privatization. Post privatization data showed a 125
         percent growth in profit before tax

Local population: Individual customers using utility and other services were to benefit
from improved access, volume and quality of services resulting from improvements in
operational efficiency and network extension. From the Price Water House Coopers
report (Privatization Impact Assessment Study, Final Report, Volume 2, March 2007),
there are numerous examples of how the local population is seen to have benefited from
the process but below are just a few:

    i) Bakhresa Milling Malawi Limited (formerly Grain and Milling Company),
         improved its efficiency in operations and thus improved its production capacity as


                                              35

         well as added manufacturing of soap apart from the wheat and maize it was
         producing. It is thriving alongside another milling companies thus ensuring
         improved quality and prices for consumers through competition;

    ii) Mapeto Pvt. Limited (DWSM) decreased its production capacity post-
         privatization considerably but registered an operating profit. Company appears to
         have management problems bringing into doubt whether efficiency improvements
         have benefited the public other than indirectly through reduction in state
         subsidies;

    iii) MTL's privatization has seen an big improvement in connectivity, transparency in
         billing system better and cheaper access to international networks, availability of
         another cell-phone network provider ensuring competitive prices, short waiting
         time for connection times - consequently choices to Malawian consumers have
         improved;

    iv) Dairibord Malawi Limited (formally Malawi Dairy Industry): This privatization
         transaction created great competition in the diary industry with significant
         benefits to consumers in terms of price and quality. In Blantyre, farmers have
         benefited from having a reliable buyer for their products and also incentives
         arising from competition between two companies. Consumers were also
         benefiting from an increase in number of products (an addition of other products
         like ice cream post privatization); and

    v) The local population benefited from increased employment in some of the
         privatized enterprises. It was estimated that in the short term 2,441 jobs were
         created as compared to 2,270 (excluding ILLOVO) that were lost especially in the
         manufacturing sector and the older banks that were investing in new capital-
         intensive technology (Malawi Privatization Commission: Privatization Social
         Impact Study, final report, March 2007).

Government: was to receive indirect effects from the reduction of investments in the
utility sectors and increased tax revenue from privatized entities. The impact from this
was the possibility of the project to free up scarce public resources for investment in
social programs and other priority activities likely to accrue to the poor;

    i) Most of the enterprises with a few exceptions registered an increase in profits
         therefore translating into an increase in tax revenue collected from these entities.
         The extra tax revenue coupled with the reduction of state subsidies from the
         MK1.54bn to MK0.8bn increased the government's ability to invest in other
         priority areas to improve the living standards of Malawians.

                        Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop and Results

MALAWI: PRIVATIZATION AND UTILITY REFORM PROJECT (PURP)


Based on the Mid Term Review meeting with stakeholders in 2003, the following were
the stakeholders' views:

     i) The stakeholders acknowledged that there was inadequate finance for pre-
          privatization activities and agreed to allocate additional resources to MTL, MSB,
          ESCOM and MPC;

     ii) There was low disbursement rate (17.6 percent at MTR) and stakeholders agreed
          to reallocate funding to viable areas like "the private sector development
          component";

     iii) The workshop noted the lack of safety nets for retrenched staff and agreed to
          create a new category to carter for training retrenched employees and thus
          establish a local loan fund;

     iv) The workshop agreed to propose to IDA the possibility of financing private sector
          development as a new component under this project to tackle the problem of slow
          growth in the development of the private sector; and

     v) The workshop agreed to revise the performance indicators which were believed to
          be unrealistic and suggestions on the new indicator targets were made.

From the High level conference held in January 2005 in Lilongwe, the following were
some of the stakeholders' views:

i) The State President commented that the private sector has a major role to play in
     lifting Malawi up from poverty thus the National Economic empowerment policy
     would take the opportunity to use privatization as a tool for the implementation of the
     development objectives and priorities of the country;

ii) Some stakeholders were concerned that in some cases privatization did not lead to
     improved service as in the case of Le Meridian Hotels. In addition, some stakeholders
     felt the use of privatization proceeds was not transparent enough. The PC was not
     doing enough in terms of information dissemination and public awareness.

iii) In response, the PC mentioned that most entities that were privatized were working
     well with a few exceptions like Malawi Railways which suffered due to delays in the
     concession of the Mozambique section. The PC would launch a PA campaign with
     focused messages to target key stakeholders at various levels. The PC acknowledged




                                               37

    the lack of transparency in the use of proceeds from the privatization processes and
    that measures were being put in place to improve this;

iv) The workshop noted problems in implementation which have caused privatizations to
    go wrong and companies to be liquidated and also that there was no plan for dealing
    with job losses;

v) The stakeholders wanted to know which forms of privatization were to be considered
    as appropriate. PPPs were felt to be desirable and they also wanted to know if the
    enterprises could be restructured instead of privatized. The workshop was notified
    that plans were underway to use the PPP structure for Water Boards and BOT for our
    two international airports, Chileka and Lilongwe;

vi) The participants thought it wise to ensure that government policy was consistent with
    the privatization notion to fast track economic development;

vii)The workshop also clarified the extent to which privatization is appropriate in
    reference to social/ non-commercial sectors and there were concerns on the sale
    prices of the assets as some participants felt the enterprises were going at give away
    prices and to foreigners rather than indigenous Malawians who had not participated in
    larger and profitable transactions.

viii)   It was noted that issues of concern like the health care services were to be decided
    at cabinet level in terms of which services could be privatized and then they could be
    included in DSP for implementation.

ix) In addition, the workshop was informed that the pricing of the companies was based
    on the selection of the highest bidder. The PC was also enhancing existing
    mechanisms to increase Malawian participation in the ownership of the enterprises
    but the workshop noted that existing mechanisms were better than those in most
    Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) countries; and

x) The other concern was on post privatization monitoring and whether the PC had
    adequate procedures and capacity to monitor the privatized companies. The workshop
    was informed that an Investment Monitoring Committee was set up for this purpose.

             Annex 7: Summary of Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

MALAWI: PRIVATIZATION AND UTILITY REFORM PROJECT (PURP)


The PURP played a critical role in facilitating the much needed reforms in the utility and
financial sectors of Malawi. The government's declared policy of counting on the private
sector as the engine of growth was, prior to 2000, increasingly being frustrated by
unacceptably low levels of access to utilities especially electricity, water and
telecommunication services.

In the electricity sector, PURP supported consultancy studies aimed at coming up with
sustainable electricity tariffs regimes, designing an accounting system and valuation of
ESCOM's assets as a prelude towards the planned split of ESCOM into three strategic
business units as provided for in the national power reform strategy.

PURP was instrumental in facilitating what is so far the largest privatization transaction
in terms of resource consumption and funds flow. In February, 2006, the sole fixed line
national telephone provider, MTL, was privatised. The total funds flow generated was
US$ 30.7 million. Based on the first post privatization review of MTL undertaken in
2007, the entity has registered a growth in telephone lines from 40,000 to 150,000. In
order to avoid the possibility of abuse by the private owned MTL on public broadcasting,
PURP disbursed US$ 2.7 million to finance a satellite signal distribution project. This
has enabled the two public broadcasters to distribute their program content through
satellite rather than terrestrial networks as was the case before. This has resulted in a
much improved and welcome broadcasting quality.

The government made an attempt to privatise the national airline, Air Malawi, in 2003.
The privatization transaction was preceded by extensive specialised studies and
marketing initiatives all of which were financed by PURP. The transaction was not
successful mainly on account of the global recession that hit the airline industry primarily
as a result of 9/11 terrorist attacks and the war in Iraq. After abandoning privatization
efforts, the project nonetheless made resources available aimed at shoring up the value of
the airline through making available an international commercial airline expert to support
the management in developing viable routes for the airline and spearheading a cost
rationalisation initiative.

An equally memorable role played by the project was the project's intervention towards
re-energizing the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) and the
National Electricity Council (NECO) through capacity building initiatives. The whole
area of regulation is still evolving as ultimately the GoM's intention is to establish a
Multi-Sector Regulator (MSR). However, in the interim, MACRA and NECO provided a
measure of regulation in the communication and electricity sectors that made a difference
in the sector.



                                             39

Critical in the implementation of the privatization programme is the ability to retain
professional staff to coordinate and supervise the privatization process. In this vein, the
project supported the salaries of professional staff at the PC in addition to financing a
fully fledged project implementation unit. As a result of this, The PC was able to retain
key staff which could have been lost to the private sector or international agencies. The
project also facilitated the recruitment of a senior privatization advisor to support local
staff in carrying out complex transactions. Of particular significance was the project's
role in capacity building through training especially in the area of public private
partnership (PPP), promoting public awareness on privatization and formulation of a
privatization strategy.

Perhaps the most outstanding achievement was the remarkable transformation of The
Malawi Postal Corporation (MPC). The corporation was undercapitalized and literally
insolvent immediately after being de-linked from the then Malawi Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation. The project was responsible for capacitating key
management position through training and promoting skills transfer through a twinning
arrangement between MPC and a British counterpart.

The two suspensions of the privatization programme, described earlier, to some degree
affected the rate of implementation of the privatization program and therefore the rate of
disbursement by the project. This inevitably precipitated into the project being
restructured in 2005 in order to reflect the changed circumstances since the onset of the
program.
