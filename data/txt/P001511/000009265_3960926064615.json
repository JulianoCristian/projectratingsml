Adjustment\n            Program Project in Madagascar was achieved. The Bank played\n            an important role in the implementation of the project.\n            Madagascar has made significant progress in its shift from a\n            command economy, with almost two decades of economic\n            decline, to a market oriented economy. From 1988 to 1990,\n            economic recovery continued at a reasonable pace, although\n            Madagascar still remains highly dependent on external aid.\n            Efforts must be made to stimulate private savings and\n            investment among both households and enterprises and to\n            expand exports. ITPAC was successful in carrying forward the\n            reform effort in Madagascar and setting the stage for\n            renewed interest in Madagascar by domestic and foreign\n            private investors. The program design lesson from this\n            experience is that when multiple objectives are to be\n            achieved, the pace is dictated by the slower actions to be\n            implemented. Public enterprise reform, although an important\n            objective, had an impact on trade reform which was advancing\n            on a faster track. Lapses in macroeconomic management and\n            lower than expected export expansion, together with the\n            delay in tranche release, contributed to the reemergence of\n            foreign exchange constraints and threatened the\n            sustainability of the program."}, "docdt": "1992-04-15T00:00:00Z"}
