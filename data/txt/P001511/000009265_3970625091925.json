Adjustment\n            Credit aims at supporting policy reforms designed to\n            increase the efficiency and productivity of the economy,\n            reallocate resources to the more productive sectors,\n            reorient these sectors towards exports and a greater use of\n            domestic inputs, and stimulate the revival of the efficient\n            segments of the industrial sector. Following a significant\n            effort in the area of economic stabilization and some\n            initial policy improvements at the sectoral level, the\n            cornerstone of the policy package is a major trade\n            liberalization supported by exchange rate adjustment. The\n            broadening of a market-oriented system for allocating\n            foreign exchange would be accompanied by the removal of\n            protective import prohibitions, rationalization of the\n            import tariff structure and further price decontrol. The\n            policy package would also include measures in the areas of\n            public investment, public enterprises and the banking\n            system. The quick-disbursing proceeds of the Credits would\n            increase the total amount of foreign exchange available to\n            finance imports by all economic agents under a liberalized\n            import regime, thereby supporting the movement towards a\n            market determined foreign exchange allocation system."}, "docdt": "1987-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
