MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$31.5 MILLION
TO THE
REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA
FOR A
SECONDARY AND REGIONAL ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Guatemala for US$31.5 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be repayable over 20 years, including five years of grace, at the
Bank's variable interest rate and charges.
2.       Background.  Throughout the 1970's and early 1980's, transport has
accounted for a high share of public sector investment, and as a result
Guatemala's basic transport system is essentially in place. The Ministry
of Communications, Transport and Public Works (MCTOP) is the main
Government agency with responsibility over the various transport modes, but
its role has been hampered by the lack of a comprehensive framework fcr
sector management and policy formulation. This led, under past
administrations, to unbalanced resource allocations for the various
transport modes, with expenditures in the highways subsector declining
during the 1980's to levels well below what was required to effectively
preserve the 12,000 km of roads comprising the national network. MCTOP is
now giving priority to the rehabilitation of Guatemala's very deteriorated
road network, with due emphasis to high priority secondary roads and
regional roads in the Altiplano region, and to the institutional
strengthening of its General Directorate for Roads (DGC). MCTOP's
priorities are in line with the recommendations of studies prepared under
the recently completed Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 1846-GU).
Moreover, the Government has also showed its willingness to improve
multimodal transport coordination, by expanding the role of MCTOP in sector
management.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Prior Bank involvement in the
sector has helped train and staff a basic maintenance organization, while
also assisting DGC in the implementation of road and equipment management
systems in two road districts, and in the preparation of a road maintenance
rnd rehabilitation program. With the availability of other financing
sources for the rehabilitation of the country's main external trade
corridors, the Bank has a further role to play in assisting DGC in the full
implementation of comprehensive road management systems nationwide, and in
providing finance for secondary and Altiplano regional road rehabilitation
in support of agricultural growth and export diversification. The Bank's
continuing involvement would also help develop integrated transport sector
planning, which would serve to improve the allocation of public funds
between the various transport modes. Through its participation in the
project, the Bank will ensure that the institutional objectives of the
sector are pursued and will promote improvement and coordination in other
transport modes (ports, railways) in which the Bank has not been hitherto
active.
4.       Proiect Objectives.  The main objectives pursued under the
proposed project comprise: (a) to reinforce and further develop institution
building efforts at the level of DGC initiated under the last Bank project
(Loan 1846-GU); (b) to rehabilitate and maintain damaged secondary and
regional roads of key economic importance; (c) to promote the role of the



inadequate or untimely action not just in Algeria but also in the region require
quick mobilization of resources to combat the problem. Immediate action is
required to minimize, if not avert, economic disruption to some 39.7 million
hectares of Algeria's productive lands and to protect the livelihood of some
11.9 million people potentially at risk in the invaded areas. Algeria currently
lacks the foreign exchange required to mount an effective campaign; international
donor assistance currently mobilized is inadequate to finance total campaign
requirements. The proposed project would support the Government's national
locust control program, and would further complement the new regional efforts
that are taking place in the Maghreb and Sahel countries to provide a concerted
approach to the treatment of locusts in the region.
Project Objectives
5.       A two-pronged approach to mounting a successful locust control
operation is proposed under the project. The project would first of all support
urgent Government initiatives underway for locust control for the current and
the next two campaigns. Simultaneously, improvements in permanent surveillance
and warning systems linked to prevention activities would be pursued.
Project Descrpton
6.       The project would support:
(a) Three locust control campaigns over an estimated total of 6.5 million
hectares in the period October 1988 (start of the current campaign) to
January 1990. This would require the utilization of a total of
approximately 4 million liters equivalent of pesticides, aerial
spraying over an estimated 4.5 million hectares and ground control over
an estimated 2 million hectares;
(b) The strenRthening of national locust control capabilities. The project
would reinforce the existing stock of suitable vehicles and field
equipment that can be mobilized as necessary for control activities;
(c) The reinforcement of comprehensive surveillance and warning systems
covering the country. The project would provide improvements in the
telecommunications, meteorological and information dissemination
networks. Vehicles for locust reconnaissance activity would also be
provided; and
(d) Provision of technical assistance and training to improve effectiveness
of locust control activities and prospection methods.
7.       The project, to be carried out over two years, would provide funds for
equipment, vehicles, leasing of aircraft, pesticides, technical assistance and
training. The total cost of the operation is estimated at US$112 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$58 million (52%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Algeria are given in Schedule C and D
respectively. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7487-AL, dated December 20, 1988,
is also attached.

Agreed Actions
8.       The Government has agreed to (i) use only those pesticides in its
locust control operations that have been approved by the FAO as causing minimum
danger to humans and to the environment; and (ii) enforce appropriate disposal
mechanisms for pesticide effluents by March 31, 1989. In addition, assurances
were obtained at negotiations that pesticide spraying on ecologically sensitive
areas would be limited to the fullest extent possible and that adequate
environmental monitoring systems would be set up.
Benefis
9.       The benefits of an effective locust control campaign are that 39.7
million hectares of productive agricultural lands which would otherwise be at
risk of locust invasion and resulting damage would now be protected. The
economic value of production of these lands is estimated at DA 22 billion
(US$3.4 billion equivalent) per year; some 11.9 million people depend either
directly or indirectly for their livelihood on agricultural activities in this
area. The economic rate of return of the Government's locust control program,
assuming that its implementation results in protection of only 1.52 of
agricultural production in the country, is of the order of 50X. In addition, a
successful campaign in one year reduces the potential risk of locust
multiplication and re-invasion in succeeding years, botL in Algeria and in its
neighbors.
Riks
10.      The major risk of the project relates to the appropriate use of
pesticides in the locust control operation. This risk is minimized through the
Government's agreement to only use those pesticides that have been approved by
the FAO for locust control activities and through the provision of technical
assistance to staff in safe pesticide handling and application techniques. In
addition, the Government has agreed to implement adequate safeguard measures
related to pesticide use, and to take appropriate measures to deal with
pesticide washings and effluents. Another risk would be the inadequate
institutional capacity within the country to effectively manage such an
operation; however, Algeria's successful anti-locust campaign of 1987-88 on a
scale commensurate with the proposed project demonstrates the adequacy of its
institutional arrangements, which, in addition, have been adjusted and
strengthened based on past experience. The project will require close
supervision in order to determine campaign requirements for 1989-90 based on the
success of locust control activities in Algeria and elsewhere in the region and
to erable fine-tuning of project strategy as necessary.
Recommendation
11.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
