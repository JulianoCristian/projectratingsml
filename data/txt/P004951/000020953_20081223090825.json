Partly as a result\n            of the successful anti-locust campaigns mounted by Algeria\n            and other countries between 1987 and 1988, there was minimal\n            locust activity during the project period and consequently\n            little damage was inflicted to agriculture. Thus, although\n            the benefits of the project cannot be quantified as had been\n            done at appraisal, the project achieved its main objective\n            which was to ensure that Algeria would have the\n            institutional capacity and effective means at its disposal\n            to (a) control any impending locust invasions and (b)\n            predict locust activity and movement thereby facilitating\n            planning and implementation of future control programs, both\n            in situations of plague and recession."}, "docdt": "1993-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
