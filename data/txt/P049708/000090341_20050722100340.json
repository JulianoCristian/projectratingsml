Such projects\n            should also incorporate a strong monitoring system to adapt\n            to changing circumstances.

High risk projects should\n            build in a risk mitigation strategy. Operating policies and\n            procedures should be tested during the pilot phase and then\n            reviewed in light of the lessons learnt."}, "docdt": "2005-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
