help\n            enhance export competitiveness and thereby prospects for\n            sustainable rapid growth by facilitating private sector\n            access to know-how for improved productivity, quality,\n            design and response time, as well as diversification of\n            export production. The project consists of: a) promoting the\n            diffusion of good technology practices through a Technology\n            Diffusion Scheme which will share the cost in improving the\n            private sector's access to productivity, quality, and\n            design services, and to information on new technologies; b)\n            strengthening the MSTQ (metrology, standards, testing,\n            quality) infrastructure to improve export quality; c) trade\n            facilitation through the implementation of a program to\n            speed up the process of trade documentation clearance, and\n            to streamline critical procedural and operational areas in\n            import and export documentation, with the aim of eliminating\n            the need to physically present documents to the various\n            organizations concerned. To ensure that these initiatives\n            lead to tangible and early results, the project will also\n            support the implementation of economic and regulatory\n            reforms outlined in recent sector work, specifically\n            provision of technical assistance: in restructuring the\n            investment authorization process to improve the acquisition\n            of foreign technology; in reviewing and restructuring the\n            retirement savings system to improve flexibility in factor\n            markets; and in developing competitiveness and productivity\n            indicators to improve access to information by both the\n            private and public sectors."}, "docdt": "1994-05-02T00:00:00Z"}
