All of its\n            components offer valuable lessons. The Metrology, Standards,\n            Testing, and Quality (MSTG) component reveal that\n            accreditation of the domestic service provider, by reputable\n            international organizations, and the establishment of\n            twinning arrangements, are effective alternatives to\n            traditional bureau arrangements standards. Public awareness\n            is essential for quality, and standards, and, the\n            integration of local organizations, should be set in\n            accordance with international standards organizations,\n            bearing in mind that export performance is heavily dependent\n            on the initial demand for MSTQ services. Trade facilitation\n            is desirable for a private corporation to own , and operate\n            electronic infrastructure, and, should include comprehensive\n            training of customs officials, in addition to customs\n            departments reorganization, if needed. Electronic\n            infrastructure should be flexible, so as to engage in other\n            value-added network activities. As for the retirement system\n            review, a comprehensive actuarial analysis is suggested to\n            take place, prior to reforms, and, it is further reinforced\n            that portable pension plans can eliminate constraints for\n            labor mobility between private, and public sectors.\n            Effective management of the Technology Diffusion Scheme\n            should be accompanied by Government support, and a\n            public-private oversight committee to build-on required schemes."}, "docdt": "2000-03-30T00:00:00Z"}
