Mr. Guillermo Caram

Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic
Dear  Sir:
      Please refer to the Loan Agreement between the Dominican Republic (the
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
Bank), dated December 4, 1989, for an Industrial Free Zone Development
Project.
      As you were informed by Mr. Page's telex of today's date, the annuity
in the amortization schedule included in the Loan Agreement was calculated
on the basis of an interest rate of 7.59% instead of 7.65%, which was the
rate applicable during the period January 1, 1989 through June 30, 1989 and
that, therefore, the amortization schedule should be changed to reflect such
applicable rate.
      Schedule 2 is amended to read as per the attachment to this letter of
amendment.
      This amendment shall come into force on the date the Loan Agreement
becomes effective.  Please confirm your agreement to the above by signing
and dating the conformed copy of this letter and returning it to me as soon
as possible.
      A copy is being sent to Mr. Roberto Martinez Villanueva, Technical
Secretary to the Presidency of the Republic.
                                Sincerely,
                         /s/  Gerald F. Flood, Jr.
