India: Rajasthan District Primary Education Project II
(ID-P055455)
Tribal Development Plan
The Second Rajasthan District Primary Education Project (Rajasthan DPEP II) is
the ninth in a series of Bank-financed primary education projects in India. It is also part
of the national District Primary Education Programme sponsored by the Government of
India which now extends to 18 (of 28) states in the country. Broadly, the program and
the project aim to ensure that all 6 to 10 year-old children have access to a five-year cycle
of primary education of appropriate quality. Importantly, this objective results in a
program focus on children from socially and economically disadvantaged groups who
have 'traditionally' remained outside education. Thus, the very objective and focus of
the project include tribal children within their ambit.
This Tribal Development Plan (TDP) has been prepared on the basis of secondary
information available on the project districts and primary information collected by the
Social Assessments (SAs) carried out during project preparation. The SAs included
consultations with some potential tribal beneficiaries of the project and with state and
district officials and NGOs working in the project areas. The TDP follows the format of
the "Indigenous People's Development Plan" which is provided in the Bank's
Operational Directive on Tribal People (O.D. 4.20).
Legal Framework
Article 46 of the Constitution of India states that the State will promote the
educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of Indian society, especially
the Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Scheduled Castes (SCs), and protect them from all forms
of social injustice and exploitation. The state governments have been made responsible
for promoting the welfare of SCs and STs. In compliance with the Fifth Schedule of the
Constitution of India (Part X) that provides protection to the Scheduled Tribes on account
of their disadvantages, the Government of Rajasthan has enacted a number of laws to
protect and promote the social and economic interests of tribal people. These include
measures which are intended to ensure that STs do not lose their land, laws abolishing
bonded labor and usurious money-lending, relief from indebtedness, the minimum wages
act, laws providing rights to forest and common lands, and prohibition.
Personnel Policies
The government "reserves" up to 12 percent of places in all fields of employment
for tribal people. Rosters of candidates are maintained, vacancies are carried forward and
age limits, qualification requirements and application fees are relaxed to facilitate the
entry of ST candidates into jobs.
To enhance human resource development and skill improvements, a number of
training programs are organized specifically for tribal areas/people and education
incentives are provided in the form of uniforms, stationery, books, or hostel facilities.

Land Tenure
The Rajasthan Tenancy Act of 1955, amended from time to time, provides legal
protection to tribal people against alienation of their land. The Act prohibits transfer of
tribal land to non-tribal people. Under Section 42 (3) any transfer of tribal land by sale or
lift or bequest is void. Under Section 43(2) no tribal land-owner can transfer his rights to
his holdings to a non-tribal in whole or in part. Section 46(A) forbids letting or sub-
letting of whole or part of the holding by a tribal to non-tribals. Section 49(A) prohibits
exchanges of tribal land with that of a non-tribal. Section 183(B) provides for summary
inquiries to be conducted in the event of instances of infringement being brought to light.
Trespassing on Lands held by a member of the STs. Anyone who has taken or
retained possession, without lawful authority, of land held by a tenant belonging to the
SCs and STs is liable to be ejected on an application in a summary manner under Section
183 (b) of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955. The proceedings under this section are to
be concluded within three months. There is no such provision for non-SC/STs. General
tenants have to bring suits for ejection to a court.
These laws are of tremendous significance to tribal people because of their
dependence on land and forests for their livelihoods. This project does not impinge on
land tenure issues concerning tribal people. Schools established in tribal areas (and
related facilities such as water supply facilities or toilets) would be situated in (i) rented
or donated buildings, (ii) government owned land, or (iii) community donated land.
Therefore no land alienation is expected to occur that might interfere with the tenurial
rights of tribal people.
Baseline Data
Population and Literacy of Scheduled Tribes
In Rajasthan, the population of Scheduled Tribes (STs) according to the 1991
Census was 5.475 million, constituting about 12.44 percent of the state's total population.
(Rajasthan accounts for 8.08 percent of the total population of India. Figures on the
Scheduled Tribe population in the 2001 Census are not yet available.) The state ranked
14th among Indian states in terms of ST population in 1991.
The literacy rate of STs in Rajasthan was 19.44 percent for all persons, 33.29
percent for males and 4.42 percent for females in 1991, comparatively lower than that of
overall literacy in the state: 38.55% for all persons, 54.99% for males, and 20.44% for
females.
A continuing reason for this literacy gap is that the enrolment of ST students as a
proportion of total school enrolment in the state continues to be lower than their
proportion in the population at large. It was only 10.35% at primary stage and 11.88% at
the upper primary stage in 1998-99 (Table 1). The corresponding figures for ST girls
were 8.27% and 9.50%. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of ST children is 84, which
is much lower than the GER of 101 in the state overall.

Tribal People in the Project Areas
Rajasthan DPEP I covered ten of the state's 32 districts, and Rajasthan DPEP II
covers an additional nine districts. Tribal people in these nine districts live in two types
of situations: (a) a majority who are integrated into rural communities, have access to
opportunities and resources, and participate in the development process; and (b) a
minority who are located in habitations that are small in size and in relatively remote
areas.
The following areas of the nine Rajasthan DPEP II districts are thickly populated
by tribal people. The number of children enrolled in schools in these areas are given
alongside. Two of the nine project districts have negligible tribal populations.
Lalsot and Sikrai blocks in Dausa District  58809
All blocks in Karauli District            48833
All blocks in Sawai Madhopur District     31141
Basedi and Bari blocks in Dholpur District. 6525
Weir block in Bharatpur District          5238
All blocks of Bundi District              25448
Jamwa Ramgarh, Bassi and Chaksu in        28593
Jaipur District
The proportion of children out of school in these tribal areas is higher than among
children living in non-tribal areas. The main reasons for this is the remoteness of these
areas, which has limited the amount of educational infrastructure available, and the
difficulty faced by children living in smaller habitations in accessing existing formal
schools. Some of the remote tribal areas are cut off from main villages or well-populated
rural areas by rivers, ravines, forests, hill ranges, and so on. Other reasons for low school
enrolment among Scheduled Tribe children include the reluctance of ST families to
educate their children -- in addition to the high illiteracy among ST parents, they may not
value the education available, particularly in relation to its opportunity costs. Children
are crucial family workers in the tribal economy which includes agriculture as a main
occupation, cattle herding, labor on work sites, and home-based work such as rolling
indigenous cigarettes (bidis), collecting firewood or other minor forest produce, stone
quarrying, mining, etc.



ST children may be out of school because of low enrolment/attendance or high
drop out. Different tribal areas in the project seem to manifest different patterns as
shown in Table 2 below.

Bari          62.97          23.12
The table shows that about 20 percent of ST children in these areas remain unenrolled.
While about 80 percent of ST children enroll in schools, they leave school after a few
months, showing a drop out rate as high as 57 percent.
Development Activities in the Project for Tribal Areas and Children
In the Project, the Government of Rajasthan (GOR) proposes to pay special
attention to tribal children, employing the following specific strategies to ensure that they
attend school and complete five years of education. A special focus will also be given to
girls who tend to be more excluded than boys.
Survey to Identify Non-schoolgoing Children in tribal areas:
A survey will be conducted of out-of-school children in tribal areas has been
conducted and will be used as a basis for tracking progress in school enrolment and
retention.
Awareness Campaigns to Increase Enrolment of tribal children into formal schools:
Village-wise special awareness campaigns will be organized to bring out- of-school
tribal children to formal primary schools. The project focuses on improving formal
primary education and making the school a place that children like. Teachers will play a
vital role to create environments conducive to the education of tribal children.
Supervisory educational functionaries will also reinforce these awareness campaigns
through their activities. Communities will play important roles in creating awareness,
highlighting the benefits of children's education during personal contacts with parents as
well as in general village meetings. The special awareness campaigns will be organized
in all predominantly tribal villages in the seven districts containing sizeable tribal
populations. Approximately 50,000 tribal children will be benefited.



Opening Alternative Schools
Alternative Schools (AS) which provide flexibility in terms of timing, learning
modalities, etc. will be opened in tribal areas on a priority basis. The objective of opening
AS is to bring non-schoolgoing children into the fold of primary education by providing
educational facilities nearer homes. In tribal areas 298 AS will be opened for non-
enrolled and dropout children, benefiting approximately 8000 tribal children.
Opening Evening Alternative Schools
Evening alternative schools will be opened in school-less habitations where 15 to
20 out-of-school children between 6 and 11 years of age are available. These Evening
AS are expected to meet the needs of working tribal children, in particular. 79 Evening
AS will be opened, through which approximately 2,000 tribal children will be benefited.
Bridge Courses
Residential and non-residential short-duration "bridge" courses will be organized
for out-of-school children in the 6-11 year age-group. These bridge courses are intended
to bring out-of-school children who have had some education back into the mainstream
of formal primary education by preparing them in a relatively short period of time. For
over-age dropout or non-enrolled girls, 775 Bridge Courses will be started. Through
these, approximately 15,000 tribal girls will be benefited.
Development of Language Inventory:
A language inventory will be developed for the predominantly tribal areas to
facilitate the learning of tribal children. In project districts, language is generally not an
issue. Workshops will be organized for teachers and language experts to develop and
encourage use of the language inventory.
Other Benefits for Tribal Children in DPEP
* All tribal children will receive Teaching-Learning Materials free of cost. About
198,000 ST children will be benefited.
*  Escort services will be provided in predominantly tribal areas to bring ST children,
especially girls, to school. 270 escorts will be employed for this purpose.
*  250 Girl Child Motivators will be appointed in tribal areas to motivate and bring girls
to schools.
*  Opening of Early Childhood Education centers. To reduce dropout among older girl
students who are often faced with looking after their younger siblings, about 200 ECE
centers will be opened in formal primary school campuses in tribal areas where other



child care centers are not functioning. These centers are also expected to give
attending children a head start in primary education.
* No tuition fees are charged to tribal children up to Class VIII. They are also given a
50 percent reduction in other local fees.
Other Provisions
Under the Indian Constitution, Scheduled Tribes have been given 7.5 percent
(Rajasthan, 12.0%) reservations in government jobs and in admission to government
colleges and technical educational institutions. In DPEP, ST candidates are given
preference in recruitment of para-teachers.
Negative Impacts
No negative impacts are expected from the project as, in addition to the above
strategies, tribal children will have access to primary education in formal primary schools
or existing alternative schools. These have already covered habitations with more than
200 people, while the project will address habitations with less than 200 people by
opening AS. The opening of schools will be based on demand from local communities,
including tribal communities. Following a request for a school, funds will be provided to
the panchayats within three months to open an alternative school. Teachers and
administrators will be sensitized to cater to the special needs of tribal children. There are
no tribal groups with variant languages in the project areas. The tribal languages in the
project districts are very close to Hindi which is the language of instruction in the state.
The textbooks being used in the project include material on tribal culture.

Strategy for Tribal Participation
The project will involve ST people in decision-making at several levels. At the
district level, elected representative such as Members of the State Legislative Assembly
and Members of the national Parliament will be members of the Governing Council and
Executive Committee of the Project. At the block and village levels, locally-elected ST
representatives and teachers will be members of project management committees.
Particularly important are the School Management Committees which will include ST
representatives from the local village panchayats (local government bodies), which
already have a constitutionally guaranteed representation for STs. In predominantly
tribal areas, ST men and women will be involved in community mobilization efforts
which would include enrolment drives, village meetings, etc. Traditional local leaders
and organizations would also be involved in these activities. ST women will be engaged
by the project as girl child motivators and escorts. All these representatives of tribal
people would participate in the planning, local-level decision-making, and oversight of
project activities, and in providing feedback on the project to project staff.
Institutional Capacity
The State Project Office will have officers specifically designated to ensure that the
above provisions for tribal areas and children are implemented in the project. When
necessary, the Project would draw on the expertise of NGOs and other institutions in the
state or elsewhere which have worked with tribal people in the field of education. Such
expertise is readily available and would be useful particularly in the community
mobilization and pedagogical dimensions of the project. Specialized institutions (such as
the District Institutes of Education and Training) are also available to assist in the
development, implementation and management of activities as required. Project staff
will be trained to carry out the special activities in tribal areas with the necessary
sensitivity and diligence. The educational system and several of the related institutions
have outreach capacity which will be utilized and developed as needed to serve tribal
areas.
Implementation Schedule
The implementation schedule for the above activities in tribal areas will follow the
general implementation schedule for the project as a whole. The Project has also
established benchmarks for coverage and achievements over the project period, which
will be used to monitor implementation progress. The Government of India and the state
government are responsible for sustaining project activities, expenditures and outcomes
over the long term.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The educational progress of ST children will be monitored through the project
Education Management Information System (EMIS). The data will be analyzed at
district and state levels. The progress of each child will be monitored through a GIS-
based Child Tracking System. Local people will be involved in both these efforts. In
addition, the School Management Committees, including tribal people, will be



responsible for continuous monitoring of activities in their areas and would provide
feedback to local teachers and officials in charge of the project. It is also expected that
the SMCs would interact with local groups, such as tribal people, more widely during the
course of their work (e.g., in village meetings, enrolment drives, etc.). Evaluations will
be carried out by external agencies to determine the impact of the project. Professional
social scientists will be involved in all three sets of formal monitoring and evaluation
activities. In the DPEPs, it is customary for the Bank to review monitoring reports,
studies and evaluations with the Borrower during the regular Joint Supervision missions.
Evaluation reports would be made public.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
As many of the activities planned in tribal areas are also to be done in non-tribal
areas of the project, cost estimates have not been prepared separately. However, it is
expected that expenditure in tribal areas would be proportionately higher than in non-
tribal areas because of the difficulties of access and need for a higher level of effort. The
financing plan for this tribal plan is the same as that for the project as a whole.
