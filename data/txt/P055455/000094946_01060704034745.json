This project is the second phase of an ongoing\n            program, Rajasthan DPEP, the first phase of which is being\n            financed by Rajasthan DPEP I and covers ten underserved\n            districts of the state. There are three project components.\n            The first expands access, retention, and enrollments. It\n            includes targeted interventions to reach marginalized\n            groups, establishes early childhood education centers,\n            provides residential facilities for migrant children, and\n            services children with mild to moderate disabilities.
