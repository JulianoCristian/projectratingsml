The TDP follows the format of the\n            \"Indigenous People's Development Plan,\"\n            provided in the World Bank's Operational Directive on\n            Tribal People (O.D. 4.20). Development activities in the\n            project for tribal areas and children include the following:\n            a survey to identify non-schooling children; awareness\n            campaigns to increase enrollment of tribal children into\n            formal schools; opening alternative schools; organizing\n            \"bridge\" course to return out-of-school children\n            to formal primary education; developing a language\n            inventory; distributing teacher-learning materials\n            cost-free; escort services and appointing motivators to\n            encourage and bring girls to school;opening early childhood\n            education centers; and tuition-free education, among other\n            benefits. No negative impacts are expected from the project\n            as, in adition to the other strategies, tribal children will\n            have access to primary education in formal primary schools\n            or existing alternative schools."}, "docdt": "2001-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
