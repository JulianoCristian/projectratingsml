Lessons largely reinforce the importance\n            of Government dialogue, ensuring budgetary and logistical\n            support, through an autonomous Project Unit for more\n            effective project implementation. In addition, it is\n            stipulated that training would be more effective if combined\n            with classroom, and on-the-job experience, especially in the\n            case of sophisticated geo-science database management\n            systems. Also, ensuring continued work flow and program\n            development is necessary. Greater care could have been\n            exercised in the choice of trainees on these sophisticated\n            systems to ensure they are line employees of the relevant\n            agencies, rather than contract hires. In line with this,\n            capacity building is a slow process, and requires long-term\n            commitment from the government, and the Bank in order to put\n            sufficient capacity in place. For example, for certain\n            specialties it would be helpful for the Bank to fund long\n            term academic training. Notwithstanding, the project\n            demonstrated that the private sector will respond well to\n            invest in the country, and engage in mining sector, provided\n            the government establishes the right framework, and\n            strengthens adequate institutional capacity."}, "docdt": "2005-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
