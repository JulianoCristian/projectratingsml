     promote private investment in mining and to ensure real and\n            sustainable contribution to economic growth; (ii) strengthen\n            public and private sector capacity to effectively administer\n            regulations and to monitor sector developments; and (iii)\n            establish capacity in the country for environmental\n            management.  Additionally, the project aims to: (i)\n            stimulate private sector response to the growing need for a\n            variety of mining and environment related technical goods\n            and services; and (ii) identify and adopt appropriate\n            mechanisms to facilitate the development of small scale\n            mines and to improve the social, health and environmental\n            conditions of artisanal miners.  The project will comprise\n            four main components: 1) regulatory and fiscal framework and\n            training; 2) institutional strengthening and resources\n            management; 3) environmental management; and 4) small scale\n            and artisanal mining."}, "docdt": "1997-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
