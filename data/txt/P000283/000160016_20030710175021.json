A credit for the Project, of SDR14.8 million, was\n            approved on June 30, 1997 and became effective on April 28,\n            1998. The original closing date, December 31,2002 has been\n            extended to June 30,2004. The reallocation of funds will\n            allow the project to enhance the achievement in two of its\n            principal development objectives: improving the living and\n            working conditions of persons involved in small scale and\n            artisanal mining, and building capacity to improve\n            management of the environment. The reallocation will\n            increase consultant services to deepen government\n            environmental oversight institutions and to extend work to\n            20,000 artisanal miners and their families. These changes\n            are proposed: to increase the \"Consultants\"\n            category of the credit agreement by using the funds from the\n            \"unallocated\" category (SDR 1.25 million), and\n            funds saved in the categories \"equipment\" (SDR\n            1.50 million) and \"training\" (SDR 0.5 million)."}, "docdt": "2003-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
