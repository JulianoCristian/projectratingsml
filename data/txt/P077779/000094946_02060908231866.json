ensures the\n            management of environmental adversity, provides guidance for\n            social adverse impacts, and plans mitigation measures. It\n            stipulates that no subprojects of the Emergency\n            Infrastructure Reconstruction Project will be eligible\n            should land acquisition affect 200 or more people, and,\n            specifies attribute ineligibility of subprojects that\n            involve significant degradation to natural habitats,\n            cultural heritage sites, or forests (commercial logging is\n            to be avoided), or, adversity to waters among riparian\n            neighbors. Sectoral adversity is identified, followed by the\n            relevant mitigation measures. 1) water supply\n            infrastructure: prioritize leak detection; conduct chemical\n            and bacteriological testing of water quality; install\n            drainage pipes to prevent stagnant waters, and, covered\n            pumps to prevent contamination; select sites for latrines\n            and septic tanks installation; and, conduct regular surface,\n            and groundwater investigations. 2) Solid waste: conduct\n            frequent waste collections; minimize incineration practices;\n            specifically identify collection, and disposal of medical,\n            and hazardous wastes; establish appropriate monitoring\n            criteria. 3) Roads: prepare adequate drainage designs;\n            restore borrow areas; conduct re-vegetation practices to\n            protect soil surfaces. 4) Erosion: maintain slope stability\n            through re-vegetation; design and construct access roads;\n            prevent firewood practices; remove, and adequately dispose\n            of oil, bitumen, and hazardous material wastes. 5) Power:\n            store waste transformer coolant air in sealed containers,\n            pending safe disposal; and, preferably, the use of natural\n            gas should be the choice. Measures in general, include\n            health, and hygiene education, training, capacity building,\n            and monitoring criteria to ensure the ESSF is appropriately implemented."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T17:32:00Z"}
