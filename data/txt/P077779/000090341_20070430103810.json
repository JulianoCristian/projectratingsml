Lessons\n            learned from the project: The experience of this project\n            demonstrates the degree to which the priorities of\n            post-conflict reconstruction can work against one another,\n            and suggests measures that can be taken to help reduce this\n            tension that is inherent in the post-conflict development\n            agenda. In the experience of this project (and many other\n            projects in Afghanistan), cost estimates at appraisal,\n            particularly for consulting services, proved to be far below\n            actual costs. Although this issue has been highlighted\n            elsewhere in the document, the Bank should consider\n            seconding staff to Government (for a limited duration and at\n            the request of the government) during the early stages of\n            reengagement. This could be particularly useful in the areas\n            of procurement, disbursement/financial management, and\n            project management which are central to the successful\n            implementation of projects."}, "docdt": "2007-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
