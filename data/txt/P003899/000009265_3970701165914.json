Some lessons learned\n            included: the complete training process must be\n            systematically managed if sustainable training practices are\n            to be institutionalized. Technical assistance is needed to\n            create the technical capacity required to manage HRD\n            successfully. The lesson from this project is that a\n            technical assistance team willing to share and transfer\n            technology can be very effective. Regular visits and\n            continuity of staff from the Bank and the concerned\n            institution are essential in projects where the process of\n            change is being supported. It is essential that the Bank\n            'stay the course' in terms of advice and support\n            as the institution goes through the cycles of apparent\n            progress and regression associated with institutional\n            change. Clear progress indicators should be agreed at\n            project design stage to serve as reminders of interim goals\n            for project implementers and supervisors, as benchmarks to\n            be attained before moving the institutional change process\n            forward; and as a 'road map' for managers in the\n            institution who support change."}, "docdt": "1996-11-20T00:00:00Z"}
