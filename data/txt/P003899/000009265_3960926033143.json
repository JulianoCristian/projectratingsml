enhancing\n            manpower planning capability and building the capacity of\n            the Directorate General of Estates (DGE) to develop its\n            human resources.  The  project includes financing for\n            consultant services, overseas fellowships, local training,\n            training of trainers, instructional equipment and materials,\n            and incremental costs.  This is with the intention of: (a)\n            strengthening the capacity of the DGE to plan, coordinate\n            and monitor manpower and training for estate crops\n            personnel; (b) improving managerial and technical support\n            for field staff and smallholders; and (c) strengthening the\n            capacity of institutions involved in subsectoral training.\n            Lastly, the projects entails: (d) improving the productive\n            capacity of the subsector by training staff supporting the\n            establishment of selected export crops in 14 provinces; and\n            (e) building capacity for administering manpower development\n            in the Secretariat General of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA)."}, "docdt": "1988-08-15T00:00:00Z"}
