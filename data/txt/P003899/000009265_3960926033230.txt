MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIUNAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A TREE CROPS HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment loan to the Government of Indonesia (COI) for US$18.4 million equivalent
is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms
with 20 years' maturity including a five-year grace period at the standard
variable interest rate, and would help finance a tree crops human resource
development project.
2.        Background.  Skill deficiencies in staff of the Directorate General
of Estates (DGE) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and among smallholders
have been recognized as a serious constraint to satisfactory development of
the tree crops subsector. The effects of these deficiencies are measured in
the disappointing quality of newly planted tree crops in government sponsored
schemes and in the suboptimal maintenance, harvesting and primary processing
on the part of subsector smallholders. The origin of the problem can in part
be traced to weakness of manpower management in the subsector; a lack of tree
crop subsector training capacity, inadequately trained subsector workforce;
and infrequent farmer leader training.
3.        Human resource deficiencies in the subsector have been brought to
Government attention thrQygh a number of detailed studies including the Major
Tree Crops Review, 1985 - and A Survey of the Training Needs of the Estate
Crops Sector in Indonesia, 1985. Government reaction to evidence that man-
power weaknesses contribute to the slowdown of subsector development and the
loss of potential foreign exchange earnings from key export tree crop products
has been speedy and positive. The Third National Agricultural Extension
Project (NAEP III) includes, as one of its objectives, the training of tree
crop extension workers and farmer leaders; the Second Smallholder Rubber
Development Project (SRDP II) contains a significant training component; the
planned Smallholder Eatate Crops Development Project (SECDP) gives consider-
able emphasis to staff and smallholder training. However, most earlier sub-
sector projects concentrated on physical targets in line with Government
development plan objectives. Many projects contained small project related
training components but with some exceptions there was no concerted human
resource development capacity strengthening strategy whereby succeeding
projects built on the foundations of earlier ones. By and large, subsector
HRD has been addressed in a piecemeal, project by project fashion resulting in
a persistence of skill deficiencies. These have been aggravated by the severe
pressures on managerial and technical staff brought on by ambicious subsector
development programs and the lack of manpower management and training capacity
in the subsector.

1988), The World Bank, Report No. 5318-IND, April 15, 1985 (the "Tree
Crops Sector Report").



- 2-
Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.        Bank assistance to GOI in the development of the subsector has been
significant. Since 1917, seven Bank funded Nucleus Estates and Smallholders
(NES) projects have been instrumental in settling 100,000 farm families and
the establishment of 136,000 ha rubber, 70,000 ha oilpalm and 34,000 ha
coconuts. The Bank is in the process of assisting the subsector in expanding
processing capacity and increasing support for further smallholder develop-
ment. This commitment to development of the subsector is tempered by the
realization that insufficient attention has been paid to developing human
capacity to manage improved technology. The 1985 Major Tree Crops Sector
Review cited in para. 3 provided sufficient evidence of human resource
weakness to prompt GOI to request assistance to remedy the situation. There
is now a unique opportunity to address human resource development and manage-
ment on a total subsector basis avoiding the piecemeal approach of the past
and, by concentrating on capacity building, laying the foundation for long-
term human resource development improvement.
5.        Bank involvement in Agriculture Sector Agricultural Education and
Training projects (Credit 288-IND, Loan 1692-IND) and the ongoing Agricultural
Training III Project (Loan 2341-IND) served to establish and strengthen the
Ag.=ncy for Agricultural Education, Training and Extension (AAETE). In
addition to running a major share of the formal agricultural secondary schools
in Indonesia, AAETE is responsible for all formal inservice training for the
NOA. AAETE, to-date, has focussed heavily on the training of food crop exten-
sion staff to the neglect of other subsector personnel. However, AATTE is now
ready to turn its attention to the training needs of the tree crops subsector
and could benefit greatly from a tree crops human resource development project
by building its own capacity to expand training activities in tree crop tech-
nology and, during the project implementation period, participating in the
training of field extension staff and farmer leaders.
Project Objectives
6.        The proposed project has the following objectives:
(a) to improve productivity in the tree crops subsector, by enhancin-
manpower management capability in the DGE; preparing tree crop
specialized trainers; providing well structured inservice training
programs and undertaking coordinated farmer leader training; and
(b) to contribute to the capacity building of AAETE and the Estate Crops
Training Institute to enable them to better meet the human resource
development demands of the subsector.
Project Description
7.        Project objectives would be achieved through activities conducted
under four broad categories:
(a) Human Resource Management Capacity Building. Creating in DGE the
capacity to plan for and manage manpower, undertake training needs

Training III Project (Loan 2341-IND) served to establish and strengthen the
Agency for Agricultural Education, Training and Extension (AAETE). In

capacity to plan for and manage manpower, indertake training needs



- 3 -
analyses, and to design, implement (through subsector training
agencies) and evaluate training programs;
(b) Building Training Capacity in the Subsector. Increasing the number
of tree crop specific trainers at master trainer and inservice
levels in AAETE; providing upgrading opportunities for the Estate
Crops Training Institute teaching staff; and training trainers for a
program of farmer leader training;
(c) Staff Training. Providing a comprehensive series of training
programs on technical, management and financial topics for staff of
DGE, the provincial service of the DGE (DISBUN) and the Estate Crops
Training Institute to improve technical capacity to serve the
subsector' s needs; and
(d) Farmer Leader Training. Undertaking a well planned and coordinated
program of farmer leader training, emphasizing key husbandry and
processing practices and stressing leadership techniques.
8.        The project is estimated to cost a total of US$26.6 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$8.7 million (33Z). Cost estimates and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
The timetable of key events in project processing and the status of Bank
operations in the country are summarized in Schedules C and D. A map is also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report is being distributed separately.
Agreed Actions
9.        A number of project related actions already taken have been reviewed
and agreed at negotiations including:
(a) Technical Assistance. A short list of firms qualified to supply
expertise together with draft contracts.
(b) DGE Headquarters Training. A list of staff from DGE Directorates to
participate in training programs, their specializations and planned
schedules for enrollment.
(c) Training of Trainers. Selected candidates for training of trainer
courses, draft curricula and schedule of field visits.
(d) Budget. The 1988/89 budget for the first year of project
operations.
(e) Project Implementation Unit. Details of the establishment of the
unit, appointment of a fulltime project manager and identities of
unit and human resource development counterpart staff.
Assurances were provided by Government that suitable accounts would be main-
tained, audited by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank within nine
months of the close of each GOI fiscal year. Assurances were also provided at



- 4 -
plan to incorporate annual DGE-wide human resource development activities into
the normal operations of the DGE. Government, by negotiations, had (a) appointed
staff to the agreed key posts in the project implementation unit; and (b) estab-
lished the management Board.
Benefits
10.       The project is expected to:  (a) minimize the human resource related
constraint to estate crops subsector development; (b) create a body of well
trained subsector trainers at various levels; (c) improve the technical and
management capability of DGE, DISBUN, managers of other smallholder projects
and staff; (d) positively influence smallholder production through systematic
farmer leader training; and (e) contribute to improving the standard of living
of subsector smallholders through increased income from the application of
better husbandry and primary processing techniques.
Risks
11.       While there are no major risks associated with the proposed project
it could face, in common with other development projects in Indonesia budge-
tary constraints and problems of project coordination which could slow the
implemert.ation process. The project includes measures to alleviate these
risks.
Recommendation
12.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve
the proposed loan.
