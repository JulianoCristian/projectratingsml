              Amendment to Paragraph A.6(d) of Schedule 4
              to the Loan Agreement
Dear Sirs:
     We refer to the Loan Agreement entered into by and between
Credit du Maroc (the Borrower) and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) dated July 27, 1987 (the
Loan Agreement), and to the Guarantee Agreement entered into by and
between the Kingdom of Morocco (the Guarantor) and the Bank of even
date therewith, both in respect of the above-mentioned Project.
     Pursuant to the Borrower's request, the Bank has agreed to
amend the provisions of paragraph A.6(d) of Schedule 4 to the Loan
Agreement on the interest rate applicable to Investment Sub-loans.
As such, said paragraph is hereby amended to read as follows:
     "(d) carry interest on the principal amount of the Investment
     Sub-loan withdrawn and outstanding  from  time  to time, at an
     effective  rate which shall be  equal  at least to the greater
     of:  (i) the rate of interest applicable, on the date upon
     which the Sub-loan is made, to the Loan pursuant to the
     provisions of Section 2.05 of this Agreement, and (ii) the
     rate of interest established by the Guarantor's Minister of
     Finance applicable, on the date upon which the Sub-loan is
     made, to loans made by the Guarantor's  National  Bank  for
     Economic Development with the same maturity as Sub-loans."
     Please confirm your respective agreement to the foregoing
amendment by signing and duly dating the confirmation space set
forth below, and returning this amendment letter to us at your
earliest convenience.  Two signed duplicate originals of this
amendment letter are enclosed herewith, one for each of your
