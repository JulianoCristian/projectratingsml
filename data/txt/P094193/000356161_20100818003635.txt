1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The tsunami and its impact. The tsunami reached Maldives at 9:20 a.m. on December 26,
2004. Tidal waves ranging from 4 to 14 feet were reported in all parts of the country.
More than 100 were confirmed dead and more than 1300 people suffered injuries. Unlike
other countries affected by the tsunami, Maldives experienced a disaster of national
proportions. Thirty-nine islands were significantly damaged and nearly a third of the
Maldives' 300,000 people were severely affected. More than 12,000 people were
displaced from their islands for an extended period, and another 8,500 people were
temporarily relocated on their own islands.

The reconstruction program. Immediately after the tsunami, the Government of the
Maldives launched the preparation of a tsunami reconstruction program based on a
damage assessment prepared jointly with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and the UN system. Total damages were estimated to be about US$470 million,
close to 62 percent of GDP. The largest source of direct damages was to the housing
sector and the largest source of indirect damage was to the tourism sector, stemming from
a sharp drop in tourist arrivals. The cost of restoring the economy to pre-tsunami levels
was estimated as US$406 million.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project objective was "to support the efforts of the Government of the Maldives to
carry out a program of rehabilitation and reconstruction related to the damages caused by
the tsunami of December 26, 2004".

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

There were no changes to the project objectives during the course of the project's
implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries were the Maldivian communities affected by the tsunami.

1.5 Original Components

The Bank's assistance was for a total of SDR 9.3 million (US$14.0 million equivalent) of
which SDR 3.7 million was in the form of an IDA grant and SDR 5.6 million was an IDA
credit. IDA routed its support through the government's Tsunami Relief and
Reconstruction Fund (TRRF) established immediately after the disaster under the aegis of
the Ministry of Finance and Treasury with a view to increasing the transparency of the
use of funds. The project was designed with three components:


                                           1
Component 1: Restoration of Livelihoods (US$8.6 million). As originally designed,
this component included two sub-components, designed to help restore the livelihoods of
households and businesses affected by the tsunami: (a) Cash Grants (safety net
payments) to the persons affected by the tsunami; and (b) Sub-grants to finance the
restoration of lost or damaged assets of affected micro and small-scale enterprises.

(a) Safety net cash grants to households affected by the tsunami (US$5.6 million). As
an immediate response to the tsunami, the Bank agreed to retroactively finance cash
grants paid out by the government to affected families immediately after the disaster. It
distributed grants of Rf. 1,500 (US$117) per capita to families whose houses were
completely destroyed; Rf. 1,000 (US$78) per capita to families whose houses were
partially damaged; and Rf. 500 (US$39) per capita to families whose houses are intact
but household items swept away.

(b) Restoration of Assets (US$3.0 million). The Bank agreed to provide urgent support
to restore small businesses. Specifically it was intended that this program would provide
sub-grants for restoration of assets (e.g., fishing vessels, fishing gear, fish-processing
equipment, agricultural tools, and other equipment). It would also target small-scale
enterprises in the affected islands that lost or suffered damages to their income generating
assets and provide grants to help enterprises restart their businesses.

Component 2: Increase school capacity on islands receiving population displaced by
the tsunami (US$5.0 million). The tsunami had made some islands uninhabitable. The
population displaced from these islands needed to be resettled immediately. The
receiving islands were envisaged to need additional schools and facilities to
accommodate the increasing student population. This component was designed to
support the construction and rehabilitation of education facilities through the provision of
goods and technical advisory services, and the carrying out of works.

At project preparation, government envisaged that the reconstruction program would
allow it to advance its long discussed policy for population consolidation. It was
believed that the tsunami damage lent new urgency to the policy of population
concentration. Implementation of this policy would permit greater protection against sea-
level rise on the islands where the population would be concentrated while also reducing
the diseconomies of scale in service provision.

Component 3: Implementation Support to the Post-tsunami Reconstruction
Program (US$0.4 million). This component was designed to help the government
finance the temporary staff required to manage and implement the post-tsunami
reconstruction program.

1.6 Revised Components

The first component of the project was refined to include cash grants to agriculturalists
(households whose agricultural operations were affected by the tsunami. In addition, the
component was modified to include the provision of loans to small businesses (US$3.0
million). Following the initial distribution of cash grants to households, the government


                                             2
requested the Bank's approval to include this provision. In order to reduce the pressures
created by the provision of cash grants, it wished to use the available funds to provide
small loans to small businesses. The Bank agreed to this proposal and the legal
agreement was amended accordingly. These funds were distributed through the Bank of
Maldives (BML). Loans were made available to 950 tsunami- affected small businesses,
mainly for fish-processing activities, and some for agriculture and trading purposes.

1.7    Other significant changes to the design and scope of the project:

There were no other significant changes to the project itself. However, it must be noted
that, in parallel, both the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) and the European
Union (EU) entrusted the Bank with the implementation of tsunami reconstruction
projects in the Maldives under two trust funds. While both were prepared in the 2005,
the JSDF grant was signed only in June 2006 and the EU grant was signed in October
2006. The main reason for the delay was government's desire to fine-tune its
reconstruction program following the initial round of agreements reached with a broad
range of donors very soon after the disaster, including the World Bank.

The JSDF funds (TF055387) (US$1.96 million) were used to directly extend the
livelihood components of this project, providing additional funds to compensate
agriculturalists, fishermen and small businesses. This trust fund closed on December 31,
2009. The EU funds (TF056638) (US$17.1 million) were used to fund a Public
Accounting System (to allow more efficient management of the reconstruction funds), the
provision of additional education and health facilities, and the development of a solid
waste management component for the Maldives on tsunami affected islands. This trust
fund closed on January 31, 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was prepared very rapidly after the
tsunami hit. The Bank team worked in very close consultation with government provided
critical in the preparation of its tsunami reconstruction program, together with ADB and
the UN. The design of the project reflected the urgent needs on the ground at that time.

2.2 Implementation

Understandably, in the years immediately following the disaster, the government of the
Maldives struggled to manage the sudden increase in volume of funds made available to
it after the disaster. Over this period, donor fund flows increased from around US$30
million per year before the disaster to over US$100 million per year. Even though a large
proportion of the projects was implemented by the funding agencies, including the Red
Cross societies and the UN system, the government still had difficulty fulfilling the
administrative tasks that only it could complete and to implement the projects it had
agreed to implement, including those funded through the World Bank, JSDF, and the EU.



                                            3
The reconstruction program also put the contracting industry under great pressure,
leading to delays and cost increases as some donors were willing to pay any price.
Adding to the pressure on government was the decisions of some donors to hire key
technical staff in the government to run their own programs. In a country with a limited
base of technical staff this was a major constraint.

Given this background it is not unexpected that following a very enthusiastic start, project
implementation was only rated as moderately satisfactory until the mid-term review
mission held in January 2007, just two years after the disaster. Civil works, in particular,
were slow to take off as the large contractors who won most of the bids had taken on too
much work overall. As a result the project closing date had to be extended by one year.
However, after the initial delay the overall implementation rating improved to
satisfactory. The bulk of the funds was disbursed before the middle of 2008 (US$13.84
million out of a total of US$14.00 million).

As noted above, at project preparation, government was keen to promote its policy of
population consolidation, and accordingly planned this project's education component
(Component 2) around this objective. It saw the future of the Maldives involving
consolidation of its population on a smaller number of larger islands that could be
protected more effectively from sea level rise, and where services could be delivered
more effectively and at a lower cost. However, as the reconstruction program was
implemented, some of the potential difficulties of implementing such a program became
apparent. Communities are very attached to their home islands, are reluctant to relocate,
and pressures were often quick to emerge between relocated and host communities.
Nonetheless, some population consolidation did take place. For example, the entire
population of an island in Dhaal atoll, Gemendhoo, moved to the atoll capital of
Kudahuvadhoo, first to temporary housing and then to permanent housing. The islanders
from a second island in the same atoll, Vaanee, also moved to Kudahuvadhoo.1 Also, the
population from the island of Madifushi, in Meemu atoll, moved to the larger island of
Maamigilli in Alifu Dhallu atoll.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Given the emergency nature of this project and the fact that project development
objectives were to support the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts, performance
indicators for the project were defined as outputs rather than outcomes. The targets set
were as follows:

    Component 1a. Livelihoods restoration--cash payments to 50,000 households
    Component 1b. Restoration of assets--cash payments to 2000 agriculturalists and
    800 businesses

    Component 2. Increase in school capacity--2000 classrooms, later amended to 40
    schools

The Government monitored the implementation of the program carefully and these
targets were achieved, and indeed, surpassed for two of the above indicators.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

No safeguards were triggered by the project. However, procurement and financial
management were both foci for the government and the Bank throughout the project
implementation period.

Procurement was rated as either satisfactory or moderately satisfactory throughout the
implementation period. A procurement audit conducted in mid-2008 concluded that
while there were no major issues, there were a number of smaller issues that needed to be
attended to so as to strengthen public procurement practices in the Maldives. Also, in
parallel, a technical assistance grant was provided to government to help build the
required institutional capacity to improve procurement capacity.

Financial management (FM) was rated as moderately satisfactory when the project
closed. Although during implementation there were no issues with respect to WB-funded
activities, there was concern with respect to government-funded expenditures. Even
when the project closed, action had not been taken to complete the audit of government-
funded tsunami expenditures for 2006, 2 funded through TRRF as required by the
financing agreement. There were also delays in providing responses to audit reports and
there was delay in the completion of internal audits beyond December 2006.

The project's FM arrangements were of variable quality throughout the implementation
period due to lack of capacity and the rapid turnover of FM staff. For example, there was
no Director General for the Public Finance Division during the six months prior to the
closure of the project. Also, although payments and accounting was centralized at TRRF,
other supporting documents were kept by line departments. As a result, substantial
coordination was required before accounts could be prepared. In sum, the preparation of
the necessary project accounts proved a challenge for government throughout the project
implementation period.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The only project component requiring an on-going management and maintenance is the
schools component. These buildings will have to be maintained by the Ministry of
Education along with all their other school buildings. Potentially, these on-going
commitments will be more difficult to manage at a time of fiscal stringency although a
technical audit conducted in June 2008 noted that the maintenance program for school

that MoFT and other departments had never fully addressed.

buildings was running smoothly and Parent-Teacher associations had made significant
contributions to equipping the buildings.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The project directly addressed the needs of the country after the tsunami. It was prepared
in parallel with the government's tsunami reconstruction program. Both the project
objectives and content were firmly founded in it.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The development objectives of the project as originally defined were fulfilled. It
provides in full the agreed level of support to help the Government of the Maldives carry
out its own program of rehabilitation and reconstruction related to the damages caused by
the tsunami.

Cash grants were made available to affected households, agriculturalists, fishermen and
business-persons, as originally intended. However, it is noted that there were no surveys
to measure the resulting impacts or outcomes. All the original targets were equaled or
exceeded as described below:

           Immediately after the tsunami cash grants were distributed to 58,370 as
           compared to the target of 50,000 households
           Cash grants were distributed to 5836 agriculturalists plus a small number of
           fisherman, while 950 loans were provided to small businesses, against targets
           of 2,000 agriculturalists and fishermen, and 800 businesses

Additional classroom space was provided at 38 schools compared to the target of 40 on
islands where it was expected that persons would be relocated after the disaster.
However, the outcomes of this activity were not entirely as envisaged because of the
decline in school-age population and the government's reluctance to implement its school
rationalization policy. It appears that the government's enthusiasm for population
consolidation also waned during project implementation. This is perhaps not surprising
given both the intra- and inter-community tensions that arose during implementation as
government sought to relocate populations displaced by the tsunami.

Despite this change, all the new classrooms provided are in use even though the number
of children enrolled in the schools has actually decreased by about 25 percent nationwide
during the project period. This change is attributed to the reduction in birth rates and the
resulting change in the age profile of the Maldives' population. An additional and
important outcome is that with the smaller number of children and the additional
classrooms paid for through the project, it has been possible for schools on many islands
to move to operating a single session each day, compared to the previous practice of
operating two sessions.


                                             6
3.3 Efficiency

The initial distribution of cash grants to householders was handled very efficiently and
could be considered a model of its kind. Also, the distribution of funds to pay for the
repair of fishing boats was handled efficiently, with the initial damage assessments being
prepared with the help of experts funded by the FAO. However, the distribution of the
remaining cash grants to agriculturalists was delayed by some months. The start of
construction of the schools was also delayed. However, in the circumstances following
the tsunami this may be understandable, given the limited capacity of the domestic
construction industry in the Maldives.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

While there were some early delays in the implementation of the project, all the project
components were essentially completed by the end of 2008, and the outcomes of the
project were net with the important exception that the school populations have not always
increased on all the islands where the additional classrooms have been provided.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
There were no surveys that specifically targeted the recipients of cash grants. However,
interestingly, a Tsunami Impact Assessment, commissioned by the government six
months after the disaster, suggested that despite the widespread disruption caused by the
disaster, people across the country were better off than they were six months prior to the
disaster. It stated that:

    "Surprisingly perhaps, the tsunami did not have a serious impact on incomes or
    poverty. Indeed for most people the progress of previous decades appears to have
    continued uninterrupted. Before the tsunami, there had been impressive growth in
    household incomes ­ which between December 1997 and July 2004 increased by
    more than 35 percent. And despite the tsunami they continued to rise: between
    September 2004 and June 2005, average per capita household income increased by a
    further 7 percent".3

This was the third in a series of Poverty and Vulnerability studies. The second was
undertaken six months before the disaster, allowing an accurate assessment to be made of
the impact of the tsunami. It attributed the quick recovery to a mix of factors including,
donor support, the employment generated by the reconstruction activities, and the large

increase in government salaries at the end of 2004. Despite this positive outcome, it also
suggested that the people of the Maldives still faced a series of long-standing challenges
including: the disparity in incomes between Male and the other Atolls, lack of
employment opportunities (particularly for young people), and poor access to reliable
sources of drinking water.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The institutional development component of this project was the foundation for the much
larger intervention by the EU to help the government implement a Public Accounting
System (PAS). This is already functioning and will have a lasting impact on public
administration in the Maldives.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no unintended outcomes or impacts other than those discussed elsewhere in
the text of this report.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

While no beneficiary surveys were undertaken, Bank staff made a point of talking with
beneficiaries when visiting islands where projects financed by the Bank had been
undertaken. Unsurprisingly, the new school buildings were widely appreciated. Parents
were also happy with their schools operating a single session each day; a change
facilitated in part by the creation of extra classrooms through the project. However, there
were also complaints about non-project issues, including the shortage of laboratory
equipment, text books and at some schools the quality of the expatriate teaching staff was
a major concern.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome- Rating: Moderate

The risks to the development outcomes of the project are rated as moderate. The current
weakness of the economy in the Maldives could negatively affect both the communities
and individuals that benefited from the support provided through the project. In addition
it is possible that the country's poor fiscal position could adversely affect how intensively
the school buildings funded through the project are used and maintained.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The project was prepared very quickly and in close consultation with the government,
and other donors active in the Maldives immediately after the tsunami struck the



                                             8
Maldives. It was tightly focused and designed to meet the immediate needs of the
country. It was approved by the Board less than three months after the disaster.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank supervised the implementation of this project in tandem with the supervision of
the activities funded through the EU Trust Fund and JSDF Trust Fund. It supervised all
activities very actively up until the end of 2007 and was very active again throughout
2009. However, in 2008 the Bank's own supervision activities were adversely affected
by the disruption caused by the country's first democratic elections, and the subsequent
arrival of a new government. As a result, implementation of components financed by all
three funding sources was adversely affected. While regular supervision of the project
proved difficult, the Bank commissioned a technical audit of all construction activities
financed by both IDA and the EU, as well as a post-award review of government
managed procurement activities. The audit concluded that with minor exceptions, the
quality of construction was generally satisfactory. The procurement review also did not
identify any major issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated as Satisfactory because it delivered a project that
was directly relevant to the country's recovery efforts and generally supervised its
implementation effectively.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government's performance in the days and months immediately after the disaster was
highly satisfactory. During implementation it struggled at times to complete activities in
a timely fashion. However, project funds were almost all fully disbursed by the end of
2008 and the project closed after a one year extension at the end of 2009.

With respect to the overall reconstruction program throughout the implementation period,
the donors would have liked government to put in place a stronger executive management
framework. While appropriate measures to coordinate the program were implemented, a
strong executive was never appointed. As a result, it was sometimes difficult to resolve
disagreements between implementing units and between government and community
groups.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance




                                            9
For the key agencies responsible for the management and implementation of the IDA-
funded program, the performance ratings are assessed as follows:

Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Moderately Satisfactory

MOFT was the signatory of the Bank loan, was the manager of the TRRF through which
the loan was passed within the Maldives and also had an important role in coordinating
and managing the government's reconstruction program. As manager of the TRRF, its
performance has not been completely satisfactory. For example, there were residual audit
issues throughout the life of the project.

Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture. Moderately Satisfactory

While the small component to reimburse fisherman for the damage to their boats was
handled admirably, the Ministry's efforts to manage the distribution of cash grants to
agriculturalists were delayed. Their efforts to prepare and get agreement to the short lists
were less effective although it has to be said the bulk of the funds allocated through this
project were distributed before the mid-term review of January 2007. In contrast, funds
provided through a parallel JSDF grant, effectively extending the list of eligible
recipients, took much longer to distribute.

Ministry of Education. Satisfactory

There were some initial delays to the implementation of the component managed by this
Ministry. However, the construction of all but four (out of a total of 38 schools) was
complete by the end of 2008, the original closing date for the project. A technical audit
completed in mid-2008 concluded that the quality of these projects was generally
satisfactory. It should also be noted that there was a shortage of both contractor capacity
and construction materials for long periods in 2007 and 2008 and this, at least in part,
explains the delays affecting school construction.

Bank of the Maldives. Moderately Satisfactory

Once instructed by the government, BML distributed the funds allocated through this
project with commendable efficiency. However, the very high percentage of non-
performing loans should be of concern for both BML and the government.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The government's immediate response after the tsunami was highly commendable. Also,
it made immediate efforts to prepare, with donor assistance, a credible reconstruction
plan. Despite some weaknesses with respect to the implementation of this project,
overall the performance of both the central government and line agencies is rated as
satisfactory. The bulk of the funds had been implemented within three years before the
original closing date of December 31, 2008.

6. Lessons Learned

Five years after the disaster, the government has essentially completed its reconstruction
program and most of the donors have left the Maldives. However, a number of lessons
can be learnt from this project that could have improved the implementation of the
reconstruction program and could improve the design of future reconstruction programs
in other countries. These have been grouped under three headings: preparation of the
reconstruction program, project design and project implementation.

Preparation of the reconstruction program

       This project demonstrated once again the importance of governments preparing
       solid and reliable damage assessments and reconstruction plans. In this case, the
       government's damage assessment was completed very quickly, effectively and
       efficiently with assistance from the World Bank, the ADB and the UN system.

       The availability of credible lists of beneficiaries that were prepared very soon
       after the disaster and were broadly accepted by the community ensured the
       success and efficiency of the first round of distribution of cash grants to
       households.

Project design

       The willingness of the Bank to adjust the precise contents of individual
       components during implementation was very much appreciated by the
       implementing agencies. Even in the context of an emergency reconstruction,
       many other donors were less accommodating.

       Despite the emergency character of the project, it should include some kind of
       evaluation of results. Even a simple qualitative study on the use of funds, would
       have allowed both the government and IDA to collect valuable lessons for
       government's future handling of disasters.

 Project implementation

       Implementation of other activities included in the government's reconstruction,
       and financed by other donors, did suffer because of the absence of reliable
       beneficiary lists prepared in a timely fashion. For example, it impacted the
       implementation of the housing reconstruction programs on several islands. To fill
       this gap, donors should consider giving more active financial support and
       technical assistance for the preparation of these lists.

       Medium and small contractors may sometimes be better able to deliver in the
       aftermath of a disaster when large contractors are typically over-extended.
       Procurement processes should take greater account of the overloading of
       contractors.


                                           11
       Government should consider providing support to medium and small contractors
       to complete the necessary paperwork to meet the Bank's requirements as their
       work was often more satisfactory and timely in instances where they were able to
       participate in the bidding.

       Governments need to place greater emphasis upon the management of both
       procurement and financial management functions, even when its resources are
       stretched by an emergency.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The IDA-funded activities were implemented as follows:

Component 1. Restoration of livelihoods (US$8.5 million). This component was fully
and successfully implemented. As implemented, it had four sub-components.

a1). Cash grants to affected households (US$4.0 million). The distribution of cash
grants to households seriously affected by the tsunami with full or partial loss of houses
and/or household goods was completed as planned. The funds were fully disbursed to
58,370 beneficiaries. Bank missions vetted the implementation of the component and
commented on the precision in the identification of beneficiaries by the Ministry of
Social Security and the timely distribution of the grants.

a2). Cash grants to agriculturalists (US$1.4 million). Cash grants were also
distributed to households whose agricultural operations were affected by the tsunami.
The Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture prepared a list of 5,868 applicants to receive
grants under this sub-component. In addition, the Ministry prepared a second (additional)
list of beneficiaries, for financing under grant from the Japan Social Development Fund
(JSDF) (as described above).

b1). Repair of fishing boats (US$0.1 million). Cash grants were distributed for the
restoration and repair of large fishing vessels. The identification of beneficiaries under
this component was highly satisfactory, largely because each vessel had a registered
number and could be verified for damages prior to granting assistance. The damage
assessments were prepared with the help of specialists hired by the FAO. Additional
funds provided through the JSDF allowed additional compensation to be paid for other
equipment losses by fishermen.

b2). Loans to small businesses (US$3.0 million). Following the initial distributions of
cash grants to households, the government requested the Bank approval to use project
funds to provide small loans to small businesses so as to reduce the pressures created by
the provision of cash grants. It proposed that these loans should be distributed through
the Bank of Maldives (BML). The Bank agreed to this proposal and the financing
agreement was amended accordingly.

Using these funds, BML issued business loans to 940 tsunami- affected families, mainly
for fish processing activities, and some for agriculture and trading purposes. Due process
was followed when making the loans, including clearing the beneficiary lists with the
National Disaster Management Corporation (NDMC) and using the Bank's loan officers
to formally evaluate the loans. Regrettably, BML's completion report to the Government
noted that the default rate for these loans was 76 % against a current average of 24%4
percent for the rest of its portfolio. The report suggested that because the loans were


4 This is significantly higher than the Bank of Maldives' historic single digit overdue rate and is a result of
the recent economic downturn.


                                                      14
associated with tsunami relief, beneficiaries were treating the loans as grants. It
suggested that further clarification was needed from Government if they were ever to be
repaid.

Component 2: Increase school capacity on islands receiving population displaced by
the tsunami and rehabilitate damaged schools (US$5.0 million). Thirty-eight schools
(listed below) were successfully constructed, rehabilitated, or expanded. All works
contracts (comprising 31 small value school upgrading works) were completed prior to
the project closing date and all but four before the end of 2008. A technical audit report
in mid-2008 concluded that the quality of work was satisfactory overall. However, it was
lower than the quality of the EU-funded schools where construction was more intensively
supervised by both local and international consultants.

The school age population in the Maldives has been decreasing steadily since 2002 when
it peaked at 106,220. This population stood at 97,131 in 2007 and is estimated to be only
73,798 in 2009.5 Meanwhile the GoM has not implemented its school rationalization
policy6 or the focus island policy7 discussed at the time of project preparation. While not
an issue at this time, as additional buildings have been typically built in crowded multi-
session schools.

Component 3: Technical skills for implementing the Post-Tsunami Reconstruction
Program (US$0.5 million)

As envisaged, the government/MOFT used this component to finance temporary staff and
an expatriate accountant to assist with the management of the TRRF.
