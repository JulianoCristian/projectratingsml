agricultural policy adjustments and to\n            improve services to farmers and livestock producers. The\n            project will support the adjustment program through: a)\n            water measurement and management in the Jordan Valley; b)\n            groundwater basin monitoring and cotrol; c) strengthening\n            research; d) developing extension; and e) carrying out\n            monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of the adjustment\n            program. The first component will help improve water\n            measurement and management in the Jordan Valley. Under the\n            second component, the Government is adopting a program to\n            move towards sustainable groundwater abstraction nationwide,\n            and implementing a full management program to meter and\n            control all groundwater production, supply and usage. Under\n            the remaining components, the project will strengthen the\n            key agricultural support services of research and extension\n            to enable them to better advise producers on optimizing\n            productivity in response to changing price signals during adjustment."}, "docdt": "1994-11-18T00:00:00Z"}
