overall\n            conveyance system efficiency in the Jordan Valley to 80\n            percent. the sustainability of project investments is likely\n            because of the innovation made to assign responsibility for\n            the bulk of the physical investments to farmers, and the\n            human capacity developed. Overall World Bank and Borrower\n            performances were rated as satisfactory, although there were\n            delays in implementation. Key lessons learned included the\n            following: Decentralizing investments downstream of pumping\n            stations to private operators, especially farmers, would\n            help promote the sustainability of the irrigation system at\n            that level. A first step was made to relocate farm turnouts\n            from their customary location on access roads to on-farm,\n            with individual farmers being held accountable for them and\n            the related costs recovered directly from them in cases of\n            meter tampering. Apart from promoting sustainability, this\n            approach has also reduced the fiscal costs of these\n            investments. Although some monitoring of the project's\n            effects and some monitoring capacity was built in to the\n            agriculture ministry, these efforts slowed and were not\n            effectively used by the government to address the impacts of\n            sector reforms on the poor. Internal clearance mechanisms\n            used by the Government to review small equipment purchases\n            resulted in needless delays and transaction costs. he Bank\n            for no"}, "docdt": "2001-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
