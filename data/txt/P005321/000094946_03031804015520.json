Evaluation\n            Summary's (ES) assessment, in that it downgrades the\n            outcome ratings of both the Agricultural Sector Adjustment\n            Loan (ASAL), and Agricultural Sector Technical Support\n            (ASTS) Projects to moderately satisfactory, but upgrades the\n            ASAL's institutional development to substantial, while\n            concurs with the ES's rating on the ASTS'\n            institutional development as modest. However, the consistent\n            ratings in both operations show likely sustainability, and\n            satisfactory performances from both the Bank, and Borrower.\n            The experience of the two projects, confirm key lessons from\n            the Operations Evaluation Department as follows. The overly\n            ambitious ASAL project design - in addressing both\n            agriculture sector/trade and water reforms - was limited by\n            political constraints, given farmers could not at the same\n            time, pay more for water, and be constricted by the\n            elimination of subsidies, and loss of import protection.\n            Instead, the ASAL could have been an appropriate instrument\n            for institutional reform of the water sector, had the Bank\n            better understood the government's concerns on social,\n            poverty, and employment impacts of higher agricultural water\n            tariffs, and worked in a participatory, more incremental\n            approach to address these concerns. This harmed the\n            Bank's credibility, for although the cross-sectoral and\n            strategic framework for water and agriculture, were\n            supportive (even accepted by stakeholders) of increased\n            water tariffs, at approval time it was clear that a second\n            water tariff increase would be politically unrealistic.\n            Thus, the second tranche release undermined donor\n            partnerships, and mislead the government towards wrongful\n            tariff increases. The above confirms that reforms cannot be\n            imposed, and the Bank needs to be more sensitive to the\n            political economy of reform, acceptability, and timing."}, "docdt": "2003-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
