Bank Reform Loan Project. The two loans were analyzed\n            together because of their twin nature - identical timing and\n            similar purpose. The outcome of both loans were rated\n            satisfactory. Among the lessons applicable to both loans\n            are: 1) Financial/fiscal crises offer opportunities for\n            structural change in banking. 2) Structural/ownership change\n            in banking requires resources to restructure past losses. 3)\n            Even when sufficient financial resources are available,\n            there will be selection bias in the roster of potential\n            acquirers. It is unclear whether program design features\n            alone can overcome that bias. 4) Funds were disbursed only\n            after the careful review of the individual transactions. 5)\n            Some of the banks created through these transactions may\n            require additional restructuring as market conditions\n            change. Some failures need to be anticipated. 6) A strong\n            borrower commitment is indispensable in such complicated,\n            time-intensive transactions."}, "docdt": "1999-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
