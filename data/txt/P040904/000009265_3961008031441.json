objective of the Bank Reform Loan\n            Project is to provide balance of payments support to the\n            Argentine Republic in the aftermath of the regional crisis\n            that has abruptly curtailed the country's access to\n            foreign capital. At the same time the loan will support the\n            Argentine Government's ambitious bank reform program.\n            The program has the following principal objectives: 1) to\n            hasten the process of consolidation of a fragmented private\n            banking sector; 2) to improve the financial structure of a\n            distressed banking sector in the context of acquisitions,\n            mergers and restructurings, and 3) to contribute to the\n            restoration of confidence in the banking system."}, "docdt": "1995-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
