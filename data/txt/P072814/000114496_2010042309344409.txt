Re:   
Community Development Fund Project (TF024832) 
 
Amendment to the Trust Fund Grant Agreement      
Dear Mr. Surroi, 
 
I
refer to the Trust Fund Grant Agreement dated December 21, 2000 between the 
International Development Association, acting as Administrator for the Trust Fund for Kosovo 
(the Administrator) and Community Development Fund (the Recipient) for the above Project (the 
Grant Agreement).  I further refer to your letter dated October 7, 2002 requesting amendment of 
the Grant Agreement in order to include financial audits as an eligible expenditure under the 
Project. 
 
I
am pleased to inform you that the Administrator has concurred with your request and 
that the Administrator proposes the following amendments to the Grant Agreement: 
 
1. 
Inserting the words “and financial auditing” at the end of Category (2) of Section 1 of 
Part A (General) of Schedule 1 (Withdrawal of the Proceeds of the Grant) such that said 
Category henceforward shall read as follows: “(2)  Consultants’ services including 
training and financial auditing”.  
 
2. 
Inserting the following new paragraph under Part C (Other Procedures for the Selection 
of Consultants) of Section II (Employment of Consultants) of Schedule 3 (Procurement 
and Consultants’ Services) immediately after paragraph 1: 
 
“2. 
Least Cost Selection
Services estimated to cost less than  US$30,000 equivalent per contract for 
financial audit services may be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph 3.1 and 3.6 of the Consultant Guidelines.” 
 
3. 
As a result of the insertion of new paragraph 2 above, re-numbering existing paragraph 2 
(Individual Consultants) of said Part C of Section II of Schedule 3 as paragraph 3.
