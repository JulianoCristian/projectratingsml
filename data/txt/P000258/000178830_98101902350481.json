a\n            possible three phase program to convert swampland to more\n            productive use. The main objectives of this first four-year\n            pilot phase will be to: (a) test key assumptions regarding\n            future development of swamp areas; and (b) address price\n            structure, marketing and economic issues of the rice\n            subsector. In addition, the project will assist the\n            Government to promote institution building in the subsector\n            through organizational, training and evaluation components;\n            define a national rice policy; and create a market structure\n            to ensure farmer confidence in rice production and train\n            future rice industry managers. Four hundred hectares of\n            swampland will be developed through construction of simple\n            flood protection works. Support to the rice industry will be\n            provided through provision of technical experts'\n            services to the Ministry of Rural Development and, to the\n            Kou Valley Rice Mill, and through an evaluation unit and\n            studies to review policy and practice in the industry."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
