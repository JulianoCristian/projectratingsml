Dionkele Rice Development\n            Project for Upper Volta is a pilot phase of a possible three\n            phase program to convert swampland to more productive use.\n            The main objectives of this first four-year pilot phase will\n            be to: (a) test key assumptions regarding future development\n            of swamp areas; and (b) address price structure, marketing\n            and economic issues of the rice subsector. In addition, the\n            project will assist the Government to promote institution\n            building in the subsector through organizational, training\n            and evaluation components; define a national rice policy;\n            and create a market structure to ensure farmer confidence in\n            rice production and train future rice industry managers.\n            Four hundred hectares of swampland will be developed through\n            construction of simple flood protection works. Support to\n            the rice industry will be provided through provision of\n            technical experts' services to the Ministry of Rural\n            Development and to the Kou valley rice mill, and through an\n            evaluation unit and studies to review policy and practice in\n            the industry."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
