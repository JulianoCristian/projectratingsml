efficiency and relevance of\n            the National System for Vocational and Technical Education\n            (CONALEP).  Specific objectives are to : a) upgrade the\n            quality of high level skills training and middle level\n            technician training; b) selectively expand the range of\n            CONALEP's training activities in key sectors; and c)\n            strengthen the administration of CONALEP.  The project would\n            achieve these objectives through the implementation of three\n            components.  The first includes quality improvements in the\n            area of teacher training, advance technology pre-service\n            training, and high level in-service training in eight\n            selected centers.  The second component encompasses\n            expansion of training activities, including the initiation\n            of a modular program in the evening.  The third component\n            involves increasing efficiency and includes measures such as\n            strengthening CONALEP's cost accounting/recovery\n            systems; improving the efficiency of student flows and\n            graduate placement; and development of a communications network."}, "docdt": "1991-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
