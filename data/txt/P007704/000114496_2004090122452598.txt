            Re: Loan No. 3358-ME (Third Technical Training
                Project) Amendment to the Loan and CONALEP
                Project Agreements
Dear Sirs:
        Please refer to the Loan Agreement between
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the
Bank) and Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (the Borrower) dated
October 14, 1991 (the Loan Agreement) and to the CONALEP
Project Agreement between the Bank and Colegio Nacional de
Educacion Profesional Tecnica (CONALEP) of even date therewith
(the CONALEP Project Agreement; as amended).  We are pleased to
inform you that, as a result of your request and our recent
discussions on the subject, the Bank agrees to amend the Loan
Agreement and CONALEP Project Agreement as follows:
LOAN AGREEMENT
Schedule 1
1.  A new paragraph 4 is hereby added at the end of said
Schedule to read as follows in its entirety:  "The Bank may
require withdrawals from the Loan Account to be made on the
basis of statements of expenditure for expenditures such as,
inter alia, those for consultant services under $100,000
equivalent per contract (in the case of consulting firms) or
under $50,000 equivalent per contract (in the case of
individual consultants), under such terms and conditions as the
Bank shall specify by notice to the Borrower.".
CONALEP PROJECT AGREEMENT
Schedule
2.  Section II of this Schedule is hereby amended to read as
follows in its entirety:
    "1.  In order to assist CONALEP in carrying out the
Project, CONALEP shall employ consultants whose qualifications,
experience and terms and conditions of employment shall be
satisfactory to the Bank.  Such consultants shall be selected
in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to
the Bank on the basis of the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as
Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981 (the
Consultant Guidelines).  For assignments estimated to cost
$500,000 equivalent or more, CONALEP shall employ such
consultants under contracts using the standard form of contract
for consultantsþ services issued by the Bank, with such
modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank.  For
Page  2
assignments estimated to cost less than $500,000 equivalent,
CONALEP shall use other standard forms agreed with the Bank.
    "2.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this
Section, the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring
prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists,
selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals,
evaluation reports and contracts shall not apply to contracts
for consulting firms estimated to cost less than $100,000
equivalent each, or to contracts for individual consultants
estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each.  However,
this exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to:  (a)
the terms of reference for such contracts; (b) single source
selection of consulting firms; (c) assignments of a critical
nature as reasonably determined by the Bank; (d) amendments of
contracts for consulting firms estimated to cost $100,000
equivalent or above or for individual consultants estimated to
cost $50,000 equivalent or above; or (e) amendments of
contracts for consulting firms raising the contract value to
$100,000 equivalent or above or for individual consultants
raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above.".
        Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing
amendments by signing and dating this letter in the spaces
provided below.  This amendment letter may be executed in three
counterparts, each of which shall be an original.  Upon your
confirmation, please return one fully executed original to us.
        Because of his interest in this matter, a copy of this
letter is being sent to the Director General de Credito Publico
of the Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico.
