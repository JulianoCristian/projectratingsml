     Project in Mozambique are as follows: overall outcome of the\n            project was rated satisfactory, and the performance of the\n            Bank and the Borrower were rated as satisfactory. Some of\n            the lessons learned from the project are: 1) project\n            simplicity and realistic objectives are important factors in\n            project success, especially in an environment of great\n            uncertainty and recognized weak capacity such as prevailed\n            in Mozambique in the late 1980s. Project design also needs\n            to be flexible to accommodate evolving country conditions;\n            2) care needs to be taken when designing projects with more\n            than one implementing sectoral ministry. Implementation is\n            likely to become complicated; multiple implementing\n            ministries should be avoided if feasible; 3) with the\n            sectoral ministry clearly taking the lead in\n            conceptualization and strategy development, donor\n            coordination across the sector can be built around growing\n            coordination in sub-sectors or sub-areas; 4) to effectively\n            monitor implementation, clear and monitor able performance\n            targets need to be set at appraisal; 5) continuity of\n            technical assistance, often crucial to a project's\n            success, can be achieved in the medium-term by ensuring\n            repeated presence of the same advisors. This can also be\n            achieved in the long-term with good communications access\n            between visits; 6) e-mail communications between Ministry of\n            Health (MOH)/ Gabinete de Coordinacao de Projectos de\n            Investimento (GACOPI) and Washington-based Bank staff, which\n            became available during implementation, greatly facilitated\n            and sped up communication and decreased Health and Nutrition\n            Project (HNP) communication costs."}, "docdt": "1998-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
