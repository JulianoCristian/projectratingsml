MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF MOZAMBIQUE
FOR A HEALTH AND NUTRITION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Mozambique for SDR 21.0 million (US$27.0 million equivalent) is submitted
for approval. The credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity. It
would help finance a health and nutrition project. The project would be financed
parallel by WFP for SDR 3.4 million (US$4.4 million equivalent), UNICEF for SDR 1.5
million (US$1.9 million equivalent), NORAD for SDR 0.2 Lillion (US$0.2 million
equivalent) and the Government of Switzerland SDR 4.1 million (US$5.3 million
equivalent).
2.        Background.  Despite severe economic difficulties and the ongoing security
situation, the Government is making encouraging progress in implementing an Economic
Rehabilitation Program (ERP) that provides a promising basis for future development.
Within this context, the Government is strongly committed to improving social sector
services, including health and nutrition, and to developing appropriate policies to
cushion the social impact of adjustment measures.
3.        On health, policies stressing preventive and basic health services have
been adopted and implemented, leading to a rise in the number of primary care
facilities from 546 to 1,416 between 1975 and 1985. Despite this progress, health
status remains poor in comparison to other low-income African countries, due both to
the low base inherited at Independence and to continuing problems within the health
system itself. Key problems include a cumbersome Ministry of Health (MOH)
structure, fragmented health information systems, weak management, lack of
maintenance capacity, and shortages of crucial inputs -- together contributing to
low efficiency and poor quality of services. Moreover, widespread armed bandit
activity has led to damage or destruction of much of the health facilities network
and to disruption of services. Increased cost recovery has been introduced, but
major questions have yet to be resolved about implementation and about protecting
vulnerable groups. Family planning services are readily available at health
facilities and contraceptive prevalence rates of 18 percent in Maputo are high by
East African standards. The MOH is currently receiving substantial support from
UNFPA in strengthening family planning services and has just established an IPPF-
affiliated family planning association to promote family planning. The Government
has indicated that a possible financial gap may emerge in later years for health and
population, thus a future operation in the sector (currently shown as FY92) would
aim to contribute towards any such financing gap.
4.        On nutrition, there are serious and widespread problems stemming largely
from the severe deterioration in food production. While the Government's new
policies under the ERP, including improved prices and other incentives to producers,
will have important beneficial effects in the medium- and long-term, their short-
term consequences have been negative for urban residents, particularly poor
households with high dependency ratios, who have experienced food price increases
ranging from 100-300 percent in the rationing system. Overall food security is
likely to remain precarious for some time due to climatic vagaries, infrastructure
deficiencies, weak institutions and continuing bandit activity which has led to
displacement of an estimated 1.5 million people and affected a further 3 million.
For the next several years at least, Mozambique will continue to be dependent upon
substantial inputs of food aid, the main responsibility for distribution of which
rests with: (a) the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) for the sale of food, particularly



- 2 -
rn urban areast and (b) the Department for the Prevention and Control of Natural
Calamities of the Ministry of International Cooperation for free food distribution
as part of emergency relief effozts. It will be crucial during this rereol to
ensure that food aid is used as efficiently as possible and in ways that promote
productive activities and protect vulnerable groups.
5.        ProJect objectives.  To help improve health and nutrition status, the
project has four main objectives: (a) strengthening capacity in policY formulation
and management on health and food security issues, with special attention to
resource mobilization, institutional development, information systems, planning and
analysis; (b) improving efficiency, to enhance the impact of services within the
tightly constrained budgett (c) improving service quality, to enhance the provision
of basic needs for the population: and (d) helping to mitigate some of the social
costs of adjustment, to help sustain the ERP.
6.        Project description.  Supporting these objecti$es within the context of
building a firmer basis for longer-term development and institution-building, the
project, comprised of two components, would involve the following:
(a)   For the objective of strengthening capacity in policy formulation and
management, the project would: (i) facilitate development of imProved policies
in the health sector in the areas of cost-recovery, manpower planning, and
facility management through studies and assistance in implementation of these
studies' recommendationss (ii) strengthen the MOH through reorganizing the
central ministry, developing a better financial management information system
and establishing a central unit, under the Department of Planning, to manage and
supervise the implementation of investment programs; and (iii) contribute to
improving food security policies and information by aiding in policy analyses
regarding food pricing and distribution and improvements to the food security
information sy-tem.
(b)   For the two objectives of improving quality and increasing efficiency of
services, the project would: (i) support the health facilities reconstruction
program, through renovating and equipping selected health facilities; (ii)
improve hospital efficiency through establishing better management procedures;
(iii) strengthen health facility maintenance capability at the provincial and
central levels through technical assistance for MOH maintenance centers and the
provision of initial stocks of basic materials and vehicles; (iv) improve
pharmaceutical supply system, through construction/renovation of drugs storage
facilities in Maputo and Beira with a view to strengthening inventory control
and reducing spoilage and upgrading overall management; (v) improve health
manpower training, through enhancement of teaching quality, curriculum
development, and capacity for in-service training and through upgrading of
training centers, teaching materials and technical assistance; and (vi) increase
the efficiency of the urban food distribution system through streamlining food
supply management and information in the ration system, easing the transport
shortage for moving food supplies from central depots to consumers in Maputo and
Beira, supporting supplemental feeding programs targeted to primary school
children in Maputo and Beira, and improving the nutritional status of factory
workers.
These activities would, in addition to their other benefits, also contribute to the
fourth objective of helping to mitigate the social costs of adjustment. In
particular, the supplemental feeding programs would directly help the targeted
groups in dealing with the ERP's transitional costs. Additionally, improvements to



- 3 -
the rationing system would help ensure regular availability of essential cereale and
other comuodities to the urban population.
7.       Health-related project activities would be carried out by the MOH and
nutrition and food security-related activities by the MOC. Both Ministries have
appointed project directors and coordinators and established the necessary
administrative units for proj9ct implementation. The project, to be executed over a
period of five years, would include funds for equipment, supplies, civil works,
vehicles, technical assistance (including housing), training and incremental
recurrent costs. Preparation of the project was undertaken by the Government of
Mozambique (GOM), with assistance from an IDA Project Preparation Facility (PPF) of
US$0.8 million. Including refinancing of the PPF, the total cost of the project is
estimated at US$42.5 million with a foreign exchange component of US$36.4 million.
By project cloeing, December 1994, the annual incremental recurrent costs generated
directly by the project would be about US$0.67 million for the MOH, only 3 percent
of the 1988 MOH recurrent budget. Annual incremental recurrent costs of US$0.19
million for the MOC represent less than 1 percent of the 1988 MOC recurrent budget.
8.        The proposed site for the Maputo pharmaceutical warehouse was legally
transferred to the MOH by Maputo City authorities prior to credit negotiations.
There are presently about 60 families living on the Maputo warehouse site. A plan
for resettlement of the families on alternative sites has been developed. Taking
into account Government objectives of supporting the private sector, about 100
vehicles intended to alleviate the transport shortage for the distribution of food
supplies would be transferred to independent retailers as part of the ration scheme.
9.       A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the allocation and disbursement of the IDA
Credit are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of project preparation and the status
of Bank Group operations in Mozambique are shown in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7423-MOZ, dated February 1, 1989
is also attached.
10.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA involvement is needed because (i) the
Government has not yet developed sufficient capacity and experience to address
effectively the complex technical, strategic, and policy issues that must be
resolved; (ii) IDA has a comparative advantage in these areas, including
considerable experience from other countries; (iii) other donors are already fully
extended in other areas (e.g., emergency relief) or lack the required expertise or
resources; (iv) the Government and other donors, recognizing these points, are
seeking IDA involvement and see it as an aid to strengthening other donor-assisted
initiatives; and (v) the project will contribute to ensurin, that the adjustment
process remains sustainable.
11.      Aareed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following main actions:
A) by credit effectiveness: i) submission to IDA of an evaluation of the cost
recovery scheme together with MOH comments; and (ii) finalization and submission to
IDA of the study on food needs, supply and access based on IDA comments on the draft
study presented by the Government during negotiations; B) Covenants: i) a joint
review of the cost recovery evaluation by GOM and IDA by October 31, 1989, with
implementation of the jointly agreed action plan to commence by April 30, 1990; ii)
submission of manpower development plan to IDA by July 31, 1990, with a joint review
to be held by October 31, 1990, and implementation of the jointly agreed
recommendations to commence immediately thereafter; iii) submission of the study on
the MOH's organization by October 31, 1989, with a joint review to be held by
January 31, 1990 and implementation of the jointly agreed action plan to commence



- 4 -
immediately thereafter; iv) implementation of the resettlement plan for the families
on the site of the proposed Maputo pharmaceuticals store in a manner acceptable to
IDA; v) transfer of tru^ks for strengthening of the urban food distribution system
to the private sector in accordance with the procedures agreed during negotiations;
and vi) that all the necessary measures be taken to provide housing for the resident
consultants to be employed under the project; and C) conditlons of disbursement of
funds for: i) the second phase of health facilities rehabilitation (about 60X of the
funds for the sub-component) would be the satisfactory demonstration to IDA of the
attainment of jointly agreed efficiency measures (namely reductions in the average
length of patient stay, and reducing excess meal production in the hospital
kitchens) to be implemented at the three main hospitals of Maputo, Beira and
Nampula; and ii) the housing for foreign technical assistance personnel, IDA
approval of the designs, architectural plans and financial terms for the
construction of such housing.
12.      Justification.  The project provides a significant opportunity to aasist
Mozambique in: a) human capital development, thereby laying the foundetion for
long-term economic growth; and b) protecting vulnerable groups during the adjustment
process, thereby helping the adjustment process to be sustainable. The project thus
would make a contribution towards both the longer-term institutional, policy, and
service deliveLy development in the health ar_ nutrition sectors, and tcwards
meeting the immediate basic needs of the population during the transitional stage in
the ERP process. The improved policy formulation capability and efficiency measures
to be introduced through the project would assist the Government in making better
use of scarce domestic and foreign resources, thereby improving both the quality and
the sustainability of service delivery within the tight resource constraints facing
Mozambique.
13.      Risks.  Risks are twofold.  First, the ongoing security situation presents
special difficulties. In order to minimize possible disruption, project activities
have been restricted to secure areas. Second, Mozambique's experience in managing
health projects is still quite limited, there are few trained managers, and tnere is
little experience in project management and in procedures such as international
bidding procedures, project monitoring, keeping accounts or performing audits. This
risk is being addressed through the strengthening of program and project
Implementation capacity and provision of technical assistance and training under the
project. Additional support to implementation capacity is also being provided
through multi lteral/bilateral agencies and NGOs.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
