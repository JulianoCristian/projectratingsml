         improve health and nutrition status in Mozambique; this will\n            be accomplished by a variety of components. In order to\n            strengthen policy formulation and management capacity, the\n            project will : (i) facilitate development of improved health\n            policies in the areas of cost recovery, manpower development\n            and facility management; (ii) strengthen the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) through reorganisation of the central ministry,\n            and development of an improved financial management\n            information system; and (iii) contribute to improving food\n            security policies by aiding in policy analyses on food\n            pricing and distribution. The project will assist in\n            improving services by : (i) renovating and equipping\n            selected health facilities; (ii) establishing better\n            hospital management procedures; (iii) constructing and\n            renovating drug storage facilities; and (iv) improving\n            health manpower training. Finally, the project will increase\n            the efficiency of the urban food distribution system through\n            management streamlining and strengthening of supplemental\n            feeding programs."}, "docdt": "1989-02-01T00:00:00Z"}
