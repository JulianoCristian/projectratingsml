overall objective of accelerating human resource\n            development to ensure that the requisite manpower exists to\n            attain the desired economic transition in Dominica. The\n            project is intended to: 1) strengthen the planning and\n            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth\n            Affairs and Sports (MOE) to guide and carry out the\n            long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to\n            initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide\n            qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary\n            level; and 2) serve as a catalyst for a major adjustment\n            process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of\n            primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line\n            with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social\n            development. The project comprises three major components:\n            1) a strengthening management and planning component; 2) a\n            qualitative improvement of basic education component, which\n            will enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and 3) an\n            expansion and conservation of school places component, which\n            will assist MOE to provide more secondary school places in\n            the most under-served districts to reduce long distance\n            travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities."}, "docdt": "1995-11-29T00:00:00Z"}
