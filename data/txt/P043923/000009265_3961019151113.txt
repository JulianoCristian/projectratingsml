MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND
THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO GRENADA
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
the equivalent of US$3.826 million and a proposed development credit for SDR 2.6 million, the equivalent
of US$3.826 million, to Grenada to help finance a Basic Education Reform Project to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the education system, and enhance the equity of access to educational
opportunities. The loan would be a single currency (US dollars) fixed interest rate loan, with standard
amortization term, grace period and interest rate for loans with an expected disbursement period between 3
and 6 years. The credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years. Retroactive
financing of up to SDR 512,000 (US$760,000 equivalent) or 10 percent of combined IBRD and IDA
project finan- ng would be provided to reimburse the Government for eligible expenditures incurred after
October 1, 1995, to enable the Government to commence immediately requisite steps to expedite the
education reform process.
2.     Country Background. Grenada is a member country of the Organization of Eastem Caribbean
States (OECS). The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the OECS countries has been circulated to the
Board and discussed in April 1995.' According to 1993 estimates, Grenada has a population of about
91,000. In the 1980s, real annual growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in the OECS averaged about
six percent, largely because of: (a) concessional aid flows, (b) preferential market access and favorable
prices for banana exports, and (c) some tourism development. Amid a rapidly changing external
environment, however, GDP growth slowed to four percent over the 1990-93 period. Among these
countries, Grenada had a below average performance in 1994 with a GDP growth of 2.5 percent.
3.    The members of the OECS are experiencing a difficult period of economic transition, with (i) a
decline in concessional aid flows (from about nine percent of GDP in the early 1980s to about four percent
in the 1990s, (ii) increased competition in banana exports from Latin American producers under the new
European Union banana regime and the implementation of the North American Free Trade Area, and (iii)
continued low prices for nutmegs (Grenada's main export crop). Grenada faces serious fiscal problems; its
external debt stocks represent about one third of GDP and service on official debt is 4 percent of exports
and 8 percent of revenues. The country also faces an arrears situation -- about US$7.8 million to OPEC,
Libya and Algeria, repayment of much of which is affected by UN sanctions. Despite these difficulties,
social indicators reflect relatively high standards of living. However, unemployment, especially among
youth, has remained persistently high at 12-20 percent of the labor force, and there are pockets of poverty.
Environmental awareness is high and no significant gender bias appears to exist in the provision of social
services.
4.     The success of economic transition, essential in the increasingly competitive global economy, will
require increasing domestic savings, broadening the economic base, improving the incentive structure to
promote efficiency and productivity and encourage private sector growth, and improving the infrastructure.
Report No. 14295-LAC. Memorandum of the President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the International Development Association to the Executive Directors on a Country Assistance
Strategy of the World Bank Group for the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States April 10, 1995.
1



The best prospects for employment growth appear to lie in increased productivity in agriculture and the
development of tourism, assembly manufacturing, telecommunication, financial services and construction.
5.     Key to attaining the desired economic transition, will be accelerated human resource development
to ensure a modem labor force, well prepared to adapt to the rapidly evolving international economy. To
secure such a labor force, standards of education and learning must be raised significantly. Strong
commitment to education has been reflected in sustained, relatively high public investment levels in the
OECS by comparison with other developing countries world wide. Within the OECS context, however,
Grenada allocates relatively modest proportions of national recurrent budget--16.6 percent--to education.
6.     Sector Background. Considerable expansion of coverage has been achieved, with almost universal
access to primary education and about 63 percent of the secondary school age group in secondary schools
(net of repeaters over the age of 16). The key issues in education are weak management and planning,
unsatisfactory and declining educational quality, poor inter:-al efficiency of the school systems, and
problems of access to education.
7.     Adequate numbers of primary school places exist virtually nationwide; hence, expansion of
primary education infrastructure is not a priority, provided the transition rates to secondary education could
be raised so as to relieve the primary schools of large numbers of students beyond the normal primnary age
group.
8.     Low transition rates from primary to secondary education reflect serious constraints in the supply
of, rather than in the demand for secondary places. Only about three out of five secondary school age
youth--those 12-16 years old-has access to bonafide secondary education. The proposed project would
add 665 places to raise the total of secondary school places to approximately 70 percent (net of repeaters
beyond 16 years of age) of the 12-16 age group. Even with project-supported investments, amid an
estimated 9,220 secondary school age youth, the goal of universal access to secondary education will not be
attainable until well into the first decade of the next century, unless significant additional resources can be
mobilized and/or efficiency measures instituted to reduce the number of over age students in the secondary
schools.
9.     Secondary school places are allocated to students on the basis of their performance in a competitive
Conmmon Entrance Examination (CEE) taken around age 11, at the end of the primary education cycle.
Because of the high stakes, succeeding in the CEE is the main driving force of primary education, thereby
distorting it from mastery of the prescribed curriculum toward mastery of the exam-tested areas. For the
vast majority of students who do not gain a place in the secondary schools and must therefore remain in
primary schools to complete the period of compulsory education which ends at age 16 (senior primary
program), this schooling reflects the terminal point in their formal education. Relatively few of these
students are successful at their "second chance" to enter secondary school through the opportunity made
available three years later through the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) Examination which is effectively a
senior primary examination. The shortages of qualified teachers to serve the senior primarv program,
coupled with lower curricular standards, suggest limited value-added during the senior primary years,
exacerbating problems of labo. ! Jrce absorption of these students upon leaving school.
10.    Serious inequities exist in learning opportunities. Overcrowding of schools is common in and
around the capital city area of St. George's. Many of the schools are poorly maintained and some buildings
are dilapidated, unhealthy and unsafe. Moreover, the education sector faces several issues relating to the
quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning. Performance in the CEE and in the examinations
administered at the end of the secondary cycle--the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) exam--indicate
2



unacceptably low levels of student mastery of curricula throughout the system. Test scores also indicate
wide disparities in student performance across schools and districts. Of increasing social concern are the
significant gender differentials in student achievement, with girls attaining higher scores than boys on the
CEE, thus securing the predominant share (59 percent) of secondary places and a rapidly increasing share
of tertiary education.
11.    The key factors contributing to low student performance in many schools include:
(a)    weak institutional capacity to plan, manage, or monitor performance of the education
system;
(b)    inadequate supervision of instructional delivery;
(c)    poor articulation of curricula within and between grades and cycles;
(d)    distortion of the primary curriculum by the pressure of competition for secondary school
places; and
(e)    quantitative and qualitative problems with regard to major education system inputs,
particularly the teaching cadre, educational equipment and supplies, and facilities.
12.    With regard to efficiency, the relatively high teacher to student ratios at the public primary and
secondary levels-- 1:27 and 1:19 respectively--reflect the absence of close monitoring of costs and
efficiency, and lack of detailed planning and programming of enrollments, curriculum organization within
the schools and recruitment and deployment of teachers. These ratios are far more generous than
reasonable ratios of about 1:30-35 at the primary level, and 1:25 at the secondary level. It will be essential
to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet system-wide needs in management, equipment and
supplies and maintenance, that are now significantly underfinanced and are essential to achieving
qualitative improvement. Salaries presently consume, on average, over 95 percent of primary and
secondary level outlays, thus severely circumscribing the availability of funding for other key educational
inputs, and ultimately lirniting teaching effectiveness. The savings resulting from less generous (and yet
reasonable) teacher to student ratios would permit the system to better respond to current and projected
needs and ensure that sufficient resources are available to support initiatives being launched under the
proposed Project.
13.    From an equity standpoint, the poor face special geographic and economic constraints to access to
good quality education. The heavy urban concentration of secondary schools limnits their availability to
poor, rural families, who may not be able to afford relatively high transport costs for their children to
attend such schools when coupled with other considerable education-related expenditures bome by the
household (i.e., textbooks, uniforms), although public education itself is free. The poor CEE performance
of many students in schools outside the capital city areas also limits their access to secondary education.
No barriers exist to the establishment and conduct of private schools, however, partly because of the tight
household financial situation, there is only a negligible number of private schools and these are
predominantly church schools. Even these often seek substantial State assistance which converts them
effectively into public schools.
14.    The Government has underscored the connection between (i) economic diversification and growth
objectives and (ii) human resource development, and the need to rapidly attain universal access to
secondary education. It recognizes that institutional and policy reforms will be essential to achieve desired
education sector improvements. The Government's priorities include: (a) developing local capacity for
policy analysis, project identification, preparation and evaluation, data management and research; (b)
reform of the sector to improve intemal efficiency and external productivity, design new curricula and
provide teaching materials, and (c) reduction of inequities in access to education caused by remoteness and
3



poverty. National education policy assigns high priority to improving access to, and the quality of, basic,
compulsory education (up to age 16), consistent with the OECS Education Reform Strategy (OERS).
15.    Project Objectives. The project objectives are to accelerate human resource development to
ensure that the requisite mix of skills exists to attain desired econormic transition. The project supports the
first stage of a major reform of basic education, namely:
(a)    strengthening planning and management in the sector;
(b)    improving the quality of basic education; and
(c)    expanding access to schools, especially at the secondary level.
16.    During project implementation, the Project Management Unit (para 20) and the Bank will monitor
project achievements on the basis of evaluation and monitoring indicators that will be included in the
Project Implementation Manual (para 20). The key performance indicators for the project are provided in
Schedule B.
17.    Project Description. The project comprises three major components:
(a)    A Strengthening Planning and Management Component (US$1.7 million equivalent, or
19 percent of total base costs) would (i) reorganize the administrative structure, upgrade
staff, and create better linkages among kev Ministry of Education (MOE) operating units;
(ii) reinforce central and sector capacity for planning and analysis and formulate a long-
term sector development plan; (iii) initiate development of an integrated education data
system comprising student, school, financial and personnel information and institutionalize
financial analysis of sector operations to facilitate improved sector analysis, administration
and management, and policy making; (iv) establish a permanent project development and
management capacity within the MOE and strengthen the central Planning Division of the
Ministry of Finance in order to better support education sector planning; and (v) finance
special studies critical to guide future policy and program development;
(b)    A Qualitative Improvement of Basic Education Component (US$2.2 million equivalent,
or 26 percent of total base costs) would enhance the quality of teaching and learning
through (i) upgrading basic teacher training and revising and intensifying in-service
training for all teachers (with special attention to the core subjects of social studies,
science, mathematics, and language arts) and concurrently ensuring their more appropriate
utilization and job satisfaction through improved personnel supervision, management and
career development; (ii) formulating and adopting improved curricula (especially in core
subjects); (iii) establishing an educational testing and measurement capacity to monitor
student and system performance; (iv) identifying and instituting more cost-effective
methods of selection, production, procurement and distribution of educational materials;
and (v) providing support for the acquisition of textbooks, supplies and educational
materials for selected disadvantaged schools.
(c)    An Expansion of Access to Schools Component (US$4.7 million equivalent, or 55 percent
of total base costs) would increase secondary places in an under-served district, and
expand and improve the facilities at an existing secondary school. These investments will
significantly reduce overcrowding at the primary level and improve educational
opportunities at the secondary level. Additionally, the project would provide for
reconstruction of two existing government assisted primary schools that are now housed in
4



unsuitable facilities. The component would also provide funding for urgently needed
rehabilitation of selected primary school facilities.
18.   Project Cost and Financing. The project is estimated to cost US$9.9 million equivalent
(including duties and taxes). The Government would finance 23 percent of total cost or US$2.3 million
which includes US$0.6 million of taxes (See Schedule A). The disbursement schedule and the amounts and
methods of procurement are shown in Schedule C. A time table of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Grenada are given in Schedules D and E respectively.
19.    Loan Product. Grenada is eligible for IBRD borrowing under Single Currency Loan (SCL) terms
because: (i) it has no unconverted VLR82 loans, and (ii) the proposed loan does not exceeds US$100
million, although it represents 100 percent of IBRD lending program for FY 1996. Presented with the
choice of loan product, the Government of Grenada decided on the fixed exchange rate US dollar SCL
option. This choice was based on the effort of eliminating exchange rate volatility (the EC dollar is pegged
to the US dollar) and mininizing interest rate uncertainty for a social sector project such as the proposed
one.
20.   Project Implementation. The Government has reached formal agreement with the Bank and
Association on the general contents of (a) an Education Strategy Letter outlining its sector policy and
development strategy and the measures being adopted to achieve its medium term goals, and (b) a Project
Implementation Manual (PIM) that would set out the project objectives and content; the modalities and
procedures of project implementation, the arrangements for the project management and financial
management and control, the project monitoring and evaluation indicators, the target dates for completion
of various aspects of the project, the system of project review (including annual and mid-term reviews),
procurement methods and audit requirements. The project would be executed by MOE, within which the
Government would establish an Educational Planning and Development facility, to include a Project
Management Unit (PMU) to oversee project implementation and an Education Planning Unit, in charge of
the preparation of a sector development plan. The Bank and IDA would permit a portion of proposed
retroactive financing to be utilized for meeting initial establishment and operational needs of the PMU. All
entities involved in project execution would be guided by the agreed PIM. A Project Advisory Committee
would be established, with representation from MOE and other ministries responsible for finance and
public works to provide advice and counsel to the PMU over the project implementation period. The
Government would establish a Special Account and a Project Account for the project under the
management of the PMU.
21.    Project Sustainability. The project scope reflects extensive national and international thinking on
development priorities in the sector. The project has been drawn from the national education plan, the
recommendations of the OERS and the Bank's report "Access, Quality and Efficiency in Caribbean
Education: A Regional Study." These studies emphasized the need to reform basic education, improve its
quality, expand access, especially at the secondary level, and strengthen sector management and planning.
Moreover, project preparatory work was undertaken with the assistance of intemational consultants to
evaluate and identify sector development constraints to ensure adoption of the most cost-effective
approaches to achieving desired education system improvements in teacher training, school building design,
school location planning. Thus the priorities for the project originated in extensive analysis and
Bank/country dialogue.
22.   The proposed project falls within the priorities of the OERS to which the Govemment has
subscribed. The commitment of the Government to the goals and content of the project will be contained in
5



its Education Strategy Letter. It is significant that the project was designed under the previous Government
and that the new Government elected in June 1995, after close study of the project, endorsed it fully.
Requisite Government financing for the project, including the contribution of US$ 1.7 million equivalent
(net of taxes) can easily be met, as it represents about 0.74 percent of GDP. Analysis show that because of
the savings to be generated by the sector adjustment process (paragraph 12), the project would not result in
any net incremental recurrent cost over its implementation period. The design of the technical assistance
program seeks to maximize development of local expertise and capacity, with the scheduling of expert
services and fellowships, synchronized to derive optimal value from both and to help sustain project
benefits well into the future.
23.    Lessons Learned from previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) No 14404 of April, 1995 prepared for the recently completed OECS Regional Vocational
and Technical Education Project (Credit 1785-CRG), as well as the experience of other Caribbean
education projects reveal that it is essential to: (a) link project objectives to the broader sector and macro
policy objectives; (b) carefully evaluate local procurement and project implementation capacities; (c)
ensure annually that Government budgets provide the requisite project financing to sustain project activities
and complete the project on schedule; (d) involve all major stakeholders in an education reform process
from the early stages of project design; and (e) ensure that the policy environment within which the project
will operate is supportive of project objectives and facilitates the conduct of the needed systemic and
institutional reforms. These lessons have been taken into account in designing the proposed project.
24.    Capitalizing on the experience of the preparation of the St. Lucia Basic Education Project (Loan
3837-SLU/Credit Cr2676-SLU), the selection and methods for procurement of educational equipment and
furniture have been carefully assessed to ensure that detailed technical specification are developed with
participation of end users, high quality-low cost sources are identified and tapped, and comprehensive plans
exist for operationalizing and pilot testing new equipment, and training teachers in their appropriate use.
As civil works represent over 50 percent of total project cost, attention was given in the preparatory phase
to the development of prototype designs and preliminary drawings which take into account local building
standards and experiences and environmental (including hurricanes) and other factors.
25.    Rationale for Bank and IDA Involvement. The CAS for the OECS countries including Grenada,
discussed by the Board in April, 1995, seeks to support the Government's program of economic transition,
with special attention to: (i) human resource development and poverty alleviation; (ii) restructuring of the
public sector to ensure sustained adequate levels of public savings, while promoting greater regional
collaboration; (iii) acceleration of private sector-led economic diversification into tourism and export
services; and (iv) natural resource management. To these ends, the Bank is pursuing a three-pronged
approach in Grenada, as elsewhere in the sub-region. First, through ESW, it is providing intellectual
leadership, in collaboration with the IMF and CDB, to strengthen the institutional capacity of the countries
to identify priority policies and programs and effectively implement them. Second, the Bank is
strengthening CDB capacity in human resource development and enviromnental management, so that in full
partnership with the Bank, it can increasingly undertake ESW and lending in these key development areas.
Third, the Bank is taking a leading role in donor coordination, including mobilizing the scarce extemal
financing available to OECS countries, the main forum for which coordination will continue to be the
Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development (CGCED).
26.    The proposed operation is fully consistent with the above mentioned CAS targeting the priority
area of human resource development, catalyzing an education sector adjustment process to improve
efficiency of public resource use, and providing an approach to education reform that promotes greater
regional collaboration. The project design is similar to that recently approved for St. Lucia.
6



27.    Agreed Actions. At negotiations, the Government and IBRD and IDA reached agreement on the
scope of the Education Strategy Letter describing the Government's educational sector reform strategy and
the priority actions to be taken to effect such reform, with special attention to the compulsory, basic
education cycle. The agreed final Letter will include a schedule delineating annual targets for adjusting the
teacher to students ratios over the project implementation period. The Govermment also reached formal
agreement with IBRD and IDA on the general content of the PIM.
28.   At negotiations, assurances from the Government were also obtained that it would comply fully
with standard Bank procedures relating to implementation of the project and that they would (a) establish
and subsequently maintain within the MOE, the PMU and the Educational Planning Unit; (b) allocate in the
Annual Estimates of Expenditure for the years 1996 through 2000, the total respective amounts required
for project financing to support project implementation; and (c) seek IBRD and IDA agreement on all
proposed fellowship candidates and training institutions.
29.    As conditions of Effectiveness of the Loan and Credit, the Government will be required to have:
(a) presented to the Bank and the Association the signed Education Strategy Letter; (b) ensured that a PIM,
satisfactory to IBRD and IDA, had been issued and become effective; and (c) opened, and deposited
requisite funding into the Project Account.
30.    Envirommental Aspects. The proposed project does not represent environmental risks and has
been assigned a "C" environmental classification.
31.    Program Objective Categories. The proposed project consists of activities included in the
categories of economic management, poverty and human resource development.
32.    Participatory Approach. The preparatory phase included wide consultation with all major public
and private entities involved in the sector, including teachers, principals, the unions representing teachers
and Government officials from various ministries responsible for education, finance, planning, public
works, training, national statistics, physical planning and so on. The consultative, interactive process,
which is being continued with the newly elected Government, provided a valuable vehicle for broad
discussion of investment and policy and institutional reform requirements.
33.    Project Benefits.    The project is expected to effect major improvements in the quality of
education provided throughout the compulsory cycle and, hence, in student achievement and employment
potential. The Project emphasizes the range of investments relating to the major educational inputs that a
majority of intemational studies2 have shown yield highest retums in the form of student leaming: trained
teachers, modemized and streamlined curricula, more and appropriate educational materials, professional
and more frequent educational testing and measurement, and better maintained school plant.
34.    An improved quality of primary education is expected to help ensure that many more students will
be prepared to benefit fully from secondary education as access to it increases. An additional 665 students
(or about seven percent of the secondary school age cohort) will have access to secondary education as a
result of a project-financed civil works program that emphasizes the development of cost-effective school
designs and construction. Moreover, over 1,500 children in many remote and poorer communities would
benefit from project support for textbooks for disadvantaged schools.

35.    The contribution of the proposed project to building institutional capacity, particularly at the
MOE's central headquarters, will not only support the efficient management of the systems but also
promote the planning and development of the sector in a cost-effective manner. As such, it would lay the
groundwork for effective absorption of future investments. The project would similarly strengthen
management at the school level, and promote increased collaboration between key public and private sector
entities involved in the education sector at the national and regional level. The project, consistent with the
OERS, promotes cooperation with other OECS countries embarking on this reform process, in particular in
such areas as achievement testing, integrated education data systems, and expansion and upgrading of
educational materials production, in which there is common interest.
36.    Risks. The principal risks associated with the project relate to:
(i) the inadequate institutional capacity to carry out the education reform process, including possible failure
to augment the MOE with requisite additional qualified staff; (ii) failure to adjust, and/or to closely
monitor compliance with adjusted, teacher to student ratios in primary and secondary schools; (iii)
unavailability of sufficient Government financing to sustain reforms in the light of the difficult fiscal
situation and the high vulnerability of this small economy to external shocks and natural disasters; and
(iv) PM12 problems in meeting the administrative demands presented by heavy front loading of
implementation over the first two years, given limited experience with implementing Bank-financed
projects.
37.   In order to minimize these risks, strong emphasis is placed on rapid strengthening of sector
planning and institutional capacity, including extensive staff upgrading, and Government assurances that
the MOE personnel complement will be expanded to ensure expertise exists to fulfill its broad education
sector development mandate. Several measures are being taken to facilitate smooth, timely project
implementation, amid front loading of investments, including: (a) advancing crucial start-up activities, e.g.,
architectural designs and equipment and furniture specification lists, planned to be carried out before
Effectiveness; (b) training of PMU staff in key management areas prior to project commencement; and (c)
provision of Project Management expert services to support the PMU over the initial months of project
execution.
38.   In view of the vulnerability of this OECS economy to external factors and shocks, Government
project financing has been kept within easily met ranges at present and projected GDP and has been
concentrated on local costs. The burden of incremental recurrent costs, which often hamper achievement of
education sector reforms, will be offset by resources to be released from adjusting teacher to student ratios
over the project implementation period and presentation of an Education Strategy Letter which includes a
schedule for introducing these ratios as a condition of Loan and Credit Effectiveness. Minimization of
financial risks is achieved through the choice of loan product by the Government: fixed rate US dollar SCL
(para. 18). Moreover, the project places emphasis on the early preparation of a long term sector
development plan which would serve as a vehicle for achieving national consensus on the principal
directions of sector development into the next decade. Finally, the monitoring system and annual
evaluations will permit timely adjustments in project implementation to achieve project objectives.
39.    Further, to facilitate inter-country collaboration, high priority has been, and will continue to be,
assigned to pooling technical expertise, encouraging use of Caribbean expertise, sharing of experiences and
developing regional interventions, where appropriate and feasible.
