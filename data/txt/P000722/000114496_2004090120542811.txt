Dear Sir:
1.    We refer to the Development Credit Agreement for the Market Towns
Development Project dated March 1990, between Ethiopia (the Borrower) and
the International Development Association (the Association).  We also refer
to discussions between Ethiopia and the Association on reallocating funds
under the Project for the purpose of financing emergency requirements in
urban areas.
2.    We are pleased to inform you that the Association has agreed to amend
the Development Credit Agreement as follows:
      (a)   Section 2.02 (b) shall be amended to read as follows:
            "(b) The Borrower shall, for the purposes of the Project, open
            and maintain in dollars in the National Bank of Ethiopia on

            appropriate protection against setoff, seizure or attachment:

            Special Account) for the purposes of Parts D and E.3 of the
            Project; and (iv) a special account (the MUDH Special Account)
            for the purpose of Part A.1, B and E.1 of the Project.
            Deposits into, and payments out, of the Special Accounts shall
            be made in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 to this
            Agreement."
      (b)   The table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Development
            Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read as in the attachment
            to this letter.

            parts for emergency rehabilitation of water supply systems in
            Wollo, Tigray and Gondar regions."

            (2)(c)(vi), (3)(a), and (6) set forth in the table in paragraph
            1 of Schedule I to this Agreement;"
      (e)   Paragraph (1)(c) of Schedule 4 to the Development Credit
            Agreement shall be amended as follows:
            "(c) the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount to be
