Political instability hindered\n            implementation, and even after implementation resumed in\n            1991, senior staff changes, and weak contractors\n            /consultants' work, resulted in unsatisfactory\n            performances as well. Key lessons include: 1) the low\n            economic rate of return, unsustainable cost recovery and\n            institutional capacity, raised awareness of complex issues\n            in project design, which, in an attempt to adjust to\n            changing circumstances, the project proved useful in\n            defining development programs - responsively - a concept not\n            built-in project design. Likewise, the inability to achieve\n            significant financial management and policy reforms, helped\n            address these issues within a political context; 2)\n            questions are raised on the Bank's comparative\n            advantage in financing individual subprojects, and\n            suggestions are, that given their high cost, the Bank should\n            rather assist the client in building its own management\n            capacity, to better concentrate on finance issues; 3)\n            Decentralization requires analytical work, to undergo an\n            unfolding process of incremental reforms, supported by\n            investments, and capacity building. Strong ownership within\n            local governments, and flexibility, should accompany the\n            inextricable linkages sector wise, for broader economic growth."}, "docdt": "1999-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
