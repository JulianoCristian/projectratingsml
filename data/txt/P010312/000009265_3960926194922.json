It will also expand the\n            transmission system to meet projected demand at the least\n            cost and strengthen the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The\n            project consists of a five-year time slice of CEB's\n            program to take over licensees' power distribution\n            systems. In addition, it will rehabilitate and expand those\n            systems, and develop its transmission system. It will\n            consist of an island wide rehabilitation and extension of\n            low voltage distribution networks, and it will provide\n            technical assistance to CEB."}, "docdt": "1988-06-02T00:00:00Z"}
