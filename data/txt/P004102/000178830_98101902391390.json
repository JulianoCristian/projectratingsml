is\n            to foster the technological development of Korean industry.\n            The project will help establish and develop KTDC whose\n            primary purpose will be to provide financial assistance for\n            relatively risky software-intensive Research, Development\n            and Engineering (RD&E) subprojects. Specifically the\n            project would consist of two major components: (a)\n            Institutional development of KTDC comprising: (i) consulting\n            services to strengthen KTDC's project appraisal and\n            implementation capabilities, and to assist KTDC in carrying\n            out periodic studies and surveys of Korean industry's\n            RD&E programs and areas of potential development; and\n            invitation of experts from other institutions in Bank member\n            countries that are of similar nature to KTDC to help train\n            KTDC staff; and (ii) training of KTDC staff and the purchase\n            of educational materials; (b) A line of credit to help cover\n            the estimated foreign exchange requirements of subprojects\n            to be financed by KTDC during 1982-1984."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
