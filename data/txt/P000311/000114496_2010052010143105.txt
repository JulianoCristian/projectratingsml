awarded in accordance with procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the 
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the Bank in May 
1992 (the Guidelines).
(a)
When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid validity period, such period 
may be extended once, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59 of the 
Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to complete the evaluation, obtain necessary 
approvals and clearances and award the contract. The bid validity period may be extended a second 
time only if the bidding documents or the request for extension shall provide for appropriate 
adjustment of the bid price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract over the period of 
extension. Such an increase in the bid price shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. 
With respect to each contract made subject to the Trustee's prior review in accordance with the 
provisions of Part D.1 (a) of this Section, the Trustee's prior approval will be required for (i) a first 
extension of the bid validity period if the period of extension exceeds sixty (60) days, and (ii) any 
subsequent extension of the bid validity period.
(b)
In the procurement of goods and works in accordance with this Part A, the 
Recipient shall use the relevant standard bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such 
modifications thereto as the Trustee shall have agreed to be necessary for the purposes of the 
Project. Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been issued by the Bank, the Recipient 
shall use bidding documents based on other internationally recognized standard forms agreed with 
the Bank.

the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount equivalent to $200,000 to be 
withdrawn from the GET Grant Account and deposited into the Special Account pursuant to

commitments entered by the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions shall be 
equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR 700,000.
2.
Payments out of the Special Account shall be made exclusively for eligible expenditures in

After the Trustee has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Special Account has been 
duly opened, withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish the 
Special Account shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish to the 
Trustee a request or requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of

request, or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Trustee shall so request, refund to the 
Trustee) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so eligible or
