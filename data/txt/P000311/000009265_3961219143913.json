The project will enhance\n            biodiversity conservation and management at six priority\n            project sites. These areas include the coastal\n            Guinea-Congolean refugium and the western highlands. The\n            project will underwrite studies necessary to identify\n            priority protection and produce management plans for\n            critical core areas integrated within a network of\n            multiple-use management zones. The project will also finance\n            conservation of savanna ecosystems including implementation\n            of a recovery plan for the endangered black rhinoceros. The\n            project will strengthen key institutions concerned with\n            biodiversity research and provide resources, training and\n            technical assistance to improve their ability to fulfill\n            their mandate. The project will also strengthen the Studies\n            and Planning Services (SPS) of the Department of Wildlife\n            and protected areas (DWPA)."}, "docdt": "1995-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
