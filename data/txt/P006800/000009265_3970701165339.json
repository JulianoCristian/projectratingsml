      integrate less developed areas into mainstream economy; (b)\n            improve efficiency and reduce costs of rural transport; (c)\n            upgrade National Rural Road Fund's (FNCV) institutional\n            performance; and (d) develop, on a pilot basis, more\n            efficient conditions for small scale water transportation in\n            a selected coastal area. Major benefits are expected from\n            value added to agricultural production and lower rural\n            transport costs. Direct beneficiaries would be: (i) small\n            farmers, for whom access to markets would be improved and\n            modernized; and (ii) the isolated communities in the Pacific\n            coastal region, for which small scale water transportation\n            would be made safer and cost effective."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
