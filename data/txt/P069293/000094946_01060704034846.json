There are three project components.\n            The first component stimulates a national dialogue on policy\n            changes needed for health reform in Azerbaijan; generates\n            support in the Government for the reform process itself;\n            introduces a common understanding of terms and objectives\n            such as productivity and cost-effectiveness; performs\n            critical assessments related to health financing reform; and\n            strengthens capacity in the health ministry to plan,\n            implement, and evaluate health reforms by developing a\n            management information system, and by developing new\n            pharmaceutical policies and procedures. The second component\n            implements a number of reforms that have been previously\n            piloted by UNICEF in Azerbaijan: the rationalization of\n            health care services; the implementation of primary health\n            care models; the improvement of and access to primary care\n            services; and the strengthening of managerial and clinical\n            capabilites of health personnel. The third component\n            supports the project coordination unit and a monitoring and\n            evaluation program."}, "docdt": "2001-05-16T00:00:00Z"}
