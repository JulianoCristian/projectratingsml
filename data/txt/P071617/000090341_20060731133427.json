Ghana were as follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, and the Bank and borrower\n            performance were both satisfactory. Lessons learned from the\n            project: The use of HIV prevalence data, though an excellent\n            monitoring tool for the epidemic in countries, should not be\n            a measure of success of a Bank funded HIV/AIDS project. The\n            decision to design the project without and Ministry of\n            Health component was not appropriate. Mainstreaming HIV/AIDS\n            in the formal education sector was effective for\n            comprehensive targeting of at-risk youth who reported\n            reduction in number of partners and increased use of\n            condoms. Contracting out an international auditor to assess\n            the use of funds by civil society organizations contributed\n            to a balance between implementation facilitation and\n            fiduciary responsibility. Decentralization of HIV/AIDS\n            response is very successful in Ghana as demonstrated by the\n            strong ownership of GARFUND by provinces and districts.\n            Development Partner collaboration and co-financing was\n            successful and should be promoted and expanded. An effective\n            monitoring and evaluation system is essential for optimal\n            effectiveness of the MAP learning by doing strategy. There\n            is an urgent need to strengthen the focus on strategic\n            management of the epidemic and tailor the multisectoral\n            approach to Ghana's contained and relatively stable\n            epidemic. The private sector as an engine of growth should\n            be more largely and systematically included in the\n            implementation of the MAP projects. The financing of\n            salaries through donor funds should be considered with\n            caution where it concerns the financing of institutions that\n            need continued and sustainable financing beyond the scope of projects."}, "docdt": "2006-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
