risk to\n            development outcome was substantial; Bank performance was\n            unsatisfactory; and borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Lessons learned from this assessment included:\n            the drive to accelerate disbursements and to spread the\n            financing across a wide range of implementers, activities\n            and geographic areas poses the risk that these process goals\n            could take precedence over the quality of interventions, as\n            well as the strategic selection and prioritization of the\n            highest-impact activities; a more strategic choice and\n            sustained use of implementers with the experience and\n            capacity to carry out the highest impact interventions\n            likely would have resulted in stronger and more sustainable\n            results; efforts to strengthen a multi-sectoral response\n            would likely have been more successful had synergies been\n            created with the Ministry of Health, capitalizing on\n            technical and operational expertise; and learning-by-doing\n            has the potential to improve effectiveness, but it is\n            unlikely to take place in the absence of strong preparation\n            and incentives for systematic monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2007-06-19T00:00:00Z"}
