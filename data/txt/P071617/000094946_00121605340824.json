Response\n            Project for Ghana is to reduce the speed of the HIV (Human\n            Immunodeficiency Virus) infection, and reduce the impact of\n            AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) on those affected\n            and their families by financing interventions outside the\n            Ministry of Health's mandate. There are four project\n            components. The first employsa fund mechanism to solicit,\n            evaluate, and fund service provision subproject proposals to\n            carry out activities to prevent HIV transmission and to\n            provide care for people living with AIDS and their families.\n            the second component finances the technical and managerial\n            capacity of implementing entities to implement policies as\n            well as sustain the process of scaling the HIV/AIDS\n            response. The third component sets up and maintains an\n            information clearing house/database on HIV/AIDS relevant to\n            implementing entities to improve their effectiveness. The\n            fourth component has a strong sub-component that will assess\n            the progress attained in the fight against AIDS nationwide\n            on the basis of the targets defined in the Strategic\n            Framework, and will monitor the advance of activities\n            financed by Garfund, the Ghana AIDS Response Fund."}, "docdt": "2000-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
