A. Project DevelopmentObjective

1. Projectdevelopment objective: (seeAnnex 1)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in carrying out a pilot program to stimulate the
private sector demand for skills training development through a demand-driven and competitively-based
mechanism.

2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The following indicators will be used to measure the performance of the project against baseline data to
be collectedinthe first year (further details are spelt out inthe Operational Manual):
a) increasing number of requestsby small and medium-sized firms and businessassociationsfor training;
b) increasing percent of approvedrequestsby small andmedium-sized         firmsand business associationsfor
training;
c) increasing number of responses from public and private training providers to competitive tenders for
training services;
d) increasingrates ofpost-training employment of employees inoccupations for which they were trained;
e) continuously improving perceptions of managers from a sample of fm and business associations of:
i)relevanceoftrainingtoemployerneeds; ii)qualityoftraining;iii)transactioncostsofprocuring
funding for training from Govemment; and iv) timeliness of Govemment's provision of funding for
neededtraining.

Although the ultimate objective of increasing private sector demand for training i s to increase firm
competitiveness and labor productivity, these outcomes are excluded on the basis of OECD country
experience. This experience indicates that it may take 15-20 years for the private sector inEgypt to invest
sufficiently intraining to get the benefit of usingtraining as a tool to achieve greater competitiveness and
labor productivity.

Even if the Skills Development Project (SDP) i s well implemented, it i s vulnerable to downturns in
Egypt's economy. Private sector employers will reduce their training demands as they cut back on
upgradingthe skills of existing workers, hiringnew workers, or investing innew technologies that require
new skills. So data on economic growth or contraction inthe sectors targeted by the SDP duringthe life
of the Project will be collectedto interpret the outcome results.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-related CountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS) goalsupported bythe project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 22163-EGT       Dateof latest CAS discussion: June 5, 2001
The June, 2001, Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Egypt documents a respectable rate of growth
between 1996 and 2000. However, it points out that growth has been driven more by factor accumulation
than by total factor productivity gains. The sources of growth have been primarily non-tradables focused
on domestic demand. Even manufacturinggrowth, driven by low technology sectors such as textiles, was
focused on domestic demand-merchandise exports stagnated in the 1990s. Past growth rates and their
positive effects on poverty rates are not sustainable inthe long rununless Egypt increasesits exports and
total factor productivity, including the productivity of its labor. Increasing exports requires low prices
and high quality, both of which depend on the enhanced productivity of the factors of production,
including labor.
In response, the CAS identified three types of interventions on which the Bank Group would focus: (i)
interventions that support higher and sustained growth; (ii) interventions for poverty reduction;
                                                                targeted
and (iii) interventions with major indirect effects on poverty reduction, including interventions that
promote broad-based, private sector-led growth. Inthe context of this third priority the CAS specifically
identified the needfor a skills development lendingoperation.

2. Mainsector issuesandGovernment strategy:
In the early 1990s the Government of Egypt (GoE) focused on macroeconomic stabilization. It then
tackled Egypt's slow economic growth rate by initiating an economic liberalization process, including
privatization, deregulation, and financial sector reform.
a) Availability and quality of labor as a limiting factor. The policy debates about growth identified a
skilled labor force as critical to economic liberalization.      Between 1994 and 2000 four surveys of
enterprises (World Bank, ECES, Economic ResearchForum) assessedperceived constraints to economic
development inEgypt. All four pinpointedthe availability and quality of labor as a limitingfactor, and
between 1994 and 2000 this problemwas seen as becoming worse. The surveys found the following:
i)ascarcityofsemi-skilledandskilledlabor. Inlargerfirms,demandisincreasinglyforspecializedor
"higher" skilled, i.e. technologically-oriented, labor. The availability of skilled labor appears to have
decreased since the first survey. Unskilled and low-skilled labor is abundant and does not appear as a
constraint. Middle and highlevel management has become more abundant, but may still be in demand in
some sectors for specific functions (e.g. sales).
ii)thequalityofalltrainedlabor,especiallyforskilledhighlyskilledoccupationsandmiddlehighlevel
managementpositions, appears to be low and not adapted to the needs of firms. Quality appears to have
significantly declined inrecent years.
iii)ThequalityoftheeducationandTVETsystemwasviewedasrequiringupgrading.
iv) The perceived need for in-service training and retraining to adapt and upgrade the quality and
relevance of skills i s increasing, but from a very low base. Demand i s primarily for private training
providers.
b) Small and medium enterprises and large public companies in traditional sectors are not
competitive on labor productivity. Egypt joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. In
2001it initialed an Association Agreement with the European Union (EU), which hasbeenratifiedby the
Egyptian Parliament and i s in the process of ratification by the EUParliament. Both of these steps have
putpressureonEgyptto increaseits labor productivity. The Agreements requirethat tariffs bereduced or
eliminated and non-tariff barriers to trade such as customs procedures simplified by 2012. A few large
Egyptian firms have a generally well-defined competitive advantage in international markets. However,
small and medium enterprises and large public companies in traditional sectors are operating in
"protected" domestic markets behind still high levels of protection and low labor costs. They are not
competitive on labor productivity. Average gross production per worker i s over 1.5 times higher in
Morocco, 2.4 times higher inTunisia, and 4.1 times higher inTurkey. Average value addedper worker i s
1.6 times higher inMorocco, 2.5 times higher inTunisia, and 5.7 times higher inTurkey. East Asian and
Latin American countries show even better results. The GoE understands that it has about a decade to
help vulnerable companies prepare to withstand open competition with global suppliers of goods and
services to Egypt's domestic market. Again the need for a skilled labor force emerges as an important
piece of the equation.

c) Egypt's technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system seems to contribute to its
unemployment rates, especially to the rates for youth. Egypt has been dogged by highrates of youth
unemployment. According to the 1996 census, the structure of unemployment by age i s as follows: 15-
19 years: 26 percent; 20-24 years: 40 percent; and 25-29 years: 21 percent. The rates for females are
higher: 15-24 years: 59 percent; and 25-29 years: 35 percent. Ninety-six percent of all unemployed
between 15-29 are first time job seekers. Estimates of overall open unemployment vary between 10-13
percent, and there i s also substantial underemployment.       As economic liberalization proceeds, labor
redundancies in state-owned enterprises are increasing. Although vibrant economic growth i s the most
powerful means of stimulating job creation by the private sector, Egypt's technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) system seems to contribute to these unemployment rates, especially to the
rates for youth, because it does not provide students with skills that employees findrelevant.

Status of the Skills Training Sector

The publicly-funded skills training systeminEgypt has these characteristics:

          0  It is highly fragmented bureaucratically.
          0  It is supply-driven, not demand-driven-public         fundingflows to delivery institutionswith
             little involvement of the private sector inthe governance, funding, or delivery of training. The
             result i s that training i s not market relevant, of low quality, and inefficient.
          0  The gap betweenthe skills that training graduates actually obtain and those indicatedby the
             credentials they receive distorts signals to employers.
             The system's efficiency and market relevance are unmonitored.

a) Fragmentation The current organization of publicly-funded skills training services reflects Egypt's
past as a centralized economy. Training is organized vertically. The Ministry of Education (MoE)
controls pre-tertiary, school-based programs that can start after grade 6 and that enroll the largest number
of students in TVET-over         2 million. The Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE) controls the middle
technical institutes (MTIs).      These draw their enrollments from MoE's general secondary schools or
technical schools and have much smaller enrollment numbers. Graduates of the MoEs vocational
programs can enter vocational training centers (VTCs). These are under the auspices of 21 additional
ministries, agencies, public enterprises, or defense related establishments, the major providers being the
Ministries of Industry and Technological Development, Manpower and Emigration, Construction,
Agriculture, Electricity, Public Enterprises and Petroleum. In a 1998 survey to establish the number of
VTCs, the CentralAgency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) found 1,237 training centers
nationwide, including 68 in-house training centers inpublic enterprises. These VTCs, 95 percent of them
public, graduated 176,000 students in 1998.

This degree of organizational fragmentation results in a system that cannot realize economies of scale,
encourages the continuation of supply-driven services, and discourages private sector use of the system.
Multiple bureaucracies and bureaucratic boundaries work against the agility and flexibility required if the
system i s to respond to private sector changes in skill demand. In fact, they make change of anv kind
difficult, such as institutionalizing national skill standards and a uniform assessment and accreditation
system.
b) A supply-driven, rather than a demand-driven, system.                      Current funding and governance
arrangements for TVET delink suppliers (trainers) and customers (employers). Ministries allocate their
TVET budgets to their providers on a mechanical basis, without regard to the quality, market-relevance,
or efficiency of the training being provided. The providers themselves are not allowed to retain any fees
from courses that could be eamed by meeting specific demands from private enterprises. Consequently,
they have no incentives to respond to labor market signals conceming the skills required in the economy
and every incentiveto continue supplying outdated training curricula. The result is that training programs
fail to adjust to the type and quality of skills that employers need, as evidenced by responses of 211
employers to a survey conducted expressly for this project. Respondents indicated that they view the
training providedby the vocational training centers (VTC) and middle technical institutes (MTI) as low in
quality and market relevance. Employer federations representing small and medium-sized enterprises
have reported that the demand for semi-skilled workers and technicians is increasing rapidly, but that
trained technicians and competent workers are in short supply. At the same time, private sector firms-
especially small and medium-sized enterprises-have            only a limited understanding of the benefits of
training, given the few options available for relevant training and the lack of capacity in small and
medium size firms to assess their training needs and to formulate training plans.

c) False signals to employers. Since the quality of training i s well below international standards, the
credentials awarded training graduates exaggerate the skills that graduates have actually mastered.
Graduates of 3-year industrial programs, for example, obtain technician-level certificates. However, at
best, they are semi-skilled workers who expect jobs that require skills that they do not possess. (Gill and
Heyneman. 1999. Egypt: Reforming Vocational Education and Training to Meet Private Sector's Skill
Demands. Constraints and Innovations in Reform of VT. World Bank and LO).
The immediate result i s distorted market signals--employers arenot getting the skills that the credentials
ofjob applicants indicate that they have. The muchlarger cost, however, i s that training of low quality
contributes to a low skills equilibriumfor the economy, employers, and workers.

d) Unmonitoredsystem. There is no routine feedback on the performance of the system-its           efficiency
or its outcomes. Aside from the special purpose study for this project and those conducted for donor-
funded projects (e.g., the FrenchAFPA and German GTZ projects), government-funded tracer studies are
non-existent. These special purpose studies indicate that unit costs vary widely by type of training, but
Government does not track unitcosts or assess the reasons for variations incosts.

This lack of feedback on the training system is very costly. Policymakers do nothave datafor identifying
problems in the system and for tracking the effects of reforms. Public funding cannot be targeted
effectively. For example, even if it wanted to, the Government does not have the data that would let it
reward providers whose graduates are more apt to get jobs or that obtain the same employment rates for
graduates at lower costs. Students have no information to guide their choices of training programs. Even
ifstudentsdonotpayfortrainingcourses,theypayinopportunitycosts.

Government Strategy

With assistanceprovided by the World Bank, in 1999/2000 the GoE established an Education, Training
and Employment Sub-committee (ETES), chaired by the Minister of Manpower. One of its objectives
was to design a reform strategy for the TVET system, especially that part that does not come under the
authority of the MoE. The fmal ETES report (June, 2000) recommended a TVET system that would
consist of five core areas: a) a national occupation classification system; b) employment services; c) a
labor c) a labor market information system; d) national skills standards and an assessment and
accreditation system, and e) technical educational and vocational training (TVET). It also laid out a
strategy for implementation.

In2002, the Government adoptedaPolicy StatementonTVET (seeAnnex 10)basedonthe ETESreport.
Itcharged the Supreme Council on HumanResource Development (SCHRD) with the responsibility for
implementing the reform strategy, including policy and legislative changes. Reformof all five core areas
of the TVET system i s underway with donor support for each. The Policy Statement conceives of skills
development as a tool for economic growth, increasedproductivity and competitiveness, social inclusion,
and equal opportunities. It also identifies several for TVET reformdirectly related to the proposed SDP
project:

        0    scattered organization of the TVET system distributed across many line Ministries that have
            their own supply driven traininginfrastructures;
        0    highinternalandexternal inefficiency;
        0    low involvement of the private sector inthe governance, fundingand delivery of TVET;
        0    slow propensity of the TVET system to change and the vicious circle of low quality, low
            efficiency, low esteem, and low relevance; and
        0   little investment by firms instaff qualifications and incontinuing education and training.

The Policy Statementidentifies three pillars of the TVET reform.


                                                    - 5 -

         0    Establish a Oualifications System to suuuort lifelong learning.   The introduction of vertical
              and horizontalpathways of integrationbetween the different levels of skills and qualifications
              within the TVET systemi s a key priority inthe reform. Other key elements include building
              partnerships among stakeholders, redefinitions of basic skills according to the revised
              national system of skills standards, redefinition of financing mechanisms, and the
              establishment of quality control systems and monitoring indicators.

         0    Establish a TVET system responsive to labor market needs. The TVET system has to
              undertake a transition from supply-driven to demand-driven.           Establishing alternative
              financing mechanisms and incentives and monitoring and evaluation feedback systems for
              employers and providers will play an important role in this transition. To this end, capacity
              buildingis necessaryfor the private sector so that it can formulate its own skills and training
              needs.

         0    Establish new legal, institutional and governance frameworks for TVET institutions. The
              main objective under this heading would be to enlarge the autonomy of TVET institutions in
              their functioning and the delivery of their services. TVET institutions in Egypt at various
              levels suffer from a too centralized and rigid management model. This would allow the
              TVET institutions to generate their own income, to define their own institutional policy and
              to apply new management models, including the participation of the private sector in the
              governance and the managementof individual TVET institutes and of the whole system.

The GoE i s coordinating donor support around these three pillars. Inconjunctionespecially with the EC,
but also with the German GTZ and France and the Egypt Social Fund for Development (SFD), the
proposed project focuses on the secondpillar. The project focuses on reformof the financing of training,
while the GTZ Mubarak-Kohl Initiative and a Frenchsupported project focus on relevant, demand based
training for employers and on training provision respectively. The companion EC supported project
concentrates on beginning the reform of the governance system for training, that i s the third pillar. The
initiatives plannedor under implementationthat support the three pillars are the following.

         0    The German-funded, GTZ supported Mubarak-Kohl Initiative (MKI) has been pioneering
             training reform since 1993, and, along with other donor initiatives such as the French
              supported Ameria project for short course training for private sector fm'employees under
             the MITD, provides a sound foundation the proposed Bank project can build. Key lessons
             from the MKIproject have been built into the design of SDP. MKIsupports the training of
              apprentices through a partnership between private local investors associations and the
             Ministry of Education, including apprentices in two sectors targeted by the project: the
             manufacturing and construction sectors. It has been able to address successfully the issue of
             providing financial incentives to training providers to participate and with its technical
              support to investors associations, it has helped develop an infrastructure of fourteen such
             associations, which are self financing, have proven institutional capacity, and are credible
             with the private sector intheir geographic zone. While MKI'sfocus remains pre-employment
             technical training, it has found there i s growing demand for in-service short term training,
             which now constitutes about 5 percent of its output. This project i s continuing.
         0   The EC i s proposing a companion project to the SDP that consists of three components: a)
             establishing enterprise-TVET partnerships at the local level; b) improving the quality of
             training through a range of interventions that include alternative methods of delivery,
             matching supply and demand, increasing flexibility, and teacher training; and c) developing
             national regulatory and support functions through improving governance, identifying means
             of sustainable financing, and research, monitoring and evaluation. The Government regards
             this proposed project and the SDP as a package that will be approved by the Egyptian
             Parliament simultaneously. The Bank and the EC have had a series of joint preparation
             missions, and duringappraisal worked on the conceptual design of, and the economic sectors

             and geographic locations being targeted by each project, as well as the complementary
             implementation arrangements.
         0   The National Skills Standards Project, financed by the Social Fund for Development, and
             implemented technically by a consortium led by the British Council, i s preparing
             occupational standards in the same sectors as those proposed for the SDP and national skill
             standards. The completiondate i s 2004. Pilot implementationwill begin shortly.
         0   Canadian CIDA i s funding a project focused on employment offices and a labor market
             information system. The completiondate i s 2006.
         0   The EC-financed Industrial Modernization Project (EUR250 million) includes support for
             customized training for targeted SMEs that are included in the business upgrading program,
             one of six component programs supported by the IMP. The training support i s mainly for
             management personnel and some On-The-Job training inthose companies that are selectedto
             be part of the program, the objective of which i s to assist them to compete internationally.

         0   The French funded project, which has been administered by the SFD, was designed to
             upgrade 14 public VTCs in five ministries, including staff training and curricula reform. A
             key element of this project was the monitoringcomponent, which included carrying out tracer
             studies. It was completed in 2003. Another SFD project will upgrade 50 selected VTCs
             following feasibility studies. The combined effect will be to increase the number of actual
             and potential providers of quality training under the SDP.
         0   The World Bank-fundedHigher Education Enhancement Project is fundingthe consolidation
             of 47 middle technical institutions (MTIs) into eight technical colleges and the upgrading of
             curricula design, instructor training, and academic administration and management. The
            MTIs are under the Ministry of Higher Education. The HEEPfocuses ontechnicaltraining at
            higher skill levels than under the SDP. Implementation i s just starting. The SDP i s also a
            companion project to the HEEP.

3. Sector issuesto be addressedby the project andstrategic choices:
As indicated, the SDP supports the second of the three pillars of the Government's strategy, namely, to
establish a system responding to labor market needs. While it broadly focuses on financing reform, the
Project addresses these sector issues also:

a) Involving the private sector. Developing the capacity of the private sector to identify their training
needs andto preparetraining plans i s an essential requirement for the emergenceof a demand for training.
The project would provide advisory services to finns (awareness, information and technical guidance)
directly and through business, investor, trade associations, federations, chambers of commerce and the
like selected as Project Intermediaries (PIS). Through PIS,it would fund training needs analysis and
surveys of skills needs.
b) Improvingthe marketrelevance of public funding of training. The SDP would improve the market
relevance of public funding for training by establishing a demand-driven mechanism for financing
training proposals submitted by private firms to PIS. Competition for funds would promote efficiency,
effectiveness, andrelevance among training providers.
c) Improving the internal efficiency of training. Firms that participate can obtain their training from
training providers, which have been selectedon a competitive basis. Inall cases the internal efficiency of
training should improve. Where a P Iproposes in-house provision, its proposal will be scrutinizedduring
the evaluation process for the efficiency with which it uses resources. Incases of provision by public or
private providers, competitive biddingwill initially improve efficiency, and the monitoring of the training
actually provided will affect future bidding rounds. The project will monitor unit costs by types of
training and eventually establish benchmarks for costs of different types of training.

C. Project DescriptionSummary

1. Projectcomponents(seeAnnex 2for adetaileddescription andAnnex 3 for adetailed cost
breakdown):
1.      The project has three components.

   Component 1. Awareness Program, and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$l.lO million)
   This component will finance the provision of technical advisory services to: carry out awareness,
   promotion and outreach programs; monitoring and evaluation surveys, studies, and assessments;
   enable beneficiary finns to undertake training needs assessments and plans; enable eligible training
   providers to develop training proposals; and enable eligible Project Intermediaries to develop
   aggregated training proposals. The purpose of this component will be to stimulate private sector
   demand for training and competitively-based responses of training providers to private sector
   demand. It will also evaluate project outcomes. The project will target initially three sectors of the
   economy--manufacturing, construction, and tourism--and the small and, especially, medium-sized
   private sector fm(SMEs) and employer federations and business and investor associations inthese
   sectors. The selection of these three sectors was based on labor market surveys carried out in 2001
   under the PHRDgrant for the project. As Annex 2 shows, SMEs dominate each of the three sectors.
   LA. Awareness, Promotion, and Outreach. Training demand-particularly                  informed training
   demand-is      poorly developed in small and medium-sized fm and business associations. This
   subcomponent supports awareness campaigns and other promotional activities to acquaint fm and
   associations in the selected sectors with the training opportunities available under the SDP. The
   campaign will clarify the criteria that: i)the project will useto select training proposals for funding,
      and ii)the Project Intermediary (PI) organizations will use in deciding whether to include a
   particular
      f m ' s  proposal    in their aggregate training proposal.     This subcomponent also        finances
   technical
   assistance to PI organizations to develop their aggregate training proposals; and includes help in
   conducting training needs assessments, costing of the training needed, and assessment of proposals
   from fm and training providers. It also includes technical assistanceto training providers, as they
   are inexperienced incompetitive tendering processesand inproposal writing. The implementationof
   this component will be guided by acommunications strategy developed for the project.

   l.B. Monitoring and Evaluation. Measurement of outputs and outcomes is an essential element of a
   pilot project that will test a new financing mechanism for training. The key performance indicators
   for the project are described in Section A2. This subcomponent will finance consulting services and
   technical assistance to carry out the instrument design (such as surveys of employers and business
   associations, tracer surveys), and data collection needed to track these project outcomes and
   contingencies. This component focuses on project outcomes, as opposed to project inputs, processes
   and outputs M&Ethat the Project Management Unit (PMU) will undertake as part of component 3.
   Component 2. TrainingSub-projects (US$10.83 million)
   Under this component, the project will finance a demand driven training program on a cost shared
   basis with beneficiary f m s ; and will strengthen the institutional capacity of eligible Project
   Intermediaries. The program will be implemented through PISfor the benefit of small and medium
   size fm and related business associations and organizations initially in the construction,
   manufacturing and tourism sectors and will support short term (less than six months) production
   related training (see Section E3 for further details). Targeted geographical areas are those with large
   clusters of firms in the selected sectors, and with business associations that are active in these areas
   and have some experience managing training activities. These criteria may be modified during the


                                                   - 8 -

    course of project implementation. Training funds may be usedto support the following activities:( i)
    in-service training; and (ii) for prospective employees.
                                  training
    PISwill submit proposals for training funds to the PMU, and the PMU will evaluate these proposals
    according to specified and advertised criteria. These criteria are specified in the Operational Manual
    for the SDP. One key criterion is that firms will contribute a share (minimumof 10 percent) to the
    total costs of the training. A second will be that PISmust allow non-member fmto be included in
    their training proposals and services. Except for winning PISthat propose to provide training in-
    house, the PI will conduct simplified competitive bidding for public or private training providers.
    Training will be based on the competency standards already developed and in use by business
    associations and federations for these sectors. The PI will award training certificates to graduates
    who meet the competency standards.
    PISvary in their capacities to manage training services to SMEs. Some, such as the 14 investors'
    associations and the Tourism andthe Construction Federations, have developed this expertise. Others
    are at a less advanced stage of development. However, even the most advanced lack the capacity to
    absorb an additional training program like the SDP. Thus this component will also finance the
    incremental operating cost (staff, equipment, materials, supplies, transport, and consultants) that PIS
    selected for inclusion in the project incur. This will be provided in the form of a management fee.
    This will give them the capacity to deliver the training servicesenvisaged under the project as well as
    provide capacity buildingof a longer term nature.

    Component3. Project management and M&E (US$0.52million).

    This component will finance goods and technical advisory services for: strengthening the institutional
    capacity of the Project Management Unit (PMU); and conducting the monitoring and evaluation of
    the project's inputs, processes and outputs. It includes all staffing costs, equipment, materials,
    supplies and office space, as well as consultant assistance to ensure effective operation and
    monitoring and evaluation. To discriminate between design and implementationproblems with the
    SDP and to maximize learningfrom this pilot, M&Ewill focus onthe measurement of key inputs,
      processes, and outputs. This includes: a) evaluations of the training provided by contracted
    providers
      relative to the training specifications listed in provision contracts; and b) analyses of data
    from components 1B and 2 to establish benchmarks for demand-driven training, such as benchmarks
    for the costs of different types of training.

2. Key policyandinstitutionalreformssupported by the project:
The SDP i s a pilot for and a demonstration of a significantly different way of allocating public resources
for TVET. Its primary goal i s to inform the policy dialogue on training financing and provision and to
encourage the GoE to move subsequently from a pilot reform to a national reform that incorporates
successfully demonstrated features of the SDP.

The key policy and institutional reforms to be demonstratedby the SDP are the following:

        0   Change the public financing mechanism for TVET as well as the incorporation requirements
            for private sector businessorganizations inways that shift the system from supply to demand-
            driven training provided under competitive conditions.
        0   Streamline the public organizational apparatusfor managingpublicly financedTVET.
        0   Increase the accountability of publicly financed TVET by routinely measuring the market
            relevance, quality, and costs of publicly-financed training and using this feedback to modify
            TVET policies and operations.
        0   Improve the incentives for training providersto provide marketrelevant quality training.

3. Benefitsandtarget population:
Benefits
Economic benefis: The funding mechanism piloted by the SDP should produce training that is more
market relevant and that corrects skill imbalances faster, thus allowing beneficiary firms to improve their
competitiveness.    The approval process for PIS'proposals for cost-shared training services and the
tendering process for training provision should result in a more effective use of public training funds.
Unitcostsmay or maynotdecline, depending onwhether historically public TVET was over-funded or
under-funded, relative to quality standardsand standards for efficient operations.

Social Benefis: By testing a new financing mechanism for training, the SDP should help improve the
employability and labor productivity of individuals by bridging the gap between their skills and those
requiredby businesses.

Target Populations

There are three target groups.

       0    Workers. Two groups of workers are targeted by SDP: i)those already employed in a firm,
            and ii)those for whom there i s a demonstrated demand by firms through their federation or
            association surveys. The benefits for each are those traditionally associated with market-
            relevant training of good quality: better chances of getting a job, of keeping a job, of
            promotion, and of improved earnings.
       0    Employers and business associations. The SDP has initial eligibility criteria for firms and
            business associations: firm size (small and medium-sized), business sector (construction,
            manufacturing, and tourism), and geographic area (zones with large clusters of firms in the
            selected sectors and with business organizations with experience in managing training
            activities). Inthe longruneligible firms should benefit from improved labor productivity. In
            the shorter run both firms and business associations should benefit from the exercise of
            identifying their skill and training needs and a financing mechanism that provides effective
            training services.
       0    Trainingproviders. Inconjunction with the incentives such as those created under the MKI
            project, andto be createdby the companion ECproject for training providers, competitionfor
            funds may encourage these providers to develop their capacity to supply the services
            demandedby employers.

4. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements:
Implementation Period:        The project will be implemented over four years from November 2003-
December 2007.
Institutional Arrangements.       The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Industry and
Technological Development (MITD). Because the project i s multisectoral and under the broad aegis of
the Supreme Council for Human Resource Development (SCHRD), a Triministerial Advisory and
Coordinating Committee will be established to be the communications link with the SCHRD on policy
matters relating to TVET reform and to the EC and Bank supported projects. The members will be the
Minister of Manpower, the Minister of Industry and Technological Development, and the Minister of
Statefor ForeignAffairs. This Committee will meet two times a year.

A Board of Trustees (BOT) with management oversight and coordination responsibilities for boththe EC
and the Bank financed projects has been established within the MITD. Its membership of eleven will
include all project stakeholders. Employers will have a strong voice with a majority of the seats on the
Board, while key Government agencies will also be represented and the Minister of MITD will chair.
BOT members will rotate regularly. The BOT will meet quarterly and be supported by a technical
secretariat. The two PMUs responsible for implementing the EC and Bank supported projects would
report to the Board of Trustees.

A Project Management Unit (PMU) is being established under the BOT by the MITD to implement the
project. Its establishment with adequate numbers of staff with qualifications, experience and terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank; and the retentionwithin the PMUof a financial managementfirmwith
qualifications and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, and the commencement of the
implementation of the financial management system by the firm are conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed loan. The PMUi s being supported initially by an interim project managerfrom the Social Fund
for Development (SFD) until the PMU i s fully staffed and operational, which i s expected to be by
October 31, 2003. The UNDP i s providing financial support for the start up period. The PMU will
managethe project inaccordance with the Operational Manualpreparedfor the project, which sets out the
criteria and procedures under which the project will be implemented. The MITDwill maintain the PMU
with staffing, procedures andbudget satisfactory to the Bank for the duration of the project. The project's
Operational Manual would remain acceptableto the Bank at all times and would be reviewedperiodically
with the Bank and no less than annually.

D. ProjectRationale

1. Projectalternativesconsideredandreasonsfor rejection:
Reform the supply side of the system without attention to the demand side. One design alternative is to
upgrade the supply of TVET without dealing with the demand side. For example, the vocational training
centers (VTCs) argue, with somejustification, that a main problem i s a lack of resources:poor equipment,
poorly trained trainers, and inadequate training materials and supplies. This option was rejected for two
reasons. One was that several donor-funded and Bank-funded projects have taken this approach, but to
little effect on the quality and market relevance of the training provided. The second i s that the incentives
in the current system do not encourage firms and business associations to take responsibility for
identifying their skills and training needs, nor training providers to offer training of a type and quality
neededby the end-users (firms)and to price it competitively.

In the context of attending to the demand side of TVET, support public VTCs to improve the market
relevance and quality of their training services by financing, e.g., equipment purchases, curricula
redesign, or training to upgrade faculties. This option was discussed extensively. The SDP now focuses
on stimulating private sector demand for training, but obviously suppliers need to have incentives to meet


                                                    - 11-

demand if the TVET reformenvisioned by the SDP i s to work. Private suppliers do have such incentives
and can be expected to respond to SDPs competitive tendering for training services. However, there are
no incentives for public VTCs to act in a similar way. They now receive automatic budget allocations
from Government, and, thus far, the MoF has not allowed them to retain the revenues that they might
generate by selling their services to private firms or business associations. Since they have been delinked
from the demand side, their inputs to training (e.g., equipment, curricula, faculty) probably do not match
what i s requiredto deliver the training that firms need. Public (and private) VTCs certainly can include in
their responsesto competitive tenders the costs of some upgrading if it i s closely connected to the training
needed by specific firms. However, the costs of the upgrading required may result in bids that cannot
possibly be cost-competitive. The SDP could include a competitive grants program for VTCs to help
them improve their capacities to compete on future tenders. However, the SDP i s focusing on stimulating
training inresponse to specific market demand. The Bank was also concerned about the implementation
burden on the PMU of handling multiple proposals for funds from VTCs. The PMU already has to
handle proposals from Project Intermediaries and overseethe delivery of training services by the PIS.

The SDP will pursue three avenues. First, the SDP will work closely with the GoE and donor partners
that are addressing the supply side, especially with the EC.          The objective i s to coordinate the
simultaneous stimulation of the demand and the supply sides to produce more market relevant and higher
quality training in selected industries. Second, the MlTD intends to engage the MoF on a policy change
to allow public VTCs to retain some of the revenuesearnedby responding to private demand. Third, the
PMU will encourage PISto use existing mechanisms under which fees can be retained. These are
workable but with room for improvement. It will closely monitor rates at which public VTCs are
responding to the SDPs competitivetenders for training services. Ifthe responserate i s anemic, the SDP
will revisit this issue with Government and its donor partners.

Full-scale Reform. This option means replacing the current financing system entirely with a National
Training Fund. This alternative was rejected for two reasons. First, as section B.2 showed, the current
TVET system has a large number of stakeholders. A full-scale reform would probably mobilize the
political opposition of the line ministries that now control the VTCs, thus endangering the success of the
project. Second, the changes proposed under the SDP are radical inthe Egyptiancontext. It i s advisable
to test and learnfrom piloting these changes before trying to extend them broadly.

Choice of sectors,Jirms, eligible trainees, and geographic locations.      The SDP could have targeted all
sectors of the economy, firms of all sizes, a wide range of individuals, and the whole nation
geographically. Since the SDP i s a pilot and one objective i s to maximize learning from the SDP, it was
decided to limit its scope along all of these dimensions.

Specifically, it was decided on the basis of special labor market surveys to focus initially on three sectors
of the economy with good future growth prospects: construction, manufacturing and tourism. Within
manufacturing the GoE has seven strategic sectors that it supports as having particular potential for
growth and exports. These will be given a small margin of preference but as the project i s demand
driven, other manufacturing sectors will be eligible. Large Egyptian firms and multinationals were
excluded in favor of small and medium-sized enterprises because usually large firms already have some
appreciation of the importance of training and are either procuring it or providing it in-house. Ifincluded,
they would also dominate the use of the fund and would be more likely to use it to substitute for their own
training budgets.

Additional classes of individuals could have been included as eligible for training-e.g., handicapped
individuals or chronically unemployed workers. It was decided to restrict eligibility to workers already
hired by firms (new hires and experienced workers) and to a third class with particular characteristics:
first time entrants to the labor market who can be trained in fields where there is demonstrated demand
and placements offered by firms.        Finally, it was decided to limit the pilot to a few areas with
concentrated clusters of SMEs.

The SDP and the set of related Bank and donor-funded projects being prepared or under implementation
constitute coordinated support to the three main pillars and the five core areas of the Government's TVET
reform program. As the SDP was designed, there were extensive consultations, workshops and seminars
with the GoE and the donors. The main related projects with which the SDP i s coordinated are specified
inthe Section B.l (Government Strategy).

3. Lessonslearnedandreflected inthe projectdesign:
The design of the SDP incorporates a number of internationallessonsabout TVET that are also echoedin
the World Bank`s and other donors' experienceswith TVET inEgypt.
           Increasing private sector demand for training and providing it in a cost-effective manner
           requires consulting closely with and involving the private sector. It also requires financing
           arrangements that create incentives for firms to invest intraining and for training providersto
           improve the cost-effectiveness of services. The cornerstone of the SDP i s the piloting of
           financing arrangements that can be expected to create suchincentives, especially for firms.
           Competition among public and private providers of training reduces costs, increases the
           amount of training, and improves the relevance of training to employer skill needs. The SDP
           will tender for training services from private and public sector training institutions.
           Incountries where the private sector has weak incentives and limited capacities to invest in
           training, the reimbursement for most costs of external training, technical assistance to
           enterprises, and support for external private and public sector training providers are neededto
           stimulate the development of an effective training market. Egypt's TVET system fits this
           case, and the SDP i s designed to support private sector firms and business associations in
           assessing their skill and training needs and in putting together proposals for training sub-
           projects. Aside from contributions that may be in-kind,the training costs of firms selectedto
           receive such funds will be covered by public sector funding. The SDP will also hold
           technical assistance workshops that will be open to all public and private sector training
           providers inthe limited geographic areas where the SDP will be operating.
           Institutingmarket relevant reforms inTVET cannot be done when multiple ministries control
           the system. The SDP i s a pilot "one stop shopping" for private sector firms and business
           associations that needtraining services.

           information technology - found that enterprises are willing to finance training at a rate of 10
           A survey of five sectors in Egypt - construction, manufacturing, tourism, banking and

           to 50 percent of the total cost. Based on these findings, the SDP includes a cost-sharing
           mechanism.
           On the basis of the experience with Jordan's Bank-financed TVET project, it was decided to
           use investorhusiness associations and federations, chambers of commerce and the like as
           intermediaries between beneficiary firms and training providers.         In the Jordan case the
           transaction costs of dealing directly with multiple fmthreatened the PMU's ability to attend
           to other project priorities. The Project Intermediary mechanism lets the SDP "wholesale"
           training services and reduces the number of actors with which the PMU must deal. In the
           first year up to three agreementswith well qualified PISin a few industrial areas (e.g., 6th of
           October, 10th of Ramadan, Sadat Cities) would be executed, after which any necessary
           changes could be introduced on the basis of the experience gained. There are fourteen private
           investors associations with up to eight years of experience providing training to member
           fm,as well as the federations, associations and chambers of commerce representing
           different sectors, and with varying degrees of experience in providing training to members.
           There i s thus an adequate pool of organizations with practical experience to act as Project
           Intermediaries under the project.
           Donor interventions in the TVET sector in Egypt in the past have been poorly coordinated,
           resulting in a sum of effort that i s less than its constituent parts. The Government's overall
           strategy for TVET now guides all donor-supported projects, includingthe Bank's SDP.
           One-shot donor interventions to improve the competitiveness of Egypt's firms--specifically ,
           business services, including training services--have not been sustainable.           The SDP i s
           designed, if successful, to evolve into a national, fiscally sustainable, demand-driven training
           system.

4. Indicationsof borrower commitment and ownership:
Key Egyptian policymakers have developed a keenunderstanding of the stakes involved inimproving the
skills of the country's labor force.     These include reducing youth unemployment, improving labor
productivity as one way to sustain economic growth, and helpingsmall and medium-sized firms prepare
for free trade with Europe and the impact of Egypt's entry into the WTO. It i s against this compelling
backdrop that the GoE articulated its vision for TVET reform by adopting a Policy Statement for TVET
that sees promoting a demand-driven training system as a cornerstone. Government has committed
significant levels of effort and fundingto a package of priorities that are laying the groundwork for TVET
reform. It developed legislation amending the Labor Law, which was approved by Parliament in early
2003. It i s implementing significant reforms in the other four core areas: the Skills Standards Project
(development of new training standards in three major sectors), the National Classification of
Occupations (licensing mechanisms), employment services, and the labor market information system, as
well as inthe governance and financing of training supported respectively by the proposed EC grant and
Bank loan. It has also organized donor support around these priorities in a coherent and mutually
reinforcing manner.


5. Value added of Bank support inthis project:
The Bank has extensive experience-and           relative to other donors working in Egypt, a comparative
advantage-in    designing financing mechanisms that: a) transform supply-driven systems of training into
demand-driven systems, and b) create incentives for suppliers to provide market-relevant and higher
quality services at competitive costs. The Bank together with the EC has played a leadership role in
helping the Government formulate a coherent overall TVET reform strategy, which involved consultation
with and inputsfrom all the stakeholders. Through the proposed project the Bank will be able to continue
to play a leadership role inthe policy dialogue with the Government.

E. Summary ProjectAnalysis (Detailedassessments areintheprojectfile, see Annex 8)
1. Economic(see Annex 4):
Cost effectiveness NPV=US$ million; ERR = % (see Annex 4)
Rationale for public intervention. Egypt's long-term plan (1997-2017) to increase its international
competitiveness includes: i)enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of its firms; ii)improving the
country's technological base and its ability to absorb new technologies rapidly; and iii)positioning the
private sector as the lead producers of goods and services that meet quality international standards at
competitive prices. Although no single factor ensures competitiveness, adequate human resources as
shaped by workers' education and training are one factor in the competitiveness equation. The urimaw
rationale for this uubliclv financed intervention i s that the SDP addresses market failure in Egvpt's
training. markets. Features of the financing reform strategy that the SDP i s piloting include mobilizing
private resources (cost-sharing by fw),a demand-driven and competitive allocation of public training
resources, and a competitive tendering for training servicesby public and private providers.
Demand failure. On the demand side, Egypt's employers and workers underinvest intraining for similar
and different reasons.    Both employers and workers see public training as having low value (low
relevance and quality). In addition, workers underinvest because they cannot meet the costs of training
and becausebetter skills are not necessarily rewarded inthe labor market.
Most Egyptian employers spend few resources on training their staff for two reasons: a fear that their
trained employees will be "poached" by other enterprises; and a low skills equilibrium. The Egyptian
private sector is dominated by small and medium enterprises, many of them operating with low levels of
productivity and employing workers with low levels of education and skills. S M E employers often do not
understand the type of labor force that they need to improve their competitive position or how training
can be used strategically to create the skills that they need. Lack of information on training needs i s thus
a major market failure inEgypt.



                                                      - 16-

Supply failure. On the supply side, public training providers have no incentives to adapt training to the
types of skills and quality standards needed by employers and workers. They receive automatic annual
budget allocations. These are not tied to the market relevance and quality of the training provided. In
addition there is still arelative lack of private training providers who service demand driven training.
Addressing market failures. The SDP i s designed to pilot incentives to address both demand and supply
failures. Directly or through Project Intermediaries, it targets fmwith nascent competitive promise by
providingtechnical assistance to help them identify their skill and training needs and to work with them
to procure training competitively. It tries to offset the fear of poaching by partially financing the costs to
firms of identifying their training needs, preparing training plans, and obtaining training. Inother words,
itreduces the cost oflosingtrainedemployeesto other firms by reducingthe initialcost of training.
It addresses supply failures by involving employers in the specification of training needs and in the
competitive procurement of training provision according to these specifications.
Cost-eflectiveness analysis. Because of a lack of experience and no data on demand driven training, it i s
not now possible to do a cost-effectiveness analysis of demand-driven TVET. But one of the analytic
products of the pilot SDP will be the information to undertake cost-effectiveness analysis. To the extent
that mechanisms being piloted under the SDP succeed, market failures in training should be reduced,
efficiency will improve, training costs may be reduced, and training shouldcertainly be more effective. It
i s planned that over the course of the project the SDP will estimate the "true" costs of different types of
training that are being more efficiently delivered. Ordinarily competitive bidding for services reduces
costs. However, it i s not now clear whether unit costs for training will increase or decrease. VTCs have
significant inefficiencies, such as excess non-training staff. However, supplies and materials are known
to be inadequate, and these centers may have to pay instructional staff at higher rates to secure teachers
able to meet the quality standardsrequired.
The SDP will measure indicators of effectiveness. Prior to collecting empirical data, it is reasonable to
expect, and international experience strongly suggests, that the mechanisms that the SDP will use to
procure training will ensure much tighter connections between the skills and training that firms and
workers need andthe training delivered. The competitiveprocess will require employers to think through
what skills they need and to specify the training that they want provided. The tendering for training will
set training standards, and ex-post evaluations will affect providers' chances in subsequentcompetitions.
The result should be that public training money i s more effectively spent.

2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
NFV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)

 Fiscal Impact:
The cost of the SDP to Government i s approximately $18 million over a five year period. In 1998, the
most recent year for which this type of information i s available, Government expenditures on TVET were
about $125 million. Assuming a rate of increase of 3 percent a year, expenditures in 2002 would have
been inthe order of $140 million. The annual cost of the SDP is 2.4 percent of the 1998 expenditures or
2 percent of estimated 2002 expenditures.           This is a small amount and the fiscal impact will be
manageable. The World Bank will provide a US$5.5 million loan, the GoE US$6 million, and fm
benefiting from the training at least US$1 million in contributions. Since the GoE plans to continue
allocating the same budget to the line ministries for TVET as it has in past years, the GoE counterpart
contribution to the project would be incremental to the overall TVET budget.

Fiscal Sustainability of a Demand-Driven TVET

The proposed project i s sustainable during its expected five and a half year life, because the Government
has assembled the financial package, including earmarked counterpart funds, to ensure that. In addition
the Ministry of Finance has allocated adequate resources to the Ministry of Industry and Technological
Development (MITD) to support the companion EC project. This will enhance the reform effort in both
governance and financing of the training sector.

                                                      - 17-

If the SDP is successful and the GoE moves to a national training fund for demand-driven TVET, its
annual costs and fiscal sustainability cannot now be estimated. First, the costs of a demand-driven TVET
system are unknown. For example, the costs of training provision under competitive conditions are
unknown. Second, the Government needs to complete its review of options for future sources of funding
for demand driven training as well as the relative trade-offs involved. These include reallocation of some
of the training resources now allocated to the line ministries administering training programs to a single
national training fund, which would have likely political costs. They also include whether to implement a
0.5 percent corporate revenue levy on f m s earmarked for training, which has been approved by the
Government in May, 2003. This raises concerns about the total tax burden on labor as well as technical
issues of compliance. A third option, would be for the GoE to institute policies designed to increase the
level of cost recovery from employers and workers for training services. This could be expected to affect
demand by SMEs and workers for training.

3. Technical:
The training demanded by small and medium size enterprises, and to be financed under the project, i s not
technically complex as it will finance short term (less than six months) training related to the production
process in established technical disciplines.       The complexity in the project i s more in terms of
management as it arises from the need to provide a wide variety of different types of technical training
demanded by different client firms and their workers. In the demand studies carried out during the
preparation of this project, surveyed firms made it clear that technical training included both training in
relevant technical competencies, and training for technical staff in 'soft' or social competencies
(communications, teamwork, time management, understanding the client, crisis planning etc.). They also
indicated strongly that technical training included training of all technical personnel from senior managers
to the shop floor and worksite.       All training provided will be competency based, and certificates
recognized by firms and their representative federations and associations will be issued to trainees upon
completion of each course. The project will not include other types of training (finance, sales, marketing,
general management etc.) as these are being adequately covered by other donor supported projects. As
noted elsewhere, project management and implementation will be governed by an Operational Manual,
which sets out the policies and procedures which will govern the project. With respect to the various
consulting support tasks in the project, there i s ample capacity within the Egyptian consulting industryto
carry them out, and project management and institutional capacity buildingskills are readily available in
Egypt.

4. Institutional:

4.1 Executingagencies:

The executing agency i s the Ministry of Industry and Technological Development (MITD), which was
selected by the Government because of its leadership and management capabilities, including
implementation of donor funded projects. To ensure that the voices of key stakeholders, both employer
and provider representatives, are heard, the Minister of the MITD will establish the Board of Trustees.
This will provide overall project management and oversight for both the European Commission and the
Bank financed projects, andcoordination and communication between the various project stakeholders.

4.2 Project management:

The Project Management Unitbeing established by the MITDto implement the project i s being supported
initially by an interim project manager from the Social Fund for Development (SFD) until the PMU i s
fully staffed and operational. The PMU will manage the project in accordance with the Operational
Manualpreparedfor the project, which sets out the criteria and procedures under which the project will be
implemented. The project's Operational Manual would remain acceptable to the Bank at all times and
would bereviewed periodically with the Bank and no less than annually.


                                                    - 18-

The MITD has a three person senior counterpart team, which will be responsible for establishing the
PMU and in particular for recruiting its regular personnel: a Project Director, a financial officer, a
procurement officer and an accounting and financial management firm all of whose terms of reference,
qualifications, experience and conditions of employment are satisfactory to the Bank. The persons
recruited to these positions will be subject to a six month probationary period, at the end of which the
MITDinconsultationwith the Bank will decide whether or not to retainthem. The recruitment process
for these positions has begun and i s expected to be completed by October 31, 2003. The PMUwill also
recruit a financial manager, a monitoring and evaluation expert, and support staff including a data systems
specialist, and an MIS specialist. The terms of employment and salary levels of all PMU staff will be
consistent with those of project management staff in other Bank supported projects, and will be term
contractual positions.   The PMU will recruit consultant experts in communications, promotion and
outreach, training needs assessments (TNA), and capacity buildingto Project Intermediary organizations
(PI). The PMUwill be supported for the first two years by a TVET expert funded by the Government of
France. This support will be renewable for another two years if needed. The Government has provided a
start-up contribution of LE1million ($170,000) to the PMUbudget. This is in addition to a contribution
from UNDPof $25,000. The PMUbudget will be financed thereafter by the Government.


An institutional, procurement and financial management capacity assessment at appraisal determined
these proposed arrangementsto be adequate once they are inplace. Further details are set out inAnnex 6.
The PMU has prepared a draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and First Year Work Program, which
were agreed at negotiations and are incorporated into the Operational Manual. The focus duringthe first
year to eighteen months will be on: i)a communication, promotion and outreach programto informfirms,
and their associations and federations as well as public and private training providers about the project
and how to obtain cost sharing training funds or training contracts; ii)a pilot with about three selected
Project Intermediaries (PI) to show quick success and be a testing ground; and iii)establishing the
Monitoring and Evaluation system.
The PMU will review and make recommendations on all training proposals under a certain threshold.
Those above the threshold would be evaluated by a larger committee, bringing in sectoral experts, with
the Project Director making decisions basedon the committees' recommendations.
Once a proposal i s approved, the PIwill be responsible for contracting training providers. To the extent
feasible this will be done on a competitive basis. The PI will also be responsible for collecting the
matching cost share contributions from the beneficiary firms. Wages and in-kind contributions such as
making available trainers, andtraining rooms may be acceptable provided beneficiary firms have no other
means of making contributions and provided the value of contributions can be assessed. The PI would
also evaluatethe training provider at the end of the training period and contracts will be subject to sample
audits.
The PMUwill also manage all project monitoring and evaluation, including the outcome monitoring (see
Section Cl). Inaddition to the standardperiodic reporting, the PMUstaffwill be responsible for carrying
out random field supervision of PISand training providers to ensure that training i s being provided in
accordance with the terms of the contract, and that firms are contributing their agreed share of costs. The
supervisionplani s includedas a part of the PIP.


4.3 Procurement issues:

Procurement under the project will not be complicated as it will primarily consist of procurement of
training services. The PMU will allow PISto use simplified procedures to procure training providers.
Procurement under the project will be managed in accordance with Bank Guidelines.               A qualified
procurement officer will be recruited. Training of PMU staff will be provided by the Bank's Cairo
Country Office, and if required by the L O program in Turin, Italy. Procurement arrangements are
reviewed further inthe Procurement Assessment, Annex 6. Disbursements would be made against SOEs
with full documentation and direct payments.

                                                   - 19-

4.4 Financialmanagement issues:

A financial management assessment of the PMUwas carried out duringappraisal. The PMUwill retain
an accounting fmto install and then manage the project's accounting and financial management system.
This will ensure compliance with OP10.02.          At the end of the first year, the experience with this
arrangement will be evaluated and the contract either extended or dropped. This would be inaddition to
recruiting a financial manager. The Operational Manual details the accounting policies and procedures
for the project.   Project accounts will be audited annually by an independent external auditor with
qualifications, experience and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. The audit report will be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of eachfiscal year.

6. Social:
6.1 Summarize key social issuesrelevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
development outcomes.

The SDP will target small and medium sized enterprises in which the majority of Egyptian employees
work.   As noted in section E.l, it is reasonable to expect that the SDP will ensure much tighter
connections between the skills and training that fm and workers need and the training delivered. Thus,
the SDP should increase the employability and the wages of those trained by increasing the market
relevance and quality of their skills. The criteria for awarding cost sharing training funds will promote a
balance between urban and rural areas and between male and female workers, subject to economic
conditions and employer demand.

6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholdersparticipatinginthe project?

The relevant apex organization (SCHRD), core and line ministries, and agencies such as the Social Fund
have been involved extensively in project preparation, most recently through a Government Task Force.
The Task Force met between July-September, 2002 to determine the main design parameters of the
                                                    - 20 -

project as well as the companionEC funded project. The Federationsand Business Associations for the
Construction, Manufacturing and Tourism sectors have been consulted extensively. Under PHRD
financed surveys, 211f m s and financial institutions in the construction, manufacturing and tourism, as
well as bankingand IT sectors were surveyed on their training needs. A sample of Vocational Training
Centers was also surveyedto ascertaintheir interest in and impedimentsto providing training under this
type of project. Various Bank mission have met with other business organizations (Egyptian-American
Chamber of Commerce, Investors Associations etc.) and with Egyptian businessmen managing large
corporations to obtain their views. The Bank and EC have consulted closely with all other donors
involved in the training sector through several workshops conductedjointly with the Government to
ensure complementarity and to avoid overlap. Donors active in the sector include GTZ, French
Cooperation, EC and CIDA.        Many of these stakeholders had been consulted earlier during the
preparation of the ETES report of the Education, Training and Employment Sub-committee of the
Cabinet during 1999-2000. The governancearrangements for the project (the Board of Trustees) as well
as the implementation arrangements set out in the Operational Manual are designed to include all the
stakeholdersandto give themvoice.

6.3 How does the project involve consultationsor collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?

Six private sector representativesto be selected from the relevant federations and business associations
will be members of the proposedBoard of Trustees. All of these organizations are established under the
Egyptian NGO Law Number 84 of 2002. The Project Intermediaries acting for SMEs within their
geographic areas, will play a key linkage role both in terms of awareness and promotion, and are also
responsible as well for implementation. In addition the surveys and other follow up instruments under
component l.B (Outcome Monitoring and Evaluation) of the project will be an important channel for
consultationandfeedback.

6.4 What institutional arrangements havebeenprovidedto ensure the project achieves its social
developmentoutcomes?

The establishment of the BOT with broad stakeholder representationand with oversight over the PMU,
and the implementation of the project in accordancewith the OperationalManual, will help ensure that
the socialdevelopmentobjectives are achieved.

6.5 How will the project monitor performanceinterms of socialdevelopmentoutcomes?

Monitoring of socialdevelopment outcomeswill be done throughthe various follow up surveys and
studies included inthe M&Ecomponent.

Doesthis project include any Community-Driven Development component?       No

F. Sustainability andRisks
1. Sustainability:
Economic, political, and fiscal factors will affect the sustainability of the SDP bothinthe five year project
life span, as well as inthe longer term reformhorizon. Inthe short term, the SDP isjudged to be a high
riskproject given the new 'demanddriven' approachto training it will introduce. That is why a small and
simple pilot project was designed both to test the approach and to reduce risk. "Sustainability" of the
SDP will be achieved if it can stimulate and respond successfully to training demand from SMEs. As a
'pilot' to test moving to a national demand driven training fund, 'sustainability' means developing a track
record, which convinces the various stakeholders to buy into longer term systemic change. This concept
has good political support as senior policy makers appreciate the need to improve Egyptian labor
productivity inthe context of opening the economy.
But as noted in Section A.2, such a fund is vulnerable to downturns in Egypt's economy. Under
conditions of downturn, private sector employers will be less apt to take several actions that affect their
training demands-e.g., hire new workers, upgrade the skills of existing workers, or invest in new
technologies that require new skills. IfEgypt enters a prolongedperiod of slow growth, the GoEmay not
move to a nationalfund simply becausethe employer demand for training on which the fund i s predicated
may be insufficient to warrant such a move. As noted in Section B.2, the current TVET system i s
fragmented organizationally and fiscally among multiple ministries. Movingto a national demand-driven
training fund implies substantial institutional and budget restructuring over time as a single fund i s
established. The multiple ministries with a stake in the current TVET system can be expected to resist
such a move. The pilot nature of the project will allow a period of dialogue on the policy and institutional
issuesinvolved and consensusbuilding. As noted in Section E2, the fiscal sustainability of the project is
assured. However there are difficult fiscal policy options to be reviewed and decided upon before it can
be concluded that a national demand-driven training fund could be fiscally sustainable. To achieve a
successful outcome will require adroit and sustained political leadership of the process of achieving the
neededconsensus among the different stakeholders.
Finally, with a subsidized training program of this kind there i s always a risk of incurring high
'deadweight' costs, that i s firms substitute public funding for own financing of training. In a project of
this nature there will inevitably be some 'deadweight' costs. That is acceptable as long as the overall
economic benefits of the project outweigh the economic cost. The project has design characteristics to
limit this risk.

3. PossibleControversialAspects:
Two dimensions of the project are potentially controversial:

a) The idea of demand-driven training, competitively provided training services, and the move from a
supply-driven and vertically organized system to a single training fund i s new in Egypt and therefore
politically controversial.

b) Proper governance arrangements require collaboration across ministries. The public sector inEgypt is
vertically organized, and there i s limited experience with horizontal and collaborative governance of a
public entity.

                             Annex 2: Detailed Project Description

                   ARAB REPUBLICOF EGYPT: SKILLS DEVELOPMENT

1.       Project development objective:

The objective of the Project i s to assist the Borrower incarrying out apilot programto stimulate the
private sector demand for skills training development through a demand-driven and competitively-
basedmechanism. The project would have three components: 1)Awareness Programand
Monitoring and Evaluation; 2) Training Sub-projects, and 3) ProjectManagement and M&E.
Further details can be found inthe Operational Manual for the project (see Annex 11).

2. Key performance indicators:
The following indicators will be used to measure the performance of the pilot against baseline data
to be collected inthe first year (further details are spelt out inthe Operational Manual):
a) increasing number of requests by small and medium-sized fums and business associations for
training;
b) increasing percent of approved requests by small and medium-sized firms and business
associationsfor training;
c) increasing number of responsesfrom public and private training providers to competitive tenders
for training services;
d) increasing rates of post-training employment of employees in occupations for which they were
trained;
e) continuously improving perceptions of managers from a sample of firms and business
associations of: i)relevance of training to employer needs; ii)quality of training; iii)transaction
costs of procuring funding for training from Government; and iv) timeliness of Government's
provision of fundingfor neededtraining.


Although the ultimate objective of increasing private sector demand for training i s to increase fm
competitiveness and labor productivity, these outcomes are excluded on the basis of OECD country
experience. This experience indicates that it may take 15-20 years for the private sector inEgyptto
invest sufficiently in training to get the benefit of using training as a tool to achieve greater
competitiveness and labor productivity. The Skills Development Project (SDP) i s designed as a
catalyst to help acceleratethis process.
Even if the Skills Development Project (SDP) i s well implemented, it i s vulnerable to downturns in
Egypt's economy. Private sector employers will reduce their training demands as they cut back on
upgradingthe skills of existing workers, hiringnew workers, or investing in new technologies that
require new skills. So data on economic growth or contraction in the sectors targeted by the SDP
duringthe life of the Project will becollected to interpret the outcome results.


By Component:

Project Component 1     - US$1.10 million
Awareness program and monitoring and evaluation. This component will finance the provision of
technical advisory services to: carry out awareness, promotion and outreach programs; monitoring
and evaluation surveys, studies, and assessments; enable beneficiary firms to undertake training
needs assessments and plans; enable eligible training providers to develop training proposals; and
enable eligible Project Intermediaries to develop aggregated training proposals. The purpose of this
component will be to stimulate private sector demand for training and competitively-based
responses of training providers to private sector demand. It will also evaluate project outcomes to

complete the feedback loop. The project will target initially three sectors of the economy -
construction, manufacturing and tourism - and the small and, especially, medium-sized private
sector firms (SMEs), and federations and business associations in these sectors ina limited number
of geographic areas where firms in these sectors are concentrated. The selection of these three
sectors was based on labor market surveys carried out in2001under the PHRDgrant for the project.
The following tables show that measured by number of fim,SMEs dominate each of the three
sectors.
Constructionsector. This sector has a very few large companies that inturn sub-contract to small
and medium fm.Only 14 firms, 10of thempublic sector, employ more than 1,000 employees.

LA. Awareness, Promotion, and Outreach. Training demand-particularly               informed training
demand-is      poorly developed in small and medium-sized firms and business associations. This
subcomponent supports awareness campaigns and other promotional activities to acquaint firms and
associations in the selected sectors with the training opportunities available under SDP. The
campaign will clarify the criteria that: i)the project will use to select proposals submitted for
funding; and ii)intermediary organizations will use in deciding whether to include a particular
fum's proposal intheir aggregateproposal.
The Project Management Unit (PMU) will select business associations to operate as Project
Intermediaries (PIS)between the PMU and beneficiary firms and workers. The PISproposals will
"bundle" firms and workers that the association has identified to receive training. Inthe first year a
very small number of training agreements with well qualified intermediaries would be executed,
after which any necessary changes could be introducedon the basis of the experience gained. There
are fourteen private investors associations with up to eight years of experience that provide training
to member firms, as well as the federations, associations and chambers of commerce representing
different sectors that have varying degrees of experience inproviding training to members. There i s
thus an adequatepoolof organizations with practicalexperienceto act as PISunder the project.
This subcomponent also finances technical assistanceto PISto develop their training proposals; and
includes help in conducting skill needs surveys, training needs assessments, costing of the training
needed, and surveys of qualified local providers. Ifthe PIproposesto conduct in-house training, the
PMU will help the organization identify what it needs to provide quality training, such as training
trainers and developing appropriate curricula. It also includes technical assistance to training
providers, as they are inexperienced in competitive tendering processes and in writing proposals.
The PISwill consult with training providers about the program information that they need. The
PMUwill run workshops open to all providers in the geographic areas targeted by the SDP. The
implementation of this component will be guided by a communications strategy developed by the
Ministry of Industry and TechnologicalDevelopment(MITD).

l.B. Monitoring and Evaluation. Systematic measurementof outputs and outcomes is an essential
element of a pilot project that i s designed to test policies. The expected performance indicators are
noted in section 2 above.      This subcomponent will finance consulting services and technical
assistanceto cany out the instrument design (e.g. surveys of employers and business associations,
tracer surveys) and data collection needed to track these outcomes and contingencies.             This
component focuses on project outcomes as opposed to project inputs,processes and outputs M&E
that the PMUwill undertake as part of component 3.


ProjectComponent2 US$10.83 million
                      -
Training Sub-projects. Under this component, the project will finance a demand driven training
program on a cost shared basis with beneficiary firms; and will strengthen the institutional capacity
of eligible Project Intermediaries. The program will be implemented through PISfor the benefit of
small and medium size firms and related business associations and organizations initially in the
construction, manufacturing and tourism sectors and will support short term (less than six months)
productionrelated training. Targeted geographical areas are those with large clusters of firms inthe
selected sectors, and with business associations that are active in these areas and have some
experience delivering training to member firms. These criteria may be modified during the course
of project implementation. Cost sharing training funds may be used to support the following
activities:
In-service training: undertaken once a person is employed- includes the training needed to upgrade
employee skills and to meet the skills requirement of firms.

Trainingfor Prospective Employees: undertaken in cases where there is a demonstrated demand
from firms, including placement agreements, for trained people who are entering the labor force for
the first time.
                                                  - 32 -

PISwill submit proposals for financing of training to the Project Management Unit (PMU), and the
PMUwill evaluate these proposals according to specified andadvertised criteria. These criteria are
set out in the Operational Manual for the project. One key criterion i s that fm will contribute a
share (a minimumof 10percent) of the total costs of the training. A second i s that PISmust allow
non-member firms to be includedintheir training proposals. Exceptfor winning PISthat propose to
provide training in-house, the PI will conduct simplified competitive biddingfor public or private
training providers. Training will be based on the competency standards already developed and in
use by business associations and federations for these sectors. The PI or sector-relevant business
association or federation will award training certificates to graduates who meet the competency
standards.

PISvary intheir capacitiesto managetraining services. Some, suchas the 14investors' associations
and the Construction and Tourism Federations, have developed expertise in delivering training
services. Others are at a less advanced stage of development. However, even the most advanced
lack the capacity to absorb an additional training program like the SDP. Thus this component will
also finance the incremental operating cost (project staff, office equipment, materials, supplies,
transport, and utilities) that PISselected for inclusion inthe project incur. This will be provided in
the form of a management fee. This will give them the capacity to deliver the training services
envisagedunder the project as well as provide capacity buildingof a longer term nature.


Project Component3 US$0.52 million
                       -
Project management and M&E. This component will finance goods and technical advisory
services for: strengthening the institutional capacity of the Project Management Unit (PMU); and
conducting the monitoring and evaluation of the project's inputs,processesand outputs. It includes
all staffing costs, equipment, materials, supplies and office space, as well as consultant assistanceto
ensure effective operation, and monitoring and evaluation. To discriminate between design and
implementation problems, and to maximize learning from this pilot project, the monitoring and
evaluation sub-component will focus on the measurement of key inputs, processes, and outputs.
Thisincludes: a) evaluations of the training provided by contracted providersrelative to the training
specifications listed in provision contracts, as well as to the unit costs of training related to the
qualification level being taught; and b) analyses of data from components 1B and 2 to establish
benchmarks for demand-driven training, such as benchmarks for the costs of different types of
training.  The PMU would produce quarterly and annual progress reports and arrange for the
auditing of project accounts. It would prepare the Mid Term Review of the project as well as the
Implementation Completion Report. It would ensure that records were adequately kept. In order
for the PMUto carry out its financial reporting and auditing obligations, PISwould be required to
keep adequate records of all training activities funded under their contracts with the PMU. The
PMU could request access to these records as well as those of any other private or public partner
that has entered into a contractual obligation for approved activities. The PMU would be able to
requestan inspection of premises where approved training has taken place.

competitiveness includes: i)enhancing the productivity and competitiveness of its firms; ii)
improving the country's technological base and its ability to absorb new technologies rapidly; and
iii)positioningtheprivatesectorastheleadproducersofgoodsandservicesthatmeetquality
international standards at competitive prices. Although no single factor ensures competitiveness,
adequate human resources as shaped by workers' education and training are one factor in the
competitiveness equation. Since the SDP deals with basic demand and sumlv failures in Envut's
training. markets, there i s a clear rationale for this publiclv financed intervention. Features of the
strategy that the SDP i s piloting include mobilizing private resources (cost-sharing by firms), a
demand-driven allocation of public training resources, and a competitive tendering for training
services by public andprivate providers.
Demand failure. On the demand side, Egypt's employers and workers under-invest in training for
similar and different reasons. Both employers and workers see public training as having low value
(low relevance and quality). Inaddition, workers under-invest becausethey cannot meet the costs of
training and becausebetter skills are not necessarily rewarded inthe labor market.
Most Egyptian employers spend few resources on training their staff for two reasons: a fear that
their trained employees will be "poached" by other enterprises and a low skills equilibrium. The
Egyptianprivate sector i s dominated by small and mediumenterprises, many of them operating with
low levels of productivity and employing workers with low levels of education and skills. SME
employers often do not understand the type of labor force that they need to improve their
competitive positions or how training can be used strategically to create the skills that they need.
Lack of information on training needs i s thus a major market failure inEgypt.
Supplv failure. On the supply side, public training providers have no incentives to adapt training to
the types of skills and quality standardsneededby employers and workers. They receive automatic
budget allocations. These are not tied to the market relevance and quality of the training provided.
Addressing market failures. The SDP i s designed to pilot incentives to address both demand and
supply failures. Directly or through Project Intermediaries, it targets firms with nascent competitive
promise by providing technical assistance to help them identify their skill and training needs and to
work with them to procure training competitively. It tries to offset the fear of poachingby partially
financing the costs to firms of identifying their training needs, preparing training plans, and
obtaining training. Inother words, it reduces the cost of losing trained employees to other firms by
reducingthe initial cost of training.
It addresses supply failures by linking employers into the specification of training needs and
competing training provision according to these specifications.
Cost-eflectiveness analysis. It is not now possible to do a cost-effectiveness analysis of demand-
driven TVET, but one of the analytic products of the pilot SDP i s a cost-effectiveness analysis. To
the extent that mechanisms being piloted under the SDP succeed, market failures intraining should
be reduced, training costs may be reduced, and training should certainly be more effective. It i s
planned that over the course of the project the SDP will estimate the "true" costs of different types
of training that are being more efficiently delivered. Ordinarily competitive bidding for services
reduces costs. However, it i s not now clear whether unit costs for training will increaseor decrease.
VTCs have significant inefficiencies, such as excess non-training staff. However, supplies and
materials are known to be inadequate, and these centers may have to pay instructional staff at higher
rates to secure teachers able to meet the quality standardsrequired by employers.
The SDP will measure indicators of effectiveness (see sections A2 and Cl). Prior to collecting
empirical data, it i s reasonable to expect that the mechanisms that the SDP will use to procure

                                                  - 35 -

training will ensure muchtighter connections between the skills and training that firms and workers
need and the training delivered. The competitive process will require employers to think through
what skills they need and to specify the training that they want provided. The tendering for training
will set training standards, and ex-post evaluations will affect providers' chances in subsequent
competitions. The result should be that public training money i s more effectively spent.

Cost-benefit analysis. Theoretically, the SDP should reduce unemployment among those it targets
by increasing the market relevance and quality of trainees' skills. New entrants are more likely to
get hired; employees are more apt to keep their jobs. All else equal, it should increase the labor
productivity of the fmtargeted.

Cost-benefit analyses based on the Egyptian case cannot now be done. However, again, one of the
purposes of the pilot i s to collect data that would allow simple cost-benefit analyses, and one of the
analytic products of the pilot SDP is expected to be a cost-benefit analysis.            To that end,
components l.B and 4 of the SDP will fund the collection of data that can be used to estimate the
costs and some of the benefits of demand-driventraining.

Fiscal Impact of the Project

The cost of the SDP to Government i s approximately $18 million over a five year period. In 1998,
the most recent year for which this type of information i s available, Government expenditures on
TVET were about $125 million. Assuming a rate of increase of 3 percent a year, expenditures in
2002 would have beeninthe order of $140 million. The annual cost of the SDP i s 2.4 percent of the
1998 expenditures or 2 percent of estimated 2002 expenditures. This i s a small amount and the
fiscal impact will be manageable. The World Bank will provide a US$5.5 million loan, the GoE
US$6 million, and fmbenefiting from the training at least US$1 million incontributions. Since
the GoE plans to continue allocating the same budget to the line ministries for TVET as it has in
past years, the GoE counterpart contribution to the project would be incremental to the overall
TVETbudget.

Fiscal Sustainability of a Demand-DrivenTVET

The proposed project i s sustainable during its expected five and a half year life, because the
Government has assembledthe financial package, including earmarked counterpart funds, to ensure
that. In addition the Ministry of Finance has allocated adequate resources to the Ministry of
Industry and Technological Development (MITD) to support the companion EC project. This will
enhancethe reform effort inbothgovernance and financing of the training sector.

Ifthe SDPis successfulandthe GoEmoves toanationaltraining fundfor demand-driven TVET, its
annual costs and fiscal sustainability cannot now be estimated. First, the costs of a demand-driven
TVET system are unknown.           For example, the costs of training provision under competitive
conditions are unknown. Second, the Government needs to complete its review of options for future
sources of funding for demand driven training as well as the relative trade-offs involved. These
include reallocation of some of the training resources now allocated to the line ministries
administeringtraining programs to a single national training fund, which would have likely political
costs. They also include whether to implement a 0.5 percent corporate revenue levy on fm
earmarked for training, which has been approved by the Government in May, 2003. This raises
concerns about the total tax burden on labor as well as technical issues of compliance. A third
option, would be for the GoE to institute policies designed to increase the level of cost recovery
from employers and workers for training services. This could be expected to affect demand by
SMEs and workers for training.

                 ARAB REPUBLICOF EGYPT: SKILLS DEVELOPMENT




ProcurementAdministration

Egypt's public procurement i s managed in accordance with the provisions of the Law No. 89 of
May 1998 on Organizing Tenders and Bids, amendedby decrees No. 513/1999 and No. 2/2000,
and the Executive Statutes promulgated by the Ministry of Finance by Decree No. 1367/1998.
The Law, as it is called, delegates the power to administer procurement, including contract
management, to the Competent Authority. Incasesjustifying limitedtenders or direct contracting,
a Competent Authority requires the authorization of the Prime Minister. The Executive Statues
interpret a Competent Authority to mean the concerned minister. Therefore, the concerned
minister is empowered to appoint the tender committees to open and to evaluate tenders, and to
approve the recommendations of the tender evaluation committees to award contracts. The Law
empowers a minister to delegate the authority to manage procurement to a direct subordinate
staff. No formal review of this law has been undertaken by the World Bank. There are, however,
a number of provisions in the Law, which would not be acceptable to the World Bank. These
issues would be best addressed under the framework of a Country Procurement Assessment
(CPA), which i s now planned for FY04. These issues, however, would not affect the execution of
the SDP.

The SDP i s a pilot project to experiment processes and procedures to better manage publicly-
funded demand-driven and competitively-based production processes training that would
stimulate private sector demand through a one-stop shopping for employers.

Cost-sharing demand-driven production processes training sub-projects will be managed (from
design to implementation) by Project Intermediaries (PIS), such as investors associations,
chambers of industries, federation of industries, and similar organizations. During negotiations,
an initial first year pilot operation of up to three PISwas identified based on criteria acceptable to
the Bank. The selection of PISfor this first year pilot was based on single source procedures for
the priority industrial sectors and areas identified where beneficiary SMEs are located. The
selection of subsequenttraining sub-project proposals shall be based on quality criteria submited
by eligible organizations in accordance with the sub-project criteria specified inthe Operational
Manual (OM). In such cases, the selection of PISwill also be based on single source procedures
for the specific sub-project area. PISshall meet the eligibility criteria specified in the OM.
EligiblePISshall at least: (a) be legally registered inEgypt as a non-profit organizationunder the
NGO law of 1964 and as amended; (b) have experience inmanaging training activities for SMEs
on both technical and soft skills; and (c) have capacity to managetraining programs financed on a
cost-sharedbasis.

The PIS,with the assistance of consultant(s), will formulate Training Sub-project proposals based
on cost-sharing demand-driven production processes training needs of participating small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Eligible Training Sub-projects shall: (a) support the provision
of training to SMEs, namely enterprises employing more than ten (10) but less than five hundred
(500) employees; (b) target employees whose work i s directly related to the production process
within the eligible Beneficiary Firm: (c) support Beneficiary Firms providing a contribution of at
least ten (10%) percent of the training costs; and (d) not finance any Training Sub-project

proposalexceedingUS$400,000 equivalent. Criteria for the design and implementation of these
Training Sub-projects i s given in the OM. The PI'S proposed Training Sub-projects will be
reviewed by the Project ManagementUnit (PMU) for considerationand approval of the Boardof
Trustees (BOT). Under this principle, the BOT will approve the overall program, and the PMU
will enter into implementation contracts with PIS,and manage the execution of such contracts.
Contracts entered into by the PMU and PISshall be govemed by the NGO law of 1964 as
amended, and terms andconditions specifiedinthe OM. The PISwill be fully responsiblefor the
execution of Training Sub-projects including cost-sharing agreements with participating SMEs
and sub-contracts with training providers selected inaccordancewith procedures specifiedin the
OM.

The MITD has entered into a cooperation agreement with the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) for providing bridge-financing assistance, for managing the recruitment of
the PMU staff, and for recruiting an accountingand auditing fmto develop and administer the
accountingandfinancial management systemfor the SDP.

Procurementat the PMU/BOT level will be managedby a Tender Committee (TC) appointedby
the MITD Minister and Chairpersonof the BOT or hisher designated authorizedrepresentative.
The TC will be responsiblefor openingtenders, evaluatingbids and issuingrecommendationsfor
contract award for approval by the chairman of the BOT or hisher designated authorized
representative. The PMU will provide administrative support to the TC in the process of
dischargingits duties. Criteria for the compositionof the TC will be provided for inthe OM. The
O M was discussed and agreed upon during negotiations and recorded in the minutes of loan
negotiations.

Use of BankGuidelines andStandardDocuments

Procurement of Goods will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement
under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits (World Bank, January 1995, RevisedJanuary and August
1996, September 1997andJanuary 1999). The Project will not include International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) and National Competitive Bidding(NCB). Procurement for Goods will consist of
small packages grouped, to the extent feasible, in sizes suitablefor procurement through national
shopping (NS) procedures in accordance with the guidelines of the Bank. The proposedproject
will not include procurement of works. The Bank's Standard BidEvaluation Form-Procurement
of Goods (April 1996) will not berequiredto be usedto evaluatebids.

The procurement of Services will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for the
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997, revised
September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002). The procurement of services will consist of: (i)
employment of consultant firms; (ii)   employment of individual consultants; and (iii)contracting
PISto implement training sub-projectsby sub-contractingpublicly- and privately-owned training
organizations. The consultancy services provided by firms would consist of short-term
assignments; the training contracts would consist of short-termcourses on-the-job and intraining
centers; andindividual consultantswould be retainedto provide short-termtechnical assistanceto
the PMU and PIS. However, there may be a few contracts with a value estimated at about
US$200,000.00 equivalentor greater, for which the StandardRequest for Proposals(RFP) for the
selectionof consultants (July 1997, revisedApril 1998 and July 1999) and the StandardFormof
Contracts would be used. For the selection process of firms, the Sample Form of Evaluation
Reportfor the Selectionof Consultants(October 1999) will be used.

Advertising

A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the United Nations Development
Business (UNDB) and Gateway, and in at least one newspaper of national circulation. The GPN
will provide a description of the Project and it will list all contracts for consultancy services
estimated at more than US$200,000.00 equivalent. The GPN will be updated annually for all
outstandingprocurement.

Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) for services with an estimated value above US$200,000
equivalent, and invitations for expressions of interest (EOI) will be advertised in UNDB and
Gateway and in at least one newspaper of national circulation. Invitations for EO1for services
below US$200,000 equivalent will be advertised locally.

ProcurementCapacity andImplementationArrangements

Currently the PMU i s staffed with an interim project director seconded by the Social Fund for
Development (SFD). The MITD has assigned interim counterpart staff who are experienced in
program management and with the help of consultants have drafted the OM, and are instrumental
inthe establishment of the PMU.The MITDhas entered into a cooperation agreement with the
UNDPunder which the UNDPis assistingwith the recruitmentof the PMUregular staff, and will
contract the services of an auditing fm to be responsible for the SDP accounting and financial
management. The UNDPwill also assist the SDP in the recruitment of the public awareness and
training needs assessment consultants that will provide support to the PISand participating
beneficiary SMEs in the formulation of the training proposals for the frrst year program. The
UNDP office in Egypt is familiar with World Bank procurement. However, it should be noted
that procurement to be carried out by UNDP, will not be funded by the Bank.

The SDP appraisal concluded that since regular PMUstaff are not yet on board, the qualifications
of the procurement staff and its familiarity with the Bank procurement guidelines and procedures
cannot be assessed. Also, considering the fact that procurement and contract management of
training providers under approved training subprojects will be done by PIS,who are not familiar
with the Bank procurement guidelines and procedures, the implementation of the SDP i s
considered relatively risky. However, the project includes mitigation provisions by providing
technical assistance to the PMU, the PISand SMEs. Also the PMU will be supported by a full-
time TVET expert consultant already hired through the French Cooperation Agreement provided
on a grant basis by the Government of France. Moreover, workshops will be conducted by
consultants to make training providers aware of the SDP requirements, and to provide guidance
on how to present proposals and execute the training contracts. Also, since most of the funds
under the SDP will be for funding training programs, to further reduce the risks, the first year
operations will be limited to three PIS.This approach will permit the development of modest-
sized manageable training programs to gradually build capacity at the PMU, the PIS,the SMEs
and participating training providers. Duringthe first year, a program of awareness, promotion and
outreach activities will be undertaken by the PMUwith the help of consultants to ensure adequate
resources are made available to the stakeholders to address implementation issues. A Mid-Term
Review (MTR) of the SDP will be carried out inthe early part of the second year, at which time
the stakeholders (PMU, PIS,SMEs, some training providers and the Bank) will take stock of the
lessonslearned inthe frrst year of the pilot operation.

During negotiations, agreement was reached on a plan of action to recruit prior to loan
effectiveness the PMUkey staff (Director, Procurement and Financial Management Specialists)
and the recruitment of an accounting fmfor SDPs financial management. These measures will


                                             41

ensure that the minimum PMU qualified administrative capacity on project management,
procurementand financial aspects are inplace by loaneffectiveness. Since the SDP i s designed to
test on an experimental basis the implementation mechanism through PIS,only a general Project
Implementation Plan (PIP) and the fust year procurement plan were discussed and agreed upon
duringnegotiations. The fust year procurement plan will include the contracting of: (i) fust the
three PIS;(ii)  consulting fm for the consultancy assignment for the awareness, promotion and
outreach services; and (iii)the auditor for the SDP. The PIP will be reviewed and updated during
the MTR. Duringnegotiations, agreement was reached on the selection process and timetable for
the first three PISand the scope of the corresponding training subprojects. The PIP and first year
procurement plan will be incorporated inthe SDP Operational Manual.

Procurementmethods (Table A)


Works.     The Project will not include procurement of Works. Therefore no provisions are
includedinthis section.

Goods.     Procurement of Goods would be limited to the purchase of a couple of vehicles,
computers and office equipment for the PMU. Such procurement would be in bid packages
costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount of about
US$200,000 equivalent. Therefore, this procurement would be subject to National Shopping
(NS) procedures, basedon comparingprice quotations obtained from at least three suppliers.

Services.    Services contracts include: (i)   short-term consultant firms for studies, technical
assistanceand conducting workshops; (ii)    individual consultants for technical assistance; and (iii)
project intermediaries for carrying out demand-driven cost-sharing production process training
for participating Sh4Es through training providers. For consulting services the Quality-Cost-
Based-Selection (QCBS) method and World Bank's StandardRFPwould be used. Single-Source
(SS) selection will be used only under exceptional circumstances, with the World Bank's prior
concurrence. Project intermediaries, may, with the Bank's prior approval, be procured in
accordance with single source procedures once the sub-project areas and beneficiary industries
are selected. The selection of priority areas and sectors will be basedon criteria as specified inthe
OM, and it will be based on the quality of the training sub-project proposals, the capacity and
experience (qualifications) of PISto carry out training programs, and PI'Sinterest inparticipating
in the SDP. Training providers, sub-contracted under PI training sub-project contracts, will be
procuredon the basis of the training needs assessments inthe subproject areas inaccordancewith
methods acceptableto the Bank (generally such methods will follow CQ and QBS methods, and,
to the extent feasible, by QCBS methods). For contracts with individual consultants, the Selection
of Individual Consultants method according to the World Bank's Guidelines would be used. For
consultancy services below US$200,000 equivalent the short list of consultants may comprise
entirely national consultants.

Frequency of procurement supervision missions proposed: One every 6 months (includes special
procurement supervision for post-review/audits)
A sample of each type of procurement of at least 10% of contracts under each Training Subproject
Agreements managed by PISwould be reviewed ex-post in accordance with the World Bank guidelines
and procedures. The timing of procurement post review missions will be determined by the progress in
project implementation as determined by the updated Project Procurement Plan included inthe quarterly
progress reports. The first year will require three missions to ensure proper implementation start-up
(project launching workshop) and familiarity of the PMUandPISstaff with World Bank's guidelines and
procedures. A Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission will be launched inthe early part of the second year to
review project implementation. During the MTR mission, a procurement assessment will take place to
decide whether the above arrangements will continue or if the procurement arrangements in the Loan
Agreement shouldbe amended.

 Thresholds generally differ by country and project. Consult OD 11.04 "Review of ProcurementDocumentation"
and contactthe RegionalProcurementAdviser for guidance.

 Useof statementsof expenditures(SOEs):
Withdrawals from the loan account may be madeon the basis of SOEs for expenditures for Training Sub-
projects each costing less than US$50,000 equivalent, under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower. All supporting documentation for SOEs, including copies of invoices
and bank statements, must be maintained by the PMU for at least one year from the date the Bank
receives the audit report for the fiscal year inwhich the last withdrawal fromthe loan account was made.
As part of the annual audit all records and documents must be made available for the review of the
external auditor and visiting supervision missions fromthe World Bankuponrequest.

 Specialaccount:
To facilitate project implementation and make timely payments of the Bank's share of eligible
expenditures to suppliers, consultants, and others, the Borrower will open and maintain a special account
in a commercial bank inEgypt, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The PMUwill manage
and have access to the SA. Disbursement will be made by the PMUdirectly from the SA. The authorized
allocation of the SA will be equal to six (6)months estimated expenditures, equivalent to US$ 600,000.
At the start of the project, the initial deposit to the SA will be limited to US$ 300,000. The remaining
amount of the authorized allocation may be requested only after cumulative disbursements reach the
equivalent of US$1,500,000. Requestsfor replenishment of the SA will be submitted on a monthly basis.
A bank statement of the SA and a reconciliation of the SA against the bank records will support the
replenishment applications. Replenishment of the SA will follow Bank procedures. There i s no minimum
amount applicable to replenishment requests (Withdrawal Applications), which will be submitted on a
monthly basis.

B.FinancialManagementAssessment Report

ExecutiveSummary andConclusion

An assessment of the financial management (FM) arrangements for the Project was undertaken inMarch
2003 to determine whether the FM arrangements for the Project are acceptable to the Bank. The
assessment concluded that the project's FMarrangements do not meet the Bank's minimumrequirements
and, therefore, an FM action plan was agreed with the borrower and the completion of the first two
actions were agreed at negotiations to be a condition of effectiveness (see schedulebelow).

A Consulting Firm(CF) will be appointed (TOR are included in the project file and the OM) that will
have overall responsibility for the Project's financial management (i.e., outsourcing the FMfunction) for
the first year of the project. The CF responsibilities will include: managing project funds, building of the
capacity of the PMU accounting staff, and working to strengthen the overall financial management
systems of the PMU. The CF will have overall financial management responsibility for the project
financial activities including disbursement and project financial reporting. As part of the backstopping
role, the CF will train staff of the PMU and Project Intermediaries (PI). The FM consultant will also
prepare the financial accounting manual that will document the accounting system and other financial
procedures to be usedto managethe financial resourcesunder the Project.

  Financial ManaPement Risks

  Country Financial Management Risks: ROSC draft report (2002), Mini-CFAA (1997), in-progress
  CFAA report (2003), and CPPR report (2002) identified major weaknesses in the Egyptian financial
  accountability, in both the public and the private sector. Also, there are two areas in the CAS (2001)
  that give indications of the inherent risk and these are to be found in the context of country economic
  development and public sector administration capacity.

  Proiect Financial Management Risk The project i s in the process of creating a PMU that will be
  responsible for project implementation. The Project i s relatively straightforward, however, good
  coordinationbetween different agencies, PIS,and various funding sources will be challenging. Below is
  a summary of the riskanalysis:

  3- Counter part funds are available on time and with       Unlike other Bankfunded projects inEgypt,
  no delays.                                                 local fundingi s not an issue for the SDP.




                        Weakness                                               Resolution
  1-Lack of experience withBankfunded projects at            Usingexperience of SFD (project director)
  MITD.                                                      and hiringexperienced consultants to handle

  2- Temporary arrangements for project implementation Capacity buildingof MITDand PMUstaff
  can be confusing and short-term innature.                  will be an integral part of the FCconsultant
                                                             scope of work.


RiskMitigationMeasures

To compensate for the above mentioned issues, a combination of "ring-fencing" the project, hiring a
competent and experienced financial management consultant to handle the FM function on temporary
basis, and close supervision by the Bank, especially during the temporary arrangements setup, will all
help reduce the level of risk to an acceptable level. The following risk mitigation measures have been
agreedupon with MITD:

1- A qualified financial management consultant (CF) is hired for 12 months and has commenced the
implementation of the financial management system (condition of effectiveness) to establish a sound
financial management and reporting systems within the PMU as all expenditures for the project will be
controlled and accountedfor by PMUinMITD.The consultant will assist the PMUinrecruiting qualified
and competent accounting staff, train hired staff on FMprinciples and Bank guidelines, release Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) on quarterly basis by the project, prepare timely withdrawal applications and
Statementsof Expenditures (SOES).

2-      Annual audit for the project will be handled by a private, qualified, and independent auditor. TOR
for the assignment will clearly reflect the project exact needs and nature. Also, annual SOEreviews will
be conducted by anotherexternal auditor to ensure that expenditures are accurateand inaccordanceto the
loan agreement.




                                                      50

3-       Close supervision by the Bank Country Office inEgypt consisting of quarterly missions (at least
inthe fust year of theproject) toreview workdoneby thefinancial managementconsultant, andtoensure
that the developed systemi s maintainedina consistent manner acceptableto the Bank. Also, identified
financial management riskswould be continually monitoredand evaluated and appropriate remedial
measureswill be taken duringthe Bank's supervision missions.

ProiectManagement and Coordination

Implementation of the Project will be undertaken by the Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU
would be responsible for the management of all project activities and implementation of a transparent
financial management system. The PMU will also be responsible for overall project financial
management and accounting. It will maintain books of accounts for the project, prepare and disseminate
financial statements and financial monitoring reports, and ensure timely submission of the audit report.
Cost-sharing demand-driven production process training subprojects will be managed (from design to
implementation) by PIS.Duringnegotiations, a process and work programfor an initial pilot operation of
up to three PISwas agreed based on criteria acceptable to the Bank. The PI'S proposed cost-sharing
demand-driven production process training subprojects will be reviewed by the PMU for consideration
and approval of the Board Of Trustees (BOT). Under this principle, the administration of expenditures
and procurement under the SDP will take place at two levels, at the PMU and BOT for overall program
implementation, and at the PI level, for the execution of cost-sharing demand-driven production process
training activities included inapproved training subprojects.

Flow of funds

To ensure that funds are readily available for the project implementation and to separate and not
commingle funds from various sources, a Special Account (SA) for IBRD funds, denominated in US
dollars, will be opened at a commercial bank inCairo, and it will be operated by the PMU. Deposits into,
and payments from the SA will be made in accordance with provisions in the Loan Agreement.
Withdrawal applications and replenishments of the SA will be prepared and sent by the PMUcarrying the
authorized signatures. Each withdrawal application will be signed by two authorized representatives.
Authorized signatories names and corresponding specimens of their signatures will be submitted to
IBRD. Initially, an advance of US$300,000 will be transferred to the special account upon effectiveness
of the loan and receipt by IBRD of an acceptable withdrawal application. Since a large number of
payments will be made in local currency, the equivalent amounts will be withdrawn from the SA on a
"just intime" basis so as to minimize exchangelosses.

To facilitate the process, for activities jointly financed by IBRD and GOE (based on stipulated
percentages in the L.A.), the PMU may utilize GOE counterpart funds to pay for the whole activity
amount (IBRD and GOE shares). In such cases, the PMU, on a monthly basis, will make a transfer of
funds fromIBRDSA to GOEbank account.

The PMU will ensure that training sub-projects are identified, appraised and submitted to the Bank for
review prior to approval by the BOT, andensure that appropriate contractual arrangements are made with
Project Intermediaries selected inaccordance with the provisions of the SDP Operational Manual for the
successful carrying out of sub-projects. Disbursements under training sub-project contracts will be in
accordancewith the terms of the contract as specified inthe SDP OperationalManual. The initialadvance
shall not exceed 20% of the contract amount funded by the SDP; and subsequent payments will be made
on a monthly basis in accordancewith the progress of work performed. The PMUwill be responsible for
monitoring and supervising the execution of training sub-project contracts, as well as for coordinating
implementation of all training subprojects. The PMUwill provide technical assistace to PISand training
providers in the various locations in order to ensure efficient execution of training subprojects.


                                                   51

Disbursements from PISto training providers under training contracts will be done as specified in the
operational manual. The initial advance under such contracts shall not exceed 20%, and subsequent
payments will bebased onprogress of work performed.



The PMUstaff (except for the interim project director) are not yet on board, and they may not be familiar
with Bank guidelines (financial management, procurement and disbursement). The CF will assist the
PMUindevelopingjob descriptions and inorganizing the PMUfor proper financial management.It will
strengthen the capacity of the PMU and will give recommendations on additional staff and skill mix as
needed.

AccountingSvstem

It is agreed that the Project accounting (cash basis) will cover all sources of project funds and all
utilization of said funds according to InternationalAccounting Standards. All project-related transactions
will be recorded inthe books of accounts, and supporting documents will be kept at the PMUlevel (audit
trail). Direct disbursements made by the Bank and from the SA will be includedinthe project accounting
system. Funds received from different sources (IBRD and GOE budget) would be identified separately
and reflectedinthe project accountsandFS.

The Project will have an accounting procedures manual which will outline: (i)accounting job
responsibilities within the PMU; (ii)      monthly, quarterly, and annually closing and reconciliation
procedures including SA, loan account, and SOEs; (iii)  accounting policies including those related to the
conversion from foreign currency to the local currency and authorization and payments system; (iv)
banking and cash procedures; (v) means of monitoring and reviewing financial transactions on the
Intermediaries level; and (vi) internal control guidelines that will cover financial management,
disbursement, and procurement.

Reporting

The P M U will be responsible for issuing quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR) and annual
Project Financial Statements (PFS) :
(0       Quarterly un-audited FMR. The format and content of the FMR, which will beproduced45 days
from eachquarter closing date, were determined as part of the project appraisal, to be agreed at
negotiations, and includedinthe financial managementmanual. FMR include financial, procurement, and
physicalprogress information. There should also be an introductory narrativediscussion of project
developments and progress duringthe quarter, to provide context to, and explanation of, information
reported inthe FMR.
(ii)     Annuallv audited PFS. audit report, submitted to the Bank within 6 months after the closing date
of the fiscal year, would have to include: (i)statement of sources and uses of funds indicating funds
                                             a
received from various sources; project expenditures, assets and liabilities; (ii)
                                                                               schedulesclassifying
project expenditures by components, category, and sectors; (iii) a SA reconciliationstatement; and (iv) a
statement of withdrawals made onthe basis of SOEs.



Annual audits for the Project will be conducted by independent private auditors acceptable to the Bank
and procured by the PMU through the Least-Cost Selection process shortly after loan effectiveness. The
cost of the audit will be financed from the proceeds of the loan. As the training subprojects will be
managed (from design to implementation) by PIS,the audit will be performed for the project as a whole


                                                    52

(Le., PMU and PIS).The audit report, accompanied by a management letter, will cover the project's
financial statements, reconciliation and use of the SA, use of direct payments, and withdrawal based on
SOEs. The report should be submitted by the PMUto the Bank by December 31 of each year (ie., no
later than six months following the closing of the fiscal year subject of the audit). The external audit
report should encompass all project activities under loan agreement and should be inaccordance with the
Bank auditing requirements and conducted according to Intemational Standards on Auditing.

Supervision Plan

Before effectiveness, the recruitment of the CF will be monitoredfor compliance with conditions for loan
effectiveness by the Bank's FMS.

After effectiveness, As required, a Bank-accredited FMS will assistinthe supervision process. The F M R s
for the Project will be reviewedon aregular basis by the Project FMS and the results or issues will be
followed upduringthe supervision missions. Financialaudit reports will be reviewedandissues
identified will be followed upby the FMS. Also, duringthe Bank's supervision missions, the Project's
financial management and disbursement arrangements(including a review of a sample of SOEs and
movements on the Special Account) will be reviewedto ensure compliance with the Bank's minimum
requirements andto develop the financial managementrating recently introducedto the Project Status
Report (PSR). The FMratings are due twice a year, Le., by the end of June andby the end of December.

Additional AnnexARABDraft Policy Statementon Employmentand WET Reform in Egypt
                    11:
                           REPUBLICOF EGYPT: SKILLS DEVELOPMENT


 1. Guidingprinciples

 This document provides a basis for launching a comprehensive strategy for reform of the Technical
 and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and Employment systems in Egypt that adheres to
 the new economic challenges, and hence sets a basis for a dialogue between the Government of Egypt
 and the donor community for cooperation inits implementation.

 The startingpoint i s the agreementamong all parties on the need to reformthe TVET systeminEgypt
 inorder to provide the country with a skilled workforce ready to meet the challenges of international
 markets in a context of lifelong learning.      This becomes relevant in the perspective of future
 developments, like the gradual implementation of the Association Agreement EU-Egypt and the
 preparation for the future Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade zone. The existing TVET system faces a
 number of important problems and there is common agreement among the Egyptian authorities, the
 private sector and the donors active inthe country on the needto undertake a systemic reform.

 TVET reform. This reformshouldtake as a startingpoint the role of TVET system inthe Egyptian
 economic and social context. On the one hand, it should place TVET in the Egyptian economic
 context as a tool for economic growth, increased productivity and competitiveness, particularly in a
 context of global markets. On the other, it should ensure the contribution of the TVET system to the
 social development of the country and to the objectives of poverty reduction, equal opportunities,
 social inclusion, access to employment and professional development perspectives for the individual.

 This double dimension (economic and social) of TVET reform can only be achieved by setting up a
 coherent strategy that encompasses common reform objectives for education, training and
 employment. Efforts are presently being undertaken by the Egyptian Government to reform different
 subsectors of the Qualification System in an independent way: basic and secondary education, higher
 education, employment and training. Given the specific character of TVET as a crossroad among
 these various subsectors, andinorder to achievethe objectives mentionedabove, it i s indispensable to
 build-upcoherenceamong these subsector strategies.

 Emulovment policv reform.         Unemployment i s of increasing concern to policymakers as the
 Government seeks to establish a National Employment Program to articulate a response. While
 economic growth and new private sectorjobs will play a central role inreducing unemployment, well
 designed public interventions can be instrumental in assisting the unemployed with job search
 assistance, temporary employment schemes and an adequate institutional framework facilitating
 labour mobility. In doing so, a careful balance needs to be established between new public
 interventions andthe cost effectiveness of suchinterventions.

 The present draft policy statement takes into account the existence of different policy documents
 produced at different levels and with a varying degree of endorsement tackling reforms in different
 subsectors linked to TVET. This i s the case of the Report of the "Education, Training and
 Employment Subcommittee", (ETES report, 3 August 2000), dealing mostly with training and
 employment reformobjectives or the recently launched "Employment and Training Strategy" (a set of
 emergency measures issued by the Government), as well as the various Declarations for Action
 subscribed by the educational authorities. Overall it can be said that there i s not a unique policy
 document that can be considered a national government strategy covering all sub-sectors linked to
 technical and vocational education and training. There i s need therefore to overcome this fragmented
 approach by articulating a statement of objectives and an overall national strategy integrating the
 various existing drives for reform.


                                               - 60 -

The Government recommends to lead and implement a comprehensive strategy for reform of the
TVET system. This reform will guaranteethe participation of all stakeholdersrelevant for the TVET
system. (Ministries and Government agencies, enterprises, economic sector organizations, employer
federations, labour unions, private training providers). At the same time, it will provide a common
framework for interventions by the donor community aiming at supporting indifferent ways concrete
aspects of this reform. The existence of a coherent strategy encompassing all the different sub-sectors
i s a guarantee for the added value of donor interventions, the complementarity among them and the
sustainability and efficiency of their operations. Interventions by donors may take the form of
separate programmes, providing they are coherent with the overall objectives and key issues set up in
the strategy. The Government of Egypt expresses its willingness to lead this process and to ensure
donor co-ordination.

2. PresentchallengesinTVET AND EMPLOYMENTinEgypt

2.1 TVET challenges. This section summarizes the main issues to be tackled by a reform of the
TVET system in Egypt. In general there is broad agreement among the Egyptian stakeholders and
international donors and experts on the diagnosis of the main weaknesses of the Egyptian TVET
system. The root problem i s the absence of a skilled workforce (particularly in skill levels 2 and 3)
that can successfully contribute to economic growth and social development, productivity and
competitiveness inaneconomy integrated to world markets. While the problems of the TVET system
are to a large extent related to problematic aspects of the overall education system, specific TVET
issues are the following:

             Non-uniform organization of the TVET system, with inherited involvement of many line
             Ministries with their own supply driven training infrastructures;
             Highinternal andexternal inefficiency; due to bureaucracy anduse of outdated curricula
             and equipment that are not kept with current industrypractices, inaddition to the inability
             of trainers to design coursesrelevant to market expectations.
             Internaldrive of the whole education system towards higher education, combined with a
             low status and low relevance of TVET. This leads to overproduction of higher education
             graduates. They lack practical skills and competencies and cannot fillvacancies onthe
             shop floor or inline managementpositions;
             Outdated occupational profiles, curricula, teaching methods, textbooks and equipment;
             imbalance between theory and practice; lack of practical work experience of teachers and
             instructors;
             Tensions between labour market and education objectives withinmany TVET
             institutions;
             Lack of involvement of the private sector ingovernance, fundingand delivery of TVET;
             Highvariation of output and qualification standardswith serious gapsbetween formal
             and real qualifications;
             Slow propensity to change of the VET system at large and the vicious circle of low
             quality, low efficiency, low esteemand low relevance;
             Companies are not built around a core of skilled workers andemployees (with all its
             consequencesfor competitiveness, quality and productivity);
             Little investment inupgrading staff qualification and enhancement incontinuing
             education and training;
             No established horizontal andvertical pathways between the different subsectors of the
             qualification system (e.g. frompreparatory schools to vocational trainingandback to
             higher levels of general education, from work experience back to vocational education
             and training or to general education, etc., access to education and training for school
             dropouts, etc.)
             There i s a scarcity of data and analysis to guide the TVET reformprocess;



                                                - 61 -

         0    The institutional framework of TVET i s extremely fragmented (many Ministries and
              agencies are involved), lacking co-ordinationand a visible leadership on the side of the
              Govemment,
         0    There i s a lack of transparency and cohesion among the formal, non-formal and informal
              VET systems,
         0    Donors' support to TVET has been large but concentrating mostly on subsector reform,
              creating "islands of excellence" but failing to provide a coherent support to a sectoral
              policy reform,
         0    Donors' activities have traditionally lacked co-ordination and complementarity.

2.2 Labour market policies. In this short-term the objective of the Government is to stabilise
unemployment, while promoting policies that will induce sustainable economic growth in the
medium-term. Key labour market issues are:

     Current structure and operations of the public employment service are outdated and geared
     towards a planned economy,
     Mismatchbetweenthe provision of practical and academic skills, andthe skills requirements of
     the productive sector,
     Restrictions on the use of privateemployment agencies,
     Lack of statistically sound labour market information, undeveloped counselling and employment
     services
     Inadequate legislativeframework

3. Key areadcomponentsof a nationalstrategyfor TVET reforminEgypt

The framework of a national strategy for TVET in Egypt should cover the full spectrum of relevant
education and training institutions: vocational preparatory, secondary vocational and technical
schools, vocational training centres, enterprises based training, private training institutions and
Middle Technical Institutes. Relevant actors would be the main Ministries responsible for these
institutions (MoE, MoH, MoIT, MoMP, etc.), as well as employers, trade unions and the private
sector (including private training providers). All these actors are relevant for the creation of cohesive
links and partnerships between TVET institutions and the private sector. Within these partnerships,
the involvement of the different groups of stakeholders (parents, students, teachers and trainers,
managers and administrators of TVET institutes, fm)should be foreseen. There i s a need to
integrate regional andlocaldimensions inthe framework of the national strategy.

Four main pillars can be identified as main components of the reform. They are interdependent and
complement each other. Each of these pillars encompassesa subset of key issues and measures to be
developed.

3.1.     Establishinga aualitv Qualification system fosteringthe principle of LifelongLearning.

The Lifelong Learning concept comes up as an answer to the need to keep updated knowledge and
skills in an international competitive economy within a context of rapid technological change. This
understanding has created a shift towards investment in human capital and in raising the participation
in education and training throughout working life. It also provides an answer to the social dimension
                                                - 62 -

by targeting the objectives of personal fulfilment, active citizenship, social inclusion and
employability/adaptability This message is relevant inthe Egyptian context, where the introduction
                            .
of vertical and horizontal pathways of integration between the different levels of skills and
qualifications within the TVET systemi s one of the key priorities to achieve a skilled workforce able
to answer the needs of the labour market. Within the context of lifelong learning the formal TVET
systemhas an important contribution to make.

Some basic elements for a quality TVET system inthis perspective would include:

         0   Buildinguppartnerships, notonly between decision-making levels (national, regional
             and local) but also between education providers (public and private) andthe industry and
             social partner representatives;
         0   Redefinition of basic skills, according to a national system of skills standardsand
             occupational classification (both under development at present inEgypt). This would
             include makinggeneral knowledgeand basic skills available to all types of education and
             training systems. This implies looking as well into the connections between the formal
             and non-formal learning systems. Non-formal education and training has to focus on
             ways of acquisitionof the core skills and specific skills neededinlabor market, as well as
             on certain skills where critical shortagescould be identified.
         0   Revision of the investment and financing mechanismsfor learning, especially in

             payingattention to groups with special needs, equality of opportunities for all citizens,
             increasing the internal coherence of the education systems, setting up of information and
             guidance services;
         0   Giving learning a higher profile, bothinterms of image and incentive. A special focus

         0   Introducingquality controlsystemsand indicators (standards), as well as feedback
             mechanisms on the performance of the system.

Supporting strategiesfor the introduction of these key elements would include:

         0   The setting up of a national systemof skills standards with the involvement of employers
             andtrade unions;

3.2 Establishinga TVETsvstemresuondingto labormarketneeds

The TVET system inEgypt needs to be much more responsive to the needs of the labor market. The
system has to accomplish the transition from supply to demand driven. However, further capacity
buildingis necessary for the private sector in order to empower it to be able to formulate skills and
training needs inan appropriate manner. Capacity buildingi s also neededto enable the private sector
to provide high quality trainers and practical training places. The private sector in Egypt needs to
develop its awarenessand involvement on the provision of market relevant training. At the same time,
relevant labor market information for skills needs identification needs to be further developed for
helping inmaking policy decisions inTVET reform.

A set of strategies aiming at improving the relevance of TVET towards the labour market would
include:

         0   Upgradingthe capacities of companies for elaborating training needs analysis and
             training plans, which are linked with the development plan of the enterprise;
         0   Creationof partnerships between TVET institutions andcompanies;
         0   Creationof incentives for the participation of companies intraining of youth and adults;
         0   Settingup in-service training programs as well as enterprise basedtraining for students;
         0   Fosteringthe participation of enterprises inthe elaboration of training programs;
         0   Supportingtraining and employment programs for staff facing lay-off (e.g. from public
             enterprisesbeingprivatized), and for retraining the unemployed.

Inthis context, a reform of the financing of training should take place: Training institutions should
become accountable to consumers of their services for the use of public financing and they should be
allowed to accept direct financing from firms and individuals. This process would include the setting
up of an accounting and cost framework for the whole TVET system (formal and non-formal), and
the elaboration of several options for more efficient funding (including more financial autonomy for
TVET institutions, a National Training Fund, tax incentives, employment and training subsidies
among others).

3.3      Establishingnewlegal, institutionalandgovernance frameworks for TVET institutions

The main objective under this heading would be to enlarge the autonomy of TVET institutions in
their functioning and the delivery of their services. TVET institutions in Egypt at various levels
suffer from a too centralized and rigid management model that i s not in accordance to the aspirations
of linking the TVET schools and centers to the labor market as well as to their local environment.
This reform would argue for a more flexible approach inthe relation between schools and centers and
their respective supervising authorities. This would allow the TVET institutions to generate their own
income, to define their institutional policy and to apply new management models, including the
participation of the private sector in the governance and the management of individual TVET
institutes and of the whole system.

A second objective would seek to improve the coherence and co-operation at local level between
TVET schools and Vocational Training Centers inlocal TVET networks. This would contribute to a
more efficient and flexible provision structure, it would facilitate an objective appreciation of quality
in training, and it would contribute to reducing the frictions between different institutions educating
and training for similar occupational profiles.

This process should be seen in connection with the creation of partnerships between the TVET
institutions and the private sector mentioned inthe two precedent sections. It would be dependent on
the development of a national qualification structure based on agreed standards as well as on the


                                               - 64 -

existence of adequate quality assurance mechanisms. It should have as a mid-term objective the
establishment of a legal framework that would regulate the adequatefunctioning of this new model.

3.4           Establishinglabor marketpoliciesthat enhancethe mobilitv oflabor

Government policies are confined to smaller scale and pilot project activities, in some cases still
dominated by the needs of a planned economy. Little i s known about the impact of many of these
programs on employment. To improve the relevance of training policies a set of strategies should
include:

         0   Employment and counseling services, including the preparation of guidelines for the
              operation of market oriented public and private employment services, the setting up of a
              reliable labor market information system, and the creation of occupational and career
             counseling services.
         0   Active labor market policies, which would provide cost-effective training services for the
              unemployed and redundant workers, and labor-intensive public works and community-
             basedprograms targeted to the poorest communities.
         0   Legislative issues: the legislativeframework shouldpromote the mobility of labor andthe
              creation of permanentjobs. Excessive reliance on low-wage, temporary labor has an
             inherent bias against the provision of skills for employees. Legislation should not impose
              restrictions on hiringand should encouragethe setting up of privateemployment
              services.

4. Tools for strategy implementation

The implementationof the strategies described inthe previous chapter requires some instruments that
can contribute to their development. Many of the reform measures described above would most
probably be launched as pilots. However, it i s appropriate to identify from the beginning the type of
processesthat will have to be put into place inmidand long term to create the conditions for the pilot
activities to have an impact on the overall sector reform. This section describes some of the processes
that would be necessaryto establish inparallel or as a result of the piloting of the reforms identified in
chapter 3.

         0    Setting UP of a policv formulationandmanagement structure, representingnational
              authorities at various levels (national, regional and local) including as well
             representativesfromeconomic sectors andemployers andlabor unions. This structure
              could take the form of a tripartite body and would be responsible for the necessary
             process of policy formulation that i s inherent to the reforms described above. At present
             this function i s attributed to the Supreme Council for Human ResourcesDevelopment
              (SCHRD). To cover the overallTVET sector, however, it would needto enlarge its
             participationto some Ministries that are presently not representedandto increase the
             representation of the private sector and social partners. This body would need advice and
             reliable data from adequate research and development institutes, an observatorv or
             similar sources.
         0   New legaland regulatory frameworks would be neededparticularly for issues such as
             the new institutionaland governance frameworks for TVET institutions, or the adoption
             of a nationalqualification system, national TVET standards, an occupational
             classification system and an accreditation procedure for public and privateTVET
             institutes.
         0   A new financial regulation, followingthe pilotingof alternative financing models such
             as school budgets and a NationalTraining Fund.
         0   A nationalcertificationand accreditation body, ensuring the standardization of
             qualification levels enabling provision and delivery by a multiplicity of training
             providers.

                                                  - 65 -

The international donors contributing in the development of the TVET policy statement reform,
together with the Government of Egypt, will discuss ways in which these programs are going to
contribute to the design andimplementationof this process.
