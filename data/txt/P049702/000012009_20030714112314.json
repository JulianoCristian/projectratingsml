Project components are as\n            follows: 1) the awareness program, and monitoring and\n            evaluation component will finance the provision of technical\n            advisory services to promote outreach programs; implement\n            monitoring and evaluation surveys, studies, and assessments;\n            enable beneficiary firms to undertake training needs\n            assessments, and plans; enable training providers to develop\n            training proposals; and enable project intermediaries to\n            develop aggregated training proposals. The project will\n            target initially three sectors of the economy -\n            manufacturing, construction, and tourism - and, the small-\n            and especially, medium-sized private sector enterprises\n            (SMEs), employer federations, business, and investor\n            associations in these sectors; 2) the training sub-projects\n            component will finance a demand-driven training program on a\n            cost-shared basis with beneficiary firms, and, strengthen\n            the institutional capacity of project intermediaries. The\n            program will be implemented for the benefit of small and\n            medium size enterprises, and related business organizations,\n            initially in the construction, manufacturing, and tourism\n            sectors. Short term (less than six months)\n            production-related training will be supported, particularly\n            in areas of in-service training, and training for\n            prospective employees; and, 3) Project management, and\n            monitoring and evaluation (M& E) component will finance\n            goods, and technical advisory services to strengthen the\n            institutional capacity of the Project Management Unit, and\n            conduct the monitoring and evaluation of the project's\n            inputs, processes and outputs. It includes staffing costs,\n            equipment, materials, and office space, as well as\n            consultant assistance to ensure effective operation, and\n            monitoring and evaluation."}, "docdt": "2003-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
