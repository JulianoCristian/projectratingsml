But this came\n            at a cost with the external debt reaching 79 percent of GDP\n            in 2009. During the last three years, the Republic of Serbia\n            has taken steps to improve its debt management capacity and\n            has been trying to find ways to gain access to new and\n            cheaper sources of funding with longer tenors. At the same\n            time, the country has been pushing forward with a wide\n            reform agenda, particularly aimed at improving the business\n            environment for the private sector and at making the\n            financial sector more stable and efficient."}, "docdt": "2011-02-22T01:34:00Z"}
