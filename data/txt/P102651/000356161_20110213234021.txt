            Serbia: Private and Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee

                            SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION*

                             Meeting of Executive Directors

                                    February 10, 2011


       The Executive Directors approved the IBRD Private and Financial Sector Policy
Based Guarantee (Report # 58222-YF, January 14, 2011) for the Republic of Serbia of up
to EUR 300 million (not to exceed the equivalent of USD 400 million) on the payment
terms and conditions set out in the President's Memorandum.

        Speakers expressed broad support for the reforms underpinning the Private and
Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee (PBG), noting it is consistent with the CPS and
CPS Progress Report for Serbia. Speakers appreciated that the PBG has been developed
in close cooperation with other development partners and commended Serbia for
continuing substantial structural reforms in spite of the crisis. Furthermore Executive
Directors endorsed the use of the policy based guarantee to assist client countries in their
efforts to reach out to international capital markets, to diversify their loan portfolio, and
to raise funds with longer tenors. Speakers urged Management to continue working
closely with the IMF given the importance of the agreed stand-by arrangements.
