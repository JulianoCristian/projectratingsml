                          LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

                                     REPUBLIC OF SERBIA
               PRIVATE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY BASED GUARANTEE

Borrower        Republic of Serbia

Implementing    The Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the Republic of Serbia will be responsible
Agency          for overall implementation of the proposed operation. Other key ministries
                and agencies responsible for implementation of the operation will include: the
                Ministry of Economy and Regional Development (MOERD), the Ministry of
                Justice (MoJ), the Privatization Agency (PA), the Deposit Insurance Agency
                (DIA), the National Bank of Serbia (NBS), and the Serbian Business
                Registers Agency (SBRA).


                IBRD policy based guarantee. The guarantee will cover the principal amount
Financing
                of a commercial bank borrowing of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding the
Data
                equivalent of US$400 million, with a six year bullet maturity on a non-
                accelerable basis. The exact Euro amount will be fixed using the exchange
                rate of the last day of the calendar month preceding the negotiation of the loan
                agreement.

                Procurement of the underlying commercial loan is being finalized; the tender
                has been completed and the Government of Serbia (GoS) has selected Société
                Générale. The transaction is contingent on the IBRD guarantee being in place
                at the time of signing. Following approval of the guarantee by the IBRD
                Board, and as per process established in the Public Debt Law, the Parliament
                of Serbia will ratify the Indemnity Agreement and adopt the Law authorizing
                the loan of Société Générale (see Annex 6 for details on the process and
                timeline).

                Terms of the commercial loan by Société Générale are as follows: six year
                bullet, interest rate equivalent to Euro swap rate plus 100bps, and 50bps
                arrangement fee.

                Standard IBRD guarantee fees would apply: a front end fee of 25 basis points
                and a guarantee fee of 50 basis points for the maturity of the guarantee.

Operation       The proposed Private and Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee
Type            (PFSPBG) is designed to support a program of assistance to the Republic of
                Serbia to remove obstacles to private sector led-growth.
                The IBRD Policy-based Guarantee of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding
                the equivalent of US$400 million will be used to enhance a borrowing
                transaction from the international loan market. The Guarantee will lead to
                improvements in pricing and tenor, and it will contribute to enhancing
                Serbia's further access to international financial markets.

                                              ii
                 The PFSPBG supports the following three pillars of the Government of
Main    Policy
                 Serbia (GoS) program:
Areas
                       (i) Enhancing business environment,
                       (ii) Strengthening financial discipline, and
                       (iii) Building a stable and more efficient financial sector.

                 Improved legal framework for corporate governance in place. Over the
Key Outcome
                 medium term, such a framework will support: (a) increased independence of
Indicators
                 the internal supervision body in Joint Stock Companies (JSCs); (b) increased
                 shareholders rights; (c) stronger role of non-executive and independent
                 members of the board; and (d) increased transparency of reporting.

                 New set of regulations in place reflecting: (a) the elimination of not less than
                 190 unnecessary regulations, and (b) the amendment of 25 regulations and 20
                 laws by the end of 2011. Implemented recommendations are to lead to annual
                 cost savings for businesses of at least EUR 120 million by end 2011.

                 Establishment of a comprehensive record of state support measures, including
                 subsidies and grants contributing to better expenditure management and more
                 transparency.

                 Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of the banking system maintained at the level
                 of at least 12 percent.

                 Bank resolution framework improved through the introduction of: (i) bridge
                 bank resolution on a closed bank basis for systemic banks; and (ii) financial
                 assistance in the form of grants, loans or guarantees based on a least cost test
                 performed by the DIA, and emergency funding arrangements for DIA.

                 Consolidation of the RoS holdings in banking sector: banks with majority
                 RoS ownership reduced from 4 to 2 by 2010.

Project          The objective of the PFSPBG is to support reforms in three policy areas: (i)
Development      enhancing business environment to encourage private sector investment; (ii)
Objective and    strengthening financial discipline with continued reform of the non private
Contribution     enterprise sector with a particular focus on bankruptcy; and (iii) building a
to CPS           stable and more efficient financial sector through continued restructuring of
                 state holdings in banking, enhancing crisis preparedness, supporting insurance
                 sector development, and promoting development of capital markets.
                 The proposed PFSPBG is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy
                 (CPS) and the CPS Progress Report. The envisaged reforms are also in line
                 with the GoS' aspiration to join the European Union (EU). PFSPBG
                 continues the successful reforms supported under the Private Financial
                 Development Policy Loan (PFDPL) I and II: the reforms proposed under the
                 originally planned PFDPL III form the basis for the PFSPBG.

                 Two sets of risk have been identified: macroeconomic and political.
Risks and
Risk
                 The residual macroeconomic risk is substantial. Serbia went into the financial
Mitigation
                                              iii
               crisis with a high current account deficit, aggravated by rapid foreign
               currency credit growth and large cross-border borrowing of domestic
               enterprises. An ongoing IMF program supports ambitious fiscal adjustment
               targets and requires significant external financial support and private sector
               debt rollover. Specific risks include:

               (i)    The global economic outlook, while improved, remains uncertain.
               Economic risks are partially mitigated by the multilateral support package
               including from the IMF enhanced stand-by arrangement of EUR 3 billion,
               developed in close cooperation with the proposed PFSPBG.

               (ii) Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces considerable balance of
               payments financing needs over the next few years. Risks are partially
               mitigated by Serbia's robust agenda of policy reform, and as above, also by
               the size of the multilateral support package.

               (iii) Potential vulnerabilities of the banking sector remain in the context of
               substantially reduced profitability and stable but high non-performing loans
               (NPLs). Mitigating factors include: (i) the high capitalization of the system,
               which can withstand the current level of NPLs, which are high but have
               stabilized in the past few months, (ii) the improvements in the bank
               resolution framework supported by the PFSPBG.

               The residual political risk is moderate. A coalition Government facing
               prospects of elections within a year and a half could be pressured to reduce
               the pace of reforms. Mitigating factors include: (i) the economic crisis that
               has highlighted the urgency of reform, and (ii) a national consensus on the
               need for progress towards EU membership. EU Council's decision to forward
               Serbia's application to the European Commission for an opinion has boosted
               Serbia's membership bid and the stability of coalition government.

    INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
                   PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
PROPOSED PRIVATE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY BASED GUARANTEE TO
                     THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA


                                        I. INTRODUCTION

1.     This program document describes the Private and Financial Sector Policy Based
Guarantee (PFSPBG) to the Republic of Serbia to support the Government's structural
reform program and mitigate the effects of the global economic crisis. The proposed policy
based guarantee (PBG) is of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding the equivalent of US$400
million. It will cover the principal amount of a commercial loan. The procurement process for
the lender to the Government of Serbia (GoS) is in an advanced stage--the lead arranger has
been selected by the GoS, and the respective law is scheduled to be submitted to the Parliament
for approval upon approval of the PFSPBG by the World Bank Board. More details on the
public procurement process of the lender and required steps are included in Annex 6.

2.       A policy based guarantee is proposed in light of Serbia's strong track record in
macro, structural and social policies, sustainable external financing plan, and coherent
borrowing strategy. After transition-related declines in GDP and following the armed conflicts
of the 1990s, Serbia restored macroeconomic stability over the past decade and achieved high
growth until 2008 on the back of structural reforms, although external debt levels reached 79
percent in 2009. During the last three years, the Republic of Serbia (RoS) has taken steps to
improve its debt management capacity. The latest debt management strategy calls for increased
dinar exposure in the medium term and for a diversification of sources of Euro funding in the
short term. The PFSPBG will assist the GoS gain access to new and cheaper sources of funding
with longer tenors. The PFSPBG underwrites the first international non-concessionary
borrowing of the Republic of Serbia. A more detailed analysis of how Serbia meets the
eligibility criteria for a policy based guarantee is presented in Section II.C.

3.      The objectives of the PFSPBG are to improve the business environment, strengthen
financial discipline in the non-private enterprise sector, and build a stable and more
efficient financial sector. The business environment pillar aims to: (i) simplify regulatory
requirements and compliance costs for business entry and operations; (ii) enhance corporate
governance, (iii) strengthen legal framework for competition, and (iv) improve enforcement of
court decisions and based on authentic documents. The financial discipline pillar supports: (i)
creation of a registry of regional development measures and incentives; and (ii) facilitation of the
resolution of socially owned enterprises. The financial sector pillar supports: (i) crisis
preparedness, including assessment of capital adequacy, enhancement of bank resolution
framework, and strengthening of deposit insurance payout functions; (ii) continued
restructuring/divestment of the GoS's holdings in the banking sector; (iii) improved insurance
sector regulation; and (iv) further capital market development.

4.     The use of an IBRD guarantee will help the GoS gain access to international
markets at lower costs and longer maturities. The proposed PFSPBG would allow Serbia to
issue a relatively sizable commercial debt (of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding the
equivalent of US$400 million) in a challenging environment and help GoS expand its existing

                                                 1
investor base. The design of the underlying financing and of the guarantee coverage has been
driven by the GoS need to match its debt (portfolio risk) management and reduce funding costs.
Procurement of the underlying commercial loan is being finalized; the tender has been completed
and the GoS has selected Société Générale. The transaction is contingent on the IBRD guarantee
being in place at the time of signing. Following approval of the guarantee by the IBRD Board,
and as per process established in the Public Debt Law, the Parliament of Serbia will ratify the
Indemnity Agreement and adopt the Law authorizing the loan of Société Générale (see Annex 6
for details on the process and timeline). The terms of the commercial loan offered by Société
Générale represent a significant improvement in interest rate charged for borrowing in hard
currency, considerably extend the maturity, and further the process of Serbia's full integration
into the international financial market. Furthermore, the GoS' status as a global borrower will be
solidified, which may lead to better terms for borrowing banks and companies in Serbia. The
benefits of a policy-based guarantee are discussed in more detail in Section II.

5.      The proposed operation is consistent with the FY08-FY11 Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) and FY09 CPS Progress Report for Serbia, and builds on successful
implementation of reforms supported by PFDPL1 and PFDPL2. The CPS supports three
GoS priorities: (i) private sector led growth to ensure income convergence with European levels;
(ii) increased opportunities and participation in growth; and (iii) management of emerging
environmental and disaster risks. The reform program in the PFSPBG focuses on (i) and (ii)
priorities. The CPS and CPS Progress Report envisaged support in the private and financial
sector through a series of three Private and Financial Development Policy Loans (PFDPL). In
the context of preparation of the third operation under the PFDPL series, the GoS has requested
to avail of an IBRD PBG rather than a loan. As a PBG is not a DPL option under OP 8.60
(Development Policy Lending) and a "Programmatic PBG" option does not exist under OP 14.25
(Guarantees), the PFDPL series has been terminated after PFDPL 2, and PFDPL 3 has been
transformed to a stand-alone PBG operation, with the same policy matrix as originally envisaged
in PFDPL 3.

   A. POLITICAL CONTEXT

6.      The past year featured a period of political stability although the aftermath of
international economic crisis is bringing new challenges. The government coalition remains
stable despite economic and political challenges. In the past two years it has handled a number
of difficult political issues (including the arrest of some of the International Criminal Tribunal
for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indictees and economic challenges resulting from the global
crisis. A number of positive international developments have provided comfort to the coalition
in the past year. These include the visa liberalization with EU, the joint EU-Serbia resolution on
Kosovo in the UN, and the unanimous decision of the EU Council to forward Serbia's
membership application to the European Commission for an opinion. Nevertheless, economic
hardships and popular discontent with certain structural reforms are becoming a significant
challenge. This combined with the prospects of parliamentary elections scheduled for early 2012
could lead to a slowdown in reforms. Kosovo continues to play an important role in external and
internal politics posing additional risks to the dynamic of Serbia's EU accession path.

    B. MACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Pre-crisis and crisis

7.      Serbia began its transition to a market economy late and under difficult
circumstances. Unlike in other transition economies, the 1990s was a lost decade for Serbia.
Although the country started the period relatively well-integrated with the world economy and
with higher living standards than many other transition economies, its economy was devastated
as a result of regional conflicts, international sanctions, and trade shocks stemming from the
break-up of the former Yugoslavia in 1991. These effects were compounded by delayed
transition and poor economic management. By 2000 recorded GDP had fallen to below one-half
of its 1989 level, while other central and eastern European countries had made significant
progress on the transition path.

8.     In January 2001, the new Government launched an ambitious reform program
aimed at reversing the legacy of the past through a rapid transition to a more market-
oriented economy, normalization of relations with foreign creditors, and integration with
regional, EU and world markets. Facing unsustainable fiscal and quasi-fiscal positions and
high inflation, the authorities tightened macroeconomic policies through a combination of
expenditure cuts and measures to increase revenues. In addition, the central bank stopped (to a
large extent) extending credits to the budget and to public enterprises. Fiscal balance was
achieved in 2004, as structural reforms began to have impact and expenditure commitments were
reduced, and a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP was achieved in 2005. Quasi-fiscal deficits were
also reduced significantly through improved budgeting, regularization of debt service, and
reforms to contain hidden losses in key sectors (such as energy).

9.      Strong stabilization efforts coupled with increased capital inflows (from new donor
support, remittances, foreign direct investment and re-monetization through the inflow of
foreign exchange assets previously held outside the banking system) supported a reduction
of annual inflation from 112 percent in 2000 to below 10 percent by 2003. Serbia started the
transition with a crushing public debt burden at more than 240 percent of GDP, a large part of
which was successfully restructured.1 The ratio of public debt to GDP declined from 115 percent
of GDP in 2001 to 33 percent in 2005. Gross foreign exchange reserves increased substantially
from less than US$1 billion in 2000 (covering just 1.4 months of imports of goods and services)
to over US$15 billion by 2009 (enough to cover around 9 months of imports of goods and
services). The economy was also successfully re-monetized as the ratio of broad money to GDP
increased from just 15 percent in 2000 to around 40 percent in 2007. Foreign currency deposits
of households, which were almost non-existent in 2000 (at US$50 million), rapidly increased to
around US$8.5 billion by end-2009 as confidence in the banking system returned and overall
macroeconomic stability improved. Foreign direct investment (FDI) increased from US$50
million in 2000 (0.6 percent of GDP) to an annual average of US$2.2 billion between 2003 and
2008 (an average annual 7.2 percent of GDP). See Table 1.

  The Paris Club Agreement of November 2001 involved, inter alia, a phased 66 percent reduction in the net present
value of commercial obligations and a rescheduling of the remaining stock over 22 years with a 6-year grace period.
In 2004, the Government also reached an agreement with the London Club of commercial creditors, which implied a
60 percent reduction in the net present value of the debt, and rescheduled the rest over the next twenty years, with
3.75 percent interest during the first five years, and 6.75 percent interest during the remaining fifteen years.

10.     The Serbian economy grew rapidly until 2008, fuelled by exports and domestic
demand, and significant economic reforms since 2000. GDP growth averaged 5.4 percent per
year during 2001-08, with exports growing at an average annual rate of around 30 percent, albeit
from a low base2. Output rose in real terms by nearly 50 percent between 2000 and 2008, as the
corporate sector started to post profits and the banking sector restructured. The supply response
also reflected increases in productivity and output in recently privatized and de novo firms, as
evidenced by the particularly rapid rates of output growth in precisely those sectors which
underwent extensive privatization (e.g., steel, cement, rubber, tobacco, dairy, sugar and banking)
or attracted foreign investors. About 80 percent of growth was attributed to non-tradable sectors
(financial, telecoms, retail).

11.    Economic growth helped improve social conditions, with poverty falling from 13.4
percent of the population in 2002 to 6.1 percent in 2008. This lifted about 500,000 people out
of poverty (before rising again with the onset of the global financial crisis).

12.     Strong economic growth was, however, accompanied by a widening external current
account deficit and increasing private sector debt in the period immediately preceding the
financial crisis. Although exports grew rapidly, imports grew even faster and the trade deficit
reached 22.8 percent of GDP in 2008. As a result, the external current account deficit sharply
increased, from 8.7 percent in 2005 to 18.3 percent in 2008. The deficit was driven by a
widening private sector savings-investment imbalance (it accounted for about 90 percent of the
deficit in 2008). Although until 2006 the external imbalances were financed largely by FDI,
2007-08 saw a rise in debt-financing. In addition, while the central bank tightened prudential
regulation on bank activity, many companies switched to direct foreign borrowing. Inflationary
pressures also reemerged in the run up to the crisis, driven primarily by supply side factors3.

13.     Although much of the external inbalance had a private origin, fiscal policies
contributed as well to the current account deficit with the general government balance
moving from a surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to a deficit of 2.5 percent in 2008.
Two ad hoc extraordinary pension increases in 2008 increased spending on pensions from 11.3
percent of GDP in 2007 to 13.8 percent in 2009. Large wage increases were also granted in this
period (e.g. wages of health workers were increased by 24 percent in real terms in 2007). In
parallel, revenues declined from 42.9 percent of GDP in 2005 to 40.9 percent in 2008, primarily
due to lower collection of VAT, excises and personal income tax. Capital revenues also
decreased sharply.

14.     In 2009, after the onset of the global financial crisis, the Serbian economy went into
recession as domestic (investment) demand contracted. GDP decreased by 3.1 percent in
2009, a relatively shallow decline compared to regional peers. This was driven by a 17.3 percent
decline in investment, while consumption dropped by 3.5 percent. The industrial output went
down by around 20 percent between mid-2008 to mid-2009. Unemployment increased from
14.0 percent to 17.4 percent in October 2009. The increase in the unemployment rate was
further aggravated by the transition dynamics; Serbia started its transition later than most other
regional peers, and some of the privatization related layoffs coincided with the onset of the crisis.
2
  The ratio of exports of goods and services to GDP increased from 20 percent in 2002 to 30 percent in 2008, still
low compared to regional peers.
3
  In 2007, for instance, higher prices of foods and agricultural products contributed to nearly 50 percent of total
inflation while oil products and electricity contributed to about 30 percent.

                                                        5
Exports fell by nearly 30 percent over the same period, while imports declined even more
sharply. The reduction in the trade deficit paired with strong unrecorded remittances resulted in
a sharp correction in the external current account deficit from 18.3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 6.9
percent in 2009. With decreased economic activity, and lower food and energy prices, inflation
pressures also receded (to about 4 percent).

15.     The authorities responded with a fiscal adjustment package, supported by the IMF.
The IMF approved a 15-month Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) for SDR 350.8 million, of a
precautionary nature in January 2009. Spending was contained by a range of expenditure
measures, including most potently a nominal wage and pension freeze, and cuts in subsidies and
capital expenditures. But revenues fell sharply, reflecting the contraction in aggregate demand
as well as lower collection of trade taxes in line with the implementation of the Stability and
Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU. As a result, the 2009 fiscal deficit increased to 4.3
percent of GDP. In May 2009, the IMF approved an augmented arrangement for SDR 2.6 billion
(around EUR 3 billion, or 10 percent of GDP). The program period was extended to 27 months
and the arrangement was made non-precautionary.

Recent Economic Developments

16.     The 2010 fiscal deficit target of 4.9 percent of GDP, a balanced response to
continued economic weakness and the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation, has been
met. Revenues as a share of GDP have fallen by a further 0.7 percent of GDP in 2010, while
expenditures have stabilized. A supplementary 2010 budget was approved by the Parliament in
November 2010. Revenues are roughly in line with projections and the deficit target in nominal
terms has remained unchanged since the initial budget. However, space created by
underspending on capital and interest was re-allocated to pressing priorities, including social
assistance programs. The deficit is financed through a combination of domestic and external
sources (including the EU and the World Bank budget support), with domestic financing
accounting for about 80 percent of the total (Table 4). Placement of T-bills has, however,
become increasingly difficult in 2010 owing to exchange rate volatility and increasing risk
premia following the Greek crisis; and commercial bank loans have become the major source of
deficit financing. This noted, Serbia has very recently managed to issue a first ever Euro-
indexed T-bills, in response to these pressures.

17.    Data for first three quarters of 2010 indicate that export-led economic recovery is
gaining momentum and GDP growth for 2010 is estimated to have reached 1.5 percent, but
unemployment remains high. Industrial output and exports have rebounded, and exports to the
EU have recovered to near pre-crisis levels. Key non-tradable sectors, however, remain
depressed, indicating a welcome re-balancing of Serbia's growth sources. The poverty rate, a
lagging indicator, has increased to 8.8 percent in the first half of 2010, thus reversing some of the
progress made in the pre-crisis years. Unemployment was recorded at 20.1 percent in April
2010.

18.    The nominal exchange rate has depreciated by about 40 percent and the real
exchange rate by about 20 percent since the beginning of the crisis, facilitating external
current account adjustment and boosting competitiveness. The exchange rate is currently
estimated to be slightly undervalued. While dinar depreciation has improved external price
competitiveness, it has also put pressure on corporate balance sheets (gross non-performing loans

                                                 6
(NPLs) as a share of total loans stood at 17.8 percent as of end-September 2010, up from 10.2
percent in September 2008). However, due to conservative pre-crisis provisioning requirements
by the National Bank of Serbia (NBS), banks are considered well-provisioned against credit risks
and able to absorb even a protracted corporate restructuring process.

19.     After narrowing, the external current account deficit is expected to have increased
slightly in 2010, while the trade deficit continues to fall. On the back of dinar devaluation,
merchandise exports rose by 20 percent year-on-year for the first nine months of 2010, outpacing
the 9 percent growth of imports and cutting the merchandise trade deficit by 5 percent year-on-
year. But owing mostly to a drop in unrecorded remittances, the current account deficit is
projected to rise this year. Combined with the weakening of capital and financial inflows, the
overall balance of payments is projected to be negative in 2010. Loans by foreign parent banks
to the private sector have declined most, driven by corporate sector cross border deleveraging.
FDI has held up moderately well, reaching 4.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and an estimated 3.4
percent of GDP in 2010 - in part due to receipts from privatizations completed in previous years.

20.     Monetary policy has been tightened after inflationary pressures resurfaced.
Inflation dropped from 14 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2008 to 4 percent in the first
half of 2010 as the economic activity contracted. However, since summer inflation has increased
rapidly, and at end-2010 it stands at 10.3 percent, partly owing to a recent spike in food prices
and exchange rate depreciation. The central bank is taking steps to counter further increases in
inflation expectations, and has increased the reference rate by 350bp since August.

21.    The banking system has weathered the external shocks well and foreign banks have
generally maintained their exposure to Serbia. Liquidity of the banking sector remains high
with the ratio of liquid assets to total assets at 25.1 percent in September 2010. Capitalization
remains strong, with the capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector at 20.1 percent as of end-
September 2010. While possible spillover effects from foreign parent banks (especially Greek)
to subsidiaries are a potential risk, so far banks have broadly maintained their exposures to
Serbia in the context of the Vienna initiative. Further, after a sharp drop and thanks also to the
Government's program of subsidized loans, credit activity is starting to pick up again. However,
the modest expansion in the private sector credit through the domestic banking system is almost
completely offset by the cross-border deleveraging of companies.4

22.     The Government is committed to implementation of the IMF arrangement. All end-
September 2010 quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets were met, although
inflation was marginally above the agreed limit. The IMF completed the Sixth Review of the
SBA with a Board meeting held on December 22, 2010, which has enabled Serbia to draw a
further EUR 370 million.

Medium-term macroeconomic outlook and debt sustainability

23.    Consistent with forecasts supported by the IMF arrangement, growth is projected to
accelerate to 5-5.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, and to rely increasingly on

 After increasing at a rate of more than EUR 1 billion per quarter from Q2 2007 to Q3 2008, the stock of cross
border loans decreased by approximately EUR 700 million in 2009 and by an additional EUR 410 million in first
half of 2010.

exports and investments. GDP is forecast to grow at 3 percent in 2011, thanks to a
reinvigorated tradable sector (Table 2). Consumption is projected to remain suppressed in 2011,
but will thereafter start expanding again (although more modestly than pre-crisis). Net exports
will drive growth in 2011, while consumption (in 2012) and investment (in 2013 and beyond) are
forecast to become the main drivers of growth in the medium term. On the back of the
significant exchange rate depreciation, and following 20 percent year-on-year export growth (in
euro terms) for the first nine months of 2010, merchandise exports5 are projected to grow by 13
percent in euro terms in 2011 and an ambitious 21 percent in 2012, while imports are forecast to
increase by 6 and 10 percent respectively (linked to increases in imports of energy and
intermediate goods). As a share of GDP, merchandise exports are forecast to gradually increase
from 25 percent of GDP in 2010 to around 31 percent in 2015 (still low compared to regional
peers). This will be supported by the fact that with the 40 percent nominal depreciation of the
currency in last two years, Serbia's economy has regained much of the price competitiveness that
it lost in the pre-crisis years. However, despite solid growth of GDP in the outer projection
years, the unemployment rate is forecast to improve only gradually from the current level of 20
percent, to about 15 percent by 2015.

24.     The projected recovery is ambitious and requires continued structural adjustment
consistent with the Government's reform program and the EU accession agenda, resulting
in a rebalancing of the economy away from consumption-led, to export-led growth. Post-
crisis growth is underpinned by higher exports and savings, with more modest consumption
growth.6 The domestic savings rate is ambitiously forecast to improve from 8.2 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 17.6 percent of GDP in 2015. About half of the projected improvement in the savings
rate will come from the increases in public sector savings, brought about mainly by moderation
in pensions and public sector wage spending. Increased savings of the public sector are
supported by the recently adopted Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL). Increased private
sector savings are underpinned by the improvements in the business environment and further
privatizations, which will gradually improve corporate productivity and profitability. The
reforms supported by the PFSPBG and preceding PFDPL series are at the center of this agenda.
The PFSPBG also supports financial sector reforms that should increase households' confidence
in the sector and should contribute to mobilizing retail savings. Additionally, re-establishing
Serbia as a viable investment destination for global companies will be important in rebalancing
the economy, as global companies bring access to markets that was lost during the 1990s. The
Government has recently taken an increasingly active approach in attracting foreign investments
in tradable sectors, for example through forming a joint venture with the FIAT car company.
However, these measures are just starting and the progress has been patchy. Yet, despite the
challenges, there is a broad political consensus that a shift to a new growth model is necessary,
as set out in the recently presented Government strategy, Serbia 2020.

25.     A return to the pre-crisis model of consumption-led growth would risk development
of an unsustainable external balance. If consumption were to return to pre-crisis levels,
external debt would start increasing again, driven by the further buildup of private sector debt.
In this scenario, external debt would likely be above 85 percent of GDP by 2015 and rising,

 Serbia's main exports are food and agricultural products, steel and metal products, and chemicals.

 As a share of GDP, consumption is forecast to gradually decrease from around 92 percent in 2010 to around 83
percent in 2015. About two thirds of this relative decrease will come from private sector and one third from public
sector.

potentially threatening external stability. With higher consumption, the tax to GDP ratio would
improve and the headline fiscal deficit would narrow, but the structural fiscal deficit would
remain elevated.

26.     Continued wage restraint and efforts to tighten monetary policy are needed to
contain inflation, although it is projected to remain elevated until 2011. CPI inflation is
projected to stay above the NBS target level, due to continuing high food prices, the pass through
of the large exchange rate depreciation, as well as increased inflationary expectations. The
central bank has indicated that it will further tighten monetary policy if needed, using all policy
tools available. The key to bringing inflation back to target will be to contain second round
spillover effects, particularly on wages. The proposed capping of the January 2011 indexation
adjustments for public wages and pensions will be helpful in this regard.

27.     Fiscal policy is anchored in the recently adopted FRL, which sets the medium-term
deficit target at 1 percent of GDP, and outlines wage and pension indexation formulae until
at least 2015. The FRL sets out numerical targets for the general government deficit over the
medium term, as well as a cap on the overall level of public debt (standing at 45 percent of GDP,
not including restitution liabilities that could potentially arise from the compensation for assets

                                                           9
confiscated after World War II). Government revenues are projected to gradually decline over
the medium term due to lower consumption and lower taxes on foreign trade. The structural
declines in revenues are projected to be offset through improvements in the capacity of the tax
administration as well as through further expenditure reforms. Expenditure reprioritization and a
reduction in current spending will remain necessary, especially given the Government's plans to
increase spending on infrastructure. Progress with structural public expenditure reforms in the
largest spending sectors (pensions, education, public wages) is critical in this regard, and is
supported by the Public Expenditure Development Policy Loan Series (PEDPL - see Section
IV.C). Nevertheless, the Government continues to face pressures from the labor unions over the
proposed pension reform.

28.     The planned 2011 budget deficit of approximately 140 billion dinars, or about 4.1
percent of GDP, is in line with FRL. Achieving the fiscal target will require tight control of
current spending, including moderating the indexation of public wages and pensions, as well as
constraining capital spending. Transfers to local governments are projected to only be slowly
restored to pre-crisis levels, and most subsidies will be frozen at their nominal 2010 level. The
cost of the credit support programs in the 2011 budget will be reduced considerably, including by
phasing out cash loans and curtailing the subsidy rate for liquidity loans.

29.     Telekom privatization proceeds (projected at about 4 percent of GDP) will likely
cover the major share of 2011 budget financing needs. There is a strong political
commitment and a consensus in the ruling coalition to go forward with the Telekom
privatization. Market prospects for this privatization appear very good as seven companies have
qualified for participation in a public tender for the sale.7 Bids have to be submitted by February
21, 2011 and will be opened by the end of February 2011. The process is expected to be
completed in the first half of 2011. In the unlikely event that the sale of Telekom Serbia does not
go ahead, the authorities plan to cover the shortfall through a Eurobond complemented by
additional borrowing from domestic banks and T-bill issuance. In this case Government's gross
financing needs would increase compared to the baseline by approximately 1 percentage point of
GDP throughout the forecast period. Public debt in 2015 would stand at around 37 percent of
GDP, compared to 33 percent of GDP in the baseline case. If necessary, further expenditure
restructuring would have to take place; the authorities have demonstrated their ability and
commitment to do this effectively in the context of the crisis.

Turkcell, VimpelCom and Weather investments.

30.    The external current account deficit is forecast to stabilize and remain in nominal
terms at the 2010 level. As mentioned earlier, robust performance of exports is forecast (on the
back of further structural reform, a competitive exchange rate, and progress towards EU
accession) and a gradual recovery of imports (aided by the adjustment in the exchange rate, as
well as slower growth in domestic consumption). Nevertheless, the external trade deficit is
projected to remain high, declining to 10.7 percent of GDP at the end of the forecasting period.
Despite these projected adjustments, Serbia still faces considerable balance of payments
financing needs.

31.    Serbia's external financing requirements will be high. Serbia's gross financing needs
amount to EUR 6.1 billion in 2010 and to EUR 8.2 billion in 2011 (Table 4). These financing
requirements are largely due to high private sector debt amortization. Accordingly, financing
needs are projected to be covered largely by private inflows. FDI inflows are expected to spike
in 2011, reflecting the privatization of Telekom Serbia, and projected to stabilize at about 4
percent of GDP annually afterwards. As corporate restructuring restores investor confidence,
other private external flows, mostly to enterprises, are also projected to resume. Disbursements
from international financial institutions (IFIs) and other multilaterals, including the IMF, the EU
and the Bank, will help assure that the program is fully financed.

32.     Foreign exchange reserves are forecast to remain at a comfortable level. Serbia's
reserve coverage continues to compare favorably to other emerging markets. Following a
decline in 2010, gross international reserves are expected to stabilize in 2011, and rise in the
outer years. As of October 2010, gross foreign exchange reserves are at a comfortable level, as
indicated by standard indicators (gross foreign reserves are enough to cover 8 months of imports
and the ratio of gross foreign reserves to M1 stands at 429 percent; ratio of gross foreign
exchange reserves to short term external debt plus medium and long term amortizations is
projected at 2.0 in 2010 and not falling below 1.7 throughout the forecast period).

    year. Stock at the end of the previous period. 4) Includes all other net financial flows, SDR allocations, and
    errors and omissions.

33.    Under the baseline scenario outlined, both external and public debt remain
sustainable. External debt is projected to gradually decline to 67 percent of GDP by 2015
(Table A.1). Similarly, public debt is forecast to decline after 2010 and fall to 34 percent of
GDP by 2015. Strong policies and structural reforms (including those supported by Bank
programs) will underlie higher growth rates and improved public and external balances,
underpinning the declining path of both external and public debt over the forecasting period.
Other debt and debt service indicators also do not point to immediate areas of concern (see
Annex 3. Debt Sustainability Analysis).

34.     Standardized debt stress tests, however, point to sizeable risks if some assumptions
do not materialize: the sustainability of Serbia's external debt depends on the performance
of growth and exports and the stability of the exchange rate. External debt does not stabilize
under scenarios in which exports and growth consistently underperform, thus underlining the
need for strong reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies. Also, there are risks from
exchange rate shocks. Real depreciation of 30 percent would bring the external debt to GDP
ratio to just over 110 percent. While the debt to GDP ratio declines afterwards, gross financing
needs remain elevated (Figure A. 1). However, further large real exchange rate depreciation is
considered unlikely. Serbia's public debt outlook is sensitive to underperformance of growth,
delays in fiscal consolidation, and exchange rate shocks. If the growth rate underperforms by
two percentage points annually over the forecast period, public debt reaches 48 percent by 2015
(Figure A. 2). Towards the end of the forecast period, gross financing needs in case of such a
growth rate shock would be some five percentage points of GDP higher than in the baseline

                                                         12
scenario. However, Serbia's track record under the IMF, the EU and the World Bank supported
programs and its macroeconomic and development policy programs provide comfort that the
policy mix will be adjusted to avoid such a scenario. With more than 70 percent of public debt
denominated in foreign currency, a real depreciation shock of 30 percent would initially push the
public debt to around 60 percent of GDP.8 Public debt would then gradually decline.

35.      Overall, Serbia's macroeconomic framework is adequate for this operation. Post
crisis, the economy will be geared towards a more sustainable growth paradigm. This will
require higher domestic savings and increased competitiveness. With respect to the latter,
continued progress in business environment reforms remains crucial to solidify Serbia's
rebalancing of growth sources. Enhanced competitiveness will also require investment in
infrastructure. To free up fiscal space to invest in infrastructure, privatization and financial
discipline of non-private enterprise will be important as will structural reforms in pensions and
public sector wages. In this regard, reducing pension spending (which is very large by any
measure) is particularly critical and draft legislation, which has been submitted to the Parliament,
is a step in the right direction.

36.     Still, considerable risks remain. The global economic outlook, while improved,
remains uncertain, which may result in slower export growth and lower capital flows (FDI and
portfolio). Spillovers from Euro area include risks of lower growth in Serbia's main trading
partners slowing Serbia's own growth and current account adjustment. In this scenario, external
debt would remain at around 75 percent of GDP throughout the forecast period (as opposed to
gradually decreasing in the baseline) and external financing needs would be higher by some 3
percent of GDP (for further details, see Annex 3). Further, lower growth could also cause the
public debt to move to a potentially unsustainable path. There are also risks of external
financing shortfalls, including to the envisaged telecom privatization. The external financing
outlook could also be impacted by increases in the country's risk premium due to external
shocks, including possibly a new round of euro-area periphery spillovers9. Under such scenarios,
macroeconomic policies will have to be adjusted with a greater focus on stabilization rather than
countercyclical policies. As the crisis has illustrated, the authorities are committed to act quickly
and decisively if the need for larger fiscal consolidation arises. Political challenges, including
opposition of some unions to the pension reform and potential backlash from prolonged public
sector wage freezes, could slow progress on the reform agenda. The 2012 elections are likely to
intensify spending pressures, although the FRL and creation of the Fiscal Council are aimed at
containing those pressures.




8
  Ministry of Finance's Budget Memorandum estimates that 1 percent depreciation of the nominal effective
exchange rate would increase the public debt to GDP ratio by 0.33 percentage points. Thus, nominal depreciation of
30 percent would increase the public debt to GDP ratio by 10 percentage points.
9
  Direct spillovers from the Greek crisis are likely to be limited. Greek banks account for about one sixth of Serbia's
banking sector, but they are well capitalized and liquid. Trade links with Greece are relatively minor, and although
Greece has been one of the largest investors in Serbia in the early years of the transition in 2008-2010 Greece
accounted for a small share of total FDIs. However, indirect channels (risk perception, interest rate spread and in
medium to long term EU accession skepticism) may present a problem.

   C. ELIGIBILITY FOR POLICY-BASED GUARANTEE

Criterion A: The country should have a strong track record of performance, and its structural,
social and macroeconomic policy package should be satisfactory.

37.    After transition-related declines in GDP and armed conflict in the 1990s, Serbia
restored macroeconomic stability over the past decade, achieving high growth until 2008.
Output has risen in real terms by nearly 50 percent since 2000, as the corporate sector started to
post profits and the banking sector was restructured. In US$ terms, GDP per capita has risen
from about US$2,000 in 2002 to just over US$5,800 in 2009.

38.     Growth was aided by stabilization measures introduced after 2000 that have
brought the hyper-inflation of the 1990s under control. The NBS scaled up its modeling and
forecasting capacity and introduced formal inflation targeting in 2009. Improvements have also
been made in communicating with the public and increasing the transparency of monetary
policy, including through a regular quarterly Inflation Report, which discusses the achievement
of the inflation target, expected inflation outturns and the underlying macroeconomic
developments, as well as monetary policy measures to be taken in order to achieve inflation
targets in the future.

39.     Structural reforms in the public enterprise and financial sector played a crucial role
in boosting growth. Between 2000 and 2008, Serbia privatized more than 2,400 companies.
This generated nearly Euro 2.9 billion in privatization and unlocked important assets in the
country, and substantially reduced the demand for subsidies. In addition, significant strides have
been made in business climate reforms, and gains are particularly evident in the time and cost
required to start a business. More recently, a comprehensive regulatory review was completed.
In this context, 2,000 laws and regulations impacting economic activities were reviewed, 196
regulations were abolished, and 20 regulations and 10 laws were amended. It is estimated that
will result in annual cost savings to businesses of around EUR 50.8 million (see Box 2 for a
description of how this costs savings have been calculated).

40.     In the same period reforms were implemented in the financial sector. The reform of
the banking sector revolved around the closure of large unviable public banks and the entry of
Western European groups, which currently dominate the market. The state share in banking
sector assets was reduced to 18.51 percent as of Q3 2010. In parallel, a new regulatory regime
compliant with international standards was introduced. As a result, the banking sector deepened
and intermediation increased. The insurance sector was also consolidated and became
predominantly privately owned, thanks to better regulations and enforcement and the
privatization of a large insurance company.

41.    A series of tax reforms since 2001 (including the introduction of VAT in 2005) has
strengthened the revenue base. The highly complex and inefficient tax system inherited from
ex-Yugoslavia, characterized by numerous levies, widespread exemptions, and high tax rates,
has been transformed into a fairly modern tax system.

42.    Public sector reforms included improved public expenditure and debt management.
A new Budget System Law (BSL) was adopted in 2009, which established medium term
spending ceilings for budget beneficiaries. BSL amendments from 2010 have further

                                               14
strengthened the basis for introducing a three year medium term fiscal framework as well as
introducing FRL provisions and establishing an independent Fiscal Council. A new Law on
Public Procurement was adopted in 2008. Starting later than the other ex-Yugoslav republics,
Serbia now has a treasury system with all elements of a modern treasury that is organized around
the concept of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). The TSA records all government operations in
a ledger system and provides controls on the speed at which budget users can execute their
budgets. A modernized treasury system, providing treasury services for all budget beneficiaries
through a comprehensive TSA system, has led to improvements in the control and auditing
environment for Serbia. Following the establishment of the Supreme Audit Institution, a first
external audit was prepared of the 2008 budget. As a result of these improvements, the draft
public expenditure and fiscal accountability (PEFA) review completed by the Government in
2010 shows improved scores in budget execution and auditing.

43.     The Government has made progress in implementing pension reforms, improving
fiscal sustainability while maximizing poverty alleviation effects. In the face of substantial
fiscal imbalances in the pension system, a series of reforms with wide ranging parametric
changes were implemented in 2001 and 2005. Nevertheless pensions remain the single largest
spending item also on the back of two large ad hoc pension increases in 2008. A reform law
(supported by PEDPL2), which lays the basis for a third round of pension reform, has been
adopted by the Parliament in late December 2010. This should help move the system further
towards long run sustainability including through parametric reforms tightening early retirement
rules and limiting extra service credits and through new pension indexation arrangements.

44.     A well-targeted social assistance program has been put in place through a series of
legislative and institutional reforms. The Material Support for Low Income Households
(MOP), the primary poverty reduction program, has over 60 percent of benefits going to families
in the poorest quintile and the extreme poor.10 Coverage is an issue however with only 6.4
percent of the poorest quintile and 40 percent of the extreme poor receiving benefits from the
MOP program (LSMS, 2007), and a new law at an advanced stage of preparation (supported by
PEDPL2) aims to scale up the MOP to cover a higher share of the poor. Proposed changes
include (i) increases in the benefits paid to multi-member households/families; and (ii) a 20
percent higher MOP for certain vulnerable groups (including where no household members are
capable of work and single parent families).

45.    Governance indicators for Serbia also continue to improve, although from a low
base, particularly perceptions of strengthened rule of law, government effectiveness and
control of corruption (see Table 5). The WBI rule of law indicator shows for instance that
Serbia's ranking has improved from a 19th percentile rank in 2003 (meaning that 19 percent of
countries were below Serbia) to a 42nd percentile rank in 2009 (meaning that 42 percent of
countries were below Serbia). BEEPS data provide a generally similar picture; for example, the
number of firms reporting that bribes in courts are frequent fell from 22 percent in 2005 to 9
percent in 2008.




10
  The 2006 HBS does not single out household/family income from the MOP. For that reason, a proxy (broader)
social benefit income category has been used to assess the coverage and targeting of the MOP, and the data should
be treated with some caution.

Criterion B: The country should have sustainable external financing plan.

46.     At nearly 80 percent of GDP, Serbia has a high outstanding external debt stock and
external financing requirements will remain high. According to the IMF projections under
the SBA, high financing requirements are mostly due to private sector debt amortization
requirements and accordingly financing needs are projected to be covered largely by private
inflows, in particular flows to the corporate sector. Medium and long term borrowing to the
corporate sector amounted to around 13 percent of GDP in 2006-08, but then dropped to well
below 10 percent in 2009-10. As the economy gains momentum and companies rebuild their
balance sheets, it is forecast that these flows will recover and by 2012 reach around 12 percent of
GDP. This would be facilitated by the EU accession process; as the country moves closer to the
EU and companies integrate with EU markets, new lending to the corporate sector is forecast to
pick up. FDI is also forecast to increase gradually, with a spike in 2011 reflecting the Telekom
privatization. Disbursements from IFIs and other multilaterals, including the IMF, the EU and
the Bank, will help assure that the program is fully financed.

47.     During the last three years, the Republic of Serbia has taken steps to improve its
debt management capacity. In spring 2008, a debt management strategy was developed,
focusing on the need to increase the dinar portion of the government debt, which at that time
amounted to only 3 percent of the debt portfolio. In September 2009, an important
organizational change was undertaken by establishment of a designated debt management
agency (the Public Debt Management Authority - PDMA). Serbia has now a government entity
with around 20 staff members that is solely focused on debt management. Among its priorities
during its first year has been to make the present debt management system (TRASSET) fully
operational, to prepare procedures manual for the main debt management activities, to issue
more dinar-denominated securities in the local market, and to update the debt management
strategy.

48.    The strategy prepared by PDMA is more comprehensive than the earlier strategy.
On the foreign currency exposure (87 percent at the beginning of 2010), the strategy for the
upcoming 3-year period is to increase issuance of dinar-denominated securities in the domestic
market. If, however, the exchange rate volatility, particularly the dinar depreciation against the
euro, continues, the exit strategy is additional borrowing in foreign currencies, preferably long-
term euro. On the interest rate risk, the present interest rate structure with 76 percent fixed and
24 percent with variable interest rates should remain.

49.    The country's external financing needs are summarized in Table 3. Access to
external financing is helping the Government continue its reform agenda and maintain social
programs aimed at protecting vulnerable groups. With the implementation of further structural

                                                 16
reforms and renewed growth, Serbia is expected to meet its financing needs through a blend of
domestic and foreign financing. Despite the adjustments, Serbia still faces large balance of
payments financing needs. Serbia's gross financing needs in 2010 amount to 6.2 billion euro and
to 8.2 billion euro in 2011 (Table 4).

Criterion C: The country should have a coherent borrowing strategy, which will enable it to
become a borrower in its own name without a guarantee in the medium term.

50.     Forty percent of Serbia's public debt is not on commercial terms. The remainder is
characterized by short maturities and is predominantly denominated in foreign currency.
Serbia's concessionary debt is either owed to IFIs or is related to frozen foreign currency
deposits; to compensate citizens of Serbia for the loss of foreign deposits in the 1990s, the GoS
issued certificates of deposits with long maturities and a nominal rate of around 2 percent.
Commercial debt of the GoS includes short term securities, i.e. up to 24 months, and borrowing
from commercial banks with an average life of three years. The bulk of Serbia's debt is still
denominated in foreign currency (72 percent in 2010), although this has been declining over time
(foreign denominated debt accounted for 89 percent in 2002).

51.     The GoS has never accessed international markets independently. Serbia did borrow
once, but as Serbia and Montenegro, in 2005, with the issuance of US$1 billion 20-year
Eurobond designed to exchange old London Club debt. However, this bond is currently thinly
traded in markets, and it yields roughly 7 percent, with somewhat limited volatility. Otherwise,
the GoS has tapped only the local capital market and the domestic banking sector, the latter
primarily through club loans. Borrowing heavily from local market sources, banks in particular,
has increased the risk of collusion among financial actors. Moreover, reliance on local markets
may lead to some crowding out of the corporate and household sectors in the context of more
deleveraging by subsidiaries of international banks operating in Serbia.

52.     To improve its debt management capacity, the GoS approved a medium-term debt
management strategy and created a debt management agency. The strategy, which covered
the years 2009-2011, was included in the Budget Memorandum. The main objective of the
original strategy was to increase the share of government debt denominated in local currency.
This objective was to be reached in two stages. In a first phase, dinar-denominated securities
would be issued only for short-term liquidity financing, while long-term securities in dinars
would be considered in the medium-term once the dinar-euro interest rate spread had declined.
The establishment of the PDMA in 2009 strengthened the institutional framework for
government debt management. The PDMA is now fully staffed with 23 officials. Its priorities
are enhancement of the debt management system, preparation of a procedures manual, and
issuance of more dinar-denominated securities in the local market.

53.    Subsequent debt strategies were more comprehensive. Increased dinar exposure in
the medium-term was complemented by aims to diversify Euro sources in the shorter-term. The
updated strategy for 2010-2012 continued to focus on increasing local currency exposure in the
medium term. In addition, the 2011-2013 strategy aims to access new sources of financing in
global markets, specifically Euro-denominated debt, in an effort to reduce the interest paid and
lengthen the maturity of the debt.



                                               17
54.      The design of the financing underlying the IBRD guarantee and the coverage of the
latter has been driven by the GoS needs to match its debt (portfolio risk) management and
reduce funding costs. The latter drove the selection of the financing underlying the guarantee
(i.e. loan rather than a bond), while both considerations guided the design of the guarantee (i.e.
100 percent coverage of the principal and 6 year bullet repayment for the commercial loan). The
need to match the existing debt (portfolio risk) management is particularly relevant, as the GoS
plans to use a considerable portion of the financing to repay exiting and maturing debt.

55.     Market soundings indicated that the IBRD guarantee added more economic value
when combined with a commercial loan than with a public bond offering. Market
indications suggested that the guaranteed loan transaction could be arranged at 100bp-200bp
lower cost than an equally guaranteed bond. While both structures could generate savings
compared to non-guaranteed structure, the guaranteed loan format could create US$15-25
million in additional net present value savings for the Republic of Serbia. This can in part be
explained by the fact that the investor base for emerging market bonds has difficulty pricing
disparate blends of borrower risk (i.e. Republic of Serbia and IBRD risks), which reduces ability
to trade such an instrument. Conversely, loan markets may price the transaction more favorably,
because the IBRD guarantee substantially reduces the capital that the commercial bank needs to
allocate against the loan.

56.     Following a procurement process, the GoS has finalized the selection of a
commercial lender which is Société Générale. The GoS issued the Request for Proposals on
October 29, 2010, inviting interested international and local financial institutions to submit bids
for the transaction supported by the PFSPBG. Proposals from the following banks were received
by December 21, 2010, the closing date: Credit Swiss, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JP
Morgan, Raiffeisen, Societe Generale, Citi-HSBC, and Banca Intesa-Banca Infrastruturre
Innovazione e Sviluppo. The GoS has approved Société Générale, as the winning bidder, on
January 10, 2011. The interest rate offered by Société Générale on the 6 year bullet loan is
equivalent to Euro swap rate plus 100bps with a 50 bps arrangement fee. Details on the public
procurement process of the lender and required steps are included in Annex 6. The proposed
guarantee term-sheet (see Annex 4) has been provided to the bidders.

57.     The PFSPBG will help the GoS gain access to international markets at lower costs
and longer maturities. The terms offered by Société Générale represent a significant
improvement in interest rate charged for borrowing in hard currency and most importantly in the
extension of maturity. Figure 1 below compares the cost of borrowing of EUR 300 million from
local banks with no guarantee and from Société Générale with the proposed IBRD guarantee.
The longer term maturity will strengthen Serbia's debt portfolio by reducing refinancing risks,
particularly given uncertain financial markets conditions in the near term.

58.     The PFSPBG would also enable Serbia to expand its investor base. In the medium
terms it will likely reduce borrowing costs for the GoS and domestic entities. By
establishing itself as a global borrower, future market borrowing by the GoS may occur at
increasingly improved terms, with integration into markets strengthened and relationship with
lenders solidified. The expected terms of the transactions should also bear positive signaling
effects to markets about the GoS access to alternative sources of financing, which may reduce
the perceived credit risk over time. Corporate credit risk is intimately tied to sovereign credit
risk, which provides a ceiling for private sector borrowers. Gains in creditworthiness at the
sovereign level generally create tangible gains for corporate borrowers in these markets.


    D. RECENT BANKING SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS

59.     The Serbian banking sector has grown significantly in the past few years. Banking
sector assets accounted for 80.6 percent of GDP in September 2010 compared to 52 percent in
2005. In the same period, and through privatization, the share of majority state owned banks
declined substantially. In Q3 2010 majority state-owned banks' share had decreased to 1.9
percent. In addition to majority state-owned banks, the RoS has significant stake in five banks.
These include two banks in which the EBRD, the IFC and the state constitute the majority
shareholder (11.71 percent of market share), and three banks in which the state alone holds
around 20-30 percent (4.87 percent of market shares). Foreign ownership stood at 73.51 percent
of the assets in 2010 Q3, with the subsidiaries of Austrian, Greek and Italian banks within the top
five banks in the country in terms of assets. Banks from these three countries combined have
57.2 percent of market share, with French and German banks also among the top 12 banks. Most
of the local private banks tend to be specialized in specific geographic regions, type of clients, or
sectors.

                                                              19
60.     The banking system has weathered the global financial crisis, although not without
costs. Confidence in the banking sector was affected, reflected in a withdrawal of 18 percent of
household deposits from banks in late 2008 and early 2009. Nonetheless, a conservative
regulatory approach had left the banking system with capital and liquidity buffers large enough
to withstand these shocks. Confidence was restored through a coordinated response by the NBS
and the GoS, in close cooperation with the banking community, IFIs, and the European Union,
under the so-called Vienna initiative (more details on the authorities policy response to the crisis
are included in Section III C). As a result, the deposits currently stand at over EUR 6.2 billion
and exceed the pre-crisis levels.

61.     Turbulence in Greece has not had a noticeable impact on the Serbian banking
sector. There are four subsidiaries of Greek banks operating in Serbia: Alpha, EFG, Piraeus and
Vojvodjanska (NBG), which account for 15.37 percent of total banking sector assets and 16.68
percent of total deposits as of September 2010. Spillover of the Greek crisis to Greeks'
subsidiaries in Serbia could happen through liquidity withdrawal by the parent or depositor
panic. As far as liquidity is concerned, the subsidiaries do not depend on their parents for
funding, except for one. While depositors panic cannot be ruled out for the future, the banking
sector has remained stable. Moreover, the recent recapitalization of NBG group and the presence
of an IMF program in Greece with a banking recapitalization fund should provide comfort.

62.    The slowdown of the real economy has impacted the banking sector via credit
contraction and declining asset quality. Both contributed to falling profitability. The
growth of credit to the private sector has declined sharply (in Euro terms) in 2009. This trend
has been reversed albeit gradually in the early 2010 (see Figure 2). Gross NPLs have stabilized
in recent months at 17.8 percent (September 2010). As a result, the profitability of the banking
system has dropped significantly; the return on equity (ROE) fell by 50 percent between
September 2008 and September 2010 (see Figure 3).

63.      Although the banking sector is well capitalized and liquid, declining asset quality
and falling profitability are key risks. As of September 2010, the aggregate CAR was 20.1
percent and the banking system's liquid assets covered 40 percent of short term liabilities. While
the sector has enough cushion to withstand the current rate of NPLs, an increase could pose a
risk to the solvency of the system.

64.     As the situation in the banking sector stabilizes, the authorities are unwinding crisis
arrangements. Under the Vienna initiative, parent banks committed in 2008 to maintain their
exposure to Serbia unchanged from pre-crisis level. In 2009 the initiative was renewed for
another year and banks committed to maintain an exposure equivalent to 80 percent of pre-crisis
levels. The initiative ended in December 2010. The level of the NBS reserves and the recently
enhanced liquidity framework should provide the authorities with the necessary tools to
intervene, if necessary. As credit growth has started picking up again, the Government's interest
rate subsidy program for liquidity and investment loans for private companies has been
discontinued at the end of 2010.11


11
  To support credit growth, the GoS launched an interest rate subsidy program for liquidity and investment loans for
private companies. The program is administered through private banks. The loan subsidy amounted to 5 percent
with a maximum allowable interest rate under the program of 8 percent on FX loans. The total disbursed amount in
2010 has been EUR 1.5 bn through end-October. FX liquidity loans were discontinued in favor of dinar liquidity

65.     To boost profitability and support credit growth, the NBS has been decreasing
required reserves on FX liabilities. Due to the high level of Euroization, which makes
monetary policy less effective, the NBS has been using the reserves on FX liabilities to limit
credit expansion in the pre-crisis period. This contributed to the reduction in bank profitability in
the context of weak asset growth and rising NPLs. In response to this trend and to the
contraction in credit, the NBS has lowered required reserves to 25 percent for foreign currency
loans (5 percent for RSD), compared to 45 percent (and 10 percent for RSD) before the crisis.

                               III. THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

66.     The GoS has put private sector development at the center of its strategy to promote
growth and income convergence with European levels. To increase the private sector
contribution to growth, the GoS has implemented a series of policy measures to increase
productivity and investment rates. This included upgrading physical infrastructure (especially
the road network), improving the business environment and the quality of infrastructure,
privatizing non-private enterprises, and promoting financial sector policies aimed at increasing
efficient intermediation.     These measures should increase the productivity and the
competitiveness of the private sector, crucial factors in boosting exports. Given the small size of
the economy, the GoS has also actively promoted FDIs.

67.      Business environment improvements, financial discipline/divestment of non-private
enterprises, and financial sector development are at the core of the GoS' growth agenda.
To promote private sector led growth the GoS is committed to: (i) decrease the cost of doing
business, (ii) improve fiscal discipline in the non-private enterprise sector by reducing the GoS
direct ownership in the economy and free up fiscal resources for needed public investment, and
(iii) divest state holdings in the financial sector, enhance the regulatory and bank resolution
framework, and promote development of the non-banking financial sector.

68.      Reforms described in this section have been supported by the preceding PFDPL
series as well as by the proposed PFSPBG. Key reforms supported by the PFDPL series are
listed in the Box 1 below; in turn these reforms build on previous budget support operations that
the GoS has implemented successfully since the early 2000s (see a summary in Section IV.C). A
description of the policy actions underpinning the proposed PFSPBG is presented in Section V.A
and Section V.B.

loans in May 2010. The share of credit support programs in total fresh lending was 17 percent in the period
January-August 2010.

                                                    21
                          Box 1: Key reforms supported by PFDPL 1 and 2
PFDPL 1:
 Adoption of a GoS decision on the commencement of a review of regulations of business activities
 Enactment of amendments to the Privatization Law that sets a time limit for the completion of the process
 Continuation of privatization of SOEs ­ as a result some 300 socially owned enterprises were sold
 Capitalization of the DIF
 Privatization of DDOR.

PFDPL2:
 Adoption of the Law on Protection of Competition, Law on Bankruptcy, Law on Control of State Aid
 Sale of residual shares of 39 socially owned enterprises, thus completing the privatization of the same (*)
 Diagnostic assessment of all the banks in the system
 Adoption by the NBS of a liquidity framework
 Strategy of consolidation of state owned banks
 Adoption of Law on Mandatory Traffic Insurance (related to motor third party liability).

(*) According to the 2001 Law on Privatization, 70 percent of the companies offered in tender procedure was to be sold to
a strategic investor, 15 percent was given to employees, and 15 percent was to be placed in the Privatization Register
designated for citizens who did not receive shares as employees of companies. Subsequently, the GoS took the decision to
sell in the market the 15 percent allocated for the public and distribute the proceeds in cash to the same.




69.     The GoS remains committed to completing the substantial reform program
implemented thus far in private and financial sector areas. While, the GoS has made
considerable progress in the business environment, privatization/restructuring of non-private
enterprises, and in financial sector development, the reform agenda has not yet been completed.
To this end and in the short term the GoS is planning to focus businesses environment reforms
on improving construction permits and completing the implementation of the regulations of
business activities recommendation. As far as privatization and restructuring is concerned, the
GoS plans to proceed with the incorporation of Railways and Post, two large state owned
enterprises, and with the privatization of Telekom. Finally regarding the financial sector, the
GoS plans to divest its minority stakes in banks, privatize the last state owned insurance
company, Dunav. On the regulatory front, the NBS is planning implementation of Basel 2 by the
end of 2011.

   A. ENHANCING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT

Business Entry

70.     To facilitate business entry, the GoS has transformed the Serbian Business Registers
Agency (SBRA) into a one-stop-shop for business registration and has enhanced its
operational efficiency. Over time the SBRA has been given the responsibility to provide tax
numbers, to file businesses financial statements, to maintain registries of leasing deals, pledges,
bankruptcies and liquidations, amongst others. Reforms related to the operationalization of the
one-stop shop and filing of financial statements are expected to yield annual savings to
entrepreneurs in the order of EUR 2.2 million of which EUR 1 million from the single point
filing of financial statements (previously statements had to be submitted to the SBRA, the NBS'
Solvency Center, and the Tax Authority). The operational efficiency of the SBRA was also
enhanced thanks to the introduction of a complete electronic database on business entities and

                                                            22
entrepreneurs, serving as a basis for the electronic exchange of relevant data between all state
institutions. As a result of this transformation, the time to register a company decreased from 23
days in 2006 to 5 days in 2009.

71.     To further ease business entry, the GoS has established a single window for
registration of new employees, as an interim step preceding the transfer of this function to
the Central Registry for Mandatory Social Insurance. Following the enactment of the Law
on the Central Registry for Mandatory Social Insurance in early 2010 and the necessary by-laws,
a single form is being used to register new workers. The employers are now able to choose
whether to submit the single form either to the Pension Fund or the Health Fund (previously the
procedure required registering new workers at the Pension Fund, the Health Fund, and the
National Employment Service). Either of the two institutions receiving the single form have the
obligation to notify the other relevant institution within one day. This will represent a
considerable reduction in business compliance costs resulting in annual savings of approximately
EUR 15 million, calculated according to the standard cost model. This solution will serve as an
interim one, until the Central Registry is equipped to register new employees, a process which by
law has to be completed by December 31, 2012.

Corporate governance

72.     To strengthen corporate governance and facilitate business operation, a new Law on
Business Entities has been approved by the GoS. The new law, which is in compliance with
new EU directives, includes provisions to: (i) harmonize presently conflicting provisions of the
Law on Business Entities and the Law on Securities Market (e.g., provisions on conditions for
public offerings, listing of securities etc.); (ii) regulate entrepreneurs (at the same time the
existing Law on Private Entrepreneurs will be abolished); (iii) regulate existing business
associations (i.e. Association of Banks), which have been omitted in the existing Law on
Business Entities; (iv) regulate the establishment, operations and closure of branch offices of
foreign legal entities, and (v) define the duties and responsibilities of management and improve
corporate governance by allowing the option of choosing between one- or two-tier corporate
governance system for Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) and JSCs. Reforms under (ii) alone
should lead to a reduction of administrative costs for businesses of approximately EUR 6 million
per year. The Law has undergone public consultation, has been approved by the GoS, and
submitted to the Parliament for approval in the next parliamentary session.

Regulatory reforms

73.     The GoS introduced a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) requirement in the
legislative process in 2004 to improve the quality of new regulations. The implementation of
the RIA will ensure that new regulations ­ the legislative flow ­ are based on a clear rationale
and adequate analysis of costs and benefits. This is particularly important in the context of
harmonization with the EU requirements. The implementation of the RIA includes also
consultations with relevant stakeholders. The entity that has been tasked with the function of
performing such analysis is the Secretariat of the Council for Regulatory Reform under the
MoERD. Most recently the GoS has commenced the process of institutionalizing the regulatory
impact analysis with a formal decision to create a permanent body in charge of this process.



                                               23
74.     To review and reduce compliance cost of existing business regulations (legislative
stock), a comprehensive regulatory review was completed. The regulatory review was
initiated in early 2009 and consisted of four phases: inventory, analysis, recommendations, and
implementation. As a result of the inventory, 2,000 laws and regulations were identified as
impacting economic activity. In the analysis phase the responsible regulatory bodies had the
obligation to justify the need to retain the respective legislation. At the same time, to solicit
input from the business community, the GoS launched a media campaign calling for all
interested parties to propose amendments and/or cancellation of laws and regulations. The
Council for Regulatory Reform also formed ten working groups chaired by a representative of
the private sector to further analyze the 2,000 laws and regulations.

75.     Based on the review, the GoS approved 304 recommendations requiring the
amendments of laws and regulations. In addition, the GoS approved the elimination of 192
regulations. The review contained 340 recommendations to amend laws and regulations and a
proposal to abolish 196 regulations. Of these, the GoS approved 304 recommendations and
ordered the elimination of 192 regulations. The implementation of 304 recommendations
requires the amendments of 30 regulations and 30 laws. So far, 79 recommendations have been
implemented through amendments of 20 regulations and 10 laws. It is estimated that this will
result in annual cost savings to businesses of around EUR 50.8 million. The implementation of
the remaining 225 approved recommendations is expected by the end of 2011. Approximately
90 recommendations of the remaining 225 have been included in the new draft Law on Business
Entities, which will be approved by the GoS on December 23, 2010. The implementation of the
remaining 225 recommendations should yield additional reduction in business compliance costs
of around EUR 91.5 million, thus bringing to total estimated savings to about EUR 142 million.
Details of the methodology to calculate the cost savings and specific examples are presented
below in Box 2.

                Box 2: Cost savings resulting from the review of regulation of business activities

The estimated savings have been calculated following the Standard Cost Model. Variables used in the calculations are:
(i) T (tariff) ­ cost of one hour of the worker performing an administrative procedure, calculated based on the average
      income of employees in Serbia for 2009;
(ii) N - time needed to perform an administrative requirement. This is established by interviewing representatives of relevant
      businesses;
(iii) E ­ additional cost, such as administrative tax that needs to be paid in the administrative procedure.

The cost of the individual procedure for each company is obtained by multiplying T by N, and subsequently adding E. The
total cost of the procedure is then multiplied by the number of business entities affected by the prescribed procedure and
number of times that such procedure needs to be applied within one year. Statistics on business entities were obtained from
the SBRA, while information on the number of times a certain administrative procedure needs to be implemented within one
year was obtained either from businesses, or from regulatory bodies applying the respective procedure. It should be noted that
it was possible to perform this calculation only for about 10 percent of recommendations, while for the remaining
recommendations it was impossible to quantify the impact.

Examples of the cost savings associated to some of the recommendations are presented below:

    Introduction of single window approach for registering workers - EUR 15 million.
    Simplification of existing procedures such as extending the deadline for businesses to place their daily cash revenue into
    their bank accounts from one to seven days - EUR 39.5 million.
    Requiring the Tax Authority to ensure electronic submission of required tax filing documents - EUR 8.5 million.
    Eliminating the requirement for preparing and stamping the travel requests for using the company vehicles each time the
    vehicle is used - EUR 21 million.
    Eliminating the requirement for posting the company name on the company vehicles - EUR 2.6 million.


                                                              24
Improving competition

76.     To protect consumers and strengthen competition, a new Law on Protection of
Competition was enacted. In 2005, the GoS adopted a Law on Protection of Competition.
However, in the course of implementation a number of deficiencies were identified in the Law.
These included: (i) long procedures to implement mergers, which also contradict the
privatization law; (ii) unclear delineation of responsibilities among the Commission for
Protection of Competition, the Privatization Agency and the NBS; (iii) low thresholds for
concentration of capital notifications ­ requiring almost every merger/sale/tender to undergo
scrutiny by the Commission; (iv) weak institutional arrangements; and (v) lack of clarity with
respect to the basis for notification fees and applicable fines, leading to prohibitively high
compliance costs.      In consultation with the European Agency for Reconstruction
(EAR)/European Commission, the GoS decided to draft a brand new law, rather than amend the
existing one. The new Law was approved in the summer of 2009.

77.      Eight new regulations required to implement the new Law on Protection of
Competition have been adopted. These include: (i) Regulation on criteria defining relevant
market; (ii) Regulation on content of request for individual exemption; (iii) Regulation on
categories and special conditions for block-exemptions; (iv) Regulation on the form and content
of the official identification; (v) Regulation on content and the manner for notification of
concentration; (vi) Statute of the Commission for Protection of Competition; (vii) Regulation on
criteria for measurement of the amounts of fines, the manner and payment timeframe under the
measure for protection of competition and procedural penalties and on conditions for definition
of other measures; and (viii) Regulation on conditions of relief from pecuniary fines under
measures for protection of competition (Leniency Program).

Enhancing enforcement of court decisions and based on authentic documents

78.     Enforcement mechanisms remain a stumbling block for business operations.
According to the 2011 Doing Business indicators on enforcing contracts Serbia ranks 94th in the
world, with 635 days necessary for enforcement. Also, a survey commissioned by a USAID-
funded project showed that 73 percent of companies in Serbia "never or rarely" use the court for
enforcement due to inefficient implementation. Moreover, the survey found the recovery rate for
judgments in commercial courts is less than 5 percent. The European Court of Human Rights
has also ruled nine times against Serbia in the past three years over human rights violations
resulting from the inability to enforce court judgments in Serbia.

79.     To speed up enforcement processes, the Government is preparing a new Law on
Enforcement and Security. The new Law will enhance the enforcement of court decisions as
well as enforcement based on authentic documents, such as contracts and invoices. To this end,
the Law will introduce the concept of professional enforcement officers (i.e. private bailiffs)
licensed and supervised by the MoJ. The Law has undergone public consultation, has been
approved by GoS, and submitted to Parliament for approval in the next parliamentary session.
Further, the MoJ will prepare the necessary implementation regulations, which will be adopted
following the enactment of the Law. Amongst other, the regulations are expected to discipline
the work of professional enforcement officers including their selection, preparation of annual
reports, monetary awards and reimbursement of costs, mandatory insurance, issuance and
revocation of ID cards registries, code of conduct and so forth.

      B. STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE IN THE NON-PRIVATE ENTERPRISE SECTOR

80.     The non-private sector consists of numerous and varied enterprises, employing
roughly 7.4 percent of the employed workforce (Table 6). The Republic of Serbia owns some
35 larger state-owned enterprises. In addition, there are 282 socially-owned enterprises, which
used to belong to the "society" and operated via self-management12 and 221 former socially
owned enterprises, which have been transferred in state ownership after unsuccessful
privatization. About 550 municipally owned enterprises are controlled by the municipalities, but
are legally owned by the state. Finally, there are enterprises owned by the Province of
Vojvodina, which are outside of the purview of this document.

privatization has been temporarily suspended (for companies whose founders are former Yugoslav republic, as well
as veterinary stations, public media, companies with activities related to waterworks, etc,).
** These are previously privatized socially-owned companies for which the privatization contracts were cancelled,
upon which they were returned to PA portfolio as state-owned companies.

81.     Most non-private enterprises benefit from both direct and indirect subsidies. In
FY10 direct subsidies to the sector are expected to amount to approximately EUR 241.1 million
or 0.8 percent of GDP (see Table 7). Most direct subsidies are direct budget transfers to state-
owned enterprises (e.g., the Railways and Resavica mining complex) by the MoF and the
Ministry of Mining and Energy, or, in the case of socially-owned enterprises they take the form
of soft loans from the MoERD through the Development Fund. In addition, to direct subsidies,
many non private enterprises benefit from indirect subsidies such as non-payment or partial
payment of taxes; arrears to state-owned utilities (e.g. EPS), arrears on pension, social security,
and unemployment contributions. No data is available on indirect subsidies, but based on a 2004
assessment of sixty socially-owned enterprises, they are estimated to be more than three times
the size of direct subsidies. No subsidies are channeled through the state owned banking sector.

  The concept of socially-owned enterprises was unique to ex-Yugoslavia and was at the center of the economic
organization at the time.

 (*) This does not include the GoS incentives provided to the newly created enterprise (Fiat Automobile Serbia). It
is estimated that these will amount to EUR 150-200 million over the next few years (i.e. in the factory, local roads
and infrastructures, etc.)



82.    To create fiscal space for needed public investment, the GoS is committed to
strengthening financial discipline in the non-private sector. Most of the enterprises are loss
making and state subsidies are primarily geared at keeping the companies afloat rather than - for
example - addressing market failures. To mitigate the drain on the fiscal budget, the GoS has
committed to:

    (i)      Privatize or restructure socially owned enterprises and closing socially owned
             enterprises where privatization/restructuring was unsuccessful;
    (ii)     Corporatize/selectively privatize state owned enterprises; and
    (iii)    Control subsidies in all non private sector enterprises that cannot be privatized in the
             short-term.

Privatization/Restructuring socially owned enterprises and closing socially owned enterprises
where privatization/restructuring was unsuccessful

83.     Since 2001, the GoS pursued a systematic privatization strategy for socially owned
enterprises. The principles and approach are laid down in the 2001 Law on Privatization, which
incorporated lessons learnt from other transition economies. The main lesson learnt from
experience of other transition countries was that privatizations that put core, strategic investors in
charge of the firms worked better than those that passed ownership to diffused, inexperienced
workers or citizens. The selected privatization model was more conducive to improving
corporate governance and real sector efficiency, attracting foreign capital, and technology.
Based on the 2001 Law on Privatization, socially-owned enterprises should be sold by the
Privatization Agency (PA) via: (i) tenders offering at least 70 percent of the shares to a strategic
investor, if the enterprise is large; (ii) auctions for medium-sized enterprises; and (iii)
restructuring and subsequent tenders and/or auctions for large loss-making enterprises and/or
parts thereof.
                                                         27
84.     However, the privatization process was lengthy and, in 2008, legislation was passed
to complete the process by end-2008 by mandating that companies for which privatization
had not started would be closed. The Law on Privatization was amended in 2008 requiring
that the privatization of all socially-owned enterprises be initiated by the end of the same year.
Mandatory liquidation/bankruptcy13 must be introduced when: (i) announcement of public
tender/auction has not been published; (ii) the company (capital/assets) has not been sold even
after the third attempt; and (iii) the entity subject to privatization fails to submit its financial
report to the business registration agency for two years in a row. Moreover, in 2010 the Law on
Privatization Agency was amended and previously privatized socially owned companies for
which the privatization contract are cancelled, largely due to investors' unfulfilled contractual
obligations, now return to the PA portfolio as state-owned companies. These companies are then
subject to a new resolution process (privatization and/or bankruptcy).

85.     Consequently, 430 socially-owned companies were sold for about EUR 362 million
in the period 2008-2009. 28 companies were privatized in 2010 due to market conditions,
but 162 were put in bankruptcy. As of early November 2010, there were 955 socially owned
companies in the PA portfolio (see Table 8). Of these 673 enterprises were in bankruptcy/forced
liquidation; in 2010 162 companies from the PA portfolio were put in bankruptcy. In 2010 there
were further 81 companies in auction, tender and restructuring procedure in the PA; progress
with the latter category is well underway and should be completed by mid 2011. Privatization
for the remaining 201 was temporarily stopped for various reasons, such as unresolved
ownership status with former Yugoslav republics.14 The state owned enterprises reflected in the
Table 8 represent previously privatized socially-owned companies for which the privatization
contracts were cancelled.

86.     State-owned companies in the PA portfolio will be again subject to the resolution
process and, due to slow progress, bankruptcy remains an option. Currently, public
invitation has been issued for the tender of two companies and auction of additional two. By the

   Forced liquidation is initiated by the Privatization Agency when the assets exceed the liabilities of the company.
Bankruptcy is initiate by the Privatization Agency (that acts as bankruptcy administrator for socially owned
enterprises) when liabilities exceed the assets.
14
   The state owned enterprises in the table represent previously privatized socially-owned companies for which the
privatization contracts were cancelled, largely due to investors' unfulfilled contractual obligations. These were
returned to the PA portfolio as state-owned companies and will also be subject to the new resolution process
(privatization and/or bankruptcy).

end of 2010, the PA is expected to announce additional three tenders. The sale of capital/assets
in remaining companies is planned by the second quarter of 2011. Finally, restructuring is
underway in 84 companies. To facilitate resolution of unviable enterprises, especially socially
owned enterprises, the GoS has enhanced the new bankruptcy framework (see Section Improving
the bankruptcy framework).

Selectively privatize state owned enterprises

87.     In 2008, the GoS also decided to corporatize and eventually privatize selected state-
owned enterprises. These included EPS, JAT, NIS, Belgrade Airport, Telekom, and Galenika.
Until now, only NIS was sold (51 percent was sold to Russian Gazprom). The privatization of
Galenika, a pharmaceutical company, was delayed and the GoS is currently in the process of
selling 51 percent stake in Telekom. Moreover, the GoS is planning to carve out the good assets
of JAT, transfer them to "a new company" and offer it for sale.

Controlling subsidies in the non-private enterprise sector

88.     Despite restructuring and privatization, direct subsidies to the non-private sector
have hovered around 0.8 percent of GDP in the 2008-2010 period. See Table 7. There are
several reasons for this:
     Even with restructuring it takes time for savings to show up in financial performance.
     A number of privatization contracts for socially owned enterprises were cancelled (91 in
         2009 alone due to unfulfilled contractual obligations by the buyers). This group of
         companies, including large enterprises such as Azotara Pancevo, Letex, Magnohrom,
         were returned to the PA portfolio and had to be subsidized in the period.
     Companies left for privatization at this stage are the worst performers, as the best
         enterprises were sold earlier in the process.
     Up-front investment is sometimes needed. In 2008, to resolve Zastava the GoS funded
         retrenchment and active labor market programs and transferred selected assets to a new
         company (Fiat Automobile Serbia), which is owned at 33 percent by the GoS. Subsidies
         provided to Zastava alone accounted for 41 percent of the socially owned company
         subsidies in 200915 and it is planned that the socially owned company will receive about
         34 percent of the 2010 allocation. In addition, as part of the deal with FIAT the GoS has
         committed to invest between EUR 150-200 million over the next few years (i.e. in the
         factory, local roads and infrastructures, etc.).

89.     To improve transparency of state aid, the GoS introduced a new State Aid
Framework. This included the adoption of a Law on Control of State Aid in 2009 that regulates
amounts and types of subsidy, and the creation of an operationally independent Commission for
Control of State Aid. The Commission will be responsible for ex-ante control of state aid as per
the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU. The Commission for Control of State
Aid was formally established in December 2009 and it consists of 5 members from the following
entities: the MoF, the Commission for Protection of Competition, the MoERD, the Ministry of
Infrastructure, and the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning. In total, the Commission


15
  The subsidies to Zastava administered by the MOERD were aimed at the Zastava Group (in restructuring) and not
the Fiat Automobile Serbia, which is being funded from other sources.

                                                      29
has approved allocation of state aid in the amount of nearly RSD 1.1 billion (around EUR 10.2
million). To ensure transparency, all decisions are available on the website of the MoF.

90.     To better monitor state aid, a Registry of Regional Development Measures and
Incentives has been established under the SBRA. The Registry will record all measures and
incentives funds by the GoS and international organizations to a variety of entities including
companies. Further, the Registry will record the following type of information: type, purpose
and form of incentive, providers and users, financial information, and territorial focus. The
government institutions obliged to report to the Registry include: the MOERD, the Ministry for
National Investment Plan, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry,
and Waterworks, the MoF, the Development Fund, the National Employment Service, the
Serbian Investment and Export Promotion Agency, the National Agency for Regional
Development, the Agency for Insurance and Financing of Exports, the AOFI and the EU
Integration Office.

Improving the bankruptcy framework

91.     To increase recovery in bankruptcy in general and especially in the context of non-
private enterprises, a new Law on Bankruptcy was introduced in 2009. The new Law
increased process efficiency, established automatic triggers for bankruptcy, and created new
rules for pre-packaged reorganization. In addition, the new Law also improved the current
bankruptcy framework, particularly in regards to the addition of the set-off provisions, the
improvements to the reorganization process, and the avoidance of pre-bankruptcy transactions.
Furthermore, it clarified issues with respect to licensing, appointment, removal, and disciplining
of bankruptcy administrators. The Doing Business 2011 report credited government efforts in
this area, and Serbia was ranked 86th globally in `Closing a Business' indicator or 15 spots higher
than the previous year.

92.     Following the enactment of the new Law on Bankruptcy, bankruptcy
administration is being enhanced. This effort includes already adopted amendments to the
Law on Agency for Licensing of Bankruptcy Administrators, as well as revisions to the National
Standards for Administering the Bankrupt Estate and the Code of Ethics. Moreover, to track
case activities, an electronic reporting system has been established.            Finally, eleven
implementation regulations for the new Law on Bankruptcy have been approved. These include
regulations on the code of ethics, implementation of reorganization, pre-packaged
reorganization, registry of bankruptcy estate, awards and fees of bankruptcy administrators.

93.     The introduction of automatic bankruptcy triggers has resulted in initiation of
bankruptcy for some 11,000 privately and socially owned entities. The Law on Bankruptcy
requires automatic bankruptcy proceedings for enterprises with accounts blocked for over three
years16. Based on this new procedure, the NBS sends the candidate list to the commercial courts,
which formally declare bankruptcy. The debtor or the creditors have 60 days to pay an advance

16
   The blocked account system refers to the use of promissory notes authorizing creditors to block delinquent
borrowers' bank account. An account freeze, administered by the NBS claim and enforcement department is
applied to all bank accounts in the system. When balances on bank accounts are insufficient to repay creditors
requesting the blockage, the accounts remains blocked until balances are repaid, creditors withdraw their request to
block or until the borrower is put into bankruptcy. Bank accounts may also be blocked by tax, customs authorities
seeking collection of unpaid claims.

                                                        30
fee to the Courts that will then formally open a bankruptcy case and determine whether the
company is to be liquidated/bankrupted or reorganized. If no fee is paid within 60 days, the
Court will automatically open and close the bankruptcy case and transfer any assets to the state
that is the Directorate for Property of the Republic of Serbia. Any legal claims on assets (i.e.,
loans, mortgages) would still remain valid. Only if there are no assets and no parties are
interested in opening a bankruptcy case, the SBRA will erase the entities from the Registry of
companies.

     C. BUILDING A STABLE AND MORE EFFICIENT FINANCIAL SECTOR

Strengthening crisis preparedness and bank resolution

94.    To prevent possible withdrawals of foreign banks in the wake of the crisis, the GoS
and the NBS implemented a comprehensive program to maintain stability in the banking
sector. Given the large presence of foreign banks in the country, ensuring that the latter
remained committed to the Serbian market was paramount. To this end, the GoS implemented a
program under the auspices of the "Vienna initiative" in late 2008. The initiative is voluntary
and open to all banks. Signatory banks are required to keep their exposure vis-à-vis Serbia at 80
percent of the 2008-level and to keep their subsidiaries sufficiently capitalized. Incentives
include access to two liquidity facilities established by the NBS and amendments to risk
management regulations, namely an increase in the limit of sub-debt to tier 1 capital ratio from
50 to 75 percent and an increase in the net open position from 10 to 20 percent. The program has
expired in December 2010 and it will not be renewed.

95.     To ensure that the system is well capitalized a bank diagnostic and triage exercise
has been implemented. In December 2009, the NBS completed the stress testing for the entire
banking sector (i.e., 34 banks). As a result, Metals Banka was recapitalized by the Province of
Vojvodina and Komercijalna Banka, a state owned bank with EBRD minority ownership, raised
more equity from existing and new shareholders17, including the IFC. Further, Credy Bank was
recapitalized by Nova KBM from Slovenia.

96.     The deposit insurance fund has been strengthened. The fund increased in size to
around EUR 140 million at Q3 2010 due to an initial capitalization by the GoS and raising of
premium. Its current size is adequate to cover the failure of a mid-size bank18. More recently,
the capacity of the fund to deal with large payouts has been strengthened by developing payout
procedures, introducing a payout software, adopting a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on
information sharing between the DIA and the NBS. Amendments to the legal framework to
specifically provide for extraordinary funding and equate the depositors of banks in liquidation
with those of banks in bankruptcy have also been approved. Finally, to better target the size of
the fund, the DIA has developed a risk management tool.

97.    To deal with problem banks in a more effective and less costly manner, the existing
bank resolution framework is being overhauled. The previous bank resolution framework
included only liquidation and bankruptcy as resolution tools. Under the new framework,
purchase and assumption and bridge bank on a closed bank basis have been added, as well as

17
  In addition to the EBRD and the IFC, other new shareholders include German DEG and Swedish Swedfund.
18
  In the absence of a risk assessment model, the rule of thumb is that a deposit insurance scheme should be able to
deal with small and medium size bank failures, as opposed to systemic failures.

                                                        31
financial assistance for these tools on a least cost basis. Finally, to ensure that the DIA has
access to emergency funding for bank resolution/payout, the implicit government guarantee
included in the existing DIF and the Law on DIA has been made explicit with the approval of
2011 budget law. RSD 110 million (approximately EUR 1 million) have been allocated to cover
the commitment fee for a EUR 100 million stand-by credit line from commercial banks to the
DIA for contingency purposes. By doing so the implicit GoS's guarantee to the DIA will be
made explicit.

Restructuring and divesting state owned banks

98.     The GoS has continued the divestment program for state owned banks. To
consolidate the state-owned banking sector and reduce likely capital injections, the GoS adopted
a strategy in May 2009, which called for the reduction of majority state owned banks from four
to two over the next two years. The strategy identified Credy, Postanska Stedionica, and
Privredna Banka Pancevo as candidates for either merger or privatization, while the forth
majority state owned banks, Srpska Banka, would continue to operate independently.
Accordingly, Credy Bank was sold to Nova KBM (NKBM) from Slovenia in 2009. Following
two rounds of capital injections, NKBM owns 72.38 percent of Credy Bank, while the RoS owns
15.24 percent. Postanska Stedionica and Privredna Banka Pancevo were instead merged; the
legal merger was completed in September 2010 and the operational merger will be finalized in
the course of 2011. The entity that will emerge from the merger will hold 1.5 percent of the
banking assets of the system, but will have a large number of deposits, primarily pensioners'.
An institution building expert will be engaged to develop a business plan defining, amongst
others, the relationship with the postal network and identifying the best delivery channel for its
dispersed clientele.


Strengthening the insurance sector

99.     Performance of the insurance sector has improved since 2008. These improvements
have taken place thanks to the NBS' supervision, which led to the exit from the market of loss
making insurance companies and entry of foreign players. Furthermore in 2008, the DDOR, a
large and loss making insurance company was sold to the Italian Generali, which improved
substantially the performance of the company. The regulatory framework has also been
enhanced. Notable example is the approval of the Law on Mandatory Traffic Insurance. Prior to
this, the motor third party liability segment, the main class of non-life insurance business, was
not sufficiently regulated.

100. However, the sector remains small and almost a third of the market is dominated by
a state owned insurance company. With insurance consumption of EUR 76 and EUR 10 per
capita for non-life and life insurance, respectively, Serbia lags behind most of its neighbors in
South Eastern Europe. In 2009, the industry accounted for only 4.6 percent of total assets and
5.6 percent of total capital of the financial sector. Dunav, a state owned insurance company,
accounts for 28 percent of the market. While Dunav's performance has been improving thanks
to a restructuring plan, its underwriting performance is lagging. Moreover, business decisions
made by Dunav management in the past (e.g., substantial reductions in premium rates in the
motor third party liability business) distorted the market, but given the company considerable
market power.

                                               32
101. In light of the possible market distortion, the GoS has committed to future
privatization of Dunav. As a first step this will require the transformation of Dunav from a
socially owned to a state owned entity due to the fact that social ownership is no longer a valid
legal form as per the new Constitution. To this end, the GoS has approved and submitted to the
Parliament legal amendments to the Law on Insurance that define the process of transformation
of socially owned capital in the insurance sector into state owned. Furthermore, the amendments
mandate the commencement of privatization of at least 20 percent of state owned capital in
insurance companies by the end of 2013.

102. To reduce the potential for systemic risk in the sector, insurance companies will be
required to separate the life and non-life insurance businesses. Separation of life and non-
life insurance is not yet required in Serbia. The existing status quo creates opportunities for
management of insurance companies to use often sizable life insurance reserves as a substitute
for risk capital (in lieu of reinsurance) in considerably more volatile non-life insurance business,
which creates the potential for misuse of life reserves, price distortions in non-life segment of the
market and systemic risk in the sector. To address this issue, amendments to the Law on
Insurance have been enacted requiring the separation of life and non-life business by the end of
2011.

Supporting capital market development

103. Capital markets in Serbia remain underdeveloped, with limited equity market
activity and only emerging domestic bond market. Although the financial sector has
deepened in recent years, it continues to be largely dominated by the banking segment. Serbia's
market capitalization accounts for 30 percent of GDP. Currently, there are only six companies19
fully listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange, and approximately 1,700 on the non-regulated
market, of which only a few dozen are actively traded. Additional securities include certificates
of deposits issued by the GoS to compensate citizens of Serbia for the loss of foreign deposits
during the 1990s. Further, during the course of last year the GoS has gradually extended the
maturity of Treasury Bills from three to up to 24 months.

104. The financial crisis has highlighted the importance of domestic saving mobilization,
especially for countries whose banking sector is funded largely from international capital
flows. This risk is real for Serbia in light of the dominance of foreign banks and of their reliance
on parent funding to lend in the country. To offset this risk, the GoS has been trying to develop
the capital market, as a mean to increase domestic savings.

105. The establishment of a yield curve and a conducive legal framework are essential to
support capital market development. In 2009, due to the crisis, the GoS started relying more
heavily on issuing T-bills to fund its fiscal needs, and initially it experienced problems with
unsuccessful auctions. A diagnosis of key obstacles was conducted, following which the
coordination between the MoF (debt market policy) and the NBS (liquidity management policy)
was strengthened, auctions have gradually improved in this period and the maturity of T-bills
was gradually extended from 3 months to 6 months and 1 year. As a result, in 2009, the total
stock of T-bill debt reached around EUR 1 billion20(up from around EUR 15.7 million in 2008).

In May 2010, the GoS issued 18-months, and subsequently 24 months T-bills. Most recently, the
GoS issued a first ever Euro-indexed T-bills. The GoS is also working on a new Law on
Securities Market, which needs to be harmonized with the Law on Business Entities (currently in
the making) and aligned with relevant EU Directives and IOSCO21 principles.

106. Strengthening of the GoS debt management capacity is supported by the PEDPL 2.
These include the full staffing of the PDMA and the completion of the following activities: (i)
Establishment of a comprehensive debt database; (ii) Preparation of a comprehensive medium-
term debt management strategy; (iii) Description and a qualitative risk assessment of all
outstanding Government guarantees; and (iv) Preparation of procedures manuals for the main
debt management activities. All required prior actions were met. The PDMA was established
and fully staffed. Among the achievements are preparation of a comprehensive medium-term
debt management strategy, and a listing in the Budget Memorandum of the loan guarantees that
are assessed as high risk. In addition, the revision of the Law on Public Debt is underway, and
once adopted it should additionally strengthen Government's debt management capacity.



                       IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

       A. LINK TO CPS

107. The proposed operation is consistent with the FY08-FY11 CPS and FY09 CPS
Progress Report for Serbia. The Serbia CPS "Dynamic Private Sector Led Growth to Ensure
Incomes Converge with Europe" supports three GoS priorities: (i) private sector led growth to
ensure income convergence with European levels; (ii) increased opportunities and participation
in growth; and (iii) management of emerging environmental and disaster risks. The CPS and
CPS Progress Report envisaged support to the first and second areas through a series of three
PFDPLs. In the context of preparation of the third operation under the PFDPL series, the GoS
has requested to avail of an IBRD PBG rather than a loan. As PBG is not a DPL option under
OP 8.60 (Development Policy Lending) and a "Programmatic PBG" option does not exist under
OP 14.25 (Guarantees), the PFDPL series has been terminated after PFDPL 2, and PFDPL 3 has
been transformed in a stand-alone PBG operation, with the same policy matrix as the originally
envisaged PFDPL 3.
       B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

108. The program supported by the PFSPBG has been developed in collaboration with
IFIs and other development partners engaged in private and financial sector development.
Agencies engaged in the sector include: (i) USAID and KfW supporting commercial legislation
reform; (ii) the EAR and USAID focusing on enterprise sector reform and bankruptcy and
enforcement regime; (iii) the U.S. Treasury and USAID sponsoring financial sector reforms; (iv)
KfW strengthening the deposit insurance fund; (v) and SIDA supporting the implementation of
the regulatory reform. Collaboration in the area takes place through monthly meetings chaired
by the Bank country manager.

109. To safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability, Serbian authorities agreed on
a EUR 3 billion stand-by arrangement with the IMF in May 2009. The program involves a
multi-sector approach based on fiscal adjustment, private sector involvement in a financial sector
support package, and external financing from IFIs and the EU. Fiscal discipline is anchored in
wage and pensions expenditure restraint, while financial policies focused on limiting adverse
spillovers including through assurances from foreign parent banks to at least maintain their
external exposures to Serbia, while keeping their subsidiaries capitalized and liquid.

110. The PFSPBG financial sector pillar is directly supported by State Secretariat for
Economic Affairs (SECO) of the Swiss Confederation TA to the DIA and investments in
undercapitalized banks by the EBRD and the IFC. The SECO of the Swiss Confederation
has allocated a grant of EUR 2.7 million to strengthen the DIA in its function as manager of the
GoS shares in banks and socially-owned capital in insurance companies. Following the banking
sector diagnostic, the EBRD increased Komercijalna's capital by EUR 48 million and the IFC
(via the Bank Capitalization Fund) by EUR 4 million. Additional post-crisis investments by the
IFC included a EUR 40 million loan to Societe Generale for agri-business and EUR 20 million to
ProCredit for micro and small enterprises.

   C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

111. The policy actions supported by the PFSPBG are a continuation of the program
supported by the PFDPL series and previous budget support operations. In the context of
preparation of the third operation under the PFDPL series, the GoS has requested to avail of an
IBRD PBG rather than a loan. As PBGs are stand-alone operations, the PFDPL series was
terminated and PFDPL 3 has been transformed in a stand-alone PBG operation, with the same
policy matrix as the originally envisaged PFDPL 3. Budget support operations preceding the
PFDPL series and focused on private and financial sector include the two Private and Financial
Sector Adjustment Credits (PFSAC1 and PFSAC2) and the Programmatic Private and Financial
Development Policy Credit (PPFDPC-1). All supported the GoS in: (i) strengthening fiscal
discipline in enterprise, energy and transport sectors, and attracting foreign investment; and (ii)
building a more efficient and stable financial sector and improving access to finance, including
continued privatization, divestment of state-owned banks and financial assets, strengthening
insurance sector regulations and improving access to finance through the adoption of a Law on
Mortgage.

112. TA for regulatory reform, incorporation of state owned enterprises, capital market
development, and crisis preparedness further support the reform agenda underpinning the
PFSPBG. A World Bank Trust Fund funded by SIDA supported the regulatory review process.
Going forward, the World Bank's Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grant will support the
creation of a permanent government body in charge of the regulatory impact assessment. A
second IDF grant is assisting the GoS in designing an adequate framework for incorporation of
state owned enterprises, a process which should enhance their corporate governance. The
framework will also be implemented with a pilot incorporation of Serbian Railways and of Post
(which owns Postal Bank and Telecom). Under the Capital Markets Development TA,
assistance has been provided to the PDMA to identify key issues in the area of government
securities market development, provide support in initiating their resolution, and strengthen the
PDMA's technical capacity. Finally assistance in upgrading the crisis framework for the

                                                35
financial sector, and in particular on strengthening the DIA and bank resolution framework, has
been provided under the regional World Bank funded Western Balkans Facility.

113. The proposed PFSPBG is complemented by the PEDPL series. The objective of the
latter is to help reduce the size of Serbia's large public sector by supporting reforms that will
help improve the productivity of public spending. In particular, the series are structured around
three key policy areas: (i) public expenditure allocation reforms to improve the quality of
spending in the largest spending sectors; (ii) public expenditure and debt management reforms to
address poorly managed fiscal spending and to help improve fiduciary conditions; and (iii) social
assistance, especially for cushioning the impact of the economic crisis and enhancing the
coverage of the social assistance programs going forward.



   D. LESSONS LEARNED

114. The program supported by the PFSPBG and preceding PFDPL series builds on
lessons learned from other transition experiences. These include the importance of:

        a.      Sequencing market reforms and privatizations. Successful transition reform
programs have been sequenced as follows: (i) introduction of policies to liberalize prices and
ensure fiscal stability; (ii) structural reforms in industrial enterprises and banks; and (iii) reforms
in utilities, non-banking institutions and capital markets. In parallel, private sector growth
should be facilitated through business environment reforms. "Early wins" are essential for
program sustainability with restructuring of more politically sensitive large loss-makers coming
later. Under the PFDPL series, the GoS adopted the sequence defined above, completing the
early win phase and reforming substantially the business environment. However, as Serbia
embarked on the restructuring of politically sensitive large loss-makers, the global crisis hit.
Therefore, progress with respect to the latter has been more modest.

       b.      Identifying reform champions and supporting them in implementation. The
reform program is firmly anchored in the MoF, the MoERD, and the NBS. Two technical
agencies have also been created to support the implementation of the reforms, the PA in charge
of privatizing socially-owned enterprises, and the DIA responsible for the privatization of the
banking sector. Both agencies have benefitted extensively from TA, provided also under the
PFDPL series.

        c.     Providing extensive technical assistance on a timely basis. In the case of
Serbia, substantial grant funding is provided by the EU, the DFID, the SIDA, the Bank and the
USAID. The TA design and delivery is enhanced by effective donor coordination.

115. Serbia differed somewhat from other transition economies, and lessons learnt have
accordingly been adjusted. First, its system of socialism, based on worker management and the
concept of "social capital," did not entail classic central planning; and secondly, due to the
break-up of the former Yugoslavia and the resulting conflict and sanctions, Serbia was late in
embarking on the journey to a full-fledged market economy. These factors meant that the
fundamental transitional task of reforming banks and enterprises had to be adjusted to these
different initial conditions: auctions replaced voucher privatization typical for other transition

                                                  36
economies, the four largest state-owned banks were closed, and the approach to restructuring of
utilities and of the largest loss-makers has been more gradual than that of the early reformers.

116. The program supporting the PFSPBG and preceding PFDPL series has also
benefitted from Bank engagement in previous financial crises. These highlight the
importance of focus, selectivity and coordination with partners.22 The financial sector pillar of
the program addresses these issues by supporting aspects of crisis management in which the
Bank has traditionally had a comparative advantage. The reforms underpinning the pillar have
been designed in cooperation with the IMF.

117. Lessons learnt from previous PBGs have also been incorporated in the design of the
PFSPBG23. The evaluation of the two PBGs that have been issued to date, i.e. to Argentina
(1999) and Colombia (2001), indicates that in both cases, guarantees exerted considerable
leverage and allowed the countries to get access to international markets at a time when
investors' interest was minimal or when they were constrained to small volumes.24 The report
further points out that PBGs work best when the underlying reform programs are part of a
sustained effort. Therefore, hybrid policy loan/guarantee operations provide better sequencing
than standalone policy guarantee operations. This was the case in Colombia, where the PBG was
issued in lieu of a second tranche of a Financial Sector Adjustment Loan. PFSPBG is a similar
case, in that the policies underpinning the operation are part of the reform effort supported by the
preceding PFDPL series (the last operation of the series has been transformed in a PBG). The
usage of the guarantee has allowed the GoS to leverage a larger volume of resources, and
provided greater leverage to complete complex structural reforms initiated under the PFDPL
series, such as the new bank resolution framework.

     E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

118. The program supported by the PFSPBG and preceding PFDPL series builds on the
findings of the economic sector work undertaken by the Bank. These include the Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA); the Private Sector Note (PSN); and the Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) report. The ICA and PSN laid the ground for the privatization program by
demonstrating that private firms were more productive, more profitable, and growing more
rapidly than the socially-owned ones. The analysis also highlighted the importance of the
business environment for new firms--entry by new entrepreneurs and growth of existing private
firms were limited by the costly business environment.

119. Progress of reforms under the three pillars has been assessed by the 2009 FSAP
update, the annual Doing Business and 2008 Public Expenditure Review (PER). The FSAP

22
   A comprehensive review of Bank operations and research is included in "Lessons from Past Financial Crisis",
Independent Evaluation Group.
23
   A review of the usage and effectiveness of World Bank Group guarantees is presented in "The World Bank
Group Guarantee Instruments 1990-2007.Guarantee Instruments, 1990­2007". Guarantee Instruments, 1990­2007".
24
   The report further highlights that the Argentine PBG that supported its 1999 structural reform program failed,
because of broader weaknesses in the specific programs rather than the guarantee instrument itself. Following the
collapse of the Argentinean financial system, the country's adjustment program went off track, and reforms that
were intended to be supported by a Bank adjustment loan as well as the PBG financing were not achieved.

update provided recommendations for further reforms in the areas of banking regulation and
supervision, liquidity and securities market issues, crisis management framework, bank
resolution, deposit insurance scheme, corporate and household debt, and insurance sector. The
annual DB report provides analytical foundation for much of the business environment pillar.
The PER highlighted that direct and indirect subsidies25 amounted to around 4 percent of GDP in
2008 and 9 percent of general government spending. In 2008 alone, the average subsidy per
employee was equivalent to national average monthly net wage (from December 2008), thus
each worker effectively allocates one month's salary for employees in subsidized sectors.


        V. THE PROPOSED PRIVATE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICY BASED
                                 GUARANTEE

     A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

120. The objectives of the PFSPBG are to improve the business environment, strengthen
financial discipline in the non-private enterprise sector, and build a stable and more
efficient financial sector. The business environment pillar aims to: (i) simplify regulatory
requirements and compliance costs for business entry and operations; (ii) enhance corporate
governance, (iii) strengthen legal framework for competition, and (iv) improve enforcement of
court decisions and of authentic documents. The financial discipline pillar supports: (i) creation
of a registry of regional development measures and incentives; and (ii) facilitation of the
resolution of socially owned enterprises. The financial sector pillar supports: (i) crisis
preparedness, including assessment of capital adequacy, enhancement of bank resolution
framework, and strengthening of deposit insurance payout functions; (ii) continued
restructuring/divestment of the GoS's remaining holdings in the banking sector; (iii)
improvement in the insurance sector regulation; and (iv) supporting capital markets
development.

121. All policy actions for the PFSPBG are included in the policy Matrix. Prior actions
are featured in Box 3. The outcomes of the policies underpinning for PFSPBG are featured in
the last column of the Policy Matrix.
                                     Box 3: Prior Actions for PFSPBG
1) The Borrower's Government has approved the draft Law on Business Entities, satisfactory to the
Bank, and submitted it to its Parliament for adoption;

Status: A draft law has been finalized and public consultation is underway. The GoS has adopted the
law on December 23, 2010. The law has been submitted to the Parliament.

2) The Borrower has completed a comprehensive review of regulations of business activities, and
the Borrower's Government has approved the recommendations of that review;

Status: The Government has approved a total of 304 out of 340 recommendations to amend laws and/or
regulations, as well as abolishment of 192 regulations out of 196 recommended. This action was
completed with the adoption of the Government decisions of December 29, 2009 and November 26, 2010.

   Subsidy is defined as a government action that lowers the cost of production, raises the price received by
producers or lowers the price paid by consumers.

                                                     38
3) The Registry of Regional Development Measures and Incentives, satisfactory to the Bank, has
been established within the Serbian Business Registers Agency and is operational;

Status: This action was completed on December 2, 2010.

4) The National Bank of Serbia has completed a diagnostic assessment of all banks operating in
Serbia in accordance with the methodology adopted under the Second Programmatic Private and
Financial Development Policy Loan provided by the Bank, and enforced bank recapitalization to a
capital adequacy ratio of at least 12%;

Status: This process was completed by February 2010.

5) The Borrower's Parliament has:
a) enacted amendments satisfactory to the Bank to the Law on Banks, Law on Bankruptcy and
Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies, Law on Deposit Insurance and the Law on the
Deposit Insurance Agency; and
b) enacted the Law on Budget for the year 2011 which contains a provision satisfactory to the Bank
on the State Guarantee to the Deposit Insurance Agency.

Status: The amendments have been approved by the Parliament on November 29, 2010. Budget Law for
2011 has been approved on December 29, 2010.

6) Banks with Borrower majority ownership have been merged, privatized or restructured in
accordance with the strategy adopted under the Second Programmatic Private and Financial
Development Policy Loan provided by the Bank.

Status: The majority of Credy Bank was sold to Nova KBM from Slovenia in March 2010, Postanska
Stedionica and Privredna Banka Pancevo were legally merged in September 2010. The restructuring of
the new entity will take place in the course of 2012. Tender to select an institution building adviser was
launched on November 30, 2010.


122. The GoS regulations require consultations with all relevant stakeholders for
significant legislative amendments. Article 41 of the Rulebook of the GoS requires public
consultations for all legislative amendments that regulate issues which are of particular interest
to the public. Only following public discussion, and further inter-ministerial harmonization, can
the proposed legal amendments be submitted for the Parliament's consideration. Regulations
that explicitly or implicitly deal with environmental issues are reviewed by the Inter-ministerial
Regulatory Review Unit, which ascertains potential impact on the environment, and the final
decision is taken by the ministry in charge of environmental protection.

123. The Government's reform program underpinning the PFSPBG has benefitted from
consultations with relevant stakeholders (as required by OP 8.60). The Law on Business
Entity, the Law on competition, the Law on Enforcement, Amendments to the Law on Banks, the
Law on Bankruptcy and Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies, the Law on Deposit
Insurance and the Law on Deposit Insurance Agency have been classified as systemic laws.
Therefore, as per the GoS own rules, their finalization has undergone extensive consultations
with all interested stakeholders. Furthermore the review of regulations of business activities has
been designed with the help of representatives of business membership organizations, who
participated in all the thematic working groups.

   B. POLICY AREAS

PILLAR I ­ Enhancing Business Environment

124. Pillar 1 of the PFSPBG supports policies aiming to enhance the business
environment. These include measures to simplify business entry, strengthen corporate
governance, easing the business environment, make the competition framework operational, and
improve enforcement of court decisions and of authentic documents such as contracts and
invoices.

125. Under the PFSPBG, the one-stop shop concept has been expanded to include
employees' registration and a new Law on Business Entities has been approved by the GoS.
Under the proposed PFSPBG business entry has been further simplified by creating a single
window for registration of new employees. As an interim step preceding the transfer of this
function to the Central Registry for Mandatory Social Insurance by 2012, new employees can be
registered either with the Pension or the Health Fund. This is expected to generate EUR 15
million savings annually for entrepreneurs operating in Serbia. Furthermore, under the PFSPBG
a new Law on Business Entities has undergone public consultations, has been approved by GoS,
and submitted to the Parliament for approval in the next parliamentary session.

126. The PFSPBG supports the completion of a comprehensive review of regulations of
business activities and the adoption by the GoS of the majority of the recommendations.
The Government has approved a total of 304 out of 340 recommendations to amend laws and/or
regulations, as well as abolishment of 192 regulations out of 196 recommended. All 192
regulations have been abolished and 79 of the recommendations have been implemented. The
latter required the amendments of 10 laws and 20 regulations have been amended. The
implementation of the already implemented recommendations is estimated to lead to annual cost
savings for businesses of EUR 50.8 million, while following full implementation the estimated
savings are expected to reach around EUR 142 million.

127. Under the PFSPBG, regulations supporting the Law on Protection of Competition
have been adopted and a new Law on Enforcement and Security will soon be submitted to
the GoS. The regulations to implement the Law on Protection of Competition have been drafted
and adopted, thus making it fully operational. The new Law will strengthen enforcement power
of the Commission for Protection of Competition. Finally, the proposed new Law on
Enforcement and Security will greatly enhance the effectiveness of enforcement of court
decisions and of authentic documents such as contracts and invoices. This will be achieved,
amongst other, by streamlining of the enforcement process and introducing professional
enforcement officers (i.e. private bailiffs). The Law on Enforcement has undergone public
consultations, has been approved by the GoS, and was submitted to the Parliament for approval
in the next parliamentary session.

PILLAR II - Strengthening Financial Discipline

128. Under Pillar 2 of the PFSPBG the GoS has taken important steps to strengthen
financial discipline in the non-private enterprise sector. These included continuation of the
resolution of socially owned enterprises, strengthening of the bankruptcy procedures, as well as
better monitoring of the subsidies for the sector.
                                              40
129. The PFSPBG supports the implementation of the new and more efficient
bankruptcy process, to facilitate resolution of unviable enterprises, and in particular
socially owned enterprises. With the onset of the crisis, the GoS strategy to systematically
privatized socially owned enterprises became less tenable. As a consequence, the GoS decided
to focus on utilizing bankruptcy mechanism for resolution of qualifying enterprises, and decided
to improve the bankruptcy framework. Consequently a new bankruptcy framework was
introduced. Under the PFSPBG all the (11) required regulations to implement the recently
introduced Law on Bankruptcy have been adopted. In addition to this, in 2010 the NBS
submitted a list of 13,425 entities with accounts blocked for over three years to the commercial
courts in line with the new Law on Bankruptcy, which introduced automatic bankruptcy trigger
for entities with accounts blocked for more than three years.

130. The PFSBPG supported the continuation of the privatization process of socially
owned enterprises, which, due to different circumstances, resulted in a large number of
bankruptcies. Due to market difficulties and value of remaining companies in the PA portfolio,
and in light of the improved bankruptcy framework, the PA has been focusing on utilizing
bankruptcy as a tool for resolution of unviable socially owned enterprises. As a result, 162
qualifying socially owned companies from the PA portfolio were sent to bankruptcy in 2010.
Some of these companies were previously privatized but the contracts were cancelled, some were
initially scheduled for forced liquidation, and some simply qualified for bankruptcy instead of
privatization.

131. Under the PFSPBG a Registry of Regional Development Measures and Incentives
has been established under the SBRA. The registry will record all measures and incentives
funded by the GoS and international organizations to a variety of entities including companies.
The government institutions obliged to report to the Registry include: the MOERD, the Ministry
for National Investment Plan, the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry, and Waterworks, the MoF, the Development Fund, the National Employment Service,
the Serbian Investment and Export Promotion Agency, the National Agency for Regional
Development, Agency for Insurance and Financing of Exports, the AOFI and the EU Integration
Office. It is expected that this registry will represent a comprehensive record of various types of
state support measures, including subsidies and grants.

PILLAR III - Building a More Efficient and Stable Financial Sector

132. Under Pillar 3 of the PFSPBG, the GoS has taken steps to build a stable and more
efficient financial sector. These include measures to: (i) enhance crisis preparedness, including
assessment of capital adequacy, improvement of bank resolution framework, and strengthening
of deposit insurance payout functions; (ii) continue the restructuring/divestment of the GoS's
majority holdings in the banking sector; (iii) improve the insurance sector; and (iv) strengthen
capital markets.

133. Under the PFSPBG and to ensure that the banking sector is well capitalized, a bank
diagnostic and a triage exercise have been conducted for the entire sector. All banks
operating in Serbia underwent a diagnostic and stress testing exercise and the NBS has enforced
a recapitalization to CAR 12 for banks that were found to be undercapitalized. Following the
diagnostic, three banks were recapitalized.


                                                41
134. The PFSPBG supports a complete overhaul of the bank resolution framework to
increase efficiency and reduce the cost of resolving banks. Amendments to the Laws on
Banks, Bankruptcy and Liquidation of Banks and Insurance Companies, and Deposit Insurance
and Deposit Insurance Agency have been enacted. Under the new framework, purchase and
assumption and bridge bank on a closed bank basis have been added, as well as financial
assistance for these tools on a least cost basis. Finally, to ensure that the DIA has access to
emergency funding for bank resolution/payout, the implicit government guarantee included in
the existing DIF and the Law on DIA has been made explicit with the approval of 2011 budget
law. RSD 110 million (approximately EUR 1 million) have been allocated to cover the
commitment fee for a EUR 100 million stand-by credit line from commercial banks to the DIA
for contingency purposes. By doing so the implicit GoS's guarantee to the DIA will be made
explicit.

135. The PFSPBG has also supported policy actions aimed at strengthening the DIF.
Payout procedures have been adopted and a payout software introduced. An MoU on
information sharing with the NBS has been implemented and legal amendments to equate the
depositors of banks in liquidation with those of banks in bankruptcy have been enacted. Finally
a risk management tool is being developed to better target the size of the fund.

136. Under the PFSPBG, the GoS has consolidated the majority state owned banking
sector. Of the four majority state owned banks, Credy Banka was sold to a foreign group,
Postanska and Privedna Pancevo were merged, and Srpska Banka will remain as is. As a result
the number of majority state owned banks has decreased from 4 to 2.

137. To strengthen the insurance sector, and under the PFSPBG, life and non-life
insurance businesses will be separated and the process of privatizing Dunav will be
initiated. To reduce the potential for systemic risk in the sector, insurance companies will be
required to separate the life and non-life insurance business. Further, to avoid possible market
distortion, the GoS has submitted to the Parliament amendments to Law on Insurance converting
social ownership into state ownership, which is the first step for preparing the privatization of
Dunav. The latter accounts for 28 percent of the market and, business decisions made by Dunav
management in recent past (e.g., substantial reductions in premium rates in the motor third party
liability business) distorted the market.

138. Finally, to promote capital market development, and under the PFSPBG, the GoS
has gradually extended the maturities of T-bills. To increase domestic savings mobilization,
the GoS is committed to developing capital markets. The establishment of a yield curve is
essential in this respect. The GoS has therefore gradually extended the maturity of the GoS T-
bills from 3 months to up to 2 years.
   C. GUARANTEE INSTRUMENT

139. Details of the indicative terms and conditions of the IBRD Guarantee of the Loan to
Serbia are included in Annex 4.

140. The PFSPBG has been designed to enable risk sharing with commercial creditors,
be simple and generate adequate market valuation. The proposed PFSPBG covers the


                                               42
principal risk on the loan and would be callable only on the scheduled bullet maturity in year 626.
The initial Bank exposure under the guarantee (measured as the present value) would be around
Euro [270] million, or [84] percent of the face amount of debt to be mobilized27, and thus the
proposed PFSPBG would help the country mobilize sizable debt by leveraging limited IBRD
resources. Full principal coverage has been included to ensure that the guarantee receives
adequate market valuation in the current challenging global financial market environment.

141. Borrower and Lender: The Borrower is the Republic of Serbia. Following a
competitive international tender, which satisfied Serbian procurement rules, the GoS has selected
Société Générale as the lender. Following approval of the guarantee by the IBRD Board, and as
per process established in the Public Debt Law, the Parliament of Serbia will ratify the Indemnity
Agreement and adopt the Law authorizing the loan of Société Générale.

142. Guarantee Amount: This operation is a Policy-based Guarantee from the IBRD. The
guarantee will cover the principal amount of a commercial bank borrowing of up to EUR 300
million, not exceeding the equivalent of US$400 million, with a 6-year bullet maturity on a non-
accelerable basis. The loan proceeds would be made available to the Borrower upon the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement with Société Générale. The transaction is contingent on the
IBRD guarantee being in place at the time of signing.

143. Structure of the Loan: Société Générale has submitted a proposal to finance a 6 year
bullet loan, with principal amount guaranteed by IBRD, on a non-accelerable basis.

144. Interest rate of the Loan: The commercial loan offered by Société Générale carries an
interest rate equivalent to Euro swap rate plus 100bps. In addition, a 50bps arrangement fee is
included.

145. Disbursement: Upon approval of the guarantee and notification by the Bank of the
effectiveness of the Guarantee Agreement between the Bank and Serbia, the Borrower may
request withdrawal of the loan proceeds from the Private Lender within a defined drawdown
period. Serbia will utilize a portion of the proceeds of the loan to cover front end fees for the
PBG and annualized guarantee fees and deposit the remainder into a government account at the
National Bank of Serbia. The account will be managed by, and subject to control of, the
Ministry of Finance.

146. Guarantee Fees: Consistent with the current Bank policy, there is a front-end fee 25
basis points on the face value of the guarantee exposure and a guarantee fee of 50 basis points
per annum (equivalent to the contractual spread for loans) on the present value of Bank's
exposure from the transaction. The guarantee fee will be collected upfront on a net present value
basis, as per agreement with the GoS28.



26
   Based on the estimates received from the market.
27
   At the presumed IBRD's Euro discount rate of [2.9] percent for a maturity comparable to the proposed non-
callable period.
28
   The Bank's Board typically reviews the IBRD fees once a year at the beginning of the fiscal year. The present
value is calculated by using IBRD's estimated funding cost as a discount rate. The applicable Guarantee Fee
schedule as calculated above at the beginning of the transaction will prevail through the guarantee term.

                                                      43
147. Callability of the Guarantee: As the borrower, the Republic of Serbia, has the
obligation to ensure timely repayment to the lender(s). If Serbia fails to make a payment on the
uncovered interest obligation, the lender could seek to accelerate the loan. However, the Bank
will not pay the covered principal due to the lender until maturity. Alternatively, if Serbia fails
to make the guaranteed principal payment at maturity, the lender could call on the Bank's
guarantee for repayment of the amounts due. Following payment by the Bank under its
guarantee, the Bank would have sole discretion to decide whether to demand immediate
repayment from Serbia or to extend terms for repayment over time, and in the latter case, would
have sole discretion as to the terms to be extended.


                             VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

   A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

148. Poverty and unemployment have increased in Serbia since the onset of the crisis.
After significant poverty reduction between 2006 and 2008 when the share of households in
poverty declined from 8.8 to 6.1 percent (equivalent to more than 230,000 people being lifted out
of poverty), in 2009 the rate rose again to 6.9 percent. Similarly, according to labor force survey
data, the unemployment rate which had decreased to 14.9 percent as of April 2008, reached 18.8
percent in October 2009.

149. Social assistance targeting is being improved by reforms supported by the PEDPL2.
The GoS provides social assistance, including cash benefits and services, to poor households, in
addition to special purpose social programs. The main social assistance benefits are: (i) material
Support to Families (MOP in its Serbian acronym) for families whose income is lower than the
guaranteed "social security level", and (ii) child allowances - cash transfers to poor households
with children, including the families of redundant workers. Targeting under the programs will be
strengthened by policies supported by Pillar 3 of the PEDPL2 - strengthening social assistance
and protecting the most vulnerable.

150. Policies supported by pillar 1 (enhancing business environment) - and pillar 3
(strengthening the financial sector) of the PFSPBG are likely to help create jobs. Reform
measures under Pillar 1 are all targeted at decreasing business compliance costs, creating better
conditions for private local and foreign investments, and ultimately leading to job creation. The
reforms supported under Pillar 3 increased the safety of savings by increasing deposit insurance
coverage and enhancing payout speed. Furthermore, measures supporting banking sector
capitalization ensure that the system is stable and has enough resources to continue
intermediating.

151. Enterprise restructuring measures under Pillar 2 could have a potentially negative
impact on workers and hence on poverty levels. In practice it is highly unlikely that such
impact will materialize. Under Pillar 2, the GoS has committed to complete the privatization of
socially owned enterprises and to put into bankruptcy companies (private and socially owned)
with blocked accounts. Potentially three sets of workers could be affected: (i) workers of
companies with blocked accounts for which bankruptcy initiated, and (ii) workers of socially
owned companies that will be placed in bankruptcy/forced liquidation. In practice, over the past
year (the year over which the policy actions supported by this operation took place) the GoS has

                                                44
focused on filing for bankruptcy socially owned companies that could not be sold and on putting
companies with blocked account into bankruptcy. The employment impacts of these measures
are limited. For example, it is estimated that the 160 socially owned enterprises for which
bankruptcy was initiated in 2010 employed 1861 employees. As many workers have not been
receiving salaries for years, losing a job might not necessarily result in an income shock for their
households 29. Moreover, as claims for unpaid salaries rank either first or third in the list of
creditors' priority, employees are likely to receive part if not all of the due salaries in the
bankruptcy process. Concerns for a negative poverty impact have also been limited by the fact
that restructuring of large companies has been put on hold during the crisis, with the GoS
subsidies contributing to keep the firms afloat.

152. Formal measures to mitigate the employment shock on redundant workers are also
in place, such as the Transition Fund (see Box 4), and active labor market programs. The
World Bank is supporting the strengthening of active labor market programs by building
monitoring and evaluation capacity in this area, and by supporting the impact evaluation of one
of the largest programs in support of self-employment. As it is not possible to identify
retrenched workers from the privatization process in the existing household survey or labor force
data, and there is no tool for tracking their performance following dismissal, the statistical office
is exploring the option of introducing specific questions in the Labor Force Survey.30

                                            Box 4. The Transition Fund
The Transition Fund (TF) is a budget line with resources earmarked for severance pay in the budget of the MoERD.
The fund was set up in 2005 and has been managed by the MOERD since 2007. The GoS earmarked RSD 6.036
billion in 2010 to fund the Transition Fund (up from RSD 6.036 billion which was implemented in 2010).
Resources from the Transition Fund are allocated based on proposals for funding submitted to the MOERD by the
heads of state enterprises and state owned companies for which the restructuring or privatization process has started.
Proposals need to meet the criteria set by the MOERD and the Privatization Agency, and are reviewed by a
Committee set up for the purpose and signed by the Minister. Unions' agreement is required for the packages
provided.

The fund offers three (lump-sum) options for redundant workers: (i) remuneration amounting to 10 average gross
wages in the Republic in the industry sector for employees with more than 10 years of insurance record; (ii)
remuneration amounting to Euro 100 per year of service in Dinar equivalent; (iii) severance pay according to the
Law on Labor, which allows recipients to receive regular unemployment benefits. A fourth option administered by
the Employment Office exists for workers who are five years or less before retirement. Under this option workers
are paid up to 60 monthly installments equal to 60 percent of the average wage, as a sort of early retirement or
bridging retirement compensation. The Employment Office monitors whether the recipient is employed or not, and
stops the compensation when the recipient resumes work. The duration of unemployment benefits for the workers
who qualify varies with the number of years workers have been insured and the benefit size is 50-60 percent
(depending on the duration) of the average earnings in the month before employment contract was terminated.



     B. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

153. While the MOF is responsible for the overall implementation, monitoring and
evaluation is supported by various data sources collected by different stakeholders.
29
   Even if these jobs have stopped paying salaries, workers might have been able to receive benefits through GoS
programs covering health benefits and pensions to support workers. Those workers who would lose their health
insurance after redundancy can still receive health care either through a program for registered unemployed or for a
program for the uninsured.
30
   A major concern in this context is whether sample size would be appropriate to capture this group

                                                         45
Baseline and medium term outcomes are stated in the matrix (Annex 2). Stakeholders involved
in monitoring and evaluation include: (i) the MOF, (ii) the MOERD, (iii) the MoJ, (iv) the PA,
(v) the NBS, (vi) the DIA, and (vii) the SBRA. The baselines and outcomes are objective,
concrete and measurable indicators of economic, financial and institutional performance.

154. As specified in paragraph 31 of BP 14.25 (Guarantees), supervision will be carried
out in accordance with procedures applicable to Development Policy Lending (OP /BP
8.60). The Bank will complete an ICR evaluation of the PFSPBG transaction within one year of
its financial close (i.e. within one year after the issuance of the Guarantee). The policy impact of
the PFSPBG will be evaluated in a manner similar to development policy loans; the financial
impact will be assessed against the specific financial impact indicators detailed in the results
framework for this operation, including incremental market access, leverage and the costs to the
borrower. The assessment will take into account the volume, maturity, and costs of subsequent
market borrowings by the recipient countries.

155. As specified in paragraph 32 of BP 14.25, Implementation Status and Results
Reports (ISRs) will be completed annually until Guarantee expiration. These ISRs will
assess compliance of the GoS with contractual undertakings under the financing agreement and
whether circumstances exist that would lead to a call on the guarantee. ISRs will also assess, in
more detail as new information comes to light, the financial impact of the PFSPBG in terms of
increased market access, leverage etc.
   C. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

156. Two aspects of Serbia's fiduciary arrangements are relevant to the operation:              the
implications for the Bank assets of the guarantee and the consequences of activating            the
guarantee; and the public financial management (PFM) arrangements underpinning                  the
Government's capacity to manage resources to meet its obligations to the Bank under             the
facility.

157. The guarantee would involve no immediate transfer of funds from the Bank but
sufficient funds would need to be provisioned from the Bank assets to meet a call on the
guarantee if required. When called under conditions provided for under the Agreement, the
payment from the Bank will be made as a single payment to the lender or agent of the lender.
The indemnity agreement between Serbia and the World Bank provides that the former will
repay the latter on demand or as the Bank otherwise directs, if the guarantee is called.

158. The PFM arrangements in Serbia were assessed as high risk in the 2007 Public
Financial Management Assessment (PFMA) conducted by the Bank. More recent
assessments by the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department in December 2008 and 2009 concluded that,
although several key areas of the PFM system work well, important areas of budget coverage,
preparation and execution, accounting and fiscal reporting, internal controls, external audit and
debt and cash management require improvement.

159. The GoS has implemented improvements to the PFM since the 2007 PFMA
including full operation of a new financial management system and associated improvements in
budget execution and reporting arrangements. The State Audit Institution commenced audits of
the final accounts and budget beneficiaries and issued its first report in December 2009. The

                                                46
PFM arrangements continue to improve through revisions of the Law on Budget System in 2009
and 2010 to increase transparency, strengthen accountability and internal control, improve fiscal
responsibility oversight, improve administration of debt and cash management, and apply
international accounting and reporting standards. The GoS is being assisted in these reforms by
the Bank, the IMF, the EC and bilateral donors.

160. The corrective actions taken by the NBS to safeguard funds in the foreign exchange
account are deemed adequate. An IMF Safeguards Assessment, conducted in March 2009,
found that the NBS's framework had been strengthened and the quality of financial statements
and internal audit had improved since the initial assessment in 2001. Key recommendations
include strengthening external oversight of the NBS operations and amending the Law on NBS
to increase operational and financial independence, which have been addressed through
refinements to legislation.
   D. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

161. Policies supported under the PFSPBG are not expected to have negative impact on
the environment, as assessed under OP 8.60. The policies supported by Pillars 1 and 3 are not
likely to have any effect on the country's environment and natural resources, while those under
Pillar 2 would have a positive impact.

       Policies adopted under Pillar 1 have neutral impact on the environment. Legal and
       regulatory reforms adopted under Pillar 1 do not modify the existing environmental
       framework in any way; neither the RIA nor the comprehensive regulatory review deal
       with environmental matters.
       Policies adopted under Pillar 2 are likely to have a positive impact on the environment.
       As per existing Law on Privatization, an environmental audit is carried out prior to each
       privatization to identify historic and potential future liabilities.          Liability for
       environmental damage caused up to the date of privatization rest with the state, while
       private investors have to take ownership of potential future liabilities in compliance with
       the environmental management framework of Serbia. The framework has been assessed
       and is mostly compatible with relevant EU legislation, although operationalization of the
       framework has not been uniform.
       Legal and regulatory changes implemented under Pillar 3 do not allow the banking sector
       to circumvent environmental regulations governing investments.

   E. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

162. Two sets of risks have been identified, related to the macroeconomic situation and to
the political environment.

163. The residual macroeconomic risk has been identified as substantial. Serbia went into
the financial crisis with a high current account deficit, aggravated by rapid foreign currency
credit growth and large cross-border borrowing of domestic enterprises. An ongoing IMF
program hinges on ambitious fiscal adjustment targets and requires very significant external
financial support and private sector debt rollover. Specific risks include:



                                               47
       The global economic outlook, while improved, remains uncertain. Furthermore, potential
       fallout from weaknesses and risks in eurozone economies could have a significant impact
       on Serbia; Greece in particular has been the second largest investor in Serbia since the
       beginning of the transition. Economic risks are somewhat mitigated by the multilateral
       support package including from the IMF enhanced stand-by arrangement of EUR 3
       billion, developed in close cooperation with the proposed DPL.

       Despite external adjustment, Serbia faces considerable balance of payments financing
       needs over the next few years. Risks are somewhat mitigated by Serbia's pursuit of a
       robust agenda of policy reform, and as above, also by the size of the multilateral support
       package.

       Potential vulnerabilities of the banking sector remain in the context of substantially
       reduced profitability and stable but high NPLs. Key mitigating factor is the very high
       capitalization and liquidity of the system. As of September 2010, the aggregate CAR was
       20.1 percent and the banking system's liquid assets covered 40 percent of short term
       liabilities. While the sector has enough cushions to withstand the current rate of NPLs,
       which has stabilized at around 17.8 percent in recent months, an increase could pose a
       risk to the solvency of the system. Should such situation occur, the bank resolution
       framework supported by the PFSPBG provides the authorities with effective tools to deal
       with problem banks.

164. The residual political risk has been identified as moderate. Reforms underpinning the
program include potentially difficult ones, such as closure of loss making socially owned
enterprises for which there are no buyers in the current economic environment. The pace of
reforms could be undermined by the fact that the Government is based on a large coalition of
diverse political parties and that elections are expected to take place within a year and a half.
The political risk is mitigated by the economic crisis, which has highlighted the necessity and
urgency of reform, though significant challenges remain with implementation of key, but
unpopular, adjustment measures. Furthermore, the stability of the coalition government has been
boosted by the recent, unanimous decision of the EU Council to forward Serbia's membership
application to the European Commission for an opinion, thus bringing Serbia one step closer to
become an official candidate for EU membership.

Dear Sirs,

Pursuant to ongoing preparations for the PFSPBG Project (Private and Financial Sector Policy
Based Guarantee) and drafting the Letter of Development Policy aimed at continuing
cooperation with the World Bank, hereby we inform you on the status of a previously defined
benchmark for the activity to be implemented by the National Bank of Serbia in conformity with
the PFDPL 3 Project set during our previous cooperation with the World Bank.

Namely, one of the envisaged benchmarks set by the PFDPL 3 defines that the National Bank of
Serbia shall conduct diagnostic assessment of banks applying a methodology adopted within the
PFDPL 2 and if needed, impose extraordinary share capital increase in order to reach capital
adequacy of 12% at least.

The National Bank of Serbia conducted diagnostic assessment of banks in the period from May
to December 2009. Firstly the NBS performed direct diagnostic assessment as of 31 March 2009
assessing assets quality and its impact to banks capital adequacy indicator. In the second phase, it
performed stress testing using data obtained from the diagnostic assessment to indicate potential
adverse effects of deterioration in macroeconomic indicators. It was determined that there was no
need for special and extraordinary share capital increase, while several bank managed to improve
their capital position during that period upon presentation of results from assessment and stress
testing. Therefore the afore-said benchmark as well as the obligation of the National Bank of
Serbia in that respect has been fully accomplished.

It should be stressed that representatives of the World Bank and of the International Monetary
Fund were informed on the course and results of these activities during their regular visits to the
Republic of Serbia.

                                ANNEX 3: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.      Serbia has come a long way in improving its debt sustainability outlook during the last
decade, but both external and public debt levels remain elevated. Even after the restructuring of
Paris Club debt, public debt34 still stood at more than 100 percent of GDP in 2001, reflecting years of
economic stagnation and turmoil during the 1990s, which resulted in accumulation of liabilities on the
budget (most notably non-performing external debt, frozen foreign currency deposits and pension
arrears). Strong growth coupled with fiscal consolidation brought public debt down to 33 percent of
GDP by 2008. However, the recent global crisis reversed this trend and in 2010 public debt is
projected to have increased to around 43 percent of GDP.

2.      External debt35 declined from around 150 percent of GDP in 2000 to around 55 percent in
2004. With large capital inflows starting to go into Serbia in the middle of the decade, external debt
increased to 67 percent of GDP by 2007. External debt declined in 2008 to 63 percent of GDP as
private foreign investors retreated but public borrowing during the crisis increased the external debt to
GDP ratio to 79 percent by 2010.

3.      Under the baseline scenario outlined in the main text, both external and public debt
remain sustainable. External debt is projected to gradually decline to 67 percent of GDP by 2015
(Table A.1). Similarly, public debt is forecast to enter a declining path after 2010 and fall to 33 percent
of GDP by 2015. Strong policies and structural reforms (including those supported by Bank programs)
will underlie higher growth rates and improved public and external balances, underpinning the
declining path of both external and public debt over the forecasting period. Other debt and debt service
indicators also do not point to immediate areas of concern. After declining for several years, the ratio
of external debt to exports of goods and services spiked in 2009 at a high 279 percent, caused in part by
the crisis induced drop of exports. The ratio will remain high over the forecasting period, although
with the exports recovering in 2010 it is forecast to return to below 250 percent, and it is forecast to fall
to below 200 percent by 2013 on the back of improved export performance. The ratio of total external
debt service (debt amortization and interest payments on medium and long term debt) over exports of
goods and services is forecast to remain stable (around 40 percent) throughout the period. The ratio of
public debt over public revenues is forecast to peak in 2010 and is forecast to fall below 100 percent by
2014.

4.      Still, debt sustainability would be threatened if certain assumptions did not materialize.
External debt does not stabilize under a sluggish growth scenario while financing needs surge
temporarily under scenarios with one-off depreciation and underperforming current account. Public
debt is unsustainable in case the fiscal accounts fail to consolidate or growth underperforms. However,
given the commitment of the authorities to macroeconomic stability, supported also by past
performance and most recently by legislation adopted, the team believes that such an outcome is
unlikely.

A. External Debt

5.      Serbia's external debt is not excessive and is generally under favorable terms. Similar to
other countries in the region, Serbia's external debt was increasing prior to the crisis as the large
external imbalances were financed largely by private capital flows. However, private sector borrowing
quickly slowed down by late 2008 as the global crisis spread to Serbia and the region. Still, external
debt increased to 79 percent of GDP in 2009, as the country was able to borrow significant amounts as
part of the stabilization effort supported by the IMF, the World Bank and the EC, but also reflecting the
depreciation of the domestic currency36. As a result, the structure of debt is generally favorable: most
of the debt is medium and long-term and carrying favorable interest rates.

6.      Under the baseline scenario, external debt will gradually decline over the projection
period. External debt to GDP is forecast to remain stable in 2010 at 79 percent of GDP, before
entering a declining trend, supported by strong growth performance and a substantial adjustment of the
current account deficit. The current account deficit is projected to decline to below 6 percent of GDP
by 2015 aided by the realignment of the exchange rate, which depreciated by some 40 percent
nominally since the beginning of the crisis, thus improving prospects for exports and a more moderate
growth of imports, as well as by the gradual fiscal consolidation supported by the FRL. Gross
financing needs as percent of GDP are expected to gradually moderate while the export to debt ratio
improves.

7.     The sustainability of Serbia's external debt critically depends on the performance of
growth and exports and the stability of the exchange rate. External debt does not stabilize under
scenarios in which exports and growth consistently underperform, thus underlining the need for strong

  With most of Serbia's external debt euro or dollar denominated, the depreciation of the dinar accounted for roughly one
half of the increase in the debt to GDP ratio in 2009. While nominal GDP in dinars increased by some 3 percent in 2009, it
shrank by 11 percent and 15 percent respectively in euro and dollar terms. On the other hand, the debt stock expressed in
euro and dollar terms increased by 5 and 7 percent respectively.
                                                                  66
reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies. Also, there are some risks from exchange rate shocks.
Real depreciation of 30 percent would bring the external debt to GDP ratio to just over 110 percent.
While the debt/GDP ratio declines afterwards, gross financing needs remain elevated (Figure A. 1).
However, further large real exchange rate depreciation is deemed as unlikely. The real effective
exchange rate has already depreciated by almost 20 percent since the start of the crisis in September
2008 and according to the IMF's recent estimates it now appears to be slightly undervalued.
Furthermore, the reserves appear comfortable which should enable the Central Bank to mitigate
additional speculative pressures on the foreign exchange market37. The external debt stabilizes or
declines under all other scenarios considered (growth rate shock, interest rate shock etc.) though with
somewhat higher gross financing needs.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate
on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal
appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period
debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of
previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current
account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest
rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

NOTE: Large residual term in 2010 is mostly explained by exchange rate developments. About 77 percent of Serbia's
external debt at end-2009 was in Euros (approximately EUR 17.6 billion Euros out of the total debt of EUR 22.9 billion),
while DSA framework is in US Dollars. Euro is forecast to depreciate against the Dollar by some 10 percent, so the Euro
denominated debt stock is decreasing when expressed in Dollars. In fact, 17.6 billion Euros at end-2009 exchange rate is
US$25.3 billion, and according to forecasted end-2010 exchange rate it is US$22.7 billion. The difference is approximately
US$2.6 billion, or 7 percent of GDP. This significant difference, brought about by EUR/US$ exchange rate dynamics, is
offset by the residual term and hence it's large value.

B. Public Debt


8.       Serbia's public debt is modest by regional standards and large parts of it are under very
favorable terms. Over one fifth of the debt relates to frozen foreign currency deposits (FFCD) debts,
which carry a very low nominal interest rate of 2 percent. About one sixth of the debt is IBRD and
IDA debt. The average nominal interest rate on the entire debt stock is 2.5 percent38, resulting in a
significant element of concesionnality of public debt. About one half of Serbia's public debt is to
external creditors and one half to domestic creditors. However, with considerable part of domestic debt
being indexed to foreign exchange (including FFCD debt), around 72 percent of public debt is foreign
currency denominated.

9.      Under the baseline scenario, public debt is forecast to peak in 2010 at 43.5 percent of
GDP, and to gradually decline to 33 percent of GDP by 2015. Consolidation of the public debt will
be anchored by the recently adopted FRL, drafted in coordination with the IMF as part of the exit
strategy from the SBA. FRL will serve as a key commitment device that will underpin fiscal restraint
over the medium term in avoiding a shift back to the pre-crisis pro-cyclical fiscal policy behavior. FRL
sets numerical targets for the overall deficit and it also caps the public debt at 45 percent of GDP (not
including possible restitution debt).

38
 The average nominal interest rate was around 2.5 percent in the 2005­2009 period. It is forecast to increase to about 4
percent in next several years, because much of the new public debt is either T-bills or loans from commercial banks, which
carry a higher interest rate than the existing debt stock. The average inflation rate is forecast at 6.2 percent for 2010 and 9.4
percent in 2011. The combination of low nominal interest rates and moderate inflation implies that the real interest rate will
be around zero.
                                                               70
10.      Serbia's public debt outlook is sensitive to underperformance of growth and exchange rate
shocks. If the growth rate underperforms by two percentage points annually over the forecast period,
public debt does not stabilize and reaches 48 percent by 2015 (Figure A. 2). Towards the end of the
forecast period, gross financing needs in the case of growth rate shock would be some 5 percentage
points of GDP higher than in the baseline scenario. However, Serbia's track record under IMF, EU and
World Bank supported programs and its appropriate forward macroeconomic and development policy
programs should provide comfort that the policy mix will be appropriately adjusted to avoid such a
scenario. A scenario of no policy change (where key variables ­ real GDP growth, real interest rate,
and other identified debt-creating flows ­ remain at the level of the last projection year), further
illustrates the need to adjust policies in accordance with the baseline. On the other hand, with more
than 70 percent of public debt denominated in foreign currency, a real depreciation shock of 30 percent
would initially push the public debt to around 60 percent of GDP.39 Public debt would then gradually
decline. However, gross financing needs in this scenario would be some 4 percentage points of GDP
above the baseline. Public debt remains sustainable and financing needs only slightly elevated under
other scenarios considered (primary balance shock, interest rate shock, combined etc.).

11.      There are few sources of contingent liabilities that could affect public debt. Few public
enterprises are running large quasi-fiscal deficits. While most of their debt is already included in the
general government debt stock, (since they carry government guarantees40) additional risks could
emerge. Furthermore, according to the IMF, state subsidies to the private sector (interest subsidies on
loans) could potentially add up to 2 percent of GDP to public debt. However, recently adopted FRL
mitigates these risks by capping public debt at 45 percent of GDP (excluding possible restitution debt).
Contingent liabilities stemming from the financial sector (possible financial sector distress that could
lead to the need for public sector support of the financial system) seem minor given the degree of
capitalization and liquidity in the financial system. Finally, the restitution process, currently planned to
start in 2012, could increase debt by up to about 16 percent of 2010 GDP. However, experiences from
other countries of the region suggest that this debt is not recognized immediately, but over time and that
it carries favorable terms thus partly mitigating the risks.

   Ministry of Finance's Budget Memorandum estimates that 1 percent depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate
would increase the public debt to GDP ratio by 0.33 percentage points. Thus, nominal depreciation of 30 percent would
increase the public debt to GDP ratio by 10 percentage points.
40
   This includes debts of the Railroad Company and the Roads Company, which are two public enterprises with by far the
largest debt.

                                       The obligations of IBRD under the IBRD Guarantee constitute a
                                       guarantee of payment and not of collection. Any demand notice must
                                       be received by IBRD within ten (10) business days of the date any

                            guaranteed, and the benefit of such obligations may only be
                            transferred by a Lender in accordance with the provisions below, as

                          the Agent, as the case may be.

                          guarantor of the principal of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan as provided
                          therein and in no other capacity. IBRD shall incur no liability under

                                         Guaranteed Loan Agreement, including a restriction on the ability of
                                         the Lender(s) to accelerate the IBRD Guaranteed Loan upon a default
                                         by the Borrower under any World Bank loans such that the IBRD
                                         Guaranteed Loan may only be accelerated in the event of a material
                                         default on World Bank loans.

IBRD Guaranteed Loan   The terms and conditions of the IBRD Guarantee would be contained
Agreement:             in the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement among IBRD, the
                       Borrower and the Lender(s).

                       IBRD will represent and warrant to the Lender(s) that (in addition to
                       standard representations about due authorization, enforceability and
                       power to execute) its obligations pursuant to the IBRD Guaranteed
                       Loan Agreement rank pari passu with all other unsecured and
                       unsubordinated obligations of IBRD.

                       The Lender(s) will represent and warrant that they have not engaged
                       in and are not engaging in fraudulent, corrupt, coercive or collusive
                       practices, and will covenant, inter alia, to apply all amounts received
                       by them under the IBRD Guaranteed Loan Agreement towards
                       payment of the principal amounts covered by the IBRD Guarantee
                       which were the subject of the relevant demand notice.
Indemnity Agreement:   The Borrower would enter into a separate Indemnity Agreement with
                       IBRD. Under the Indemnity Agreement, the Borrower would
                       undertake to indemnify IBRD on demand, or as IBRD may otherwise
                       determine, for any payment made by IBRD under the terms of the
                       Guarantee. The Indemnity Agreement will follow the legal regime,
                       and include dispute settlement provisions, which are customary in
                       agreements between member countries and IBRD.

                       Any obligation by the Borrower to reimburse IBRD for payments
                       made under the IBRD Guarantee will rank pari passu with all other
                       external indebtedness of the Borrower, including external
                       indebtedness of the Borrower to IBRD.

                       The Indemnity Agreement will also contain provisions on the deposit
                       and use of proceeds of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan. The Borrower
                       shall agree to deposit the proceeds of the IBRD Guaranteed Loan in
                       an account acceptable to IBRD, with appropriate tracking of amounts
                       deposited therein in the Borrower's budget management system. The
                       Borrower will make withdrawals from such account for use in
                       support of its development policy program, and will agree not to use
                       such withdrawals to finance any excluded expenditures, which shall
                       include, inter alia, goods included in groups or subgroups of the
                       United Nations Standard International Trade Classification, Revision
                       3, military goods, environmentally hazardous goods, certain
                       payments prohibited by a decision of the United Nations Security
                       Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United
                       Nations, or expenditures with respect to which IBRD determines that
                       corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices were engaged in

                                         79
by representatives of the Borrower. If any such withdrawals are used
for excluded expenditures, the Borrower shall deposit an equivalent
