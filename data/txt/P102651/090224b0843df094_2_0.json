Serbia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, the Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included : First, Policy\n            Based Guarantee (PBGs)  are a potentially important\n            instrument that could be used effectively to support client\n            countries in tapping international markets on favorable\n            terms in combination with other lending and advisory\n            instruments to help countries meet the development\n            challenges of the twenty-first century. Second, this highly\n            satisfactory operation shows that the Bank can productively\n            take informed risks with new and innovative instruments to\n            support client needs in a timely fashion in a manner that\n            will not have been possible with standard instruments of\n            Bank support. Third, this operation shows that the PBG can\n            be a particularly effective instrument of budget support\n            under certain conditions. Fourth, the PBG can unlock\n            multiple benefits to the borrower, which may not be easily\n            captured by alternatives such as a standard Development\n            Policy Loan (DPL). Fifth, it is important to recognize that\n            risks such as a bullet repayment feature could add to the\n            borrower\u2019s risk of repayment in the future unless it is\n            accompanied by ex-ante provisions equal to the amount\n            required under a standard annual repayment schedule. Sixth,\n            strong and relevant design and high achievement are much\n            more likely when the operation\u2019s design is informed by\n            considerable knowledge work, intensive and longer term Bank\n            engagement and dialogue, and a relationship of trust between\n            the Bank and the borrower. Seventh, Bank staff engagement in\n            innovative operations must be more intensive and accompanied\n            by considerable informal technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2016-06-06T00:59:02Z"}
