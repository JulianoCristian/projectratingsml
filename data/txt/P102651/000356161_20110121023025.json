Private and\n            Financial Sector Policy Based Guarantee (PFSPBG) is to\n            support reforms in three policy areas: 1) enhancing business\n            environment to encourage private sector investment; 2)\n            strengthening financial discipline with continued reform of\n            the non private enterprise sector with a particular focus on\n            bankruptcy; and 3) building a stable and more efficient\n            financial sector through continued restructuring of state\n            holdings in banking, enhancing crisis preparedness,\n            supporting insurance sector development, and promoting\n            development of capital markets. This program document\n            describes the PFSPBG to the Republic of Serbia to support\n            the Government's structural reform program and mitigate\n            the effects of the global economic crisis. The Policy Based\n            Guarantee (PBG) is of up to EUR 300 million, not exceeding\n            the equivalent of US$400 million. It will cover the\n            principal amount of a commercial loan. The procurement\n            process for the lender to the Government of Serbia (GoS) is\n            in an advanced stage, the lead arranger has been selected by\n            the GoS, and the respective law is scheduled to be submitted\n            to the Parliament for approval upon approval of the PFSPBG\n            by the World Bank board. A policy based guarantee is in\n            light of Serbia's strong track record in macro,\n            structural and social policies, sustainable external\n            financing plan, and coherent borrowing strategy."}, "docdt": "2011-01-14T00:00:00Z"}
