Bank performance was highly\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: it is important\n            to maintain sufficient flexibility, particularly in the case\n            of programmatic policy development loans, to adapt and\n            respond to client needs and economic realities in the\n            country. Cooperation among international agencies like World\n            Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Swedish\n            International Cooperation Agency (SIDA), and with other\n            donors, in particular the European Union (EU), is essential\n            since extensive technical assistance has been provided and\n            needs to be coordinated and aligned with the country's\n            priorities and strategic goals."}, "docdt": "2011-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
