The project\n            did not achieve many of its objectives, institutional\n            development was negligible, sustainability is unlikely, and\n            the performance of both the Bank and Borrower was less than\n            satisfactory. Several lessons can be learned from this\n            project. First, industrial plantations have a part to play\n            in a balanced strategy for the development of the sector but\n            their establishment and maintenance will not be enough to\n            address the full gamut of social and environmental issues\n            that are implicated in forest depletion. In general,\n            forestry projects need to be broader in conception. Second,\n            the private sector should be involved in the sustainable\n            management of logging concessions. Finally, in designing\n            plantation projects, every attempt should be made to ensure\n            that funding arrangements will permit adequate maintenance\n            and fire protection."}, "docdt": "1993-08-13T00:00:00Z"}
