SANA'S WS.,\n            NAT'L COM. IMP., PUBLIC WORKS", "versiontyp": "Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was highly satisfactory, the\n            sustainability was likely, the institutional development\n            impact was substantial, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the borrower performance was highly\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned were as follows: (i)\n            baseline data on the key performance indicators that help in\n            measuring outcome and outputs should be gathered for each\n            area to be targeted by the Project. This will help first\n            establish good practices for regular and reliable data\n            collection; provide baseline data against which performance\n            can be better measured and help reduce the cost for carrying\n            out the usual impact assessment studies: (ii) through\n            confirmation of upstream and downstream activities, upfront\n            mitigation measures should be adopted. For water supply\n            subprojects proper assessment of aquifer resources need to\n            be addressed; for wastewater/sanitation subprojects,\n            existence of downstream facilities (wastewater treatment\n            facilities or other appropriate disposal facilities) should\n            be verified. (iii) an effective MIS system on monitoring\n            M&E is already in place. The systems and procedures\n            developed for monitoring, evaluation and control will need\n            to be expanded further to evaluate the periodic social\n            impact and beneficiary assessment surveys. (iv) during\n            subproject selection, strict screening of environmental\n            impacts is necessary which will also determine investment\n            needs to provide appropriate mitigation measures. (v)\n            sustainability through: (a) Financing - In order to ensure\n            sustainability, subproject selection should be based on\n            confirmation of adequate sources of funds needed from\n            government's budgetary allocation for operations and\n            maintenance of completed facilities. Also, in cases where\n            functioning of completed infrastructure is dependent upon\n            external support (other agencies, charitable trusts\n            providing equipment, furniture etc.), necessary confirmation\n            should be sought prior to start of implementation; (b)\n            Community participation - community involvement is crucial\n            in subproject identification and preparation and in securing\n            community contribution in cash or kind. This helps build a\n            sense of ownership which provides additional assurance on\n            sustainability for future operations and maintenance."}, "docdt": "2003-12-24T00:00:00Z"}
