Coastal Lands\n            Development Project is to increase and diversify production\n            and incomes of farm families by assisting Jiangsu and\n            Zhejiang provincial governments to develop coastal lowlands,\n            mudflats and shoals for culture fisheries.  The project\n            allows coastal dwellers to switch to culture fisheries from\n            the over-exploited offshore fishing industry and to\n            supplement their earnings with livestock and horticultural\n            activities.  The project aims to (a) develop mariculture by\n            constructing or improving about 10,100 ha of ponds for\n            shrimp, eels and laver (edible seaweed); (b) support animal\n            husbandry by providing breeding stock and on-farm\n            improvements; (c) promote agriculture by establishing fruit\n            and nut production bases; and (d) further the adoption of\n            technological advances by constructing pilot plants to test\n            new approaches in various fields of production and\n            processing.  The project includes support facilities, such\n            as feed mills, cold stores, processing plants and training\n            centers and local and overseas training for technical and\n            managerial staff and farmers."}, "docdt": "1988-03-04T00:00:00Z"}
