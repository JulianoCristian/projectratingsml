The primary objective of the project was to assist\n            the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to develop\n            coastal lands for culture fisheries. Bank performance was\n            generally satisfactory. Supervision missions were undertaken\n            about once a year, alternately to each province. Borrower\n            performance was generally satisfactory, with one\n            exception-compliance with covenants in Jiangsu. The\n            project's likely outcome cannot be reliably assessed in\n            the light of the uncertainties facing the two major project\n            components, shrimp and eel production, which account for two\n            thirds of the total project cost and which are generating\n            marginal or negative financial and economic benefits at\n            present. Owing to the uncertainty of the viability of eel\n            farming in the project area, government support should be\n            directed at improving the efficiency of existing facilities\n            rather than further expansion. Other lessons in the\n            agro-processing sector emphasize the importance of greater\n            attention to commercial aspects of feasibility studies,\n            direct contact between management and markets, and\n            management responsibilities and internal organization\n            conducive to motivation of both managers and workers."}, "docdt": "1995-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
