to reduce the transmission of HIV,\n            improve the quality of life of those infected and affected\n            by AIDS, and mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS in all sectors,\n            and at all levels of Malawian society. The various project\n            components follow. Prevention and advocacy aims at\n            behavioral change, and the prevention of HIV transmission.\n            To this end, a national reproductive health strategy will\n            provide the conceptual framework to targeted populations, to\n            mitigate the spread of the epidemic, which includes the\n            promotion of safe sex, such as the use of condoms, and,\n            incorporate as well life-skills education, and HIV/AIDS\n            information into educational curricula. Moreover, the\n            prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) provide\n            an opportunity for services delivery related to both\n            HIV/AIDS and STIs, through appropriate screening, treatment,\n            and health care. Voluntary counseling, and testing services\n            will be provided, as will, strengthened prevention of\n            mother-to-child transmission programs, through awareness\n            information, counseling, and health care prevention\n            interventions. The treatment, care, and support component\n            shall provide clinical care, and treatment interventions,\n            and, a community home-based care system would expand the\n            provision of health care. The impact mitigation component\n            will target communities, orphans, widows/widowers affected\n            by the epidemic, through public, private, and civil society\n            organizations, while the sectoral mainstreaming component,\n            through the national HIV/AIDS strategic framework, will\n            scale up responsiveness to the epidemic enabling mitigation\n            of the epidemic' impact on labor productivity, and\n            service delivery. Further components will focus on capacity\n            building, and partnerships to implement, and coordinate\n            responsiveness to the epidemic; research, and monitoring and\n            evaluation, to enable the National AIDS Commission\n            interventions, in the prevention, and care of the epidemic;\n            and, leadership and coordination to support policy related\n            issues, and, program management to support procurement,\n            financial management, and institutional development."}, "docdt": "2003-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
