                         The project is coming to a close on September 30, 2012. There has been a significant increase over the life of the projectincapacity for service delivery of preventive, diagnostic,
                         therapeutic and mitigation services. The 2010 Malawi DemographicandHealth Survey data indicates positive progress in changing risky behaviors, such as significant reductions in
                         the percentageofsexually active women and men (15-49 years) having sex with a more than one partner (non-regular partner) in the last 12months.Notable achievements have been
                         made in expanding treatment coverage: the number of HIV infected adults and childrenreceiving ARVshas reached over 300,000 exceeding the end of project target. Overall, the
