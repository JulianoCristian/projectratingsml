impacts of HIV/AIDS on the\n            infected and affected people, through a community and\n            multisectoral approach. The project anticipates several\n            impacts. The institutional and legal framework is weak, the\n            Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) is not a priority in the\n            national health policy, and the institutional framework\n            lacks a strategic plan, clear responsibilities, specific\n            guidelines, and procedures in HCWM. Absence of reliable data\n            on amount of waste produced, inadequate pre-collection,\n            collection, and storage of containers, unsustainable HCW\n            treatment systems, and inadequate financial resources.\n            Hospital staff, collection staff, scavengers, and people\n            using recycled objects come into direct contact with HCW and\n            are liable to HIV/AIDS contamination. The general public\n            needs information about the dangers related to the materials\n            collected. Lack of external transportation of HCW\n            constitutes a major constraint for health centers. Solid\n            waste management suffers from lack of financial support from\n            the state and local governments. The objectives for the\n            prevention and mitigation plan include a plan to reduce\n            infections due to HCW, improve service in HCWM, and\n            establish a well-managed multi-sector institutional\n            framework for coordination and implementation of HCWM measures."}, "docdt": "2003-07-04T00:00:00Z"}
