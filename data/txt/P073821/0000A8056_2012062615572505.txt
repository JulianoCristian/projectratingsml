                         Project implementation is proceeding without any major obstacles. All audits and reports have been received on schedule. There has been a significant increase over the life of the
                         project in capacity for service delivery of preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic andmitigation services. The 2010 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey data indicates positive
                         progress in changing risky behaviors, such as significant reductions in the percentage of sexually active women and men (15-49 years) having sex with a more than one partner (non-
                         regular partner) in the last 12 months. For treatment, there is also good news as the number of HIV infected adults and children receiving ARVs has reached over 300,000 exceeding

                         the end of project target. HIV prevalence is 10.6 percent for adults (age 15-49), down from 11.8 percent in 2004. Projections suggest that prevalence will continue to decline to about
                         9 percent in 2016.
