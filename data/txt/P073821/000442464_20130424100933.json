This is achieved through (i) reducing\n            the administrative burden on the coordinating body (NAC)\n            through joint work programming, accounting, and reporting\n            systems; (ii) enabling the coordinating body to develop a\n            strategic, integrated approach to coordinating the national\n            response; and (iii) building local ownership of the national\n            program as a whole.
