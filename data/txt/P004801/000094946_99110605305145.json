Key lessons with operational and strategic\n            implications for the design of future power sector projects\n            are as follows: 1) Provincial Electricity Authority's\n            (PEA) bureaucratic and cumbersome procurement process\n            resulted in a lengthy procurement cycle. Bank's\n            involvement with PEA over the years was ineffective in\n            remedying the situation, as most procurement decisions for\n            sizable contracts are undertaken at the Board level, over\n            which counterparts at PEA management had little control. 2)\n            Early approval by the Highway Department of the transmission\n            lines design must be sought to avoid bureaucratic delays\n            during implementation. Similarly, land acquisition should be\n            completed before the start of project implementation, or at\n            least, a realistic and concrete time-bound action plan\n            should be developed and followed through with close\n            monitoring by the Bank and the implementing agency. 3) The\n            Bank should be more proactive in enforcing coordination\n            among the Project Teams and Project co-financiers. With\n            better coordination in place, some mismatch in the\n            construction schedules for the transmission lines and\n            associated substations could be avoided."}, "docdt": "1999-10-18T00:00:00Z"}
