Project\n            will contribute to Egypt's plans to almost quadruple\n            the country's telecommunication investment program,\n            which has lagged badly behind other sectors, by financing\n            the rehabilitation and expansion of the telecommunication\n            systems in the smaller towns and villages. The project will\n            provide primarily for: (i) the installation of 67,500 lines\n            of semi-automatic exchange equipment in small towns; (ii)\n            the rehabilitation and re-installation of about 60,000 lines\n            of manual exchanges in rural areas; (iii) the replacement\n            and expansion of outside plant networks for about 180,000\n            lines; and (iv) the rehabilitation and expansion of long\n            distance networks. In addition the project will help\n            strengthen ARENTO's organization and financial\n            position. Project benefits include direct support for\n            development in rural areas, with more timely availability of\n            inputs and improved marketing and social services."}, "docdt": "1981-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
