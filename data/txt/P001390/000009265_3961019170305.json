Implementation of the project, was\n            fraught with problems almost from the onset. With little\n            movement on the ground, by the end of 1992 it became\n            apparent that there were major problems of communication and\n            coordination between the two ministries. Efforts to\n            restructure project management in 1993 to provide for\n            greater autonomy of action, and budgets, for the Ministries\n            of Agriculture (MOA) were to no avail. Throughout the period\n            of implementation, Lesotho went through periods of political\n            instability due to events both endogenous and exogenous (in\n            particular the momentous changes occurring in the Republic\n            of South Africa). This instability affected project\n            implementation through changes in governmental structures\n            and the ability to take consistent decisions regarding the\n            role of chiefs and the powers of the Development Councils,\n            as well as amendments to land legislation. In the last years\n            of the project, the resurgence of democracy brought to the\n            local level a new factionalism based on political\n            affiliation. Any assessment of project implementation must\n            take into account the underlying political conditions\n            prevailing in Lesotho."}, "docdt": "1995-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
