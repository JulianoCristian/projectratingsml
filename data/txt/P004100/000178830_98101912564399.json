 agricultural marketing information center; constructing\n            market-related roads and utilities; establishing an\n            agricultural wholesale market authority, the Garag-dong\n            Agricultural Market Authority (GAMA); carrying out a\n            countrywide study of the agricultural marketing system and\n            related public policies leading to the preparation of an\n            agricultural marketing master plan for Korea; and training\n            in agricultural wholesale marketing practices for\n            wholesalers and government officials. It would promote a\n            more competitive price formation mechanism by introducing\n            auction sales, and foster reduction in marketing costs by\n            shortening distribution channels, by reducing intra-market\n            congestion, and by building the new market in a readily\n            accessible location on the outskirts of Seoul. Realization\n            of the project benefits will depend on improved standards of\n            wholesale market management."}, "docdt": "1982-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
