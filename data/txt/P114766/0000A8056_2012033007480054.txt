                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Construction of the Moinak Hydropower Plant (MHPP) was completed on schedule and in January 2012 it was commissioned, feeding 150 MW new capacity into the national grid
                         through the MHPP–Shelek Substation (SS) transmission line financed from the Bank loan. Of the associated non-Bank financed transmission facilities, the outdoor switchyard at the
                         MHPP and reconstruction of the Shelek SS and Robot SS were also completed on schedule.

                         Implementation preparatory measures for the second line (MHPP-Robot SS) are in full progress. Final designs for this line were approved by the State Expertise in November 2011.
                         Construction completion is expected by August 30, 2012 whereby 150 MW of additional capacity will be made available for the southern region of Kazakhstan experiencing power
                         deficits during winter peak loads.
