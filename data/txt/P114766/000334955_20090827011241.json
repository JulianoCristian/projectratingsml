Electricity\n            Transmission Project for Kazakhstan is to increase and\n            improve the supply of electricity to business enterprises\n            and households in southern Kazakhstan in an economically and\n            environmentally sustainable manner. There are three\n            components to the project. The first component of the\n            project is construction of transmission lines. It consists\n            of the following sub-components: A) construction of Overhead\n            Transmission Line (OHTL) from Moinak Hydroelectric Power\n            Plant (MHPP) to Shelek Substation (SS): this involves the\n            construction of about 97 km long 220 kV single circuit OHTL;\n            and B) construction of OHTL from MHPP to Robot SS: this\n            involves the construction of about 225 km long 220 kV\n            single-circuit OHTL. The second of the project is\n            modernization of SS. It consists of the following\n            sub-components: A) construction of 220/110 kV Outdoor\n            Switchyard (OSY) at MHPP: the works include the construction\n            with a configuration consisting of double main busbars and\n            transfer bus and installation of circuit breakers,\n            disconnect switches, current and voltage transformers, and\n            lightning over voltage and relay protection systems; B)\n            modernization of 220 kV Robot SS: the works include the\n            reconstruction of the existing 220 kV switching topology and\n            installation of circuit breakers, disconnectors, current and\n            voltage transformers, and lightning over voltage and relay\n            protection systems; and C) modernization of 220 kV Shelek\n            SS: the works include the reconstruction of the existing 220\n            kV switching topology and installation of circuit breakers,\n            disconnectors, current and voltage transformers, and\n            lightning over voltage and relay protection systems. The\n            third component of the project is consulting and technical\n            services. It consists of the following components: A)\n            procurement and project management: this comprises\n            consulting services for procurement and project management,\n            including: the preparation o f bidding documents, assistance\n            in bid evaluation and implementation supervision; and B)\n            technical services: these include support for selection of\n            the transmission routes, conduct of engineering surveys and\n            engineering supervision of the turn-key contracts during construction."}, "docdt": "2009-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
