                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All planned project activities have been completed. The first of the two transmission line was commissioned in June 2012 and with the completion of the second line in November
                         2012, the Moinak Hydroelectric Power Plant (MHPP) became fully operational. The MHPP has resulted in (i) an additional installed clean electricity generation capacity of 300 MW in
                         the power deficit southern Kazakhstan region, (ii) additional generation of over 350 MWh in the first five months of 2012, (iii) actual reduction of the regional peak capacity deficit by
                         202 MW (from 865 MW to 663 MW ), and (d) elimination of load shedding in the Almaty power region from 80 MW to zero.
