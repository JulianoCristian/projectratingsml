                         Moinak Hydroelectric Power Plant (MHPP) became fully operational. The MHPP has resulted in (i) an additional installed clean electricity generation capacity of 300 MW in the power
                         deficit southern Kazakhstan region, (ii) additional generation of over 501 MWh in 2012, (iii) reduction of the regional peak capacity deficit by 302 MW (from 865 MW to 563 MW ), and
                         (d) elimination of load shedding in the Almaty power region from 80 MW to zero.
