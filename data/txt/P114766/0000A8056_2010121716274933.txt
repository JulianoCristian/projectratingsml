                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation schedule of this operation was updated during the supervision mission of Sept. 21-24, 2010. The mission reinforced the importance of synchronizing the
                         transmission project implementation schedule with the ongoing construction of the Moinak Hydroelectric Power Plant (MHPP). The mission visited the construction site and was
                         informed that both hydro power units will be completed in Dec. 2011 with a high degree of certainty. Reflecting the timely construction of MHPP, the completion date (end-Oct. 2011)
                         for the transmission line MHPP-Shelek SS has been set accordingly. The mission noted that this is a very demanding schedule for KEGOC which does not allow any slippage in

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Because of the estiemted cost figure reported for the line-construction package, the ISR should not be disclosed until the line-construction tenedre is completed and the contract
                         signed. This is in keeping with KEGOC's request during negotiations.
