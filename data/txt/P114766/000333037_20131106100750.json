outcome\n            was low or negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: the Bank standard\n            prequalification criteria are ill-suited for selecting a\n            qualified contractor at a reasonable price for the turnkey\n            design-supply-install contractor where tight delivery period\n            is critical. For the selection of a turnkey\n            design-supply-install contractor under a tight delivery\n            period stricter prequalification criteria should be applied;\n            while restricting competition, only those companies which\n            have experience of similar turnkey contracts implemented\n            within short period and outside of the country of their\n            origin should be prequalified for such contracts. Lack of\n            consistent and close involvement of a qualified social\n            scientist on the team experienced with land acquisition\n            issues both during preparation and especially during\n            implementation resulted in excessive delays in approving the\n            Land Acquisition Plan (LAP) and risked the project becoming\n            out of compliance with a safeguard covenant in the Loan\n            Agreement. This shows that even projects that have limited\n            land acquisition and no relocation of persons still require\n            adequate attention and resources from the Bank's team.\n            It also highlights the importance of upfront technical\n            assistance and capacity building to the client. As with most\n            Bank projects, the development of long relationships with\n            the implementing agency helped to create mutual trust and\n            understanding, which in turn facilitated resolution of\n            problems that arose during the course of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2013-10-30T00:00:00Z"}
