                         The primary project objective is to increase and improve the supply of electricity to business enterprises and households in southern Kazakhstan in an
                         environmentally sustainable manner.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation schedule (IS) of this operation was updated during the supervision mission of May 10-18, 2011. With the Moinak Hydropower Plant (MHPP) construction firmly on
                         track for completion in December 2011, the mission reinforced the importance of closely synchronizing the transmission project IS with that of the MHPP. The mission noted that the
                         IS a very demanding, not allowing any further slippage. KEGOC plans to finish the construction of one of the two transmission lines (MHPP/Shelek SS) by November 2011 along with
                         associated investments (construction of the switchyard at MHPP and reconstruction of the Shelek SS).

                         Concerning the Bank-financed package #Design, Supply and Construction of MHPP/Robot SS and MHPP/Shelek SS,# the contract valued at US$18,518,000.50 and KZT

                         3,947,239,000.00 was signed with the Consortium KEPCO and Hyundai Corp. (Korea) on March 1, 2011. KEGOC has voiced concerns about the slow responsiveness of the
                         Contractor, including delayed submission of relevant documentation for the signing of sub-contracts with local companies. To address these delays, KEGOC has organized Contract
                         Implementation Progress Meetings on a regular basis. Apparently, the Contractor is not fully cooperating with PMD of KEGOC in implementing the agreements reached at these
                         meetings. Considering the tight schedule for construction of the MHPP/Shelek SS line section, the mission has urged KEGOC to continue the efforts for establishing an effective
                         contract implementation process.
