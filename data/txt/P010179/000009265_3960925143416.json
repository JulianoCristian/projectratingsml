The project achieved all physical works\n            envisaged at appraisal, its impact on agricultural\n            development has been substantial, sustainability is likely,\n            and both the Bank and Borrower performed satisfactorily.\n            Several lessons can be learned from this project. First,\n            when water from a tubewell is shared by 100 different\n            farmers, imposing a disciplined O&M (Operation &\n            Maintenance) system is crucial to project success. Second,\n            the DCA (Development Credit Agreement) was amended to allow\n            for the submission of accounts and audit reports up to 12\n            months after the closing date of the fiscal year. Third,\n            unnecessary stipulations in the DCA that failure by farmers\n            to carry out the construction of field channels will cause\n            the project to undertake this construction and recover the\n            costs from the beneficiaries. Fourth, as lowland areas\n            minimize the use of irrigation water, the selection of areas\n            for construction of tubewell irrigation systems should be\n            carefully done. Lastly, the use of SA (Special Accounts)\n            should be avoided in the future if HMGN's (His\n            Majesty's Government of Nepal) rules cannot be simplified."}, "docdt": "1992-04-02T00:00:00Z"}
