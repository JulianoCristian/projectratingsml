canals, where seepage is excessive;\n            works for increasing capacity of 850 km of canals, and\n            construction of 160 control structures and of about 4,000\n            tertiary outlets; on-farm development by construction of\n            irrigation, drainage ditches and cart-tracks to serve about\n            50,000 ha of irrigated land, realignment of farm boundaries\n            for improved irrigation, drainage and road facilities, and\n            landshaping to ensure efficient irrigation; (b) road\n            improvements comprising work on about 250 km of roads; (c)\n            afforestation and erosion control; (d) construction of\n            project organization buildings and minor flood protection\n            and silt removal works; (e) strengthening of agricultural\n            research and extension, procurement of 15,000 nutrient tons\n            of fertilizer and its distribution to project farmers; (f)\n            provision of measures for aquatic weed control in the major\n            canals; (g) training of CAA staff in on-farm development;\n            (h) carrying out of further studies of hydrology, reservoir\n            system operations, consumptive use, drainage design,\n            construction methods for on-farm development, crab ecology,\n            and aquatic weed control, and a feasibility study."}, "docdt":
