MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:         Project Completion Report on Guinea
Industrial Rehabilitation and Promotion
Proiect (Credit 1234-GUI)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report on Guinea - Industrial
Rehabilitation and Promotion Project (Credit 1234-GUI)" prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The
Borrower did not prepare a Part II.
The PCR is of inadequate quality. Although three of the four state-owned enterprises were
reportedly rehabilitated prior to privatization, there is no discussion of the rehabilitation experience and
outcome, nor is there any indication that the accounts of these enterprises were audited and their net worth
established as required by Section 4.02a of the Development Credit Agreement. The PCR also lacks a
meaningful account of the privatization process and results. The PCR contains factual and data errors
particularly in respect of the rehabilitated enterprises and the amount disbursed from the line of credit.
Halfway through implementation, the project was overtaken by events. The Government and the
Bank decided to utilize a substantial part of project funds in support of the reform program and SAL I
initiated in 1986. This was made possible partly because the project was facing difficulties in disbursing
the funds allocated for the promotion of private sector investment. As the PCR rightly concludes, since
the project's objectives and design changed radically during implementation, it would have been more
efficient to undertake a full mid-term review or a complete reappraisal of project objectives and to respond
to new challenges brought about by the far-reaching economic reforms. Overall, project performance is
rated as unsatisfactory, with uncertain sustainability and only partial institutional impact.
In the wake of this experience, the Bank and the Government of Guinea have embarked on two
related projects namely Private Sector Promotion and Public Enterprise Sector, in 1990 and 1992,
respectively. These later projects may well deepen the process started with Industrial Rehabilitation
Project.
An audit of this project may be carried out at a later date because it is the first in the industrial
sector of Guinea.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
INDUSTRIAL REHABILITATION AND PROMOTION PROJECT
(Credit 1234-GUI)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Industrial Rehabilitation
and Promotion Project in Guinea, Credit 1234-GUI, for which SDR 16.0 million (US$19.0
million equivalent) was approved on April 24, 1982. The Credit was closed on December 31,
1992, after two extensions of the Closing Date. The last Credit disbursement was processed
on February 4, 1992. A total amount equivalent US$ 223,246.73 will be canceled as soon as
the initial amount on the Special Account is recovered.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Industry and Energy Division
of Occidental and Central Africa Department, Africa Regional Office. A review of the
Project from the Borrower's perspective was not submitted to IDA. The PCR does not,
therefore, include Part II.
The PCR is based on an IDA mission to Guinea, the Staff Appraisal Report,
legal documents, supervision reports, and miscellaneous reports and correspondence in the
project files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
INDUSTRIAL REHABILITATION AND PROMOTION PROJECT
(Credit 1234-GUI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.           Objectives. This Project was the first IDA operation in the industrial sector
in Guinea. The objectives of the project, as described in the staff appraisal report (SAR),
were to (a) create within the Ministry of Industry a capacity for industrial sector policy
formulation and planning; (b) support the Government's efforts in transferring some of its
responsibilities for national production, import substitution and employment creation from the
public sector to the private sector; and (c) improve the performance of state-owned industrial
enterprises through selective rehabilitation programs and relaxation of Government controls,
thereby increasing foreign exchange earnings, employment creation and regional development
(para. 3.01).
2.           The project consisted of the following components: (a) rehabilitation of four
state-owned enterprises through the provision of equipment, civil works, imported materials,
engineering, technical assistance and training; (b) feasibility studies of two other state-owned
enterprises (slate and ornamental stones); (c) a line of credit equivalent to US$ 8.8 million for
private sector enterprises channeled through the Credit National pour le Commerce,
l'Industrie et de l'Habitat (CNCIH); (d) technical assistance to CNCIH, and to the Ministry of
Small and Medium Scale Enterprises; (e) three man-years of technical assistance (TA) to the
Government to assist in the formulation of industrial policy and planning; and (f) financing
for the foreign costs of the external audit of all IDA project components (para. 3.02).
3.           Project objectives and design were modified during project implementation.
In 1985, three years following the approval of the Project, the new government which
replaced Sekou Toure's 25-year rule, introduced radical and far-reaching structural reforms
which led to unprecendented changes in the Guinean economy. These changes included the
dismantling of the banking system, which resulted in the liquidation of CNCIH; the
liquidation/privatization of state-owned enterprises; and the banning of state controls on
prices, wages and import and export licensing (para. 3.06).
4.           The reforms had a significant impact on the IDA Project and led to
considerable modifications in project objectives and design. The Project was given a new
orientation which aimed at supporting on-going policy reforms to strengthen the financial
sector, to improve institutional capacity and to promote the private sector. The scope of the
T.A. component was broadened and the amount alloted to it was increased, through a
reallocation from the slow disbursing components, to finance the extensive technical assistance
which was necessary to assist the Government in the implementation of the reform program
(para. 3.07).



- iv -
5.            Implementation Experience. Project implementation did not proceed as
smoothly as anticipated. Neither the Ministry of Industry, which coordinated the IDA
Project, nor CNCIH, had the capacity to manage the Project and channel IDA funds to sub-
borrowers. Technical assistance, provided to all implementing agencies, did not have
immediate results and implementation did not improve. This may be partly because
Government agencies were not committed to private enterprise development objectives, given
their earlier political orientation. Commitments as well as disbursements continued to be slow
(para. 4.01).
6.            Foliowing the reform program and Guinea's transformation into a market
economy, the Ministry of Industry had great difficulty in adopting the role of promoting,
rather than controlling, the private sector. To a certain degree, the Project lost its sense of
focus and direction and resulted in financing ad-hoc technical assistance activities related to
the implementation of the reform program.
7.            Following the modifications of the project and its objectives, project
implementation became more difficult and all Government requests for financing required
careful screening by IDA to assure that they were relevant Project's overall goal.
Disbursements remained slow and the closing date had to be extended twice, from 1988 to
1991. In 1989, uncommitted funds from the line of credit were reallocated to technical
assistance. The project took almost nine years to implement compared to the five originally
planned. Although the depth of the dialogue between the Government and the Bank improved
in the framework of structural and sectoral reforms, in retrospect, it would have been more
efficient to undertake a full mid-term review or a complete reappraisal of the project, to
respond to the new challenges brought about by the far-reaching economic reforms (para.
4.02).
8.             Project Results.  The bulk of the Credit was allocated to implement the
1985 reform program. These efforts included the restructuring of Guinea's financial sector,
technical assistance for diagnostic studies and managerial and financial reviews of selected
state-owned enterprises, which were a prerequisite to privatization, and for institution building
of the various Government agencies involved in industry and SME promotion. This outcome
constitutes a significant variation between planned and actual project objectives yet was a
crucial input to Guinea's Structural Adjustment Program (para. 5.01-5.23).
9.              The Credit also financed the rehabilitation of a selected number of state-
owned enterprises, most of which were privatized after the reforms. The IDA line of credit,
although significantly reduced, financed 54 small scale enterprises, for a total of SDR 4.4
million, in sectors such as agro-industry, wood-working and services. In the absence of
recent information on these enterprises from BICIGUI (which took over the execution of the
Project at the demise of CNCIH), it is not clear how many are still in operation, although a
large number are in arrears. Technical assistance was also provided to BICIGUI as well as
the Ministry of Industry which was responsible for the local administration of the Project
(paras. 5.08-5.09).
10.           Sustainability. The Project financed important studies on the privatization of
state-owned enterprises amd assisted in the restructuring of Guinea's financial sector. These



aspects have the potential to be sustainable. However, as far as institution building is
concerned the sustainability of measures introduced and contributions made by the Project is
questionable. While extensive technical assistance and training were financed through Credit
proceeds, it is difficult to assess their impact on the performance of the Ministry of Industry.
Following the reforms, the institutional and political context changed significantly and
subsequent Government reshuffles brought considerable modifications in the organization the
Ministries concerned, as well as the Central Bank. The depth of the dialogue between the
Government and the Bank improved in the framework of structural and sectoral reforms and
continue in the context of the IDA Private Sector Promotion Operation, which is in execution
(para. 6.01).
11.           The transformation of the Ministry of Industry's (MI) philosophy from one of
central control to a market orientation proved difficult. MI has not been able to play the the
role required to make the measures introduced by the Project sustainable. Neither could it be
achieved through expatriate consultant-local counterpart relations. The Ministry's mission is
now one of regulation and policy formulation rather than execution and it may take some time
for it to feel confident in this new role. At this stage, however, it lacks the capacity to design
and implement growth-oriented industrial policies and private enterprise development
programs (para. 6.01).
12.           Conclusions and Lessons Learned. The Project's objectives and design were
changed radically during implementation. Nevertheless, judged against the conditions which
existed in Guinea when the Project became effective, significant progress has been achieved in
improving the country's economic environment. The Project contributed to this success, but
only in preparing the ground for further reforms. The process is far from completed and
most measures introduced by the Project are not conclusive. The Project's most noticeable
contribution, namely the restructuring of the banking sector, cannot be considered a complete
sucess. Primary banks remain weak, non-profitable and financially insecure. Most of the
new banks, carry unproductive portfolios and are faced with high level of arrears and with
resource shortages.
13.           Another weak outcome of project efforts is Government's failure to improve
the investment climate in Guinea. Private operators remain skeptical about the stability of the
macro-environment and the safety of investments. It is also unclear whether staff training and
expatriate expertise has appreciably improved skills and administrative procedures in the
ministries and agencies monitoring the industrial sector. Overall, despite extensive technical
assistance, these institutions remain weak. The previous confusing and difficult institutional
and legal environment still has its effects on economic patterns and the business community's
attitudes. Nevertheless, the support provided by IDA to Government efforts to accelerate
implementation of the reform program resulted in the disengagement of the state from
productive economic activities and initiating an embryo of a private sector development
program. Government policies and attitudes toward the private sector have started to shift
from discrimination to acceptance and further support.
14.           The main lessons learned from this experience are the following:



- vi -
(a)   In designing projects of this type, more attention should be given to analyzing
the strengths and weaknesses of target institutions, including their ability to
manage, efficiently, the different components included in the Project. Project
objectives should be measured against local institutional capacity to implement
the Project;
(b)   Local project management capacity must be fostered in order to ensure that
institution-building takes place;
(c)    Commercial Banks should be pressured to be more rigorous in supervision of
their sub-borrowers as well as in their collection practices; and
(d)   In retrospect, given the open-ended re-orientation that the Project asumed
following the reforms, it would have been more efficient to undertake a full
mid-term review or a complete reappraisal of project objectives and to
respond to new challenges brought about by the far-reaching economic
reforms.

Sector               Industry
2.    BACKGROUND
2.01         Guinea is blessed with natural resources which make it one of Africa's most
richly endowed countries. It is in particular a major producer and exporter of bauxite and
other minerals. It also offers strong agricultural potential resulting from abundant land
resources and rainfall. At independence in 1958, the country was a leading exporter of
bananas and other agricultural commodities to European markets. Yet, the country is now
considered among the least developed countries in Africa.
2.02         Under the regime of Sekou Toure (1958-1984), the private industrial sector
was displaced by a pervasive network of state-owned enterprises in manufacturing, which
operated through an elaborate system of administered prices, which held monopolies over all
exports, over most trading and over most industrial activities. The official sector was
functioning under an elaborate and ineffective system of administered prices and emphasis on
state enterprises failed to produce the desired modernization and industrialization of the
economy. A poor incentive structure pushed the dynamic agricultural sector into subsistence
production. Following the sharp drop in agricultural production, Guinea had become by the
mid-1970s a net importer of food and increasingly relied on bauxite exports.
2.03         The performance of state-owned manufacturing enterprises deteriorated
throughout the 70s. Production levels decreased to 10-30% of capacity, due to worn out
equipment and lack of spare parts and raw material. In an effort to improve their
performance, the Government reappraised its industrial policy to focus on: (a) rehabilitating
all state-owned enterprises; (b) increasing production; and (c) reorganizing and providing
public manufacturing enterprises with greater managerial autonomy.



- 2 -
2.04          In 1979, Guinea requested the Bank's assistance to rehabilitate state-owned,
manufacturing enterprises and to promote SMEs. The Industrial Rehabilitation and Promotion
Project was the first Bank involvement in the industrial sector in Guinea.
3.     PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01           The objectives of the project, as described in the staff appraisal report (SAR),
were to: (a) create within the Ministry of Industry a capacity for industrial sector policy
formulation and planning; (b) support the Government's efforts in transferring some of its
responsibilities for national production, import substitution and employment creation from the
public sector to the private sector; and (c) improve the performance of state-owned industrial
enterprises through a selective rehabilitation and relaxation of Government controls and
thereby furthering their objectives of foreign exchange earnings, employment creation and
regional development.
3.02          The project consisted of the following components: (a) rehabilitation of four
state-owned enterprises through the provision of equipment, civil works, imported materials,
engineering, technical assistance and training; (b) feasibility studies of two other state-owned
enterprises (slate and ornamental stones); (c) a line of credit equivalent to US$ 8.0 million for
private sector enterprises channeled through the Credit National pour le Commerce,
l'Industrie et de l'Habitat (CNCIH); (d) technical assistance to CNCIH, and to the Ministry of
Small and Medium Scale Enterprises; (e) three man-years of technical assistance to the
Government to assist in the formulation of industrial policy and planning; and (f) financing
for the foreign costs of the external audit of all IDA project components
3.03          The line of credit was initially for an amount of US$8.8 million. The
maximum repayment period was set at 20 years with 10 years of grace for industrial
rehabilitation sub-projects and to a maximum of 15 years with an eighteen month grace period
for private sector SMEs. The maximum rate of interest was 13%, with final sub-borrowers
assuming the foreign exchange risk. The inflation rate between 1978 and 1982 was estimated
to be an average of 3.7 percent per annum.
3.04           Furthermore, in order to improve the economic and financial rates of return
in the manufacturing sector, the Government was expected to adopt adequate procedures for
imports, as well as for procurement and disbursement, to provide foreign exchange and to
liberalize price controls.
3.05          The project was co-financed by CIDA, the OPEC Fund and the European
Development Fund (EDF). The OPEC Loan of US$11 million, was to be administered by the
Bank.
Project Reorientation
3.06          The death of Sekou Toure in 1984 ended a quarter century of mismanagement
which brought Guinea to the brink of economic collapse. The new regime introduced a
radical program of reforms which led to extraordinary and unprecedented changes and which



transformed Guinea into a free-market economy. These changes included the dismantling of
the banking system, the liquidation/privatization of most state-owned enterprises and the
banning of state controls on prices, wages and import and export licensing.
3.07          As the Government's new policy focussed on privatization/liquidation of state-
owned enterprises, rehabilitation of state enterprises was no longer a Government priority.
The IDA Project was re-oriented to support on-going policy reforms aimed at strengthening
institutional capacity, private sector promotion and the financial sector and help strengthen the
Banque Internationale pour le Commerce et l'Industrie-Guinee (BICI-GUI), which replaced
CNCIH after its liquidation in 1985, as the financial intermediary of the IDA Project. The
technical assistance component was re-oriented to finance the recruitment of additional
resident advisers to accelerate the implementation of the Adjustment Program and provide
support to the Government in its efforts to privatize the Office National des Hydrocarbures
(ONAH) and to restructure ENELGUI, both state-owned enterprises in the energy sector.
Furthermore, this component was to finance staff evaluation and training needs in the
Ministries of Industry, Small Scale Enterprise and the Central Bank to identify areas where
skills needed strengthening.
3.08          In order to address new priorities, Credit proceeds had to be reallocated from
slow-disbursing components, such as the line of credit to the technical assistance component
to enable it to finance the growing Government need for technical assistance to help ie
implement its privatization program and its banking sector reform. Total funds reallocated
reached SDR 5.7 million, e.g. about 34 percent of IDA financing.
3.09          OPEC Loan. The OPEC Loan (Loan 274-P) was explicitly designated to
finance the rehabilitation of state-owned enterprises. However, following the decision of the
Government to disengage itself from the manufacturing sector and to privatize state-owned
enterprises and since OPEC loans cannot finance privatization, the unutilized balance (36% of
the total loan) was re-directed to the agriculture and education sectors.
4.     PROJECT  IMPLEMENTATION
4.01          Project implementation did not proceed as smoothly as desired. Neither the
Ministry of Industry, which coordinated the IDA Project, nor CNCIH, the financial
intermediary, had the capacity to manage the Project and channel IDA funds to sub-
borrowers. Technical assistance was provided to all implementing agencies to strengthen their
capacity but did not have immediate results, as the Borrower was not adequately committed to
the private enterprise development objectives. Commitments and disbursements were slow.
Following the reform program and Guinea's transformation into a market economy, the
Ministry of Industry had great difficulty adopting a role which would promote, rather than
control, the private sector. Soon after the reforms, the Project lost its sense of focus and
direction and in the end financed ad-hoc technical assistance activities related to the
implementation of the reform program for which the Government lacked the necessary
financial resources.



- 4 -
4.02          In the absence of clear objectives, project implementation became even more
difficult and all Government requests for financing required careful screening to assure that
they were relevant to the Project's overall goal. Disbursements remained slow and the closing
date had to be extended twice, from 1988 to 1991. In 1989, uncommitted funds from the line
of credit were reallocated to technical assistance. The project took almost nine years to
implement compared to the five originally planned. Although the depth of the dialogue
between the Government and the Bank improved in the framework of structural and sectoral
reforms, in retrospect, it would have been more efficient to undertake a full mid-term review
or a complete reappraisal of the project, to respond to the new challenges brought about by
the far-reaching economic reforms.
5.    PROJECT RESULTS
Rehabilitation/Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises
5.01          Four state-owned enterprises had originally been selected for rehabilitation, to
improve their managerial as well as their financial performance. Rehabilitation programs
were to finance civil engineering, equipment and raw material. Only three enterprises,
SONACAG Tile, SONACAG Granite and Seredou-Labe, were rehabilitated. All three
enterprises were subsequently privatized, in early 1986. The fourth enterprise, SIPAR-
LABE, was dropped from the list of enterprises to be rehabilitated.
5.02           Following the 1985 Reform Program and the Government's decision to
disengage itself from most industrial activity, IDA resources were reallocated to finance
technical assistance for the Government's divestiture program. Given the need for rapid
implementation of the reforms, consultants were, therefore, hired to assist in the process. The
search for private investors and partners focussed on foreign firms because of the weakness of
the domestic private sector and the need for early completion of the reforms.
5.03          Societe Nationale des Carreaux et Granit (SONACAG). This project
included: (a) rehabilitation of a Granite Quarry; (b) equipment, technical assistance and
market study for ornamental stone and slate production; and (c) rehabilitation of a floor tile
factory. A limited amount of training of Guinean technical staff was provided in the turn-key
contracts, and assistance in establishing accounting systems was provided under the auditors
contracts.
5.04          The SONACAG tile factory, completed in November 1985, was mothballed
the following December, despite an early agreement that the plan would be put into operation
under a technical assistance contract, pending its privatization. Privatization of both tile and
quarry factories was completed between February and July 1987.
5.05          Station Autonome de Seredou: Rehabilitation of quinine plantation
and factory. In 1986, at the request of the Government, social infrastructure as well as
replacements and spare parts were added to the rehabilitation plan. The estimated
rehabilitation reached US$5.7 million, exceeding budgeted funds by 30%. The rehabilitation
was delayed, as it was decided to involve private investors. Finally, since the available



- 5 -
balance in the Credit for this component, including contingencies, was US$3.6 million, the
Government and IDA decided not to go ahead with the rehabilitation and dropped SEREDOU
from the list of enterprises to be rehabilitated. The enterprise was privatized in February
1987.
5.06          SIPAR LABE. A turn-key contract for SIPAR LABE, an essential oils
enterprise, was signed and disbursements began in early 1985. The enterprise was privatized
in February 1988.
Line of Credit and Assistance to SMEs
5.07           In addition to a line of credit for sub-loans to Small and Medium Scale
Enterprises (SMEs), the Credit provided assistance to the financial intermediary, CNCIH and
its successor BICIGUI, as well as to an investment promotion agency to promote SMEs in
Guinea, the Centre de Creation et de Developpement de I'Entreprise (CCDE).
5.08          Line of Credit. Until early 1986, the IDA U$ 8.8 million line of credit
remained undisbursed. Slow appraisals from the Office National pour la Promotion de la
Petite et Moyenne Entreprise (ONPPME) and commitments from CNCIH and BICIGUI made
the IDA line of credit one of the least successful features of the project. At the end of 1984,
only three sub-projects had been submitted by CNCIH to IDA for approval for a total of
US$217,516. In February-March 1985, it became clear that the prospects for adequate use of
the line of credit were gloomy. Despite official statements to the contrary, the macro-
economic environment was not yet compatible with harmonious development of the private
sector. Disbursements started only after BICIGUI took over and benefitted from a subsidy of
US$1 million. Ten sub-projects amounting to US$1 million were then approved.
5.09          By the end of 1989, only SDR 2.4 million of the line of credit was utilized for
financing subprojects. A total of 54 sub-projects were financed over the course of project
implementation for small sub-projects, in agro-industries as well as service sectors. The
majority of the sub-loans were very small, ranging from SDR 3,000 to SDR 140,000; the
majority were below SDR 50,000. The financial intermediary has not provided IDA actual
information on these enterprises. It is, therefore, not possible to assess how many of these
small enterprises are still in operation.
5.10          Lending Terms. Commitment and Procedures. In 1988, three other lines of
credit were introduced in the country. Two from the French cooperation, a CCCE line of
credit similar to IDA's and a line of credit from the Ministry of External Relations (accord
cadre). The third line of credit was from the EEC. The IDA line of credit was not the most
attractive and was the slowest to disburse. IDA sub-loans had a higher interest rates than the
other lines of credit. Furthermore, under the IDA Credit, the sub-borrowers assumed the
foreign exchange risk, which in the other lines of credit was assumed by the Government.
Given the eagerness of entrepreneurs to access to long-term credit and to foreign exchange, at
almost any cost and as BICIGUI managed two of the other lines of credit, IDA funds were the
last to be utilized.



- 6 -
5.11          Sub-loan disbursements lagged behind commitments. Sub-project quality
remained low and eligibility criteria such as the 10 percent minimum internal rate of return,
and debt:equity ratios were, in most cases, not observed. To a large extent, sub-loans went
to inward-oriented small agro-businesses and service activities. Most sub-projects had no or
low export potential. Foreign exchange earnings objectives were never attained. Arrears on
the sub-loans reached 90 percent at the end of 1991 and was nearly 100 percent in mid-
February 1992.
5.12          Foreign Exchange Risk. The issue of foreign exchange risk generated a
lengthy debate between IDA and the Government. The under-valuation of foreign currency
at the official exchange rate was already a major constraint to foreign investors. Shortages of
foreign exchange were impinging upon equipment renewal in the manufacturing sector. At
the time of project design, attempts were made to set up a mechanism for providing the
foreign exchange proceeds at a premium which would reflect the extent of overvaluation of
the Guinean syli. The Government did not agree, arguing that it would be interpreted as an
implicit devaluation. At a later stage, the borrower claimed that the foreign exchange risk
had reduced the rate of return to investment, sub-project profitability and the attractiveness of
IDA sub-loans.
5.13          While it is possible that the foreign exchange risk issue had a negative impact
on the utilization of the line of credit, there is still no evidence that it is the cause of the high
level of arrears on sub-loans. As repayments of sub-loans from other lines of credit are not
significantly better, the high level of arrears is rather the product of the poor economic
environment and banking practices in the country.
5.14          Repayment of Arrears. As early as the first quarter of 1989, IDA supervision
missions identified a collection problem. By the end of 1988, the delinquency rate had
reached 70 % at the time of debit presentation. An average of 35 of sub-loans were overdue
by ninety days. Only 30% of installments were repaid on time. IFC, a shareholder of the
financial intermediary, had provisioned as much as 50 percent of its investment.
In early 1989, BICIGUI undertook substantial measures to improve and strengthen the
monitoring of its borrowers and IDA subloans. An EEC consultant was later assigned to all
donor-funded subloans and local staff were designated to follow-up collection. Despite all
these efforts, there has been no improvement.
5.15          Technical Assistance to the Financial Intermediary. Improvement in CNCIH's
lending procedures and financial autonomy of state enterprises were conditions of project
effectiveness. CNCIH's internal structures were reorganized and training opportunities
identified for the staff. A resident consultant on development credit was financed under the
project for two years (1984 and 1985). Unfortunately, this technical assistance had little
effect on the performance of CNCIH and it became clear that the project appraisal and
monitoring capabilities of CNCIH could not be significantly strengthened. Providing
assistance to rebuild CNCIH would be a long term and expensive endeavor with limited
guarantee of success.
5.16          A comprehensive restructuring of the banking system led to the liquidation of
former State-controlled primary banks and of public enterprises. CNCIH was closed in late



- 7 -
1985. BICIGUI, the subsidiary of BNP, a major French banking group, took over the role of
financial intermediary for the IDA line of credit. The consultant on Development Credit was
transferred to BICIGUI for one year (1986). Disbursements started only after BICIGUI
benefitted from a TA fund of US$1 million for credit delivery, management of up-country
branches and training. Expatriate experts pre-financed by BNP were already in the field prior
to the release of IDA funds in February 1987.
5.17          Investment Promotion Institutions, Investment promotion and support in
Guinea, had developed haphazardly under the tutelage of various ministries and government
agencies. Despite various programs of technical assistance, they remained largely inoperative.
A consultant on project evaluation assisted the ONPPME for three years (1984, 1986). In
addition, the Project provided a financial analyst for two years (1985 and 1986) before the
liquidation of ONPPME.
5.18          To fill the gap created by the liquidation of ONPPME, a new investment
promotion center was created, the Centre de Creation et de Developpement de l'Entreprise
(CCDE). However, limited progress has been achieved in making CCDE a legal entity. Its
role and mandate are still not fully accepted by the Government. The funding source of staff
salaries and operating costs of CCDE is still tentative. Credit 1234-GUI financed the
renovation of the building that is housing CCDE, and operations are being currently funded
through external resources. A re-assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of both CCDE
and Centre National pour la Promotion de l'Investissement Prive (CNPIP) to eliminate
possible duplication of efforts in underway under the Private Sector Development operation.
Technical Assistance
5.19          The Credit financed extensive technical assistance, including: four expatriate
advisors for SME-related positions; an advisor to head the Ministry of Industry's Bureau
d'Etude; one advisor designated to each of the divisions for financial analysis, management
and accounting; expatriate consultants to assist in sub-project identification and evaluation;
and TA for studies, for training fellowships and seminars on industrial policy and project
preparation. While at appraisal the technical assistance component was estimated at US $ 1.6
million equivalent, the actual amount which financed technical assistance at project
completion, represented over US $ 9.0 million equivalent.
5.20          In the Ministry of Industry, TA aimed at analyzing alternative industrial
strategies and bringing about realistic industrial sector policies. The credit financed an
industrial economist who also faced major adaptation problems and failed to win support for
his ambitious work program. His census of manufacturing industries had to be abandoned.
He resigned in August 1984 and his replacement arrived at the end of the year. The new
terms of reference included industrial policy and planning with emphasis on incentive terms,
trade policies, project analysis and industrial survey work. Most of the new tasks were
oriented toward coordinating visiting consultants' missions for sector and feasibility studies.
The census of the manufacturing, state enterprises, modern private sectors and informal
economy was carried out in that context. The work program was integrated in the
Bank/UNIDO sector work to assist the Government in formulating a new industrial policy.



- 8 -
5.21          As mentioned in paragraph 3.07, technical assistance took on a new dimension
with the advent of the structural adjustment program. The focus shifted to privatization of a
large number of state enterprises and banking sector reform.
5.22          Following the closure of the line of credit in December 1989, project activities
were implemented as free standing technical assistance. Commitments of funds responded to
emerging TA needs. The Credit financed technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning until
the Project's closing date. Such flexibility in the allocation of funds had advantages in
allowing the Government to respond to pressing demands which could not otherwise be
satisfied. Its main disadvantage, however, was that it allowed project components to be too
open-ended.
Training
5.23          Although Government agencies, particularly the Ministry of Industry received
extensive training, it is difficult to assess the impact of such programs. Such is also the case
of the on-the-job training. Apart from individual training given by experts, the training
financed by the Project was unsatisfactory. It is unclear whether training and expatriate
know-how has appreciably improved skills and administrative procedures in the ministries and
agencies monitoring the industrial sector. This category lacked a clear definition from the
outset. There was neither a well-articulated strategy nor an agreed long-term training
program. The "training, trips and fellowships" category was too open-ended and was finally
stopped.
6.     PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
6.01          The transformation of the Ministry of Industry's philosophy from one of
central control to a market orientation proved difficult. The ability of self-monitoring by the
Borrower was critical in the implementation of the Project. MI was incapable of playing the
role required to make the measures introduced by the Project sustainable. Neither could it be
achieved through expatriate consultant-local counterpart relations. Its mission is now one of
regulation and policy formulation rather than execution and it may take some time for it to
feel confident in this new role.
6.02          Institutions lacked the capacity to design and implement growth-oriented
industrial policies and private enterprise development programs. Basic skills were to be built
through training and fellowships. During project preparation, the Bank sought first to clarify
administrative responsibilities within government agencies. The Ministry of Small and
Medium Enterprises (MSME) was responsible for enterprise development and private sector
promotion. The Ministry of Industry was entrusted with project coordination responsibilities,
rehabilitation of state enterprises and sector related studies. Autonomy was to be granted to
parastatals. Under the MSME, the ONPPME was hindered by bureaucratic requirements for
approval of permits needed by private entrepreneurs.

7.  BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01         Bank supervision was adequate but effective monitoring of project
implementation was complicated by the rapidly changing environment. It did assist the
Borrower to focus on critical areas and to adopt a mid-course reorientation of project
objectives. Given the economic and political conditions, Bank staff were concerned with
making timely adjustments to achieve the greatest impact. The Bank reacted appropriately
and in a timely way to emerging issues including Government shortcomings and management
of consultants.
8.  BORROWER PERFORMANCE
8.01         The Borrower was not genuinely committed to private enterprise development
objectives, which may have contributed to the slow pace in project implementation. The
many changes that occurred during implementation did not help improve its performance..
Reporting requirements to IDA were met with great delays. Bank dialogue with the
Government, however, improved in the context of the reform program.
9.    CONSULTING SERVICES
9.01         The performance of consulting services has varied. Divergence of perceptions
within the Government and some of the consulting firms on the type of assistance needed and
the role of expatriate experts plagued the project in the first two years. The IDA-financed
expert, after completing his first year, resigned over conflicts regarding his role and
responsibilities. In some cases, the contribution was significant and instrumental in helping
the Government formulate industrial strategy and policy. In other cases, such as technical
assistance to Government agencies in project appraisal was not as satisfactory as desired.
In one case, a consultant's weak performance went unchallenged. A particular instance is the
consultant's report recommending the creation of CCDE, which contained unrealistic
proposals.
10.   PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
10.01        During the first three years of project implementation, documentation such as
the SAR and legal documents appeared to be adequate. However, following the significant re-
orientation of the Project, the SAR was no longer relevant and was not a very useful
reference document. The DCA, which was amended eight times to reflect the changes in
project design, and supervision and Back-to-Office Reports (BTOs) were the only documents
which had a more or less accurate picture of the project objectives and the evolution of the
Project. Given the absence of progress reports by the Borrower, it is not possible to have an
accurate picture on local costs incurred by the Borrower for implementation of the Project.
Furthermore, as the financial intermediary did not submit to the Bank a review of the
actual/current status of enterprises financed under the Line of Credit, it is not possible to
analyze the effectiveness of IDA financing to SMEs.
