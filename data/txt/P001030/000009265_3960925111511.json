"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "The outcome of the Industrial\n            Rehabilitation and Promotion Project for Guinea was\n            unsatisfactory. The project achieved some of its objectives,\n            its impact on institutional development was only partially\n            successful, sustainability is uncertain at this time, and\n            the performance of the Bank was satisfactory while the\n            Borrower's was unsatisfactory. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, in designing projects of\n            this type, more attention should be given to analyzing the\n            strengths and weaknesses of target institutions, including\n            their ability to manage efficiently the different components\n            of the project. Second, local project management capacity\n            must be fostered in order to ensure that\n            institution-building takes place. Third, commercial banks\n            should be pressured to be more rigorous in the supervision\n            of their sub-borrowers as well as their collection\n            practices. Finally, in retrospect, given the open-ended\n            reorientation that the project assumed following the\n            reforms, it would have been more efficient to undertake a\n            full mid-term review or a complete reappraisal of project\n            objectives and respond to new challenges brought about by\n            the far-reaching economic reforms."}, "docdt": "1993-02-03T00:00:00Z"}
