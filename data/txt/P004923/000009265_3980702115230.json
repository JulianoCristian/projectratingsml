Some lessons\n            learned included: major institutional issues should be\n            solved as a condition for negotiations; this would have\n            prevented National Institute for Agricultural Research\n            (INRAA) from spending precious time away from project\n            implementation. Programming and budgeting by objective is a\n            complex approach that took INRAA nearly four years to put in\n            place. Thus, the local context, capacity, and limitations of\n            implementing agencies should be carefully assessed and\n            analyzed during preparation. When research embarks on\n            complex restructuring and adoption of a fundamentally\n            different approach, fast disbursement should not be expected\n            from project onset.  Modifying the approach to extension,\n            especially at the national level, requires having a vision\n            and defining a strategy at an early stage, together with\n            extensive and effective participation by farmers. For lack\n            of both at project onset, it took National Institute for\n            Agricultural Extension (INVA) more time than anticipated to\n            play the vital role of testing various approaches to\n            extension on a pilot basis. Given the country and the\n            diversity of farmers, it is most likely that the Training\n            and Visit (T&V) approach to extension will prove\n            inadequate on a national scale. When elaborating a strategy,\n            decision makers must decide whether extension should remain\n            the sole responsibility of the public sector or should be a\n            mix of public and private interventions. They should also\n            decide the level of farmers' contributions to the cost\n            of extension, and the amount of funds the Government is\n            ready to commit o extension on a regular and long-term basis."}, "docdt": "1998-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
