The\n            project comprises a program to develop improved national\n            research and development systems. The research sub-project\n            components are: (a) to strengthen the National Institute for\n            Agricultural Research; (b) to implement priority research\n            themes; (c) application of programming by objectives to\n            research implementation; (d) to upgrade five experimental\n            farms to regional research centers; (e) staff training and\n            technical assistance. The extension sub-project would test\n            approaches for developing a national extension service.  The\n            components are: (a) introduction of improved extension\n            organization and methods; (b) provision of improved research\n            - extension - farmer linkage; (c) to strengthen five\n            extension training centers; (d) to reinforce the National\n            Center for Agricultural Training (CNPA); (e) to establish\n            monitoring and evaluation units at CNPA; and (f) training,\n            technical assistance and fellowships."}, "docdt": "1990-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
