MALI
SECOND MALI SUD RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A.   Project Background
1.01     The project presented in this report is a follow-up to the Mali Sud
Agricultural Project (Cr. 669-MLI) appraised in November 1975 and for which
the expected closing date is now December 31, 1983. The second project was
prepared by consultants in close collaboration with Compagnie Malienne pour le
Developpement des Textiles (CMDT) and financed by Fonds d'Aide et de Coopera-
tion (FAC). A post-evaluation of the first project prepared by the same
consultants was published in January 1981. Based on its results a feasibility
study for the second project was available by June 1981, proposing a broad-
based rural development project focussing on smallholder farmers.  An
appraisal mission visited Mali in September-October 1981, followed by two
post-appraisal missions in April and September 1982. Both of the latter
concerned the design of the policy reform program of the project (Chapter
II). Negotiations were held in Washington D. C. in June 1983. Whilst every
effort has been made to take account of provisional data for 1982/83 in this
report, most of the detailed analysis is based on the results of the agricul-
tural years through 1981/82.
B. The Rural Sector
1.02     Resource Base.  Less than a quarter of the country receives more than
500 mm rainfall annually.  However, Mali has the most favorable land endowment
of the six major Sahelian countries 1/: over a third of the total arable
Sahelian lands with over 800 mm rainfall, and nearly two-thirds of its irriga-
tion potential. The population of 6.75 million, over 80% of which is rural,
depends for its food supply on the wetter Sudano-Sahelian and Guinean zones
and the irrigated lands of the Niger delta (the northern limit of both areas
being roughly the line between Kayes and Mopti). The vast Saharan zone of the
North and East is almost uninhabited. Rural population density is extremely
low overall and varies directly with rainfall, except for some 200,000 ha of
traditional swamps and/or improved irrigation networks in the Segou and Mopti
areas, and for parts of the South which have suffered from onchocerciasis.
Long-term labor migration is an important feature of the West and North,
whilst seasonal migration to the Ivory Coast is a constraint to agricultural
production in the South.

1.03     Land tenure systems are still largely based on the traditional (ex-
tended) family structure, with the family head deciding on priority choice of
crops and allocation of labor and cash inputs to the main or "common" fields
and other adults managing minor plots as time permits, often as a personal
source of revenue. Cultivation rights (usufruct) mainly accrue to those who
first clear then continuously occupy new lands, hence ownership of animal and
machine-drawn farm implements is a major factor in land tenure. Modal "farm"
size is around 4.6 ha cultivated, with other areas held fallow in the family's
trust. In the Sudanian zone, several hundred holdings exceeding 20 hectares
and specialized e.g. fruit plantations bias the average rural income, which is
probably in the range $60-90 per capita, about two-thirds of rural incomes in
low-income Sub Saharan countries as a whole.
1.04     Technology and Livestock Resources.  Tillage with animal traction is
more widespread in Mali than in any other Sahelian country. Farming methods
range from quite sophisticated in the South (intensive fertilizer and pesti-
cide applications in cotton/cereals rotation, 60% of farm units mechanized) to
elementary hand tillage/subsistence agriculture in the marginal 300-600 mm
belt. There is significant rock phosphate production in the East, but all
other inorganic fertilizers (15,000 t/annum nutrient equivalent) are imported,
with the vast majority used in the Sudanian zone on cotton/cereals rotations.
The country's huge livestock resources (migratory and semi-sedentarized in the
Delta, sedentarized around Bamako and the South) constitute the major store of
wealth in rural areas. Mali mainly exports live animals for finishing and
slaughter in coastal countries, although by-products suitable for intensive
feeding (e.g. cottonseed and cotton cake, groundnut cake) are relatively
plentiful.
1.05     Production and Consumption Patterns.  Production and consumption data
are fragmentary and unreliable, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclu-
sions based on historical patterns. Some two million ha are estimated to be
under cultivation of which 10% irrigated and 90% rainfed. In six recent post-
drought (1976 to 1981) seasons, the two major cash crops, cotton and ground-
nuts, accounted for between 80 and 120,000 hectares each, with groundnuts
experiencing a secular decline in favour of fooderops, and cotton acreage a
dramatie rise, peaking in 1979/80 (see below, para. 1.14). Existing varieties
of maize, improved and expanded rapidly over this period, now account for some
50,000 hectares. Otherwise, apart from some pockets of rainfed rice, wheat
(in the East), and tubers, the overwhelming share of the rainfed fooderop area
is still sown to sorghum and millet.  These account for perhaps 1.5 million ha
and little yield intensification or varietal improvements have so far proved
possible in the below 800 mm rainfall zone. Millet and sorghum yields are in
the 500-800 kg/ha range, giving total coarse grain production of about 1.0 to
1.1 million metric tons. Overall foodgrain availability in normal rainfall
years appears to meet demand since about 1977, and is keeping pace with
population growth (2.6% p.a. approx.). However, Mali still imports rice to
Bamako at the margin whilst exporting unrecorded quantities of coarse grains
to neighboring countries and receiving substantial quantities of food aid
(nearly 59,000 t in 1982). Production and yield trends in the cotton zone are
discussed below and the decline of the groundnut oil exports is extensively
described in the President's report of the ODIPAC Technical Assistance Project
(July 1981), particularly paras. 30 to 39 (Report P-2993-MLI).



-3-
Agricultural Strategy in Mali
1.06     The 1974-78 Plan and subsequent 1979-81 investment program gave
absolute priority to food production investments designed to prevent a recur-
rence of the shortages experienced in the 1972-73 droughts. Over 80% of Plan
expenditure on foodcrops went to irrigated rice. This period also saw a major
expansion of industrial processing capacity for cotton lint, cottonseed oil,
and groundnut oil, largely based on the buoyant world commodity markets of the
mid 70s. Throughout the period, Government maintained a comprehensive (and
partially effective) system of quantity and price controls on trade in food-
grains and other commodities, linked to the official wholesale and retail
monopoly functions of various State distributors 1/ and the legacy of cheap
wage-goods policies of the early post-Independence era. Agricultural inputs,
and particularly fertilizers, were subsidized until 1980/81 by as much as 45%
of the cost price delivered to farmers. The 1970s also witnessed the creation
and/or expansion of some 26 semiautonomous rural development agencies, "Opera-
tions de Developpement Rural" (ODR), whose major sources of revenue were
determined through commodity price and tax schedules known as "baremes". The
"bareme" system became by the late 70s a major mechanism for resource alloca-
tion in several subsectors, including cotton, and a key determinant of
national monetary and fiscal policies.
1.07     Evaluation.  With hindsight, each of these aspects of State inter-
vention in the agricultural sector (investment planning, market regulation,
institutional growth, pricing and rationing policies) has had major drawbacks
in terms of sending counterproductive economic signals to producers and/or
generating intolerable recurrent cost burdens for the State. Firstly, the
investment bias towards irrigated rice involved the relative neglect of plen-
tiful under-populated areas in the South with adequate rainfall for relatively
secure, intensive rainfed cereals cultivation at much lower investment costs,
and subject to fewer management constraints. Secondly, the understandable
desire to promote local agro-based export industries entailed overconfidence
on the scope for genuine domestic value-added, given stagnating world markets,
capital-intensive processes and high transport costs. The subsequent over-
capacity and overstaffing has proved politically difficult to tackle ever
since. Thirdly, most of the ODR were primarily conduits for providing exten-
sion and social infrastructure services such as water supply, many of which
could not be recovered directly from farmers. Behind the legal fiction of
financial autonomy, their rapid expansion and resulting accumulated losses
(and/or net disinvestment through inadequate maintenance) have added to the
present recurrent cost problems of consolidated government finances and exces-
sive claims on the domestic credit market. Finally, the "bareme" process,
originally intended to improve budgetary controls, has become a rigid, subjec-
tive and administratively burdensome transfer price system, resulting in
additional downward pressure on producer incentives, poor cost control at all
intermediary stages, and rationing and/or severe financial losses at final
points of sale.

1.08     New Policy Directions.  The accumulated losses of major state enter-
prises, particularly cereals distribution (OPAM), other consumer goods
(SOMIEX), agricultural inputs (SCAER), and oil crushing (SEPOM, SEPAMA) ran up
against increasing resistance from the fiscal and monetary authorities in the
context of Government's growing awareness of the importance of market
forces. Major policy revisions in the scope of their operations and the
extent of State subsidies were decided from late 1980.  Many of these changes
were recommended in the context of IDA/Fund missions leading to the May 1982
IMF Standby Agreement and some are being carried out with IDA-financed tech-
nical assistance. In the agricultural sector, the major examples are: (a)
the substantial 1981 liberalisation of domestic trade in coarse grains, and a
parallel reduction in OPAM's responsibilities, (b) abolition of Government
control on groundnut marketing in early 1982, (c) large increases in the
remaining administered producer prices for crops (e.g. rice, cotton) in
1981/82, and dramatic increases - averaging 50% - for fertilizer and pesti-
cides in the same year, (d) an in-depth review of the objectives, organization
and finances of the ODR, begun in April 1982 with IDA assistance, and (e) the
liquidation of the OACV and SCAER monopolies.
Constraints and IDA Strategy
1.09     As the new policy directions started to work through the rural eco-
nomy, three major constraints became apparent: First, the lack of an effec-
tive floor price policy for coarse grains which would balance the need to
reflect structural price differences through space and time with the modest
financial and institutional resources available to carry it out. Second, the
exclusion of paddy (in large official schemes) from the market liberalization
program, in an effort to safeguard low-priced supplies to urban target groups
and protect the turnover of State-owned rice mills. Third, a reluctance to
increase producer prices of the remaining administered crops (e.g. cotton) in
line with border parities. At this critical juncture, Governnent s short-term
need to extract maximum financial surpluses from gross export revenues con-
flicts with the need to optimize production of cotton by facing farmers with
less distorted price signals at planting time. The first of these three
constraints is being tackled through the Bank's continuing technical assis-
tance involvement in cereals marketing reform, and the second through a
project for the rehabilitation of the Office du Niger irrigation network, now
under preparation. The major objective of the policy reform program of this
project is to address the third constraint so that the Government's reform
program can be continued and reinforced in the area with the largest potential
for rainfed agriculture in Mali, where the investment activities of the
project are also concentrated.
1.10     Previous Bank Group Involvement.  Previous Bank group lending for the
rural sector has amounted to US$78.3 million in the form of ten IDA credits as
follows:
(i) two projects (and one Supplementary Credit) for engineering and
construction or improvement of polders in the Mopti Area, financed by
Credits 277-MLI (US$6.9 and amendment 2.6 million, 1971 and 1975),
and 753-MLI (US$15.0 million, 1977);



- 5 -
(ii) a Drought Relief project, involving mainly small-scale irrigation and
livestock schemes, through Credit 443-MLI (US$2.5 million, 1973);
(iii) an integrated rural development project in the groundnut zone,
(Credit 491-MLI, US$8.0 million, 1974);
(iv) two technical assistance projects, for the Office du Niger irrigation
authority (Credit 854-MLI, US$4.5 million, 1978), and ODIPAC, the
groundnut zone area development authority (Credit 1174-MLI, 1982,
US$6.5 million);
(v) a livestock development, extension, health, and water supply project
through Credit 538-MLI (US$13.3 million, 1975);
(vi) a forestry project, designed to establish pilot industrial rainfed
plantations, through Credit 883-MLI (US$4.5 million, 1979); and
(vii) the first Mali Sud Agricultural Project (Credit 669-MLI, US$15.5
million, 1977), discussed in detail below (paras. 1.18 and 1.19).
In addition, IFC approved in April 1982, an investment of US$2.6 million
equivalent to finance a sheanut 1/ butter extraction plant aimed at the export
market and significantly dependent on supplies collected in the Mali Sud area.
1.11     Performance Evaluation.  Project performance has been patchy, with
wide variations in management effectiveness and more recently a deteriorating
public finance and credit environment which increasingly affects implementa
tion. Project Performance Audit Reports have been issued for four projects:
Mopti Rice I (Credit 277-MLI); Drought Relief Project (Credit 443-MLI); Inte-
grated Rural Development Project (Credit 491-MLI); and Office du Niger Tech-
nical Assistance Project (Credit 854-MLI). The most relevant lessons learned
are those which juxtapose the two major rural development projects undertaken
to date, in the groundnut zone (Credit 491-MLI) and Mali Sud I (Cr. 669-MLI,
to be completed by December 1981 and extended to June 30, 1983). The failure
of the groundnut zone project completed in 1980, provides a striking contrast
to the first Mali Sud project's considerable success under comparable starting
conditions. The audit report cites the following pitfalls of the groundnut
zone approach which have largely been avoided by Mali Sud: (i) heavy depen-
dence on outside organizations for input supply logistics, industrial proces-
sing capacity, and working capital finance, (ii) limited absorption of expa-
triate technical assistance in the Malian project organization, (iii) poor
financial information and control systems, (iv) insufficient attention to
cereals technical packages acceptable to farmers, (v) slow policy reaction
speed in detecting, then adjusting to changed world market conditions.
1.12     Sector Lending Strategy and Project Pipeline.  The broad objectives
of IDA rural sector lending to Mali are to:

(1) facilitate transfers of resources from consumption to productive
subsectors, through price incentives and institutional reform. This
will invoive targeted use of project and programmatic financing
(para. 2.03);
(2) concentrate rainfed agriculture support investments in the areas with
maximum potential (Mali Sud and ODIPAC);
(3) in irrigation, give priority to consolidating existing systems before
contemplating expansion through new investments;
(4)  support the spontaneous development of private trade and informal
producer groups through training and improved price incentives, so as
to increase participation in farmer support services (e.g. input
supply) and reduce public recurrent cost burdens over time; and
(5) improve the financial controls and preserve the financial indepen-
dence of key agribusinesses during a difficult transitional period in
the national economic environment.
In addition to the project presented below, the only agricultural project now
in the final stages of preparation involves the consolidation of existing
irrigation polders in the Interior Delta area, and integrated livestock
activities based on the Delta's pastureland resources. The presently-proposed
Second Mali Sud project is the first project in Mali which combines program-
matic financing for a major policy reform program with project financing of
more traditional project components.
C. The Mali Sud Region
1.13     General.  The Mali Sud Region, covering virtually all areas of the
country south of the Niger River and west of Mopti, with 1.5 million inha-
bitants, 1/ represents approximately one quarter of the country's total
population.  The 100,000 farm families in the area belong to the following
tribes: Bambaras and Bobos in the North, Senoufous and Miniankas in the
South. The climate is characterized by a distinct rainy season (from May to
October) with average annual rainfall increasing from 800 mm in the north to
1,500 mm in the extreme south.  Vegetation ranges from Sudano-Sahelian in the
northeast to Guinean in the extreme southwest. Temperatures vary between 26-
and 31° C. Arable lands consist of light sandy loams and loamy sands, suit-
able for rainfed cotton, coarse grains, cowpeas and groundnuts. Hydromorphic
clays are found on a limited scale in bottomlands making them suitable for
rice cultivation. An average family of 12, including 3 to 4 adult men, cul-
tivates approximately 4.6 ha, of which 1.5 ha cotton and the remainder in
coarse grains and cowpeas.

Agricultural Development
1.14     Cotton.  Table 1.1 presents the development of cotton production
since 1971-72 and improved cereals since 1975-76. A graphic presentation of
cotton production, area and yields is in graphs C and D. The area under
cotton has grown steadily since the early 60s with a dip during the Sahelien
drought period (1972-73). The maximum acreage planted was 119,000 ha in 1979-
80.  Over the last seven to eight years yields have stabilized at 1.1 tons/ha,
and the average acreage per farm at 1.5 ha. The number of farmers growing
cotton increased from 67,000 in 1971, to 75,000 in 1979, but has decreased
sharply over the last two years to levels comparable to 1971/72 (previous to
the major 1972/73 drought). Part of this decrease was due to low rainfall in
1980 and a late start of the rains in 1981. The effect of this on yields has
been only marginal. At the same time, however, the partial removal of ferti-
lizer subsidies without changing the farmgate price for seed cotton contri-
buted to a 30% reduction of net revenue per ha in one year (1980).  In the
subsequent year (1981) further removal of fertilizer subsidies was announced
to the farmers far before a 13% increase in farmgate price for seed cotton,
leading to a further abandoning of cotton production by farmers. Even the
average area grown per farm diminished and average compound fertilizer use per
ha fell between 1980 and 1981 by more than 15%. In one year, from 1979 to
1980, the cash cost coefficient for the farmer (cash outlay/expected gross
income) increased by 45% from 24.7% to 36.1%, and his net revenue in 1981 real
terms dropped to levels comparable to those attained during the Sahelian
drought period in 1972. The consequences of this trend are analysed below
(para. 1.23).
1.15     Rainfed Cereals.  Since 1975, Compagnie Malienne pour le Developpe-
ment des Textiles (CMDT), the agency responsible for agricultural extension
and cotton ginning in the project area, has promoted the growing of cereals
(maize, sorghum, and millet) in rotation with cotton using the aftereffect of
cotton fertilization (in particular phosphates). There is evidence of strong
complementarity between cotton and cereals, particularly maize, in Mali Sud
farming systems, which CMDT has deliberately and successfully exploited. In
six years (from 1975 through 1980), the area under improved cereals has
quadrupled, and maize production alone increased tenfold. 1/ Maize yields now
average over two tons per hectare on farms applying CMDT recommendations.
1.16     These remarkable developments (on both cotton and cereals) have been
made possible through an efficient input distribution and extension system,
building on a long process of human resource investment (absorption of modern
cultivation practices) and farm capitalization (principally through rapid
mechanization), and anchored on a lead cash crop with a well-developed tech-
nology. Out of approximately 100,000 farms, 86% are reached by CMDT's exten-
sion service. During the 1979 peak year of cotton production, 20,000 tons of
1/   Cereals grown by project farmers who apply CMDT recommendations
including selected seeds. Significant cereals plantings on both
"traditional" and more modern techniques are not therefore reflected in
CMDT statistics.

comnpound fertilizer (14-25-14), 3,500 tons of urea and 1,100,000 liters of
insecticides were distributed to farmers. This represents over two-thirds of
total fertilizer and chernical use in Mali. Thanks to aggressive promotion of
anrrial-powered tillage, there are now approximately 82,000 pairs of draft oxen
in the area, 53,000 ploughs, 33,000 cultivators, 10,000 planters and 25,000
TJLV sprayers. Agricultural credit has so far been provided mainly through
CMDT and the reimbursement rate has never been lower than 95% for short term
loans and 92% for medium term credits.
1.17     Rice.  Traditional rice cultivation is concentrated in the Sikasso
region which receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 1 ,200 mm,
enough to grow a rice crop on bottomland clay soils if the rains are evenly
distributed. Since 1970, the actual area cultivated has diminished from
20,000 ha to 16,000 ha in 1979 with yields varying between 0.9 tons/ha in good
years and 0.5 tons/ha in years with uneven rainfall distribution. Since the
Sahelian drought in 1972 and 1973, a water management improvement and exten-
sion program has started, mainly financed by European Development Fund
(EDF).  At present, three types of improved water management schemes are in
operation:
(i)  terrace developments on approximately 200 ha bottomlands in valleys
ehere rice is traditionally grown by women;
(ii)  anproximately 1,750 ha of small perimeters 1/ irrigated from reten-
tion dams; and
(îii)  a 1,000 ha full water control irrigation scheme at Klela.
_he malor obstacles at present are with the small perimeters and the Klela
Scheme - in some cases design deficiencies, in others bad leveling, and in
general insufficient training of the extension service and farmers to operate
the systems. Improved terrace developments are generally giving better re-
sults, whereby only landleveling is sometimes a bottleneck. Yields on small-
scale terrace developments (1,5 tons/ha) are lower than on developments (ii)
and (iii), but improvement costs are much lower for the public budget since
most of the works are executed by the farmers themselves. New full-water-
control schemes are unlikely to be socially profitable, but significant
improvements can be made to the operation of existing schemes.
IThe First Mali Sud Project
1,18     The objectives of the first preject were to expand cotton production
from 87,000 ha to 135,000 ha, kenaf production from 2,000 to 4,600 ha,
improved maize production from 6,500 ha to 14,600 ha and improved rice produc-
tion from 4,100 ha to 11,600 ha, by providing project farmers with extension
services, seed multiplication facilities, seasonal and medium-term credit and
/   Kado (140 ha), Karagouan (118 ha), Samogossoni (182 ha), Longorola
(55 ha), Touroumadie (100 ha), Bamadougou (50 ha), Siecu (Loulouni - 200
ha), Sinkolo (200 ha), Neguela (200 ha), Vallee du Kobi (Panga - 500 ha).

applied research. The project undertook to extend processing facilities for
cotton, kenaf and rice, to expand the health program in the area, and te train
CMDT staff, farmers and blacksmiths.
1.19     The results in terms of overall production are in table 1.2.  The
calculated project ERR exceeds 30% despite the recent drop in cotton pro-
duction because aggregate maize production exceeded appraisal estimates and
the recent stagnation of maize acreage, and reduction in cotton production, is
considered a temporary phenomenon largely attributable to the price policy
environment and poor rainfall, as explained in para. 2.06. The progression of
both maize and cotton yields is impressive, and a major part of project bene-
fits accrue to a small but steady increase in average millet/sorghum yields
traceable largely to after-effects of cctton fertilizers and improvements in
basic agronomic techniques which have nct been taken into account in the ex-
post ERR calculation. Improved rice production has stagnated not only because
of the design difficulties mentioned in para. 1.17, but also because CMDT did
not have the necessary technical expertise for rice production. CMDT stopped
active promotion of kenaf cultivation because world market prices were not
sufficiently remunerative as a result of competition by synthetic fibers. The
rice and kenaf components have only a marginal effect on the overall project
ERR. Promotion of improved millet and sorghum packages, although not foreseen
at appraisal, was successful (Table 1.1) with present average yields at 0.9
tons per ha.

1.20     The blacksmith training program has been very successful and at
present 155 independent blacksmiths are working in the area, 40 of whom are
equipped with heavy welding equipment, manufacturing approximately 60% of all
ploughs and cultivators sold in the region. Also successful was the func-
tional literacy training program aimed at the leaders of the Association
Villageoises (AVs) or mutual guarantee groups.  During the project, the devel-
opment of these AVs has been spectacular. Started in 1974-75 on a trial



- il -
basis, CMDT has promoted the creation of some 400 AVs that have gradually
taken over the collection and weighing of the cotton crop. CMDT remunerates
the AVs for this work, and the annual average AV cotton revenue is presently
MF 325 thousand (US$500).  Many AVs also generate funds from grouped cereals
sales, and levies on their members. With the income generated, the AVs
finance both economic and social investments (such as well improvements,
storage facilities, village pharmacies). AV income is seldom distributed to
the participants in cash.
1.21     CMDT distributes inputs to individual farmers and AVs at the time of
cotton marketing, which means that fertilizers are available in the villages
between 3 to 6 months prior to the start of the agricultural season. Up to
now, credit to individual farmers has also been made available through CMDT
for both agricultural equipment and inputs. An important feature of the
financial relationship between CMDT and farmers (individual and AV) is that
cotton marketing transactions are settled promptly and in full for cash, and
input credit (whether used on cotton or cereals) is recovered in cash later,
i.e. there is no withholding at source. This creates greater confidence but
makes the risk factor for each crop more transparent to farmers. CMDT does
not now charge interest on seasonal credit, which constitutes up to half of
the input subsidy passed on to farmers (see proposals, para. 2.33).
1.22     The Health Component, financed by BADEA, reached a population of
about 880,000. The component consisted of training health workers and tradi-
tional midwives and providing them with means of transport. Because of ini-
tial financing delays the program did not get off the ground until 1979, thus
results at the time of appraisal of this follow-up project remained below
targets (50%). This component is executed in part of the project area
(Sikasso and Segou regions) since the rest is covered by other projects. It
reaches approximately 1,100 villages, and is executed by Ministry of Health
doctors working in the area.  CMDIT only plays a role in providing finance and
coordinating these activities with AV development.
Prices and Taxation in the Mali Sud Zone
1.23     The major economic agents in the cotton subsector are:  farmers, who
buy inputs and sell cotton at Government-set prices; CMDT who provides inputs
and extension, and gins the seed cotton; SOMIEX, who has a monopoly on lint
exports; the Treasury, who collects taxes from both CMDT and SOMIEX; and OSRP,
who is supposed to compensate CMDT for shortfalls between the official ex-mill
price and actual costs. Export revenues from cotton in Mali support the
entire range of CMDT development activities as well as a substantial net cash
flow to the Treasury and SOMIEX averaging over $10 million annually during
1976-81. 1/ Given the high fixed costs of processing and transport, the
sector's net surplus is extremely sensitive to world cotton price fluctuations
and to the size of the cotton harvest. Yields are relatively insensitive to
rainfall variations in the Sudanian zone, so the major variable is acreage
1/   Only some 10% of Central Government tax revenues, but by far the
largest sectoral source.

sown to cotton. This acreage is a function of the timing of rainfall and of
the relative price of cotton, and cotton inputs, gi ven alternative opportuni-
ties for using scarce family labor. The Goverument directly controls cotton
output and input prices, but not cereals prices. Moreover, it had become
accustomed to the net cash flow of the Mali Sud zone as a source of budget
support for the State import-export monopoly, SOMIEX. It has therefore tended
to put pressure on either CMDT finances, or farmer incentives, or both, when
world prices or the volume of production have weakened from time to time. In
1982, producer prices for cotton were about 62% cf export parity equivalents,
and 69% after reincorporating the effects of input subsidies affecting
cotton. At the same time, effective market prices for cereals are close to
100% of their border parities, reflecting the fact that Government is unable
(and unwilling) te hold producer prices below their equilibrium levels, which
are also affected by export demand. Taxation is therefore being excessively
concentrated on a single crop which is subject to large shifts in acreage.
However, Government has made considerable efforts recently to reduce the
incidence of identifiable taxes on cotton: in particular, the ad valorem
export tax, was eliminated in 1981.
1.24     This chronic squeeze became critical with exceptionally bad rainfall
in 1980 and 1981 (para. 1.14). As cotton volume fell and unit costs rose, so
the perceived room for increases in "bareme" cotton prices to producers, or
for maintenance of input subsidies, dwindled. All prices were then frozen for
the 1982-83 season. The medium-term option of increasing activity through a
favorable shift in producer terms of trade is constrained by the need to
generate minimum levels of Treasury revenue through taxes on the sector's net
profit. If further cost increases are passed on to producers without com-
pensation, their financial exposure will increase and the downward spiral
could accelerate.
1.25     Cost Structure.  This vicîous circle is illustrated in table 1.3
which compares the cotton cost structure in 1976-77 (the beginning of Mali Sud
1, with favorable world market and climatic conditions)g 1979-80 (record
production year, off-peak world prices), and 1981-82 (with low output and
constant real price levels). During the Mali Sud I project period prior to
appraisal of the followup project (1977 to 1981), world market prices
increased by only 32% in nominal terms. Official input prices to producers
increased by 280%, much faster than seed cotton prices (75%) which were
broadly in line with changes in the general price index (67%). Over the same
period, the industry's raw materials costs increased from 26 to 40% of gross
export earnings, SOMIEX export costs increased frora 15 to 17% and CMDT
processing and handling costs, from 21 to 29%. This reflects high overheads
and increasingly low (60% in 1981-82, over 90% in 1979-80) plant utilization,
as well as increases in costs due to noncotton activities (e.g. cereals
extension) but recovered, in part from cotton revenues. The cotton sector as
a whole remains - just - financially viable even under these conditions, but
the profits availàble for distribution have fallen from 22% of turnover to
9%. The entire Mali Sud operation could therefore become unprofitable with a
further marginal fall in output or deterioration in terms of trade, a parti-
cularly serious risk for Mali since cotton accounts for over half of the total

value of merchandise exports. The alternative of a drastic reduction in
capacity (e.g. mothballing several ginneries) is not justified in view of the
buoyant long-term prospects for Malian cotton (Chapter V) and the risks of a
severe processing bottleneck as and when a recovery occurs.
1.26     Distribution of Cotton Revenues.  This increasing pressure on pro-
ducer incentives could have been alleviated were it not for the growing burden
of taxes and cross-subsidies charged to the "bareme", to benefit various State
institutions or to finance CMDT's non-cotton developmental activities for
which full cost recovery is not practical (e.g. functional literacy). Many of
these charges are not identified as taxes in the "bareme" but have the same
effect, i.e. of reducing the apparent breakeven cost of raw materials and
hence likely producer price for seed cotton. The major sources of consoli-
dated Government revenue are (a) output taxes levied under the "bareme" on
SOMIEX and CMDT (about FM 1.4 billion (see Table 1.3>), (b) accelerated amor-
tization of Mali Sud 1 debt service (FM 0.4 billion), (c) import taxes on
cotton inputs and taxes on seasonal interest (both borne by CMDT, over FM 0.7
billion). A much more important, but less easily predicted source is the net
surplus retained by SOMIEX, the monopoly export agency. This is based on the
difference between (a) the artificial ex-mill price owed to CMDT under the
"bareme" plus the real costs of export to Europe borne by SOMIEX, and (b) the
gross c.i.f. revenues actually realized by SOMIEX. This "spread" should be
about 100 FM/kg in 1982, or some FM 3.4 billion, bringing consolidated Govern-
ment net cash flow from a below-average year to some FM 5.9 billion (US$8.3
million). SOMIEX's net cotton revenues were until recently available to cover
part of its losses on consumer goods distribution: now they are partly (at
least 50%) appropriated by the Treasury upon receipt as part of SOMIEX's
overall tax liabilities, leaving SOMIEX with substantial uncovered losses on
its non-cotton operations.
1.27     CMDT Finances.  CMDT is damaged by the present financing and market-
ing arrangements in two major ways. First, the injection of SOMIEX as inter-
mediate buyer delays payments, increases interest charges and constantly
threatens CMDT liquidity. Second, the reduction/rejection of genuine CMDT
cost items (such as input subsidies and depreciation) in the "bareme" negoti-
ating process threatens CMDT solvency. This in turn prompts the banking
system to delay or reject CMDT's overdraft requests, creating occasional cash
crises, and eventually undermining CMDT's reputation as a reliable buyer from
farmers. In 1981, one such crisis was resolved by Government after interven-
tion by IDA. However, the financing gap resulting from underpricing of cotton
to SOMIEX was transferred to farmers through one-time input price increases
averaging over 50%, with the disincentive results described above. In 1982,
total Government/SOMIEX withholdings will probably exceed the consolidated
profits of the cotton sector. CMDT has therefore made a cash loss on cotton
operations of about FM 300 million in 1982, and will also defer part of its
required depreciation provisions and tax liabilities. This deteriorating
trend is analyzed in table 1.4 below. Detailed balance sheets for the past
5 years (1977-81) are in the Project File, item A.9. CMDT's financial
projections are discussed in Chapter 5 below.

1.28     Recurrent Cost Budgeting and Cost Control.  The annual "bareme"
discussions have also lost their original purpose of allowing Government to
examine and amend if necessary the scope and cost of planned CMDT activities,
both cotton and "noncotton". This is because they occur when most CMDT ex-
penses have already been incurred, producer prices are fixed, production
volume can be accurately estimated, but before export prices are known. In
addition, these discussions are usually held when cotton contract prices are
at a seasonal low. Any cuts that the negotiators may have to make to fit the
after-tax unit costs to the presumed c.i.f. cotton price are therefore made
mainly by disallowing legitimate cost items such as fertilizer subsidy re-
quirements, sinking fund provisions for external debt, and vehicle/equipment
amortization. Therefore, SOMIEX can appropriate CMDT's major revenue generat-
ing output at less than the breakeven price, without subsequent adjustment.
Any windfall increase in c.i.f. prices therefore benefits only SOMIEX and the
Treasury. Moreover, all of CMDT costs are blended into a single per-unit
schedule that makes no distinction between fixed and variable costs, or bet-
ween "extension" on cotton and various other (e.g. functional literacy,
health) subbudgets, or between project incremental activities and recurrent
costs of earlier programs. Finally, since all parties to the "bareme" know
that total allowed costs are going to be arbitrarily compressed, there is



- 16 -
every incentive to manipulate the presentation of each line item. Conversely,
there îs no incentive to control costs until the apparent surplus has shrunk
to zero. Farmers are not directly represented in the process, but suffer its
consequences when the "scope" for price increases is reviewed a few months
later, as was the case in 1981.
1.29     Stabilization Fund.  Throughout the late 1970s, a substantial part of
explicit cotton taxes on CMDT and SOMIEX were earmarked for general (multicom-
modity) stabilization funds managed by the Office pour la Stabilisation et la
Regularisation des Prix (OSRP). This agency, principally funded by levies on
imports cf petroleum products, intervenes principally to subsidize consumer
prices of e.g. rice and coarse grains by giving rebates to various ODR. Cot-
ton has traditionally been a net provider of funds to other crops via OSRP.
More recently, CMDT has been allowed to retain the portion of the "bareme"
transfer price due to OSRP and net it out against part of the yearend short-
falI of the "bareme" measured against true costs.  However, OSRP itself has
not managed to accumulate any net reserves, at a time when cotton is unlikely
to continue to generate substantial surpluses and virtually every other sub-
sector, particularly oilseeds, has become a net claimant for OSRP support.
The EEG's commodity export revenues stabilization fund, Stabex, reacts to
shortfalls in nominal, gross revenues against a four-year moving average and
is not designed to cover the net effects of deteriorating terms of trade. No
Stabex transfers have yet occured for Malian cotton, and even the 1981-82 crop
year is expected to yield little in 1983.
1.30     Conclusiaon.  Under the present system, there is therefore no adequate
working capital buffer to meet temporary drops in export earnings and/or
increases in unit costs. Moreover, the option of increasing real producer
prices to stimulate production is constrained by the need to continue generat-
ing surpluses which can yield tax revenue for the Treasury. The latter has
already sacrificed important sources of indirect taxes levied under the
bareme, and cannot readily generate additional savings to be passed on to
producers. In addition, it has to compete with SOMIEX's substantial claims on
cotton surpluses which help reduce SOMIEX losses on other activities. The
major thurst of the policy reform program described below is to help Mali over
a transitional period to higher producer revenues, higher capacity utilization
and an expanded revenue base, while changing pricing and marketing arrange-
ments so as to minimize the risks of excessive transfers from productive
activities to consumption, and focus taxation on actual (verifiable) trading
surpluses.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Summary Description
2.01     The broad objectives of the proposed project are in accord with
Government's policies of increasing agricultural production and farm incomes
to improve the welfare and standard of living of the rural population. The
main specific objectives are:



- 17 -
(i)  to stabilize and increase cotton production through an input and
output pricing program which is consistent with world market oppor-
tunities, and would achieve comparable levels of Government revenue
in the medium and long term at lower tax rates, higher volumes and
lower average processing costs;
(ii)  to reorganize institutional arrangements for budgeting, taxation,
marketing and cost recovery for cotton and related activities, in-
cluding a new mechanism to protect the system from temporary price
and volume fluctuation;
(iii) to increase production of cotton, of coarse grains (maize, sorghum,
millet), cowpeas, rice, and livestock, all of which depend directly
or indirectly on a healthy cotton sector, through specific input
delivery and extension programs;
(iv) to secure future improvements of agricultural production through
applied research;
(v)  to promote independent farmer organizations (AVs) through incentives
to absorb various tasks now undertaken by Government and CMDT, and
training; and
(vi) to meet basic needs of farmers in the area through village water
supply and primary health services whose basic operation and main-
tenance will be the responsibility of farmer organizations.
2.02     In particular, the project to be implemented over five years,would
include:
(a)  expanding cotton production on about 16,000 ha; improving farming
practices and input use on about 31,000 ha of maize; 35,000 ha of
millet and sorghum, and 18,000 ha of cowpeas;
(b)  partially rehabilitating and improving irrigated rice production on
about 1,750 ha of small perimeters and 1,000 in the Klela Scheme;
constructing terraces and improving production on about 1,500 ha of
rainfed rice; preparing a feasibility study for an additional 1,700
ha along the Klela River; and strengthening CMDT's capacity in the
design, operation and maintenance of small irrigation schemes;
(c)  supplying on medium-term credit through BNDA about 7,500 draft oxen,
13,000 ploughs, 10,000 seed drills, 7,000 cultivators, 2,200 ULV
sprayers, and 160 low-horsepower tractors;
(d)  strengthening the BNDA network of branch offices to provide medium-
term credit services in the project area;
(e)  replacing imported phosphate fertilizer by about 15,000 tons of
locally produced rock phosphate;



- 18 -
(f) delivering drugs and feed supplements and improving animal husbandry
practices for beef cattle and work oxen; and installation of a small
mineral lick manufacturing unit;
(g) improving and extending agricultural research through four applied
research programs on cotton and coarse grains, farming systems, tech-
nology transfer to small farmers, and fertilizer usage;
(h) strengthening CMDT's capacity for rehabilitation and maintenance of
about 3,000 km of feeder roads and construction of 30 km additional
tracks;
(i) promoting 600 additional AVs and transfering all primary marketing of
cotton and credit recovery functions to the AVs;
(j)  functional literacy training for AV members and training of AV
leaders, blacksmiths and CMDT staff;
(k) drilling of 400 wells for village water supply and 50 wells for
pastoral use, equipped with manually operated pumps; and
(1) continuing the primary health care program and training of village
level health workers.
2.03     The project will be complemented by a policy reform program linked to
programmatic financing channelled through imports of fertilizers and pesti-
cides, for a total value of FM 11,500 million (US$16.2 million). Most of this
would indirectly compensate for the expected initial net cotton sector revenue
shortfall due ta producer price increases and other reductions in Government
cash flow due to its obligations under the program. Other amounts would
remain with CMDT to settle its net claims on Governnent arising out of past
underfinancing through the bareme system, and the balance would provide the
initial capitalization of a Cotton Guarantee Fund. This program would support
a series of institutional and price policy reforms. Disbursement of this
external assistance would be through annual tranches released following
achievement of specific pricing and subsidy goals.
B. Policy Reforms
1.   Cotton Input and Output Pricing Policies
2.04     Cotton output and input prices will continue to be linked to world
market conditions, but Government's tax revenue constraints in the sector will
be temporarily lifted so as te break the vicious circle described in paras.
1.23 to 1.30 above.  The official producer price for cotton will be increased
rapidly in real terms whilst input subsidies are progressively removed. The
following table illustrates the major changes involved:

The program goal is to achieve higher absolute levels of tax receipts at lower
rates of taxation and higher output (see results, para 2.19). Within this
process of increasing net producer incentives, the balance between input and
output price increases is determined by the need to keep smallholders' expo-
sure to cash risks within reasonable proportions, based on historical observa-
tion (para 1.14). Instead of fixing predetermined price levels for the whole



- 20 -
project period, which would not allow Government enough flexibility to adjust
to changed costs and/or technology, Government has agreed to achieve and main-
tain a maximnlm cash cost coefficient of 30%.  This is defined as total ferti-
lizer and pesticide costs per hectare of cotton, at the average application
rate, as a percentage of gross revenues per hectare of cotton at the average
yield level,  This indicator is designed for ease of calculation and verifica-
tion, but does not pretend to capture all the elements relevant to farmers'
decision to grow cotton.  Moreover, so that this improvement in farmer incen-
tives îs not achieved through an increase in subsidies, Government would also
respect a maximum subsidy, calculated on the full delivered cost including
handling charges and taxes, of 25% in 1984, 18% in 1986 and 10% in 1987. 1/
Subsidies would be fully eliminated by 1988, the year of project completion.
Respect of these conditions (through official prices declared, as they usually
are ncw, by the end of April of each year) would be a condition of disburse-
ment of each annual tranche of programmatic financing. The specific per-
centage increases in Table 2.1 are illustrations of pricing policies con-
sistent with these rules Other combinations are possible: for example,
Government has chosen to increase the producer price by 15% in June 1983, but
to hcld official input prices at their present levels since import costs have
fallen. This satisfies the cash cost coefficient target but implies a sharpeir
increase in input costs in 1984 to meet the subsidy target in later years.
These pricing arrangements will be subject ta a joint review by IDA and
Government no later than April 30, 1984 and annually by April 30 of each
succeeding year, at which time the risk indicator and subsidy targets may be
adjusted by mutual agreement.
2.05     The balance of priorities within the overall subsidy bill is not
predetermined. However, it is agreed that subsidies would be decreased less
rapidly on insecticides, which have a marked impact on cotton yields and have
no alternative use on cereals, Also, subsidies on imported phosphates will be
decreased faster as applications of domestic rock phosphates progress. In
addition, Government will introduce and maintain a differential of at least
15% between cash and credit sales prices for seasonal inputs (para. 2.33).
This shauld help reduce handling costs for CMDT. Official prices for inputs
are already close to the c.i.f. costs on imported fertilizers, but CMDT bears
additional financial charges which account for the bulk of the subsidy.
2.06     The intention of the pricing program is to accelerate an improvement
in producer terms of trade, within the limits of world market prices for
inputs and for cotton lint. The review process would therefore be designed so
as to avoid the risk of a protracted net subsidy to cotton, e.g. in the ex-
treme case where domestic prices might otherwise be raised repeatedly in the
face of an unexpected decline in world market cotton prices. The review would
include (a) analysis of input costs and world market trends for cotton, (b)
analysis of producer responses to earlier price signals (yield, area, and
application rate effects) and (c) investigation of changes in CMDT's cotton
production structure, SOMIEX transport costs, and the costs of noncatton
activities recovered out of cotton revenues. Assurances were obtained at

negotiations that Government would defer producer price increases for cotton,
and/or reduce the scope of CMDT or SOMIEX activities, if and when the joint
review concluded such adjustments were necessary.
2.07     Expected Effects of the Price Policy.  It is difficult to isolate the
impact of cotton price increases alone on Mali Sud cotton production, since
over the same project period, CMDT's extension and input supply efforts will
simultaneously itensify and reach a number of villages not previously
served. 1/ The program assumes a total incremental cotton area of 16,000
hectares (15%) over 5 years, from both price effects and other interventions,
as against a real increase in the seed cotton price of over 50%. This is in
the low end of the range of acreage elasticities of supply with respect to
price that have been estimated for other developing countries, namely 0.25 to
0.44. 2/ This relatively modest area increase, coupled with a 10% increase in
yields due both to the improvement in the cash cost coefficient and project
extension and input supply efforts, would be sufficient to restore the sector
by year 4 to nearly full use of installed capacity, which in turn signifi-
cantly lowers real processing costs. Financial results for Government and
farmers are discussed below (para. 2.19).
2.   Institutional Reforms in Budgeting, Taxation and Marketing
2.08     Changes in Control of Gross Export Revenues and SOMIEX Role.  Begin-
ning with the 1983/84 crop SOMIEX would be placed on an equal footing with
CMDT as an intermediary whose legitimate transport costs and reasonable re-
muneration will be covered out of gross export revenues, but with no claim on
the net cash flow over and above this compensation for its services. SOMIEX
would continue to handle cotton lint from CMDT ginneries to export destina-
tions, but instead of retaining control of gross sales revenues at world
prices, it would instruct all buyers to pay to an earmarked Cotton Account at
the Development Bank of Mali (BDM) in the name of OSRP. This account would
settle the budgeted costs of CMDT and SOMIEX, including the former's commis-
sion of 5% of the ex-ginnery price and a new commission for SOMIEX based on
1/2% of the c.i.f. contract price. 3/ This commission would be additional to
the (audited) costs of transport, transit and insurance fees, and ocean
freight as billed to SOMIEX by private intermediaries, and would compensate
SOMIEX for staff salaries and other overhead costs related to cotton exports.
Also, as a safeguard against spoilage of cotton lint and other losses through
excessive marketing delays, CMDT would be empowered to export any batch which
had not been collected by SOMIEX within 45 days of notification, and to be
remunerated on the same scale as SOMIEX if and when this should occur.
1/   In the economic analysis, separate rates of return are calculated
for the project as such, in a favorable policy environment, and for the
total effect of the project as well as the policy reform program, includ-
ing the costs of the programmatic assistance to Government (Chapter VI).
2/   See Cotton Handbook, World Bank, February 1981, citing also USDA
sources.
3/   The 1/2% commission is roughly equal to 5% of SOMIEX's present
bareme allocation for export services.

2.09     Operation of the Cotton Account.  Opening of the Cotton Account at
BDM and the Guarantee Fund Account at the Central Bank of Mali would be a
condition of effectiveness. CMDT's budget will be separated into fixed and
variable cost components calculated per ton of estimated lint exports. Sepa-
rately identified budget sections will be presented by CMDT for non-cotton
development expenditures (such as the maize program, functional literacy and
roads). As export revenues are received from correspondent banks, the Cotton
Account will pay SOMIEX and CMDT autematically in proportion to their budget
shares for variable costs, plus commission, and up to the ceiling of CMDT's
budgeted fixed costs. On a given contract, shortfalls between total budgeted
costs and the realised c.i.f. price will be made good by drawing on the Gua-
rantee Fund (below 2.11). Any surpluses, save for debt service payments
discussed below, will be retained by the Account until the year-end, when
budgeted and actual costs would be compared and the Cotton Account (comple-
mented if necessary by drawing on the Guarantee Fund) would compensate net
shortfalls, Savings (per ton) on budgeted outlays resulting from internal
efficiency in CMDT and SOMIEX would be retained by the operator as taxable
earnings. This would introduce some incentives for cost control, hitherto
entirely lacking in the bareme process. One of the primary objectives of the
institutional reform program is indeed to replace the present bareme mechanism
xith a more efficient budgeting and profit distribution process.
2 10     Changes in Intermediate Taxes and Other Budgetary Charges.  A major
objective of these reforms is to secure the sector s net cash flow until
actual profits are determined. Therefore, clear limits must be set on various
Government agencies ability to tax cotton turnover upstream, at the produc-
tion or export stages.  Governnent has agreed to levy oely a 3% customs tax on
the border value of lint exports, plus a specific charge collected by OSRP to
retire project-related external debt obligations at actual rates charged to
Government by donors. Project-related lbans, including the proceeds of the
IDA Credit, would be passed onto CMDT in grant form since OSRP would capture
all net trading surpluses and ultimately redistribute them to Government
through the Guarantee Fund mechanism. In any case, most of the project acti-
vities financed through CMDT are not directly revenue-generating (e.g. water
supply, farmer training programs). No other direct tax on cotton output (such
as the export tax levied before 1981) may be introduced. Taxes on inputs
(e.g. fuel, fertilizers) levied on CMDT and SOMIEX are not affected, but will
now be recovered out of the Cotton Account. CMDT and SOMIEX will remain
liable for corporation tax (IBIC) on their net cotton earnings, but CDMT will
be exempt from the present minimum turnover tax of 1% levied even on before-
tax losses. The CMDT budget would include specific amortisation provisions
for vehicles, plant and equipment. These will be adjusted in the light of a
project-financed study on CMDT's cost structure, accounting systems, asset
valuation and depreciation, to be completed by March 31, 1984, and discussed
with IDA by June 30, 1984. Government has also agreed to specific guidelines
on CIMDT capital expenditures, depreciation and then budgeting, including the
treatment of Government-owned ginning mills as part of CMDT's assets pending
formal transfer of ownership. Any CMDT activities outside the scope of the
project will require the prior mutual agreement of IDA and Government. In
particular, CMDT may not engage in activities (such as crop marketing) which



- 23 -
require an aggregate annual subsidy exceeding FM 100 million ($150,000) unless
this subsidy is financed by other sources on mutually acceptable terms.
Governnent's full counterpart obligations to Mali Sud, including the recurrent
and incremental costs of non-cotton development activities (para.. 2.17), and
taxes on project investments paid by CMDT, will be included in CMDT's budget
and recovered from the Cotton Account.
2.11     Constitution of a Guarantee Fund.  Net surpluses retained in the
Cotton Account, after annual review and compensation of CIIDT and SOMIEX
accounts, would be transferred to a Guarantee Fund lodged with the Central
Bank. Government may draw on this fund only as and when its balance exceeds
FM 5.5 billion (US$7.7 million). This threshold is calculated so as to cover
an average of (i) the maximum volume shortfall experienced in past years (at
mid-project net cash flow), and (ii) a world market price drop of 10% below
project estimates. The Guarantee Fund cannot cover shortfalls beyond this
amount due to e.g. an unforeseen protracted decline in world prices. However,
Government has agreed that Stabex fund payments for cotton, if any (para.
1.29) would also be automatically lodged with the Fund. The Fund would retain
a minimum level of liquid assets (i.e. whose liquidity is guaranteed by the
Central Bank) of FM 2.0 billion (US$2.8 million) and may invest only in short-
term instruments with no appreciable risk of capital or exchange losses. OSRP
and the Central Bank are to negotiate specific arrangements for the managemnt
of Fund liquidities, whose approval by IDA is an additional condition of
effectiveness. Government has agreed to replenish the Fund to the minimum
level of FM 2 billion, from its own resources if necessary, if and when
compensation of CMDT and SOMIEX shortfalls involve drawing down the Fund below
this level. The minimum balance would be certified by OSRP, and if necessary
replenished, as of March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each
year beginning June 30, 1984. The Fund and the Cotton Account will be jointly
managed by the Director, OSRP and a Deputy Manager recruited under the project
(para. 2.18).  The Fund would compensate SOMIEX and CMDT on a priority basis
for demonstrable cash costs. Depreciation provisions not needed by CMDT to
meet immediate replacement requirements would be deferred if their payment
would otherwise bring the Fund below its minimum operating threshold.
3.   External Financial Compensation Mechanisms
2.12     Disbursement Mechanism.  IDA and CCCE would finance up to FM 11.5
billion ($16.2 million equivalent) of additional resources beyond the incre-
mental input requirements of the project. These would be applied as shown at
Table 2.2: (a) to liquidate CMDT's outstanding claims on ORSP and the
Government; (b) to secure the initial capitalization of the Guarantee Fund;
and (c) to augment the cash flow of the Cotton Account, and hence partially
compensate for the effect of farmer price increases on the sector's net
surplus. Disbursements under (a) would be to accounts designated by CMDT, and
under (b) and (c) to the Cotton Account. IDA disbursements would be against
fertilizers and pesticides purchased by CMDT under its regular local bank
financing arrangements, and resold to farmers in the project area.

This net claim of FM 2.8 billion would represent an additional tax burden of
at least 25 f/kg seed cotton if recovered on a future year's pricing schedule,
penalising producer incentives. Moreover, it already strains CNDT's working
capital and inflates interest costs on excessive overdrafts from the banking
system (para. 1.27). It is therefore proposed that this claim be settled at
the beginning of the project by a Government grant to CMDT, disbursed by IDA
against fertilizers and pesticides resold by CMDT at official prices. Since
audited CMDT accounts certifying these claims are not yet available, an addi-
tional condition of IDA disbursement for this part of the project would be
that audited CMDT accounts, including a special certification on the nature
and amount of these debts, shall have been submitted to IDA for approval.
Government and CMDT acknowledge in the proposed subsidiary agreement that
these payments will extinguish all the liabilities involved.
2.14     Constitution of Guarantee Fund.  To ensure that the Cotton Account is
backed from the beginning of the project by sufficient liquidities to meet
essential processing costs and temporary shortfalls in cotton export revenues,
the minimum Guarantee Fund balance of FM 2 billion (US$2.8 million) would be
constituted through a similar process of external grants-in-kind disbursed to
the Guarantee Fund Account. To enable the process ta begin immediately, CMDT
expenditures on fertilizers and pesticides up to $2.3 million (less than 10%
of the IDA credit) made up to 6 months before IDA credit signature would be
eligible for retroactive IDA reimbursement upon project effectiveness. Pro-
curement under IDA financing will be in accordance with Bank guidelines for
international competitive bidding. Cofinancier CCCE would make direct cash
payments for its CMDT debt consolidation and Guarantee Fund contributions.
2.15     Compensation of Cotton Account.  The balance of the programmatic
financing (FM 6.7 billion or US$9.4 million) will be disbursed in annual
tranches under the same procedures. The funds so generated will complement
regular export revenues received in the Cotton Account to compensate for (a)
the buildup to the threshold level (FM 5.5 billion) of the Guarantee Fund,
which would otherwise divert cotton surpluses from current Government tax
revenues (b) higher producer prices required under the pricing program, and
(c) full recovery of developmental expenditures (recurrent and incremental)
out of the cotton price structure, bath of which also lower Governnent's net
cash flow from the sector for any given level of turnover. An illustration of
the Cotton Account's operation is presented in Table 2.4, based on project
physical assumptions, the producer price response discussed above, and
projections of CMDT fixed and variable costs over the project horizon. Net
export revenues would decline through Year 3 in both absolute and per-unit
terms. They would recover by the end of the project to comparable absolute
levels, but a lower share of gross receipts. Out of these gross export
revenues, OSRP would caver not only CMDT and SOMIEX processing costs
(including commissions, amortisation and depreciation) but 100% of Mali Sud I
recurrent costs and Government's contribution to the proposed project's
costs. In the baseline projection, small net surpluses over and above the
cumulative threshold of FM 5.5 billion in the Guarantee Fund would arise in
Year 1, and substantial surpluses from Year 5: these would be available for
distribution to Government by OSRP. Year 2 is an illustration of a temporary
windfall arising from the attainment of the threshold level in Year 1, which
demonstrates the need tc retain flexibility in annual tranche disbursements,

given the relative fragility of the underlying assumptions: the buildup of
raw materials costs and slowdown in export price increases affects the ability
te generate surpluses in years 3 and 4, whilst the sector is self-sufficient
in Year 5.
2.16     Annual Tranche Mechanism.  The overall amount of IDA a;id CCCE
programmatic assistance linked to the policy reforms is fixed in advance and
will not change even if actual export surpluses vary significantly up or down
from appraisal projections. Government agrees that although this assistance
facilitates structural reform, it is not an all-risks insurance and must not
undermine the search for increased profitability in the cotton sector. Within
the overall amount, however, IDA disbursements in a given period should be
linked to actual Government cash flow needs, the bulk of which will be in the
early years of the project while the Guarantee Fund is not fully built up and
the effects of price increases on producer incentives do not yet compensate
the immediate loss of revenue. Government and IDA have agreed on the
following cumulative disbursement limits within an overall total for this
category of $12.0m, based on the projections in Table 2.4:
No more than: - $7 million by December 31, 1984
- $9 million by December 31, 1985
- $11 million by December 31, 1986
(the balance by project completion)
In addition, IDA disbursements are conditional on positive verification that
the price program targets for the preceding period have been met (para.
2.04). The annual program consultations would include a review of the
disbursement limits.
2.17     Financial Contrels.  The Cotten Account, the Guarantee Fund, CMDT and
SOMIEX (cotton operations) accounts will be subject to annual audits financed
under the project. Terms of reference for these audits (see Project File,
Item A5) will be expanded to cover fulfillment of the clauses of the Subsi-
diary Credit Agreement. In particular, auditors will reach a judgment as to
the accuracy of the budgeting process used by SOMIEX and CMDT to project
expenditures claimed from the Cotton Account, and would analyse the source of
any material discrepancies between budgeted expenditures and audited year-end
results. The General Manager, OSRP will have signature over the Cotton
Account and Guarantee Fund and will act as trustee of these arrangements. He
will be assisted by a Co-manager, financed under the project, who will have
joint signature powers over the Cotton Account and Guarantee Fund. Selection
of a candidate acceptable te IDA will be a condition of effectiveness. Draft
terms of reference are in the Project File, Item A4.
2.18     Legal Covenants.  These arrangements will be confirmed by Government
in the form of a subsidiary agreement 1/ between CMDT, SOMIEX, OSRP, and the
1/   Styled "Cotton Account Agreement" in the IDA Credit Agreement to
distinguish it from the Fund Management agreement between OSRP and the
Central Bank of Mali.

Government based on paras. 2.08 to 2.17 above. Detailed guidelines for this
agreement were agreed at negotiations. Signature of the mutually agreed draft
would be a condition of effectiveness.
2.19     Program Overview:  Production Growth and Shifts in Income Distribu-
tion within the Sector. Chart E presents the overall results of the policy
reform program over the life of the project, in terms of nominal revenues per
kilo of cotton exported and of the respective shares of the major economic
agents involved. Farmers' shares in the forecast c.i.f. price would increase
significantly, from 38% pre-project to over 50% at the end of the project.
This mirrors the objective of the price policy program (Table 2.1) which is to
reduce the effective taxation of cotton from over 30% to less than 20% over
the project period. Processing and transport costs (CMDT and SOMIEX), net of
taxes, will be reduced from 47% to 40% of c.i.f. value, the slower rate of
inflation reflecting higher capacity utilisation. Government's share (net
surplus plus taxes collected upstream) would decline from 15% to a low of 7%,
then stabilize at 10% of the c.i.f. price, but remain roughly the same per
kilo and increase by over 50% in absolute terms, entirely offsetting infla-
tion. In addition, there would be a significant internal redistribution
within the State sector. SOMIEX would no longer have access to the surplus
produced by cotton exports, which was used to cover its losses on other acti-
vities in the past. This surplus would be collected by OSRP and distributed
to the Treasury over and above the threshold level of the Guarantee Fund.
Governnent's ability to allocate realized net cotton surpluses to support the
non-cotton activities of SOMIEX is outside the scope of the project and would
not be affected by these arrangements.
C. Project Investments
(i) Cotton and Coarse Grain Development
2.20     In the last year (1977) for which statistically representative data
are available, 1/ the average family farm size was 4.6 ha, feeding 11 to 12
persons. About 65% of the average farm is under improved crops (typically 50%
cotton or groundnuts and 50% maize and cowoeas in rotation). The balance is
sown to traditional cereals (sorghum and millet) and pulses (cowpeas). The
project aims at increasing the total improved acreage to 73% or 336,000 ha.
This would be attained by: (i) adding approximately 6,600 farmers to those
reached by CMDT, and by so doing increasing the extension coverage from 86% to
92%; (ii) increasing the average acreage of improved crops per farm; and (iii)
slightly increasing overall yield levels of improved crops through a further
improvement in farming techniques. To reach these objectives, CMDT would
distribute fertilizers and quality seeds; provide extension services (para.
2.39); construct 113 improved adobe staff houses; and procure 2 vehicles,
1/   A large-scale survey was conducted in 1982.  The results are not yet
fully analysed but on the basis of provisional figures these orders of
magnitude are still valid.

63 motor bikes, equipment and furniture. All salaries of local staff and
operating expenses would be recovered through the cotton price schedule.
2.21     Cotton.  Over a five-year period CMDT would add 10,000 ha of cotton
in the area of Bougouni where production has been lagging behind other CMDT
zones because of the poor condition of access roads, a lesser density of
extension services and shorter experience with cotton technology. In the
older cotton growing areas, approximately 4,000 under-equipped smaller farmers
would receive loans for agricultural equipment and draft-oxen. However, the
total incremental cotton area (16,000 ha) directly depends on the policy
reform program (para. 2.04). With a slight average increase in production
from 1.15 tons of seed cotton per ha to 1.25 tons per ha, also as a result of
continued improvements in pesticide coverage (five treatments instead of
four), total CMDT production would increase from 115,000 tons estimated for
PYO to 157,000 tons in PY5 (Table 2.5). This is slightly lower than could be
expected on the basis of a linear regression of the area under cotton since
1960-61, including the Sahelian drought years, but excluding the 1981-82 low
(Chart D). Without-project acreage is assumed to recover to 110,000 ha, and
yields to fluctuate around 1.15 tons per hectare.
2.22     Coarse grains (maize, millet and sorghum).  Before the Mali Sud
project, most farmers grew about a hectare of cotton as a cash crop and sowed
most of the rest of their land (2 to 3 ha) in foodcrops (mainly millet and
sorghum) using traditional techniques and virtually no cash inputs. CMDT's
extension package for foodcrops includes the use of fertilizers and quality
seeds (from CMDT's own seed farm), and the introduction of maize growing in
full field scale (as against in garden plots) as a higher yielding alternative
to millet and sorghum. Under the project, the area under improved maize would
double and reach 60,000 ha by PY5. The number of farmers growing maize would
increase from the present 29,000 to approximately 60,000, and they would
produce a total of 162,000 tons of maize. Average yields would increase from
2.0 to 2.7 tons per ha. The area under improved sorghum and millet would
increase from 115,000 ha to 150,000 ha, and total production would reach
165,000 tons, To further improve the farming system, making a more efficient
use of soil moisture under rainfed conditions, preventing serious soil ero-
sion, and to encourage a further integration of animal husbandry and agricul-
ture, CMDT would promote the intercropping of cowpeas with coarse grains. The
project s objective would be 18,000 ha of cowpeas by PY5.
(ii) Livestock Development
2.23     The many achievements attained by the livestock component in Mali-Sud
I would continue, in particular the integration of livestock and agricul-
ture. The goals to be attained would include better animal health coverage
and higher nutritional level of about 630,000 head of cattle, including about
170,000 draft oxen, belonging to CMDT farmers. The nutrition of cattle should
be further intensified by producing more farm-grown forage, and using more
cottonseed concentrates and mineral supplements. The already impressively
high production of farmyard manure would be further expanded by construction
by farmers of cattle pens for manure production. The number of draft oxen
would be increased and selection for heavier animals would be undertaken.

Also, oxen would be fattened before culling and the culling age would be
reduced from 12 to 9 years. The CMDT livestock service would continue to be
responsible for livestock activities in collaboration with CMDT's agricultural
extension service. Investments would include housing for livestock staff in
Sikasso, the headquarters of CMDT's livestock service, and livestock staff in
other CMDT regions. One-year stock of veterinary drugs and mineral supple-
ments would be financed and revenues from sales would constitute a revolving
fund to be located within CMDT. These livestock inputs, except vaccines for
rinderpest and CBPP, would be sold to cattle owners at mark-up prices, suf-
ficient to cover losses and part of the distribution costs.
(iii) Rice Development
2.24     Rice production would increase from about 3,000 tons at present to
about 9,000 tons by PY5 (see table 2.2) through (i) the rehabilitation of the
1,000 ha Klela Scheme and approximately 1,750 ha of small perimeters in the
Sikasso Region; and (ii) the improvement of about 1,500 ha of bottom lands
through the construction of terraces. Whereas the rehabilitated perimeters
would have a full water control irrigation system, the terraces would remain
essentially dependent on local rainfall.
2.25     Rehabilitation.  For the small perimeters, rehabilitation would
mainly consist of the construction of improved drainage outlets and small
retention dikes. Since the design faults in the Klela Scheme (para 1.17) are
more serious, studies would be undertaken by CMDT, assisted as necessary by
outside consultants, including a topographical survey and a soils study. The
execution of civil works would be done under CMDT supervision, on contract.
IDA approval of the proposed investments at Klela (based on the results of the
studies) would be obtained as a condition of disbursements on civil works for
this part of the project. On the Klela Scheme yields would increase to an
average of 2.5 tons per ha and on the small perimeters to 2.3 tons per ha by
PY5.
2.26     Terraces.  All works would be preceded by a detailed topographical
survey (1/2,000) which would also include the catchment areas. On the basis
of such a survey, an execution plan would be made for small contour bunds and
overflows and discussed in detail with the farmers. CMDT would only assist
with the contruction of overflows and earth movement for the contour bunds.
In general, farmers would finalize the contour bunds and execute the necessary
landleveling (not included in project costs, but taken into account in the
economic analysis (para 6.07)). Yields are expected to reach an average of
two tons per ha by PY5. CMDT would recruit an experienced agronomist, and FAC
would provide a (volunteer) irrigation design engineer, to assist in supervis-
ing these programs (para. 4.04).
(iv) Confectionary Groundnuts
2.27     Since 1981, CMDT has managed the existing confectionary groundnut
grading plant at San and has started to promote through its extension service
the growing of confectionary groundnuts in the areas of San and Tominian to
replace kenaf production. The grading plant has an annual capacity of 5,000
tons. CMDT started in 1981 with the distribution to farmers of 100 tons of



- 32 -
improved seed for multiplication.  The objectives of the project are to reach
13,000 ha by PY5, which would easily allow delivery of 4,00 tons of unshelled
groundnuts to the grading plant (see Table 2.5). To reach these objectives,
Ci4DT would distribute fertilizers and quality seeds; provide for extension
services; and construct storage facilities and a house for the plant
manager. The first three years of the project would be used to build up a
stock of quality groundnut seeds, leaving relatively small quantities for
export, which would only increase by PY5, when a sufficiently large acreage
would have been brought under production. Therefore, all local extension
staff salaries, and vehicle operating costs are financed by the project up to
PY5. After that, a specific confectionary groundnut price schedule should
allow full recovery of these services.
(v) Agricultural Inputs
2.28     Fertilizers.  A summary of all input requirements is in Table 2.6.
The project does not require incremental quantities of fertilizers or insecti-
cides over and above those made available to farmers at the peak of the Mali
Sud I Project (1979/80) because the area sown to cotton will not significantly
increase above 1980 levels. Also, the CMDT recommendation for compound ferti-
lizer 1/ usage would be reduced from 200 kg per ha to 150 kg per ha, which
corresponds more closely to actual application rates, which would increase
only very slightly as the cash cost coefficient (para. 2.04) is reduced.
Since the necessity of potassium in the compound fertilizer applications has
not been proven, CMDT would exclude this element pending a detailed study by
the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC).  Research under the
Mali Sud I project has shown that phosphate applications can be replaced by
locally produced rock phosphate of exceptional quality; however, the practical
implications remain to be worked out. Therefore, further applied research by
IFDC during the first two years of the project would be required to establish
rates and methods of application of other essential elements (K, S and B).
During the last three years of the project a total of 15,000 tons of rock
phosphate would be distributed to farmers. Urea applications would gradually
increase from 25 to 50 kg per ha for cotton and from 35 to 90 kg per ha for
maize. Improved sorghum and millet would be grown on the after-effect of the
cotton fertilization.
2.29     Insecticides.  Over the project period the average number of treat-
ments of the cotton crop would increase from 4 to 5, corresponding to an
increase from 10 to 11 liters per ha of pyrethrum-based insecticides. Field
research has shown that insufficient treatments are the dominant factor for
the occurrence of depressed yields in the Mali Sud cotton growing area. The
progressive switch to ultra-low-volume (ULV) spraying and to pyrethrum-based
insecticides as against more toxic chemicals used in the past is expected to
have fewer negative environmental effects.
2.30     Seeds.  The N'Tarla station would continue to supply cotton founda-
tion seed and certified seed would be produced by registered farmers under
CMDT supervision. CMDT would also continue to operate a maize seed farm at
1/   14N - 23 P205 - 8S - 2.5B (K20 omitted on a trial basis).

Sougoula, which under the project would extend its activities to the produc-
tion of improved local varieties of sorghum, millet and cowpeas. All quality
seeds would be sold to farmers for cash. By year 5 of the project, the full
costs of seed production would be passed on to farmers: in the meantime the
CMDT budget would include an earmarked subsidy bridging the (declining) gap
between CMDT price and full costs.
2.31     Agricultural Equipment.  Further extension of cotton production in
the existing production areas is closely linked with equipping a margin of
smaller but viable farms who had previously had limited access ta animal
traction because no credit was available for the purchase of draft oxen and
restrictive downpayment conditions (minimum 20% cash) were applied ta equip-
ment. These farmers cften had to wait until their neighbors had prepared
their own fields before it was possible for them to rent a pair of oxen with
equipment. Since cotton yields are dependent on early planting, these produc-
tive farmers were among the first to drop out of cotton production when rains
were delayed in 1980 and 1981 and farmers exposure ta cash risks increased.
Under the project, draft oxen would be sold to these farmers on credit.
Equipment would be provided in two stages: first, land preparation equipment
(ploughs), and after reimbursement of the first loan (4 to 5 years), planters
and cultivators. Oxen carts, groundnut lifters and ULV sprayers would also be
available on credit (see Table 2.6).
2.32     Small Tractors.  About 25 small tractors have been sold on a trial
basis to the larger farmers (more than 25 ha) over the last three years. The
physical results are generally positive, but both the sales price and mainte-
nance have been heavily subsidized. Some negative effects have also been
discovered in certain areas where their use may lead to erosion (although, to
a lesser extent, this is also true for animal-drawn equipment). Some farmers
with excess land tend towards extremely extensive land use. Under the project
a study (financed separately by CCCE but on terms of reference to be accept-
able also to IDA) would be undertaken to determine how best to transfer the
sales and maintenance activities te the private sector and to investigate more
closely the social costs and benefits of wider tractor use. If the results
are acceptable, all operating subsidies would be removed and medium term
credit would be made available through BNDA directly to farmers. Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that CMDT would refrain from importing more
tractors until the results of the study had been discussed by IDA and Govern-
ment. Provision for up to 160 more tractors has been included in the project
costs from PY2 onwards.
(vi) Agricultural Credit
2.33     Seasonal inputs will continue to be made available on both cash and
credit terms by CMDT, without restrictions on their end-use. However, two
major changes will be introduced under the project. First, credit sales will
now bear a commission of 15% above the cash price, reflecting CMDT interest
costs, administration costs and overdues, the latter now averaging only 3%.
Such a commission would be equivalent ta an annual percentage rate of over
10%, at least equivalent to projected inflation rates (8 to 10%) over the

project period. This should prove a significant incentive for cash sales.
Since the handling costs of delivering inputs on credit account for much of
the input subsidy bill presently charged to cotton export revenues (para.
2.06) a sharp increase in cash sales may also allow a reduction of the average
delivered cost of fertilizers (credit and cash sales combined) and allow
greater flexibility to Government in meeting the overall subsidy ceilings set
under the price policy program. Second, AVs will be able to obtain discounts
for large cash orders, compensating their administrative and handling work,
and a commission based on 100% of loan recovery (para. 2.38). CMDT's recovery
rate on seasonal loans now exceeds 97% in aggregate and approaches 100% for
sales through AV.
2.34     Medium-Term Credit Program.  Medium-term loans will be made through
BNDA (with the assistance of CMDT) to individual farmers, to blacksmiths and
other artisans, to AVs for equipment for group use, and to AVs for onlending
to individual members. BNDA and CMDT have agreed that no (direct) individual
loans for agricultural equipment and inputs will be made to villages where an
AV exists and has agreed to take responsibility for loans to its members.
Major items financed are expected to include animal-drawn equipment (para.
2.51), rock phosphate (given the long range effects, costs will be recovered
through three-year loans), and equipment used by AVs (para. 2.37). Terms and
conditions for each type of loan may be summarized as follows:
Minimum Total
Maturity       Minimum         Contribution
Loan                                  (years)    Cash Downpayment  To Investment b/

Ag. equipment (subsequent units)          4             5%                20%
Rock phosphate                            3             -                  -
Village equipment                        3-7            5%                20%
a/ Including draft oxen.
b/ Including voluntary labor for e.g. land clearing and other payments-in-
kind by villages.
Terms and conditions for small tractor loans will be subject to IDA approval
based on the results of the study discussed above (2.32). The structure of
interest rates and organization of the credit program is discussed in Chapter
IV. Onlending terms and conditions were agreed upon at negotiations. Illu-
strative farm budgets for farm equipment loans are given in the Project File,
Item A 12. Table 2.6 provides a detailed list of agricultural and village
equipment, and quantities of rock phosphate to be distributed to farmers on
medium term credit.
2.35     Access of small farms to credit.  Current CMDT/BNDA joint guidelines
for screening candidates for individual equipment and livestock loans, which
are acceptable to IDA, include borrowers' ability to farm a minimum of 4 ha
with this investment. The farm size criterion is a somewhat arbitrary simpli-
fication to speed up loan processing and cannot adequately address the wide
variety of cropping patterns, soil conditions and income sources found

throeughout the proiect area.  In particular,  :-t_s possible tiat a significant
number oi farms now in the 2 to 3 ha range 1/   many of whoe: use rented equip-
ment -, may be able to make full use of such loans without fully attaining the
4 ha target.  CMDT's evaluation cell would carry out a special study- of such
farms' access to project benefits, vith particular reference to terms and
conditions for agricultural equipment loans, by March 31  1984, aid discuss
the findings of the study with IDA by June 30, 1984.  ln addition, CMDT would
assist BNDA in monitoring a reuresentative sample of borrowers for at least
two repayment periods to assess the impact of these loans, 'armers' abîlity to
repay and any changes in leiding terms and conditions which BNDA and CMDT
should recommend te Government and IDA (para. 4.17).
2.36     Project Banking Network and BNDA Equipent.  During the project, BNDA
would expand offices in Koutiala and Sikasso, open offices in Bougouni and
Fana, and set up skeleton sub-branches at 11-15 smaller locations, as well a,s
mobile offices at e.g. seasonal market centers. BNDA incrementai staff and
operating costs will be met entirely out of BNDA interest income from project;
loans (para. 4.12) but the project will finance the construction or improve-
ment of up to 900 m  of office space, and the purchase of 7 vehicles and 30
motorcycles for use by BNDA field staff.
(vii) AV Development
2.37     The long-term purpose of AV development is to transfer as mluch as
possible responsibilities for input distribution, marketinig and credit
recovery to the village, thereby leading farmers to self management and at the
same time allevlating the recurrent cost burden for Governnent and CMDT.  Over
the project period CMDT would promote the establishment of an additional 600
AVs through: (t) functional literacy and simple accounting training; (ii) the
supply of credit through BNDA for productive investments in marketing equip-
ment, fertilizer and insecticide storage facilities, maize shellers, cereals
milling equipment, shea butter processing equipment, and carpentry and masonry
equipment; (iii) management advice through OMDT's extension services; (iv)
testing of intermediate technology products before these are made available to
the AVs; and (v) promotion of social investments in child birth clinics,
village water supply, village pharmacies and bio-gaz equipment.
2.38     The AVs would derive their income from:  (î) primary marketing of
cotton, at actual savings to CMDT for services performed by AV; (ii) a
discount below medium term credit rates to individual farmers of at least 1%
(para. 4.11); (iii) discount on cash sales of fertilizers and pesticides
distributed by the AV to individual members at 3% of the total sales price;
and (iv) short term credit recovery at 2.5% of principal, providing 100%
recovery is reached.  These rates are based cn minimum estimates Of the costs
saved or benefits generated for CMDT and BNDA by such AV involvement.
1/   This range includes nearly 18% of the total number of farmes, or the
basis of the provisional results of the 1982 survey.

(viii) Agricultural Extension
2.59     CMDT's extension service has been responsible up to now for (i)
agricultural extension; (ii) supply of agricultural inputs; (iii) credit
recovery; and (iv) primary marketing. The service is organized in five
regions, 26 sectors and 133 sub-sectors ("Zones d'Expansion Rurale" - ZER).
Each chief of a ZER works with an average of 4.2 extension workers ("chefs de
Secteurs de Base" - SB). Each SB covers approximately 172 farms in four to
five villages with a total of 440 ha improved crops. Training of AV leaders
and functional literacy training is handled by a separate structure at ZER
level, the so-called ZAF ("Zones d'Alphabetisation Fonctionnelle").
2.40     In view of the transfer of responsibilities to the AVs (see paras.
2.37 and 2.38), the project would aim at (i) integrating the two parallel
structures ZER - ZAF into one ZAER (Zone d Alphabetisation et d'Expansion
Rurale); (ii) upgrading the qualifications of ZAER and SB agents, leading over
time to a reduction in the number of SBs whose level of education is generally
too low to handle more than the strict extension task; and (iii) increasing
the number of farmers per ZAER and/or SB. TJnder the new structure a ZAER
chief, assisted by one or two SBs would be responsible for seven AVs, whereby
the SBs would have specific responsibility for agricultural extension only,
and the ZAER chief would be responsible for AV promotion, functional literacy
and simple accounting training of AV leaders, input supply, short-term credit
recovery, and primary marketing. Medium-term credit recovery would become a
function of BNDA. By PY5 only 1,000 of the 2,500 villages in the CMDT zone of
intervention would be organized in AVs. Therefore, both organizational
structures would continue to exist in the area for some time, i.e. (i) ZERs,
ZAFs and SBs addressing individual farmers, in particular in the new cotton
growing areas, and (ii) a lighter, more skilled network of ZAERs and SBs
working with villages that have formed AVs. By PY5, the total number of SBs
would be the same as in PY0 but the area of improved crops per SB would have
increased by 45% to 640 ha. Based on seven AVs per ZAER, their number would
reach 144 by PY5 and the number of ZER/ZAF would be reduced by 82. Total
extension and training staff would thus show a net increase of 8% over the
project period before an absolute reduction could be envisaged after PY5 with
a further increase in the number of AVs. All incremental extension staff
salaries and operating expenses would be financed by Government through the
cotton price schedule, except for extension services related to confectionary
groundnut production (para. 2.27). Lodging for about 100 extension staff is
included in the civil works program (para. 2.48).
(ix) Training
2.41     AV training.  This component would consist of:  (i) intensification
and further extension of the functional literacy training program geared
towards the needs of the AVs; (ii) practical training of a group of five to
ten persons in each AV in simple accounting, first aid, masonry and carpentry,
maintenance of collective equipment (pumps and mills), and animal health; and
(iii) blacksmith training through the existing network of blacksmiths trained
under the first project. Some of the productive AV investments (para. 2.36)
would only be made available on credit if one or two villagers had been
trained in their maintenance. Practical training would take place in two



- 38 -
sessions per year in the eight existing agricultural schools for young farmers
for periods of up to six months. WPith seven AVs trained per session and per
school, about 50% of the AVs would have been trained by PY5.
2,42     Training of CMT staff.  Within CMDT each level is trained by its
superiors during seminars lasting from 2 days to one week. The annual, week-
long train-ing sessions aim at improvement of the staff's technical level.  In
addition, each month during the growing season extension staff receive a
three-day refresher course. Special subjects such as research on farmers
fields or demonstration fields with farmers are taught during two-dav
seminars. Under the project, training would be reinforced by (i) improving
the practical and technical training of the SBs; (ii) emphasizing AV manage-
ment training for ZERs, ZAFs and ZAERs; and (iii) obliging research workers in
the CMDT area to spend an average of two days per month on training of exten-
sion staff. To reach these objectives, the project would finance construction
of a training materials manufacturing unit at CMDT's headquarters in Bamako,
500 improved adobe village centers for daytime functional literacy training,
4 additional seasonal training centers, and 20 improved adobe housing units
for trainers; procurement of 15 light vehicles and 145 motor bikes for
existing training staff, training equipment and furniture; 23 additional
training staff; related operating costs; and fellowships. Expenses for
ongoing training activities under the first project would under the second
project be recovered through the cotton price schedule.
(x) Applied Research
2.43     0ngoing Research,  Under the first project, two important research
programs have been undertaken: (i) a multidisciplinary commodity program on
cotton centered around the N'Tarla station, and (ii) a farming systems program
at Fonsebougou.  Both programs are executed under the responsibility of Mali's
National Agricultural Research Institute (Institut d'Economie Rurale - IER),
the first partly financed by IDA and FAC with technical assistance from Insti-
tut de Recherche du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT), and the second
financed by Dutch Bilateral Aid (DGIS) with technical assistance from the
Royal Netherlands Institute for the Tropics (KIT). The first stage of cotton-
seed multiplication is done at the N'Tarla station as part of the commodity
research program. The farming systems program which started in 1979 is giving
its first results based on very detailed studies in a relatively small area.
Both programs would continue under the second project, but the farming systems
program would be redesigned to widen its scope and make it more representative
to conditions prevailing in the CMDT area. Under the second project, the
cotton program could be jointly financed by IDA, IFAD, CCCE and FAC, with
France providing expatriate technical assistance under parallel arrangements,
and Government continuing to finance local staff salaries. The farming
systems program would continue to be financed by DGIS.
2,44     New Research.  Two programs would be started under the second
project:  (i  an integrated program with CMDT's extension service to test the
results of farming systems research on a larger scale under existing condi-
tions of extension density, and (ii) a fertilizer research program on farmers'
flields to update N, P and K recommendations with the use of rock phosphate.
The first program would be financed by DGIS with KIT technical assistance.



- 39 -
The second program, which would start during the 1984 growing season, would be
executed with technical assistance from the International Fertilizer Devel-
opment Center (IFDC), and be financed by IDA under parallel arrangements. A
contract satisfactory to IDA between IER and CMDT has been signed, governing
the implementation of the research programs by IER, and linkages between
extension and research staff.
(xi) Cotton Tracks
2.45     CMDT maintains about 3,000 km of cotton tracks not registered in the
Public Works Department ledgers. The quality of maintenance has deteriorated
in recent years because of insufficient funding of these activities. Some
parts are now to be rehabilitated, in particular waterway crossings. In
addition, in the new areas to be developed intensively by CMDT in the Bougouni
region some 30 km of new tracks need to be constructed. The project would
provide CMDT with additional equipment (trucks and graders) and contruction
materials. At the same time, CMDT's Civil Engineering Division would be
reinforced through technical assistance. One of the major improvements over
past practices would be the preparation of workplans based on length and cross
profiles. This would not only enhance proper budgeting and budget control
procedures for this component, but also improve the quality of the works. IDA
disbursements for vehicles and equipment for track maintenance and rehabilita-
tion would be subject to the presentation of a study by a roads engineer
(financed by FAC) under terms of reference to be agreed by IDA, including a
complete inventory of the 3,000 km existing tracks and related waterway
crossings. Road construction materials, equipment operating costs and staff
salaries for rehabilitation of existing tracks would be recovered through the
Cotton Account.
(xii) Village Water Supply
2.46      Two village water supply projects are presently operating in the
area: (i) since 1975 the Mali Aquaviva project has installed 435 productive
wells in the NE part of the project area, and (ii) since 1978 the Helvetas
project (Swiss aid) has installed 180 wells in the SW part. In the central
part of the project area, covering approximately 1,600 villages, no such
services exist. In 85% of the cases traditional hand dug wells run dry each
year before end of March, and water has to be carried in from several kilo-
meters away, adding to the work burden of the farm population and women in
particular. The risks of contaminated water from open dug wells constitute an
additional health hazard.
2.47     Under the project 400 wells for village water supply and 50 for pas-
toral use would be constructed. Cost estimates include a 35% risk factor for
failure (dry well) and are based on the following estimated distribution of
well depths: 25% less than 12 m, 55% between 12 and 20 m, and 20% over 20 m.
The total program would be executed by a drilling contractor over a three-year
period under the supervision of a specialized consulting firm responsible for
detailed hydrogeological and geophysical investigations. CMDT would
administer the contractor and consultant contracts and prepare annual work
programs for 150 wells, giving priority to villages organized in AVs, accord-
ing to the following criteria:



- 40 -
(i) existing traditional wells would run dry before February each year;
(ii) the walking distance to the nearest alternative source of water
supply would be over one hour;
(iii) the size of the village and, in the case of pastoral wells, the size
of the sedentary herd; and
(iv) existing resources of the AV or village.
Wells would only be drilled after the AV had met the downpayment for the pump
and in the case of pastoral wells had in addition constructed a pen for cor-
ralling cattle at night. Hand-operated pumps would be placed by local black-
smiths after one or two persons in the village had been trained for their
maintenance (see para. 2.41), and the village had constructed a sump for
excess water, and a concrete slab and fence around the well. The Direction de
l'Hydraulique et de l'Energie (DHE) would be responsible for the technical
supervision of the contractor and consulting firm under an existing agreement
with CMDT whose terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. Stocks of pump
parts would be placed with local blacksmiths, and a limited member of spare
pumps retained by CMDT. The latter would provide all maintenance training to
AV representatives and installation advice to blacksmiths. Blacksmith ser-
vices would be recovered at full cost from villages. CMDT would not create a
maintenance unit and would not provide direct maintenance services during the
project.
(xiii) Primary Health Care
2.48     This component would be a continuation and extension of the action
started under the first project which covered five administrative districts
and would now be extended to eight districts. 1/ Over the project period, 500
existing village health workers and 250 traditional birth attendants would be
trained bi-annually by existing doctors, midwives, nurses and rural health
workers who would receive an annual trainer's course given by existing
regional training teams with assistance from CESAO (Centre d'Etudes Sociales
de l'Afrique de l'Ouest). The project would further provide for means of
transport (nine light vehicles and 38 motorcycles) and training equipment.
All birth attendants and village health workers would receive medical kits.
First aid boxes (village pharmacies) with a restricted number of drugs (in
particular malaria pills) would be made available for sale to AVs that have
one or more persons trained in first aid (see para. 2.41). Replenishment of
the village pharmacies through the existing official state pharmacies in the
area (Pharmacie Populaire) is the responsibility of the AV.
(xiv) Miscellaneous Civil Works
2.49     The project includes the construction of 2,000 m2 of housing, 900 m2
office space (BNDA, para. 2.35) and 700 m of storage facilities. Most of the
housing units are for the agricultural extension and research components and
1/   Sikasso, Koutiala, Yorosso, Kadiolo, Bla, San, Tominian and Dioila.



- 41 -
construction would be with improved adobe only. Also included is the pavement
of the areas around the cotton gins of Fana, Koutiala, Kamparana and
Bougouni. A total of 13,800 m2 would be asphalted to decrease the high main-
tenance costs of the laterite cover and to prevent dust affecting machinery
and cotton quality. In addition, fencing will be installed (total length
1,000 m) around the CMDT workshops of Sikasso, Koutiala and Fana, to protect
the expensive equipment and sparepart stocks.
III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A. Cost Estimates (Table 3.1)
3.01     Total project costs, including MF 3.3 billion (US$4.6 million) for
identifiable import duties and taxes or 5.5%, are estimated at MF 59.7 billion
(US$84.0 million) with a foreign exchange component of 71.3%. Cost estimates
reflect mid-1983 prices. Physical contingencies include 15% for all capital
and operating costs, except for fertilizers, medium-term loans, staff,
vehicles and equipment, since quantities or numbers are clearly established or
- in the case of credit - the physical program is taken as indicative.
Expected price increases for all project expenditures are compounded at the
following annual rates:
Project Year           %
1983                  8.0
1984                  7.5
1985                  7.0
1986                  6.5
1987                  6.0
No significant distortion between local and foreign rates of inflation is
predicted which would not rapidly be adjusted via the Malian/French Franc/
dollar exchange rate. Total expected price increases amount to 17% of total
project costs or 27% of base cost. Costs are detailed in the Project File,
Item A 7 and summarized below at Table 3.1. The method used to estimate
programmatic costs is explained in Chapter 2 above (paras. 2.12 to 2.16).
B. Proposed Financing (Table 3.2)
3.02     Malian sources (Government, BNDA and beneficiaries) would finance
US$23.3 million equivalent or 28% of project costs, including 97% of local
costs. IDA would finance US$25.9 million (31%), IFAD US$13.0 (15%), CCCE
US$11.3 million (13%), and three other bilateral sources (FAC, the French

Agricultural Research Assistance Program and the Netherlands) the balance of
US$10.5 million (13%).
3.03     It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$25.9 million be made to
governnent of Mali on standard terms to finance 43% of external financing
requirements. The credit would cover 74% (US$12.0 million) of fertilizers and
pesticides in support of the policy reform program (para 2.04), under parallel
arrangements; 100% (US$1.3 million) of expenditures on rock phosphate research,
OSRP technical assistance, and annual audits; and 36% (US$12.6 million) of
expenditures on civil works, vehicles and equipment, expatriate staff and
consultants, and operating costs, financed jointly with CCCE, FAC and IFAD.
3-04     Out of a total external financing requirement of US$60.7 million,
US$34.8 million or 57% have been committed by other donors. France would
continue to finance three expatriate research workers at the N'Tarla research
station and the chief of CMDT's monitoring and evaluation unit under parallel
arrangements through the "Convention Franco-Malienne pour la Recherche" for a
total of US$2.2 million (para 2.43). The Netherlands would finance two pro-
grams on farming systems and research/extension linkage (paras 2.43 and 2.44)
under parallel conditions and to be negotiated separately for a total of
US$4.1 million. FAC would finance one expatriate for sorghum and cowpea
research for a total of US$0.5 million. CCCE would finance the hydrogeologi-
cal and geophysical consultants for the village water supply component (para
2.45) under parallel arrangements for a total of US$1.2 million, and 26% of
fertilizers and pesticides in support of the policy reform program (US$4.2
million). Thus, total parallel financing would amount to US$25.5 million.
The remainder, US$35.2 million, would be financed jointly by IDA (US$12.6
million, or 36%), CCCE (US$5.9 million, or 16%), FAC (US$3.7 million, or 11%),
and IFAD (US$13.0 million, or 37%).
3.05     Government would finance identifiable taxes (US$4.6 million), delayed
cotton track maintenance and incremental local staff, for a total of US$9.1
million or 11% of project cost.  CMDT would recover Government's participation
through the cotton price schedule (para. 2.10). BNDA would finance its
expatriate staff and all its operating costs for a total of US$2.7 million.
The beneficiaries would pay for all inputs such as seeds, fertilizers,
insecticides, drugs, vaccines and cattle feed. Further, they would pay for
landleveling for the development of rice terraces and for construction of
village child-birth clinics and stores. The largest part of the beneficiary
financing would be their participation in the medium-term credit financing
requirements (downpayment and repayments within the project period). Bene-
ficiary financing would amount to US$11.5 million or 14% of total project
cost. Apart from the $3.6 million onlent by Government to BNDA at 3% (para.
4.12), and $0.5 million channelled to OSRP in grant form for technical
assistance costs, the proceeds of the Credit would be passed in grant form to
CMDT. A sinking fund to retire all project external obligations would be
constituted through an earmarked levy on cotton lint col'lected by OSRP
(para. 2.10).

C. Procurement
3.06     Civil Works, Equipment and Agricultural Inputs.  Fertilizers and
pesticides totaling US$12.0 million (IDA's share of the policy reform
program), would be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Works
on well drilling to be carried out under one contract amounting to US$5.9
million, including contingencies, would also be procured by ICB, and qualify-
ing domestic contractors would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 7-
1/2%. The balance of construction works to be financed under the project,
totaling US$6.3 million, consists of minor works and buildings of estimated
contract size less than US$500,000 scattered throughout the region, often to
be constructed with local materials (improved adobe), and not likely to
interest foreign bidders. These works would be procured by local competitive
bidding procedures, with foreign bidders having the right to participate.
CMDT follows Government procurement procedures which are satisfactory to
IDA. Goods, vehicles and equipment totalling US$1.8 million, including con-
tingencies, would be grouped into appropriate bidding packages and procured by
ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines, and qualifying domestic manufacturers
would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% or the import duty, which-
ever is the lower. Small vehicle orders and miscellaneous items of equipment
and furniture in packages of less than US$100,000 and totaling US$1.8 million
approximately would be procured under local competitive bidding procedures
satisfactory to the Bank. Agricultural equipment, manually-operated pumps and
other village investments, and locally-produced rock phosphate, all under the
medium-term agricultural credit program (US$18.1 million) involve a large
number of small deliveries over the project period and will be procured
through prudent shopping. Local suppliers of such equipment are well repre-
sented. Overall, US$19.7 million in civil works, equipment and fertilizer
contracts are expected to be procured under ICB or 43% of the total (US$45.9
million) involving IDA financing.
3.07     Contract Review, Consultants.  All bidding packages for works, fer-
tilizers and pesticides estimated to cost over US$500,000, and bidding pack-
ages for vehicles and equipment estimated to cost over US$150,000 would be
subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation, resulting in
a coverage of about 48% of the total estimated value of work contracts, 100%
of fertilizers and pesticides contracts, and 50% of vehicles and equipment
contracts. The balance of contracts would be subject to random ex-post review
by the Bank after contract award. Expatriate staff would be provided by CFDT
under the terms of the CFDT/CMDT management agreement, or be hired directly on
IDA guidelines. Consultants on short-term assignments would be retained
following IDA guidelines. Average costs per consultant man-month, including
subsistence, are estimated at $10,000.
D. Disbursements
3.08     IDA disbursements would be made against the following categories of
expenditures:



- 46 -
Category I:       Civil Works, 36% of foreign expenditures and 32% of local
expenditures: (a) for BNDA buildings (US$0.1 million);
(b) other civil works (US$2.9 million);
Category II:      Vehicles and Equipment, 36% of foreign expenditures and
32% of local expenditures: (a) for BNDA use (US$0.1
million); (b) other ($0.8 million);
Category IIII:    Medium Term Loans, 36% of loans extended to project
farmers, villages and AVs (US$3.4 million);
Category IV:      Consultants' and Experts' services, (a) 100% for fer-
tilizer research and annual audits of CMDT (US$0.8
million), (b) 100% for technical assistance and annual
audits of OSRP (US$0.4 million), and (c) 36% for other
consultants' and experts' services (US$1.1 million);
Category V:       CMDT Operating Costs (except salaries), 32% of total
expenditures (US$1.3 million);
Category VI:      Training Fellowships, 36% of total expenditures (US$0.7
million);
Category VII:    Fertilizers and Insecticides, 100% of foreign expendi-
tures up to a maximum of US$12 million, of which not more
than $7 million to be disbursed by December 31, 1984, $9
million by December 31, 1985, and $11 million by December
31, 1986 (para. 2.16).
Category VIII:   Initial deposit to revolving fund (US$0.5 million);
Category IX:      Refunding of Project Preparation Advance
(US$0.1 million); and
Category X:       Unallocated (US$1.7 million).
Disbursement of the IDA Credit would be made against supplier's invoices and
import documentation for the purchase of all capital items (civil works,
vehicles, equipment, fertilizers and insecticides) of individual values in
excess of US$10,000; against statements of medium-term loans made by BNDA; and
against certified statements of expenditure for other locally-procured civil
works, goods and services, through a revolving fund arrangement. This fund
would be replenished quarterly, to a separate bank account in the name of
CMDT. Each replenishment would be based on statements of expenditure for
previous periods. IDA and other cofinanciers (IFAD, CCCE, FAC) of these items
would disburse against such statements at the percentage rates set out above
and in Annex 3. Bank account statements and documents of actual expenditure
would be retained by CMDT and BNDA for review by IDA missions and auditors.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the project's co-financiers
would also agree to disburse through CMDT on this basis.



- 47 -
3.09     Retroactive financing of up to US$2.3 million equivalent under
Category VII (fertilizers and insecticides) would be allowed for CMDT pur-
chases made after June 1, 1983 and prior to signature of the Credit Agreement,
to assist in building up counterpart funds for the policy reform program (see
para. 2.14). The estimated schedule of disbursement of the IDA credit is
shown at Annex 2. It was compiled by aggregating (a) a Bankwide profile for
the Agricultural Credit component, (b) West Africa region profile for Area
Development expenditures, and (c) mission projections for programmatie
financing for which no appropriate profile exists.
E. Accounts and Audit
3.10     Assurances were  obtained at negotiations that CMDT, BNDA and OSRP
would develop and maintain their accounting systens in accordance with sound
and recognized accounting principles and practices acceptable to IDA, so as to
provide quarterly progress reports and annual financial statements which
fairly reflect the financial performance and position of the project and of
their own entity, from the commencement of project execution. An auditor's
opinion and report satisfactory to the Bank on such statements would be
provided within six months of the close of the financial year. The auditor's
report would include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting system and
internal controls, on the reliability of expenditure statements as a basis for
credit disbursements and on compliance with financial covenants. The terms of
reference for the audits are in the Project File, Item A 5. Additional audit-
ing tasks under the policy reform program are discussed above, para. 2.17.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Organization and Management (CMDT)
4.01     Overall project implementation would be the responsibility of CMDT.
Its organizational structure is in Chart 24014. Under the first project, the
chief of the training division was in charge of daily operations as project
coordinator, and financial management was in the hands of the chief accountant
assisted by the chief of the budget and internal auditing unit. Under the
proposed project, the senior management structure would be reinforced. A
separate project coordinator would have as sole responsibility the physical
coordination of the project components which are no-; part of CMDT's normal
responsibilities (particularly health and water supply).  He would also have a
reinforced monitoring and evaluation unit (para. 4.16) under his orders.
Project cost estimates include allowance for one internationally-recruited
resident specialist and several man-months of support services for these two
functions. CMDT's senior financial management structure is satisfactory.
However, the recent departure of an experienced chief accountant, and increas-
ing delays in financial reporting, have drawn attention to the need for tech-
nical assistance in accounting procedures and training of local financial



- 48 -
staff. As a condition of credit effectiveness, a full-time training spe-
cialist in accounting and financial management would be appointed with quali-
fications and under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. He would be
retained on a fixed-term contract of 2 to 3 years, until his training
assignment is carried out to the satisfaction of Government and IDA.
4.02     No further changes are foreseen in CMDT's highly decentralized man--
agement structure. Responsibility for daily operations is with five regional
chiefs, who are responsible for all activities in their regions, including
administration, training, extension, transport and ginning of cotton, track
maintenance and other civil works. The chiefs of the five staff divisions in
CMDT's headquarters in Bamako report directly to the General Manager; they are
primarily responsible for programming and supervision of the activities in
their respective fields of competence. Organization of training and extension
field staff is described in paras 2.39 through 2.42.
4.03     Existing Technical Assistance.  Since 1974 CMDT has had a management
agreement with CFDT at a cost of 2,500 MF (US$4.2) per ton of seed cotton pro-
duced. This agreement covers: (i) technical support by CFDT headquarters in
Paris; and (ii) administrative overhead costs of expatriate staff furnished by
CFDT. Under the project, these arrangements would continue. The following
headquarters positions are presently held by internationally-recruited staff
furnished through CFDT: the financial director, and the chief of the training
division. The chief of the civil works division has been recruited indepen-
dently. The chief of the monitoring and evaluation unit, staff responsible
for the confectionary groundnut program (from IRHO), and a research worker
responsible for maize research are furnished and financed by FAC. Three
cotton research workers are being furnished by IRCT and financed by France
(convention Franco-Malienne). Two research workers for the farming systems
research program are furnished by KIT and financed by The Netherlands. Total
CMDT expatriate staff numbered 14 in 1982 as against 34 in 1973, when produc-
tion was less than half current levels.
4.04     Summary of Senior Staff Requirements.  Under the project, three
additional senior staff would be recruited on mutually agreed terms of re-
ference and qualifications:
(i)  a training specialist for CMDT, through CFDT (see para. 4.01);
(ii) an agronomist for CMDT's rice program, through CFDT, by March 31,
1984 (para. 2.26);
(iii)  the Co-Manager o2' the Cotton Account and Guarantee Fund (attached to
ORSP), independently recruited (para. 2.17).
Recruitment of positions (i) and (iii) would be a condition of effective-
ness. In addition, CMDT would continue to retain personnel whose quali-
fications are satisfactory to IDA in the following (existing) senior posi-
tions; (iv) agronomist specializing in confectionary groundnuts; (v) project
coordinator; (vi) monitori.ng and evaluation specialist; (vii) financial
manager; (viii) agronomis-; specializing in maize production; and (ix) engineer
for the track maintenancfc program.



- 49 -
4.05     Consultants.  For some components of the project CMDT does not have
the required experience, but nor does it need to acquire the necessary exper-
tise on a permanent basis. For such components outside consultants would be
responsible for project implementation. The fertiliser research program would
be the responsibility of IFDC (paras. 2.28 and 2.44). The village water
supply component would be implemented by an outside consultant financed by
CCCE under parallel arrangements (para. 2.47). Studies for major works on the
Klela Irrigation Project (if any) would be done by outside consultants. All
topographical work for the development of rice terraces would be done by local
firms (para. 2.25).  The annual audit of CMDT would be done by an auditing
firm under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The studies of CMDT's
production cost structure and CMDT asset valuation, SOMIEX export operations,
and groundnut marketing would also be carried out by outside consultants under
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.
B. Agricultural Credit Services (BNDA)
4.06     Agricultural Credit Program.  The physical objectives of the FM 12.8
billion 1/7(US$18.0 million) medium-term credit program (para. 2.33) will be
implememted by a line of credit through the Banque Nationale de Developpement
Agricole (BNDA), assisted by the field services of CMDT. BNDA was established
in 1981, with financial and technical assistance from FAC and CCCE (France).
Its equity base of FM 2 billion (US$2.8 million) is held by the Malian Govern-
ment (55%), CCCE (20%), BCM (15%), and BDM (10%). Its governing Board is
chaired by the Minister of State for the Economy and Plan and includes the
Minister of Agriculture. Day-to-day operations (including approval of loans
below FM 5 million (US$7,000) are the statutory responsibility of a General
Manager, who is currently an expatriate with considerable West African credit
management experience.  He is assisted by about 10 senior staff, three of whom
are also expatriate specialists. BNDA is subject to the considerable over-
sight powers of BCM. The latter, in addition to its equity shares in BNDA and
BDM, regulates interest rates on loans and deposits, sets liquid asset and
gearing ratios, and limits exposure on individual accounts both through
administrative controls and as a condition of access to rediscounting facili-
ties which are the banking system's major source of funds.
4.07     BNDA was created to (a) help fill the vacuum left by SCAER (para.
1.08) in providing financing for seasonal and medium-term agricultural inputs,
(b) complement, through an appropriate branch network, the services of BDM and
commercial banks to corporate, individual and cooperative depositors and bor-
rowers, particularly AVs and Operations such as CMDT, and (c) (ultimately)
provide an alternative vehicle for rural savings mobilization. BNDA policy is
to expand only prudently, beginning with areas of high potential such as Mali
Sud and Mopti, within the limits imposed by substantial staff training re-
quirements. It seeks to develop a few large, low-cost revolving lines of
credit with well-managed organisations such as CMDT so as to crosssubsidize
1/   Including price contingencies.



- 50 -
the much more expensive administration of small farmer development loans. For
the next 3-5 years, it will finance the latter only in areas where it obtains
the active cooperation of effective extension services such as those of CMDT
whilst BNDA develops its own network and the means to reach farmers through
group channels such as the AV system (paras. 2.37 and 2.38).
4.08     Recent Performance and Importance of CMDTn  BNDA has opened major
branches in Bamako, as well as Koutiala and Sikasso in the project area, to be
followed by Segou and Mopti (Interior Delta region) in 1983. Its loan port-
folio at end-1982 was some FM 10.9 billion (US$15 million), of which 80% in
the form of revolving seasonal credit to a single client, CMDT.  BNDA has beern
allocated by Government a 30% share (second only to BDM) in CMDT's syndicated
overdraft requirements, These now peak at about FM 34 billion (US$48 million)
in February/March of each year, the end of the cotton buying season, and
should more than double during the project period. Other significant clients
include agribusinesses such as SMECMA (agricultural equipment) and Grands
Moulins du Mali (flour mills), mostly through CCCE-refinanced medium-term
loans. Finally, a small but fast-growing portfolio of loans to larger farms
(e.g. tractors, orchards) and AVs (for equipment, and pre-season cereals stock
financing) is expected to absorb about FM 200 million this year mostly in the
Mali Sud and Bamako areas. Gross income for 1982 is estimated at FM 600
million (US$8.5 million) mostly from the 7.5% yield on short-term loans. This
compares to a FM 390 million (US$0.6 million) cost of borrowing (mainly at 6%
Central Bank rediscounting facility) and FM 180 million in salary/operating
expenses and depreciation, leaving a FM 30 million operating margin. This
slim profit (only 5% of gross income) is insufficient to make adequate provi-
sions for bad debts. It is clear that for a start-up period of several years,
BNDA will require a special banking relationship with CMDT involving as large
as possible a share of this high-volume, low-cost business. Also, Government
has agreed to allocate priority to BNDA in any domestic Guarantee Fund place-
ments (para. 2.11).
4.09     Administration of Project Credit Program.  CMDT and BNDA have entered
into an agreement satisfactory to IDA covering the procedures and responsi-
bilities for loan administration. Under the agreement, CMDT field staff would
continue to screen individual loan applications as they now do for CMDT-
financed loans, but would channel them to BNDA branches for disbursement and
subsequent loan administration. CMDT would continue to handle all deliveries
of equipment, verification of installation and assist with loan recovery in
areas where BNDA is not sufficiently represented. BNDA would bear the finan-
cial risk for these loans and therefore make the final judgment on borrower
eligibility. BNDA began its own collection efforts in 1982 in the major grow-
ing areas around Sikasso and Koutiala, and is already bearing the risk of non-
recovery. The latter has been virtually negligible under CMDT management
(over 95% aggregate recoveries within the last two years). It will also
continue to be conditioned by CMDT's control over cotton marketing, its
substantial role in cereals procurement, and the contractual obligation of
BNDA borrowers to sell cash crops to CMDT in quantities at least equivalent to
their debt service requirement.



- 51 -
4.10     In the case of AV group lending, BNDA has already begun a cluster of
direct medium-term financing programs covering a variety of AV needs witheut
direct CMDT participation, and will expand tne number of these contracts pro-
gressively. By the end of the project it is expected that a majority of AVs
will have developed such programs. CMDT wilI be remunerated for its loan
canvassing, screening and supervision work by a flat 6% commission over the
net equipment price (passed on to the borrower) and will als manage a (dis-
cretionary) livestock replacement fund constituted by a 6% levy on each animal
at market price. It will not bear financial responsibility for overdues nor
receive an interest margin as such. It will continue to collect reimburse-
ments of medium-term loans issued during the Mali Sud I project, and repay
external lenders (CCCE and BADEA) with the proceeds. However, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that CMDT will abstain from making any new loans
after IDA Credit signature. CMDT loan documentation and processing procedures
are being modified with BNDA technical assistance under the terms of their
agreement.
4.11     General Lending Terms and Conditions.  Loan maturities and minimum
downpayments are set out in para 2.34 above. Technical criteria on e.g.
machine utilization rates are to be established by CMDT and BNDA based on
current CMDT practice, which is satisfactory. BNDA currently applies a 10%
lending rate for individuals (for small-scale equipment loans such as proposed
under the project), and allows a margin of 1% to AV where these absorb sig-
nificant group risks and administrative costs. These rates are in line with
the interest rate structure prevailing in Mali and most of its neighboring
countries, represent a slightly positive real interest rate, given average
annual inflation of about 9% in 1978-82, and are consistent with the cash flow
produced by typical investments under this program. Since BNDA is obliged to
operate nationwide using mainly Central Bank refinancing, the introduction of
separate, higher onlending rates on IDA-refinanced project loans, would
introduce unacceptable distortions in the Malian interest rate structure, both
between sectors and between project and non-project borrowers. The introduc-
tion of a 6% front-end fee for equipment bcans financed under the project
(para. 4.10) has the effect of raising the annual percentage rate paid by
ultimate borrowers to over 12% in most cases. In the case of AVs, BNDA would
lend at 9% p.a. (1% below individuals) whether for group loans or for onlend-
ing by the AV to its members: no direct individual Ioans would be made where
the AV already has an account with BNDA and has agreed te take financial
responsibility for equipment loans to individual members. The AV onlending
rate to its members would not be regulated. Already in many AV members pay
higher rates than the AV's cost of borrowing so as to generate funds for other
activities, whereas elsewhere the AV absorbs the differential cost of lending
and may even choose to subsidize hardship cases by lending without interest
and covering the difference from other sources. The above interest rates are
understood net of tax. Governnent presently levies a 20% tax on interest
payments. Under the project, it would have the choice of exonerating BNDA or
compelling BNDA te pass it on in the form of 12% gross rates to individuals
and 10.8% to AV. Finally, Governnent and IDA would review project interest
rates by April 30 of each year, beginning April 30, 1985, with the objective
of maintaining positive real rates as measured against the Central Bank's
inflation index.



- 52 -
4.12     The 3% IDA onlending rate to BNDA (and similar facilities directly to
BNDA for  CCE/FAC, through Government for IFAD) has been calculated as a
residual so as to just balance overall BNDA profitability and cash flow giver!
projections of other costs (see table 4.1). This would allow a 7% gross
spread, of which about 3% would be used to create provisions for project area
losses due to drought and/or animal mortality exceeding the CMDT levy.  A cash
flow shortfall equal to 5% of demand for overdues/rescheduling was built inte
the financing requirement estimate.  IDA/FAC/CCCE/IFAD would reimburse jointly
(see percentages, table 3.3) against a total of 100% of project Ibans made by
BNDA, up te a limit of FM 6.7 billion (US$9.4 million),  This is estimated to
be disbursed over four years, the repayments in years 2-4 covering BNDA
loans for the fifth year of the project. Net external financing requirements
are 52% of project lending:  beneficiaries will supply 48% of the necessary
financing in the form of downpayaents (averaging 9.5%) and reimbursements in
Years 2 through 5 (39.5%). In view of BNDA's narrow owned funds base, the
high risks of more rapid expansion, and the dominant size of the project in
BNDA's portfolio, a significant direct BNDA contribution to the medium-term
financing program is not possible, Onlending maturity from Government to BNDA
for IDA refinancing would be for at least eight years on each refinancing
tranche drawn down, allowing BNDA a safety margin over its maturity of 4 te 5
years to subborrowers.
4.13     Other Provisions.  Except with prior IDA approval, BNDA would main-
tain an overall debt-equity ratio (including statutory reserves) no greater
than 10:1. 1/ It has also agreed to follow lcan monitoring and supervision
guidelines satisfactery to IDA, and to maintain accounts at branch level and
at Head Office which clearly distinguish project-refinanced loans. The
project will finance annual audits of BNDA's accounts and particularly of
statements of expenditure subaitted to IDA for refinancing. Current financial
information controls are judged adequate, but will need to be closely super-
vised during the project given the large increase in lending volume expected.
4.14     Projected BNDA Financial Results,  Table 4.1 summarizes BNDA
projected cash flow and profit and loss projections over the project period
and the evolution of project and non-project portfolio and repayments, assum-
ing a 40% share by BNDA in CMDT working capital financing. BNDA's total
eutstanding lban volume is expected to increase from FM 22 billion to FM 38
billion, its net income from FM 236 million to FM 898 million, its share-
holders equity plus available reserves from FM 2,190 million to FM 4,620
million. Mali Sud project loans are expected to increase from approximately
one-third to three-quarters of total medium-term loans. The project hazard
fund is expected to cover up to 10% of outstanding principal on project loans
by Year 5.
1/   It is currently operating well within this limit and should not
exceed 8:1 during the project (see projections in Table 4.1).

C. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.15     Most of the operational monitoring of CMDT's activities is effi-
ciently done by existing staff, in particular by the statistical section cf
the extension division. This system would continue under the second
project. The need is felt, however, for a more in-depth evaluation of the
varicus project activities, in particular those that are not monitored by the
staff divisions. To meet this need a central monitoring and evaluation unit
has been established under the Project Coordinator. The role of this unit in
technical and socic-economic evaluation would be similar to the role of the
budget and internal auditing unit in financial monitoring. Both units would
therefore cooperate intensively. Detailed terms of reference for the new unit
are in the Project File. Apart from the preparation of quarterly progress
reports, the unit would also prepare a project completion report according to
guidelines acceptable to IDA.
4.16     The evaluation unit would also be responsible, assisted by outside
consultants, for specific studies on (a) the access of small farmers to
project benefits (para. 2.35), to be completed by March 31, 1984, (b) an
evaluation of CMDT's experience with interventions in coarse grains markets,
by March 31, 1985 (para. 5.03), and (c) a market outlook report for confec-
tionary groundnuts, by March 31, 1984 (para. 6.07). As part of its systematic
followup of critical samples of project area farmers, the evaluation unit
would specifically monitor samples of BNDA borrowers under the project who
have taken medium-term equipment loans (small and medium farm size), over
several seasons (para. 2.35).
V. MARKETS, PRICES, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Cereals Marketing
5.01     The financial difficulties of the official OPAM monopoly and the
gradual liberalisation of coarse grain marketing policies since 1980 are
described above (para. 1.08). The official procurement price, FM 90 and
FM 95/kg cf millet/sorghum and maize in 1982/3, has been limited to the role
of a support mechanism and increased by 80% since 1979/80 te a level now
consistent with world import parities. For most of the (bumper) 1981/82, and
1982/83 seasons, OPAM was prevented by financial constraints from buying all
the quantities offered, whilst private merchants - operating openly - were
offering 30% or more below official procurement prices in peak post-harvest
weeks. Consumer prices for OPAM coarse grains were increased by 36% in
1981/82, and 10% in 1982/83. However, OPAM losses on these sales remain
substantial and reducing them through further price increases, volume cuts and
overhead savings is a critical objective in the continuing IMF Standby pro-
gram, the technical assistance to the sector financed by Bank and the multi-
donor food aid project. The latter is now partly covering such losses through
earmarked counterpart funds. For all its imperfections, the scheme has
allowed a clear break with the disincentive policies of the past.



- 55 -
5.02     In Mali Sud, CMDT has traditionally acted as OPAM's supplier, col-
lecting from the farmer at the (uniform) official price and reselling at pre-
determined markups. In 1981/82, it delivered to OPAM over 12,000 tons of
coarse grains, (two-thirds of the national total 1/). CMDT maintains its own
6,000 t capacity (over and above OPAM regional facilities) of modern venti-
lated silos, and uses its substantial truck fleet for collectionu. CMDT's
support buying operations account for perhaps one quarter of primary market-
ings leaving the area's villages, and are particularly important in shoring up
prices in the immediate post-harvest period when farm sales are affected by
peak cash needs. As a promoter of new cereals technologies and seller of
inputs, CMDT's special relationship with area farmers gives it a moral obliga-
tion to try to dampen destabilizing price fluctuations. Also the local market
for certain crops, such as maize, is still fragmented and affected by poor
transport infrastructure, risks of spoilage from humidity, etc.  However, CMDT
cannot continue to absorb the full financial risks of buying throughout its
influence area at fixed prices (regardless of e.g.  seasonal and transport
cost differentials) and selling at a fixed price to OPAM particularly if the
price fails to cover CMDT's cost of collection, storage and transport.
5.03     CMDT's support buying operations, storage and grain trading activi-
ties would therefore continue under the project, but would be designed so as
to reduce the financial risks to CMDT whenever possible.  CMDT would be
allowed to recover full transport, storage and handling costs for all its
collection points. CMDT would be allowed to sell to private buyers at nego-
tiable prices, even for export if OPAM is unwilling or unable to meet these
costs. After the second season of operation of these arrangements (March 31,
1985), CMDT would evaluate the costs and benefits of its intervention in the
coarse grains market, and discuss these results with IDA and Government by
June 30, 1985.
B. Cotton Marketing
5.04     Malian cotton is part of a closely comparable range of West African
growths promoted by CFDT and sold through the services of Compagnie Cotonniere
(CC), the exclusive French-based broker of all the countries involved, at a
fixed 1/2% commission. Malian cotton is a consistent long-staple growth 2/,
with a high ginning yield, and good quality characteristics conferred by hand-
harvesting, low-humidity conditions and careful grading by CMDT. Whilst
accounting for less than 1% of a world export market of some 4 million metric
tons, Mali participates through CC in a West African grouped selling plan of
some 130,000 t annually or 3% of the world market, enabling it to secure
durable buyers among larger spinners who are prepared to pay premium rates to
avoid frequent changes in their raw materials mix. Sales are based on in-
dividual samples and "average" Malian cotton quality varies greatly over time,
1/   And a similar proportion in 1982/83.
2/   Varying from barely middling to strict middling, mostly 1 1/16".



- 56 -
but the best quality samples compete favorably within their length category
with Russian and Mexican cotton in Europe and in the Far East.
5.05     Prices of West African cotton fell in the second half of 1981 in line
with a cyclical world downturn linked to US oversupply, but had recovered to
similar nominal levels by end-1982. The Bank's commodity projections (June
1982) forecast a continued recovery in real terms through 1985 (US$2.02/kg in
constant 1981 dollars versus US$1.76 estimated for 1982). A strong surge in
French Franc prices has in fact occurred in 1983, mainly linked tO the appre-
ciation of the US dollar, but also the underlying strength of dollar prices
for high-quality cotton. West African unit values are not systematically
linked to the reference quotations of, e.g., lexican 1 3/32" monitored by the
Bank, but average 1980 through 1982 levels of Malian contracts coincide with a
10% differential below such quotations. For financial and econGmic analysis,
actual average c.i.f. Europe unit values in French Francs for 1980 and 1981
and partial results for 1982 were inflated by the underlying growth rates
forecast by the Bank, but lagged by one year to 1986, as it became apparent
that any upturn in world demand would be delayed (results in table 2.1). ThiE.
avoids distortions built in to the reference indicators 1/ and smooths the
effect of unstable exchange rates on both dollar and franc prices.
5.06     Long-term role of SOMIEX.  Apart from its negative influence on the
sector through excessive claims on cotton gross revenues (para. 1.28) it is
not clear that SOMIEX is technically needed to handle cotton exports. The
physical transport to ocean ports from CMDT mills is already largely done
through custom hire, licensed agents help with ocean freight and transit
formalities and CC finds buyers on world markets, so SOMIEX's real role is
limited. As in most other Francophone West African cotton producing count-
ries, CFDT coordinates delivery schedules and grading. Moreover, cotton
exports can lose value rapidly if delays in evacuation (through e.g. financial
difficulties) cause physical deterioration, as happened in 1981.  CMDT has a
substantial office staff, established financial controls, and a transport
logistic system which it could probably adapt over time to operate long-haul
traffic of cotton sales, whereas SOMIEX has no significant export activity
other than cotton on which to spread office and vehicle overheads. In several
neighboring countries, the equivalent of CMDT handles all stages of processing
to port of destination, even where a Government agency (e.g. ORSP) is the
recipient of net export revenues. A thorough investigation of the various
medium-term options in handling exports, including the incorporation of
SOMIEX's Export Department into CMDT, will be examined in a marketing systens
1/   Major underlying differences in basing point, currency of contract,
colour, condition, humidity rebates, and particularly variations between
sellers' offer and final price make it impractical to regress Malian
cotton directly on a single quotation for a similar growth. Detailed 3-
year comparison of Malian contract prices to the Liverpool ""A'" ifdex at
spot dollar/FF rates yields a discount (for Malian first quality) of
less than 5%. Since the Liverpool index is a composite of offer prices
not contract values, CC is clearly obtaining competitive prices in this
quality range.

study to be carried out for OSRP by independent consultants by September 30,
1985. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that Government would consult
IDA on the study by December 31, 1985, and that a plan of action for carrying
out the study's recommendations would be presented to IDA and Government by
March 31, 1986.
C. Treasury Cash Flow
5.07     The policy reform program and related programmatic assistance are
specifically designed to protect Treasury's cash flow, net of project counter-
part fund requirements, and to maintain it at (at least) without-project
levels until the production response from year 4 onwards enables it to grow
significantly. This is explained in paras. 2.15 to 2.16 and table 2.4 which
models the cash flow from cotton activities. In addition to this incremental
net flow, which is positive throughout the project, OSRP would accumulate
reserves of FM 5.5 billion (US$7.7 million equivalent) in the Guarantee Fund
if the price and cost projections are realised and past debts of over FM 2.0
billion from OSRP to CMDT would be liquidated through outside funding, re-
leasing OSRP budgeted revenues to this amount. Project-related debt service
is all on IDA or near-IDA terms, averaging 1% over 40 years. This debt would
be retired through a levy collected by ORSP out of gross export revenue (para.
2.10) and earmarked for the Debt Service Fund. Indirect tax revenue on cotton
inputs and on farmers expenditures out of incremental income from cotton and
cereals - for which no reliable estimate exists - would further improve
Government's positive cash flow from the project.
D. Financial Risks
5.08     Sensitivity tests on the base-case show that the Cotton Guarantee
Fund - at about 6% of turnover at the end of the project - would withstand a
cotton production collapse (for a single year) to severe drought levels of
70,000 tons and that the cotton sector would remain viable (after deferring
noncash charges such as depreciation) with a 10% drop in world prices in years
4 or 5. These are already estimated below the level justified by 1982 Bank
commodity price projections (para. 5.05).  However, a substantially larger
fall in turnover, particularly in the first project years when unit costs
remain high, would eliminate Treasury and ORSP surpluses altogether. In this
case, the programmatic financing would first cover the immediate needs of CMDT
and SOMIEX in continuing their ongoing operations, whilst more drastic solu-
tions such as plant closures would be considered for the next year. This
would remain a preferable alternative to sudden collapse in the absence of the
financial buffer provided through this project. The definite earmarking (para
2.10) to the Cotton Account of Stabex cotton receipts (which are triggered by
sudden gross revenue drops, but are paid one year or more after the shortfall
is incurred) may help OSRP obtain bridging finance in such a crisis. Moreover
since CMDT working capital is to be restored at the beginning of the project,
the processing sector will be less vulnerable to temporary fluctuations in
liquidity than was the case in the recent past.



- 58 -
E. Recurrent Costs and Cost Recovery
5.09     The project would put particular emphasis on recovery of recurrent
costs and their accurate budgeting (Chapter 2). The recurrent costs of
earlier programs would be fully covered as would Government's contribution to
the Mali Sud 2 project costs, including 100% of incremental local salaries and
operating costs. The largest single component of project cost is a program of
medium-term loans to farmers requiring a significant downpayment, market rates
of interest and reimbursement within 5 years, constituting a revolving fund
for expansion of lending activities after the project (Government funds are
recovered 8 years after disbursement). The next largest component, village
water supply, involves drilling by contractors, complete village responsiblity
for operation and maintenance charges, a 20% downpayment for pumps bought on
credit (many to be sold for cash), and work and materials for installation.
Given adequate partial replacement and maintenance, the useful life of PVC
lined tubewells is so long that amortization of wells is not an important
consideration, As for the health and livestock components, charges for
medicines and vaccinations would more than cover materials costs. Irrigation
user charges would cover existing operation and maintenance expenses and no
significant new investments are planned. The cotton and confectionary
groundnut processing operations are commercially viable and well managed.
CMDT will recover full input supply and credit service costs through the
policy reform program and the 6% levy on equipment.
F. Financial Implications for CMDT
5.10     CMDT is a semipublic company, managing the fixed assets belonging to
its shareholders (Government and CFDT) for the development of cotton, cereals
and confectionary groundnut production. Its capital structure is totally
geared to working capital needs (minimum ratio of equity to working capital
needs is 1:10 according to Central Bank of Mali rules for access to redis-
counting facilities). Revenue from cotton sales is supposed to provide for
the recovery of all operating costs plus a commission of 5 percent over costs
for equity build-up and dividend distribution. For an initial period of three
years, CMDT was allowed sufficient profit margins to build up its equity ratio
and set aside substantial provisions for the renewal of fixed assets; subse-
quently, financial cover for input subsidy, provisions for fixed assets re-
placement and investment were removed by government, leaving CMDT's capital
structure in a weakened position in spite of increasing working capital needs.
5.11     The project's effect on CMDT's financial structure, as illustrated in
Table 5.1, would result in: (i) a build-up of CMDT's internal reserves,
improving its equity:debt ratio from a present low of 34% to 62% by PY5; and
(ii) sufficient provisions for the replacement of fixed assets. By PY5, CMDT
would be substantially less dependent upon short-term borrowing from commer-
cial banks for its working capital requirements. Detailed balance sheet and
sources and applications of funds projections are in the Project File, items
A 9 and A 10.

FM 55,000 (US$80) per capita.
VI: JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Assumptions
6.01     Separation of price policy and project investment effects.  The
transfer of additional purchasing power to Government and CMDT by financing
nonincremental agricultural inputs (Chapter 2), and thus ta farmers in the
form of e.g., higher cotton prices, is not a direct rescurce ccst to the
Malian economy and therefore not directly quantifiable in the project ERR
eîther as a benefit or as a cost.  However, it is an indispensable financial
instrument tc facilitate these policy reforms and hence the success of project
investments (such as agricultural equipment loans), most of which are comple-
mentary to a favorable policy environment.  Twc different notions of ERR are
therefore investigated below: first, the total effects of the policy referm
program and project investment combined, compared te the combined economic
costs of project investments plus programmatic assistance; second, benefits
due primarily to project investments alone, compared only to the costs cf
those investments. The latter is the more orthodox approach, translating the
net incremental result of preject investments in a "with-policy" scenario that
assumes pclicy cbjectives are already attained; the former quantifies the more
intuitively plausible notion that programmatic financing - 19% of total costs
- is vital to obtaining "project" benefits.
6.02     Agricultural Production - Total Effects.  The project's main
quantifiable benefits would be the increased production of cotton and coarse
grains (maize, millet, and sorghum). The value of annual incremental produc-
tion at full development would be FM 7.3 billion (US$10.3 million) through
28,000 tons of cotton, FM 6.7 billion (US$9.4 million) thrcugh 55,000 tons of
maize, FM 4.5 billion (US$6.3 million) through 33,000 tons of millet and
sorghum, or 39%, 36% and 25% respectively. These benefits would be achieved
through (i) intensification of extension and applied research efforts,
particularly in the under-populated, high-potential Bougouni sector; (ii)
substantial investments in farm equipment and draft oxen, targetted at viable
but under-capitalized farms; (iii) the rapid re-establishment of attractive
terms of trade for the cotton/cereals rotation through the price policy



- 61 -
changes; (iv) the increased productivity of draft oxen and mixed farming
practices through targetted vaccination, drugs and feeding programs.
6.03     Comparison with the Witheut-Project Scenaria - Total effects.  Al-
though there is a real risk of a further downturn in Mali Sud production as a
result of the continuing deterioration in farmer terms of trade (para. 1.14),
the without-project scenario incorporates an increase above 1981/82 levels for
both cotton and coarse grains based on the continuing effects of Mali Sud I
extension efforts. Cotton acreage would increase to 110,000 hectares without
the project, the same levels used te calculate Mali Sud I ex-post returns
(para. 1.19) given also normal population shifts and some increased acreage on
larger, capital-intensive farms. Yields are projected to stabilise at 1,150
kg/hectare, slightly higher than the Mali Sud I average and equal te the good
1981/82 outturn. With-project average yield improvements are very modest (100
kg/ha in two stages), since the input goal is to reduce imported fertiliser
applications, progressively substitute domestic rock phosphate and further
promote organic fertilizer use. However, the continued increase in insecti-
cide applications will have a significant effect through 1987. Full develop-
ment cotton production is within 10% of the 1979/80 historical peak and within
current ginning capacity.  Maize area would recover to 29,000 hectares, then
increase by stages te 35,000 hectares without-project, and 60,000 with-
project: yields would increase from 2 tons/ha to 2.2 and 2.7, respectively.
Marginal increases in yields are a function of efficient seed selection,
improved (partly mechanized) cultivation techniques, and increased fertilizer
applications dependent on project investments in equipment, seed multiplica-
tion, and upgrading of extension services. Improved sorghum and millet,
almost entirely grown in the cotton rotation, would show a progressive in-
crease of some 200 kg/ha with project, and 75 kg/ha "without", over and above
current levels of 900 kg/ha, already above the national average.
6.04     Project investment effects.  Since cotton is the lead crop in the
area, and the highest-yielding cereals are mainly grcwn after cotton in the
rotation, the price policy program will also have a substantial indirect
effect on the farming system and on farmers' willingness and ability to expand
and intensify improved cereals production. There is ne precise way to sepa-
rate price and technological effects. However, te clarify this point, those
investment costs of the project related to cereals and cotton production (farm
equipment, new tracks, increase in extension coverage), and their share of
project management overheads were compared only te those net benefits which
are obviously not strongly linked te the policy reform program, such as most
yield increases in sorghum and millet and most expansion of cotton into new
areas in Bougauni. The hypothetical returns to this investment given full
implementation of the price policy program are discussed below (para. 6.06).
They are based on a yield and area decomposition which apportions te project
investments: 40% of incremental cotton production; 60% of maize production;
and 80% of sorghum production.

- 63 -
6.05     Major Non-Quantifiable Benefits.  The agricultural research com-
ponent, if successful, could have a major impact through introduction of more
productive seed varieties and/or more cost-effective input packages. These
are project objectives, but their degree of achievement and timing cannot be
readily measured, nor can the respective contribution of research, seed multi-
plication, extension, input availability and farmer financial motivation
easily be apportioned over time. By way of illustration, a sustained 5%
improvement in aggregate coarse grains yields, if traceable entirely to
project research efforts, would yield a satisfactory rate of return to the
entire program of applied research on cereals. The health and water supply
components would significantly contribute to the reduction of extreme human
hardship, measurable through high rates of mortality and morbidity, and in so
doing help stabilize village social structures in an area with high resource
potential but increasing migration pressures. The AV and village artisan
development and functional literacy components are a continuation of a
successful attempt to encourage village entrepreneurship and reduce the mas-
sive overhead costs of State services to the rural sector. The institutional
benefits of the policy reform program and agricultural credit programs (BNDA)
were discussed in Chapters II and IV above.
6.06     Treatment of Costs and Other Major Assumptions.  Project life is
estimated at 20 years with no residual values. Farm equipment is replaced
every fifth year after initial investment; 6% of investment costs are added
for maintenance after Year 6. All project investments with the exception of
AV services, health and water supply, but including the full overhead costs of
BNDA and CMDT and all road maintenance, were costed against the major direct
project benefits arising from cotton and coarse grains. The smaller rice and
confectionary groundnut components were costed separately. The programmatie
financial assistance was taken at full cost, for the FM 6.0 million trans-
ferred to Government and CMDT, and at a 10% opportunity cost of capital for
the FM 5.5 billion frozen within the Guarantee Fund (principal is not a cost
to the economy until expended on consumption or investment).
B. Results (summarised in Table 6.2)
6.06     Total Effects Case:  Main Mixed Farming Component.  The economic rate
of return, calculated on 63% of project costs, is 34%. Net present value at a
10% discount rate is FM 29.5 billion and switching points for benefits and
costs at that rate are -31.4% (percentage shortfall in benefits) and 45.8%
(percentage costs overrun) under and over the base case. The ERR would exceed
8% under the relatively severe assumption of a simultaneous 20% increase in
costs and 20% decrease in all benefits, or alternatively costs up 20% and all
benefits further lagged 2 years. Other sensitivities used involve (a) assum-
ing that in each year following the base-case drought pattern (Table 6.1),
incremental benefits are again halved through area reductions given extremely
unfavorable rains as observed in 1980/81 and 1981/82:  this yields an ERR of

24%; (b) a 25% fall in the economic farmgate price of cotton: the ERR is
26%. These are solid results. They are partly attributable to the sunk cost
and learning experience of the Mali Sud I Project and earlier CFDT efforts. 1/
6.08     Rice and Confectionary Groundnuts Components.  The small bottomland
rice improvement and confectionary groundnut components, including technical
assistance costs, yield ERRs of 24% and 28%, and net present values of FM 1.2
billion and 0.9 billion respectively.  The combined project ERR, weighted in
proportion to the NPV of these three components, and calculated on 72% of
total costs, is therefore only slightly lower, at 33%. More relevant is the
extreme sensitivity of the confectionary groundnut component, taken
separately, to cost overruns and particularly to benefit shortfalls. The
critical switching points are -15% and 18%, the former being considered more
probable. This sensitivity is due to the extreme narrowness and volatility of
the specialised confectionary groundnut market, where best qualities currently
fetch premiums of more than 100% over oil-grade groundnuts, but for which no
detailed long-term marketing perspective is now available. Another factor is
the uncertain quality composition of the shelling and calibration plant's
output, only half of which has been conservatively assumed to be of export
quality. However, this activity is the only likely medium-term replacement
cash crop for the rapidly declining kenaf farms at the extreme edge of the
viable Mali Sud zone, and involves mainly rehabilitation of existing facili-
ties. To reduce this market risk, a complete market outlook report for Malian
confectionary groundnuts, including means of lowering handling costs, would be
carried out by project-financed consultants under CMDT supervision no later
than March 31, 1984.
6.09     "Project" Investments-only Case.  The ERR is 22%, calculated on 45%
of total financial costs, and the overall project ERR is 23% when combined
with the rice and confectionary groundnut components (combined costs, 54% of
the overall package). The NPV at a 10% discount rate is FM 11.1 billion, with
1/   To test this proposition, a global rate of return to Mali Sud 1
and 2 investments (using actual/with-project streams and the "without"
Mali Sud l scenario) was calculated. The ERR is 29%, slightly lower
than either project taken singly but still a very strong result.



- 65 -
switching values of -20% (shortfall in benefits) and +25% (cost overrun). The
lower overall result (compared to the "total" effects) underlines the leverage
that policy reforms can have: they yield a very substantial (FM 18 billion)
net benefit. Since the majority of cotton benefits are assumed to accrue to
policy changes, and cotton is a much higher-value crop, the remaining benefits
are (relatively) more sensitive to shortfalls in e.g., cereals prices. This
satisfactory overall result (23%) nonetheless confirms that "project" invest-
ments have their own inherent justification and are not being double-counted
under the umbrella of a highly favorable price policy scenario.
C. Risks
6.10     The project as a whole is relatively insensitive to likely changes in
the base cost and benefit structure estimates which already incorporate cau-
tions assumptions on rainfall patterns and lags in benefits (Table 6.1).
Technical risks are minimal since the improved production techniques have been
widely introduced in the area under the previous project by an extension
network which has been proven to be extremely effective and has secured wide-
spread farmer confidence. Although based overwhelmingly on rainfed agricul-
ture, the project area is not nearly as vulnerable to drought - a 90% pro-
bability of rainfall over 800 mm - as the rest of the country or most of the
Sahel. World market risks - save for confectionary groundnuts, described
above - have been carefully weighed and are judged acceptable. Even in the
event of an unforeseen and protracted erosion of cotton terms of trade, the
programmatic assistance would act as a partial buffer (alongside Stabex) to
allow a more orderly adjustment in the project area out of cotton, whilst not
immediately threatening other development efforts in the area with financial
collapse. Moreover, the proposed progressive elimination of input subsidies,
starting from pricing levels already closer to real costs than in any neigh-
boring country, will make the project and the country far less vulnerable to
renewed surges in imported input costs, as will the progressive transfer of
some of CMDT's responsiblities to village communities.
6.11     The main risk and the greatest challenge of the project lies in
reorganising the finances of the sector so as to preserve viable and produc-
tive rural services against a deteriorating fiscal environment, whilst res-
pecting the most pressing revenue needs of Government and encouraging greater
efficiency. This has two facets. First, there remains the risk that cotton
production, hence the sector's main source of cash flow, does not improve
enough to leave Malian cotton still competitive on world markets, yet yielding
similar absolute (lower relative) levels of revenue as at present. The
projected supply response and the associated fixed cost savings are well
within experience in other countries, but are not certain. Significantly,
lower (or higher) eventual response rates will require reassessment of targets
through the annual tranche review mechanism, whose major indicators are al-
ready framed to allow Government flexibility in application (para. 2.07).
6.12     Second, and more important, there is the risk that the system of
checks and balances introduced under the project, and in particular the eli-
mination of consumer subsidy funding through SOMIEX out of gross cotton re-
venues and of overtaxation of these revenues through other means, will break



- 66 -
down under extreme pressure from conflicting interests. Alternatively, the
required net transfer of resources to farmers through price increases may be
delayed as a political choice. A partial response to this institutional risk
is the procedure of disbursement by annual tranches, requiring positive veri-
fication by IDA that the pricing and taxation agreements and annual program
targets are met before compensatory financing is released. So is the built-in
guarantees of transiting IDA recurrent cost financing through non-fungible
agricultural inputs within the CMDT system, rather than as direct program
assistance to central government revenues. In the final instance, however,
the project remains a test of the willingness of Government to reallocate
resources from consumption towards productive sectors and improve financial
controls throughout the economy, and its success will determine the feasi-
bility of similar broad-based support operations in the future.
VII - AGREEMENTS REACHED WITH THE BORROWER,
CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     Assurances on the following points were obtained at negotiations:
1.       By April 30 each year, Government would declare official input and
output prices which respect: (a) a maximum cash cost coefficient for cotton
farmers of 0.3; and (b) a maximum overall subsidy on inputs, as a percentage
of delivered cost gross of taxes, of 25% in 1984, decreasing to 18% in 1985,
10% in 1987 and eliminated by project completion. These targets would be
reviewed by IDA and Government no later than April 30, 1984 and annually
thereafter (para. 2.04).
2.       CMDT would carry out a study of its cost structure, accounting sys-
tems, asset valuation and provisions for depreciation, by March 31, 1984 and
exchange views on it with IDA by June 30, 1984 (para. 2.10).
3.       CMDT may not engage in activities outside the scope of the project
involving aggregate annual expenditures over FM 100 million except with prior
mutual agreement of Government and IDA (para. 2.10).
4.       Government would automatically commit any receipts from the EEC's
Stabex (with respect to cotton exports) to the Guarantee Fund. Government
would replenish the Guarantee Fund to a minimum level of FM 2 billion if the
balance of the Fund falls below this minimum level at the time of any quar-
terly statement (end-March, June, September, December) (para. 2.11).
5.       CMDT would refrain from importing additional tractors until results
from the study on their utilization had been discussed with IDA and Govern-
ment. The study will be carried out on terms of reference to be acceptable to
IDA (para. 2.32).
6.       CMDT would charge a commission of 15% above the cash price of sea-
sonal inputs for sales made on credit terms (para. 2.33).



- 67 -
7.       BNDA would apply the maturity and minimum downpayment conditions set
out in para. 2.34. Terms and conditions for tractor loans will be subject to
IDA approval based on the results of a feasibility study (para. 2.34).
8.       CMDT would pay to AV:  (a) at the end of each marketing season,
cotton marketing dues based on the saving effected by CMDT; (b) a commission
of 3% on delivery of fertilizers and pesticides for sale on cash basis to
farmers; (c) a commission of 2.5% payable upon recovery of 100% of seasonal
input loans (para. 2.38).
9.       CMDT would employ by March 31, 1984, under conditions and terms
acceptable to IDA, an agronomist with experience in rural engineering. CMDT
would also maintain six existing senior positions filled with personnel whose
qualifications and experience are acceptable to IDA (para. 4.05).
10.      CMDT would abstain from making any new medium-term loans after sig-
nature of the IDA Credit (para 4.10).
11.      Government would cause BNDA to apply a 10% interest rate to indi-
viduals with a 1% margin to AVs, and review these rates annually with IDA with
reference to the Central Bank's inflation index. Any tax levied by Government
on interest charges would be added to these net rates (para. 4.11).
12.      BNDA would maintain an overall debt-equity ratio (including statutory
reserves) of nct more than 10:1 (para. 4.13).
13.      CMDT would prepare a study on small farmers access to project bene-
fits, with special reference to agricultural equipment loans, by March 31,
1984 and exchange views on this study with IDA by June 30, 1984 (para. 4.16).
14.      Government would allow CMDT to sell to OPAM maize, millet and sorghum
at prices which fully cover CMDT transpsort, storage and handling costs, and
if necessary to sell to private traders at negotiated prices. CMDT would
evaluate costs and benefits related to its cereals intervention by March 31,
1985 and discuss these results with IDA and Government by June 30, 1985 (para.
5.03).
15.      Following a marketing systems study to be carried out by Govermnent
by 30 September 1985 in respect of SOMIEX export activities, Government would
consult with IDA by December 31, 1985 with a view to rationalize SOMIEX's
Export Department operations (para. 5.06).
16.      CMDT would cause a study on the Malian confectionary groundnut market
to be carried out by outside consultants not later than March 31, 1984 on
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para. 6.07).
7.02     The content of a draft agreement (Cotton Account Agreement) between
Government, OSRP, SOMIEX and CMDT acceptable to IDA concerning pricing, taxa-
tion, financial management and profits distribution for Mali-Sud activities
was agreed at negotiations (see paras. 2.04-2.16).



- 68 -
7.03     Special conditions of Credit Effectiveness would be:
(i) Government would cause ORSP to open a Cotton Account at BDM and a
Guarantee Fund Account at BCM under the joint signatures of ORSP
General Manager and the Cc-Manager of the Cotton Account and Cotton
Guarantee Fund (para. 2.09).
(ii)  The draft agreement discussed at 7.02 is duly executed by the parties
concerned.
(iii) OSRP and BCM enter into an agreement on the management of Guarantee
Fund satisfactory to IDA (para. 2.11).
(iv)  CMDT would appoint a full-time financial and accounting training
specialist (para. 4.01).
(v)  OSRP would appoint the ceo-manager of the Cotton Account and Guarantee
Fund (para. 2.17).
7.04     Conditions of disbursement of compensatory financing tranches would
be:  (i) observance of the pricing program by Government (para. 7.01(i)); and
(ii) for payments te CMDT in respect of past debts with Government, receipt by
IDA of the auditor's certificate of CMDT accounts evidencing such debts (para.
2.15).
7.05     Conditions of disbursement of other categories of the IDA credit
would be:
(i) As a condition for disbursement on vehicles and equipment for cotton
tracks, CMDT would cause a study of new tracks and waterway crossings
to be carried out by a qualified road engineer under terms of re-
ference agreeable to IDA (para. 2.45).
(ii) Disbursements for civil works related to the rehabilitation of the
Klela Irrigation Scheme would be contingent on IDA approval of pre-
liminary studies (para. 2.25).
7.06     With the indicated assurances and conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for IDA credit of US$25.9 million on standard terms te the Government
of Mali.
