The\n            broad objectives of Mali Sud Second were in accord with\n            Government's policies of increasing agricultural\n            production and farm incomes to improve the welfare and\n            standard of living of the rural population. The Second Mali\n            Sud Rural Development Project (1984-1989) was a follow-up to\n            the First Mali Sud Agricultural Project (1977-1983). Mali\n            Sud First was a first IDA integrated rural development\n            project with a special focus on cotton production in Mali.\n            Project implementation was affected by the unexpected\n            collapse in international cotton prices and the cotton\n            crisis that started as a result in 1985/86. The guaranteed\n            income scheme designed under the ocashcost coefficient\n            system lacked a downward adjustment mechanism to provide for\n            collapsing cotton prices. The linkage of the coefficient to\n            international cotton prices through the cotton guarantee\n            fund, which was inadequate to support the guaranteed income\n            scheme during the crisis years, should have instead been\n            established directly between the producer prices and\n            international prices."}, "docdt": "1990-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
