To achieve\n            this objective, the project plans to provide: (a) extension,\n            input supply and research for cotton, maize, sorghum and\n            cowpeas and for livestock vaccination and husbandry. There\n            are also funds to be allocated for: (b) small-scale\n            irrigation for rice; (c) production and grading of\n            confectionary groundnuts; and (d) support for an\n            agricultural credit bank, especially for farm mechanization\n            loans. Other project components include: (e) training and\n            equipment for cooperatives; (f) upgrading rural tracks; (g)\n            drilling village wells; and (h) strengthening primary\n            health. At the same time, the project intends to help the\n            Government carry out price, tax and institutional reforms in\n            the cotton sector, including: (a) a higher producer price\n            for cotton; (b) smaller input subsidies; and (c) new\n            marketing and tax arrangements to help ensure an adequate\n            cash flow in the cotton sector."}, "docdt": "1983-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
