reduce\n            poverty.  The Government's reform program, supported by\n            the project, aims at: 1) maintaining a tight monetary\n            program supported by an improving fiscal position; 2)\n            streamlining the Government sector and improving efficiency\n            of public spending; and 3) inducing a rapid adjustment of\n            the productive sector to new market signals.  Other\n            objectives of the project are to: 1) provide budgetary\n            support to maintain the level of critical public\n            expenditures; 2) provide foreign exchange for the purchase\n            of critical imports; and 3) provide a framework for\n            financial assistance from other donor agencies.  The key\n            reforms that the project will finance are: 1) removal of tax\n            exemptions and strengthening of tax administration; 2)\n            improvements in collection of energy payments; 3) changes in\n            the provision and financing of social services; 4)\n            restructuring of the pension system and social protection;\n            5) acceleration of privatization; 6) restructuring of the\n            financial sector; and 7) trade liberalization and trade promotion."}, "docdt": "1996-03-20T00:00:00Z"}
