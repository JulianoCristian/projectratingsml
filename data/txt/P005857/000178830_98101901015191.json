Potential\n            sources for the supply of water to these towns had to be\n            investigated and a long-term program for the collection and\n            rational use of these resources had to be recommended to\n            Public Water Corporation (PWC). In addition to these\n            technical aspects, a review of PWC's administrative and\n            financial policies had to be undertaken and ways to improve\n            them and strengthen PWC's management capability had to\n            be set forth. A comprehensive tariff study for PWC had also\n            to be undertaken under the project and alternative water\n            rates capable of ensuring PWC's financial viability had\n            to be evaluated. The examination of a national tariff\n            structure to alleviate the existing financial burdens of\n            some of the small provincial towns, where rates were much\n            higher than in Aden, had also to be undertaken. The studies\n            started in November 1978 with a three-month delay in the\n            original implementation schedule. The Development Credit\n            Agreement provided that the project would be completed by\n            March 31, 1980. Actually the studies were completed in\n            December 1980, some nine months behind the appraisal\n            schedule, due to delays in obtaining PWC's financial\n            statements and some technical data and PWC's lengthy\n            review of the draft documents, and the time required to\n            incorporate many additions and amendments requested by PWC\n            and International Development Association (IDA). This small\n            delay had, however, no effect on the first objective, set\n            out in undertaking the studies, which was the formulation of\n            a construction project for Greater Aden."}, "docdt": "1983-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
