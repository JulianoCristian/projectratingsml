MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS
FOR A HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Mauritius for the equivalent of US$16.0 million to help finance a higher
and technical education project. The loan will be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate, with a maturity of 15 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.    Background. Mauritius has turned its economy from stagnation to relative
prosperity due to rapid economic growth sustained over a long period that has absorbed
its surplus labor. GDP grew at over 7% per annum, and per capita income doubled to
$2,700, between 1982 and 1993. The proportion of the population living in poverty fell
from 28% in 1981 to 10% in 1992, and income inequality also lessened. This success is
attributable to a stable political structure, a favorable macroeconomic environment, and
an ample supply of literate but relatively low-skilled, low-paid labor. However, future
growth will depend on increasing labor productivity in industry and services by switching
from a low technology base to a higher one. A recent Bank study has identified the lack
of personnel with secondary and higher education (especially technical education) as the
major constraint to the shift to a more productive higher-technology society" Mauritius'
Education Sector Master Plan (ESMP) was prepared with wide national consultation and
technical assistance from UNDP, UNESCO, ILO, and the Bank. In it the Government
proposes to achieve four central objectives through a comprehensive and inter-linked
program: (a) to improve access to all levels of education; (b) to enhance the quality of
learning at all levels of education, (c) to foster continuing education; and (d) to strengthen
sector planning and programming. The Government is implementing the first phase
(secondary education) of the ESMIP to meet these needs with support from the Bank and
other donors.
3.    Mauritius has achieved universal primary education, but the secondary gross
enrollment ratio is only about 50%, well behind East Asian levels. Higher education
enrolls 5% of the 18 to 25 age group (three-fifths of whom study abroad helped by
scholarships and tax rebates) compared to 37% and 19% respectively in Korea and
Singapore. The performance of the existing higher education system has suffered from the
absence of a coherent policy framework and a lack of coordination among the four tertiary
institutions (University of Mauritius (UoM), Mauritius Institute of Education, Mahatma
Gandhi Institute and the Mauritius College of the Air). The institutions suffer from low
quality and a focus on certificate and diploma programs, and hence are unable to attract
the best Mauritian students. Thus, the problem of quality needs to be addressed before
expansion of enrollments, while in expansion priority should be given to science,
See Technology Strategy for Competitiveness, AF31E, World Bank Report no. 12518-MAU,
September 22, 1994.



- 2 -
engineering and management. Despite the existence of a formal consultative structure,
there is little regular interaction between the UoM and the private sector, contributing to
the poor perception of the UoM. The faculty-employers councils have been relatively
inactive. The Government created the Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) to
coordinate subsector activities and to develop a strategy to integrate tertiary education
institutions into the national development strategy. The ESMP presents a comprehensive
analysis of the bottlenecks in higher education and proposes four avenues to overcome
them: (a) increasing access to higher education; (b) enhancing the quality of learning,
(c) fostering institutional capabilities; and (d) strengthening the managerial procedures of
the system as a whole. The same broad consultative process as for the ESMP was
followed to produce the 1993 Tertiary Education Development Plan (TEDP). This plan
provides for enrollment expansion, quality improvement and better coordination among
institutions, including use of common facilities (the four tertiary institutions are located on
adjacent campuses). The Government has now requested assistance for the second phase
(university and technical education) of the ESMP and the Tertiary Education Development
Plan.
4.    Presently, university enrollments in engineering and science, areas where labor
demand is strong, account for only about 40% of total enrollments. This is because until
recently the pool of secondary students taking science subjects to qualify for university
admission was low, particularly among girls. The introduction of "magnet" schools in
1992 has helped to increase the pool. Expansion and improvements in university teaching
and research programs in engineering, science, and management have also been hampered
by the fact that fewer than 75% of the faculty hold graduate degrees. This has curtailed
the capacity to teach graduate programs, the amount and quality of research, and the
contributions of the university to policy and strategy development for the productive
sectors of the economy. According to employer surveys, university graduates lack
maturity and a broader perspective, and are weak in applied science and professional skills.
At the same time, employers faced with stiff competition are forced to reduce cost and
increase automation in manufacturing, and are moving into off-shore banking, computer
software, and printing. Their demand for university-trained workers is increasing as are
their efforts to engage university faculty in applied research and product development.
Strengthening the capacity of the university has become a national priority at this time.
5.    As much as half of Mauritius' labor force has no more than primary school
education. Comparable figures for Singapore and Korea are much lower, at about 30%
and 10% respectively. The Mauritian labor force is thus at a disadvantage: with less
education, it is less prepared for training in sophisticated skills and less adaptable to
changes in technology and market preferences. As regards vocational and technical
education, a 1992 labor skills survey indicated the need to increase training in science and
technology, engineering, agriculture, computer science, management, accounting, and
complementary middle level technical skills, in response to demand in the private and
public sectors. Employers consider the present total supply of about 200 technicians a
year to be inadequate to meet demand. There is presently one functioning polytechnic
(Flacq) supported by France, though two more are planned - one for engineering (Rose
Hill) and one for non-engineering subjects (Droopnath Ramphul). All of these are at the



- 3 -
secondary level, but under the proposed project, the polytechnics will take over about half
of the post-secondary diploma programs from the University. The quality and relevance
of the polytechnic programs need to be improved. Presently only 15% of the three-year
curriculum is devoted to science and math; 50% of the time is set aside for laboratory
practice, but there are no intemships or attachments in industry. The technical teachers
have weak science backgrounds and no industrial experience. Linkages between industry
and the polytechnics are weak.
6.    Public expenditures on education amount to about 4.3% of GDP, of which about
an eighth goes to higher education. A further 1.2% of GDP is contributed by private
households. The public share compares to 4.2% of GDP for Singapore, 4.7% for Turkey,
5.6% for Jordan and 8.7% for Syria. There seems to be no need to raise it to meet the
needs of this proposed project. The University has already started cost-recovery for part-
time students and for non-academic expenditures.
7.    Project Objectives and Description. The main objective of the project is to
support the Government's education sector program for higher and polytechnic education,
which aims to produce the human resources required to support a more competitive
economy. The project will assist the Government's program by:
(a)   Strengthening the University of Mauritius through: (i) upgrading the
quality of education at the University through upgrading staff and facilities,
thus making the University more attractive for Mauritian students;
(ii) increasing the number of quality graduates in all fields with particular
emphasis on science, engineering and management; (iii) improving links
with employers in order to: (a) make the curriculum more relevant to
national needs and (b) increase the marketability of graduates;
(iv) developing a viable post graduate education and research program to
attract and retain quality faculty and produce new knowledge in areas
strategic to Mauritius' development; and (v) enhancing the efficiency of
University of Mauritius operations; and
(b)   Rationalizing Polytechnic Education through: (i) improving the quality
of faculty, curricula and facilities; (ii) supporting the development of key
non-engineering programs such as accounting and business,
and strengthening linkages between the polytechnics and both UoM and the
private sector; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the Management Trust
Fund which runs the polytechnics to formulate policies, monitor labor
markets and consult with employers.
8.    Project Financing. Of the total project costs of US$26.5 million, IBRD will
finance US$16.0 million, covering 70% of equipment and furniture, 70% of books, 70%
of training, studies and research, 70% of consultants' services, and 25% of civil works.
The government is expected to finance US$10.5 million. In addition, France has agreed to
finance, in parallel, US$4.8 million for equipment and training for the Rose Hill
polytechnic. The Government will finance US$4.0 million for civil works for Rose Hill,



- 4 -
9.    Out of the proposed loan, the Government of Mauritius has proposed to use up to
US$ 1.0 million (or 6% of the total loan) for advance procurement and retroactive
financing of essential consultants' services and equipment. Such advance procurement is
necessary to complete the rehabilitation and equipping of the new Droopnath Ramphul
polytechnic before its opening in April 1995. All retroactive financing will be for
expenditures after December 1, 1994.
10.   Project Implementation. The Master Plan Coordinating Unit (MPCU) will be
responsible for overall coordination. Set up in the Ministry of Education and Science in
1991 to coordinate all donor-financed projects, the MPCU is currently responsible for the
AfDB-financed Education Project and the on-going IBRD-financed Education Sector
Development Project (Loan 3578-MAS). It has considerable experience in project
management and a good knowledge of Bank procurement and disbursement procedures.
11.   The MPCU is headed by an Assistant Director, who reports directly to the
Minister and will be ultimately responsible for this project. Given the addition to MPCU's
workload, a full-time manager will be appointed to assist the Assistant Director with the
day-to-day management. The manager will be assisted by an accountant and a
procurement specialist responsible only for tasks related to this project. The MPCU team
will work in close collaboration with UoM and the Management Trust Fund which will be
responsible for day-to-day implementation of the two project components. The MPCU
will: (a) consolidate annual work programs, budgets, and procurement schedules, to be
transmitted to the Bank and other concerned parties for review; (b) prepare semi-annual
progress reports; (c) prepare the annual and mid-term reviews; (d) maintain the project
accounts and prepare withdrawal applications; (e) prepare for the annual audit, and (f)
prepare bidding documents and carry out the procurement process. In addition, the
MPCU will monitor the agreed project performance indicators.
12.   In order to facilitate project implementation, and taking into account the
specialized nature of the project's two components, clearly defined management structures
are being put in place. Thus, if one component were to suffer from implementation delays,
the whole project would not come to a standstill. For each component, a coordinator has
been appointed to oversee technical as well as implementation-related matters. The
coordinator will be assisted by a component manager for day-to-day management. This
person will be responsible for: (a) preparation of annual work programs, budgets, and
procurement plans; (b) implementation of the agreed annual work programs; and
(c) preparation of specifications and lists for needed equipment, materials and books. The
component coordinators will be responsible for transmitting this information to the MPCU
for consolidation and procurement.
13.   Project Sustainability. The incremental recurrent costs resulting from this
project will be only 1.3% of the Ministry of Education's 1993-94 budget. Mauritians
studying abroad spend about US$20 million per year on education. The improvements to
the UoM, once they are reflected in higher quality and greater acceptability of graduates to
employers, should encourage more students to stay in Mauritius, leading to significant
savings for the Mauritian economy as the average cost of education at UoM will remain



- 5-
much less than abroad. Three additional factors will contribute further to sustainability.
First, total public education expenditures in Mauritius are around 4.3% of GDP, which is
low for a middle income country, and could increase to 5% if necessary without affecting
other sectors significantly. Second, the age pyramid of the population is changing.
Mauritius, which has already achieved 100% primary education enrollment, will have
fewer and fewer pfimary school entrants in future due to fertility declines in the past two
decades. Finally, the Government has already introduced cost recovery at institutions of
higher learning. As part of the mid-term review, the Bank and the Government will assess
the adequacy of the Government's action plan for sustainable financial arrangements in the
higher and technical education sub sector.
14.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. The PPARs and PCRs of the two
completed projects (First Education Project - Cr. 501/Ln. 1333-MAS and Second
Education Project - Ln. 1 543-MAS) found that, in order to accommodate the
Government's changing education policies and satisfy parental choices, extensive changes
were made in project objectives and content during implementation. The first lesson is
that a clear vision and a policy framework for institutional changes and investments should
be prerequisites for project design. Secondly, project design should be sufficiently flexible
to accommodate the needs of a rapidly changing economnic and social enviromnment.
Finally, a project should not support experimental and innovative activities for which little
commnitment exists on the part of parents, who are the key decision-makers. The two
ongoing projects (Industrial and Vocational Training Project - Ln. 3401-MAS and
Education Sector Development Project - Ln. 3578-MAS) took these lessons into account
by obtaining a consensus on the policy action plan at the outset, providing a flexible
financing mechanism, and including periodic and m-id-term reviews. The proposed project
also incorporates policy consensus and reviews and will, in addition, involve employers at
all stages of the project and thus improve the linkages between education and the labor
market. Finally, arrangements have been made to speed up procurement and loan
disbursement.
15.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Country Assistance Strateg was
discussed by the Executive Directors on May 24. 1994. It endorses Mauritius' growth
strategy, which is based on diversifying production and increasing productivity through
acquisition of modern technology, while developing the financial sector. This will require
improving labor force quality with emphasis on increasing the supply of workers with
higher and technical education. The proposed project responds to that need and thus fits
squarely with Mauritius' development strategy. It is central to the Bank's support,
proposed in the CAS, for the country's transition to a higher-skill and higher-technology-
based economy with NIC status by the start of the twenty-first century. The Bank's on-
going policy dialogue and long-standing support for education and training have placed it
in a partnership position vis-ci-vis the country's education sector. The Bank has assisted
with the development of professional leadership in the sector, advised on policy issues,
conducted supporting policy analyses and helped to improve resource allocation.
Moreover, the Bank's global experience in the development of education is valued in
Mauritius. Its principal role, therefore, is to participate as a partner in the development of



- 6 -
Mauritius' education and, as an external agency, to help stimulate the institutional and
policy changes and reforms needed.
16.   Agreements. During negotiations, the Govemment gave assurances that it will:
(a) implement the project according to its Letter of Higher and Technical Education Policy
and the targets specified for key monitoring indicators; and (b) prepare a plan for the
academic integration of the four tertiary education institutions by December 31, 1997
and implement it by December 31, 1999. The recruitment of appropriate MPCU staff is a
condition of effectiveness.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The project has no related environmental issues and has
therefore been assigned to environment category C. The Government of Mauritius is
particularly sensitive to environmental concerns, as evidenced by its Environmental
Monitoring and Development Project, Loan 3277-MAS, US$12.4 million, signed in
1991). Construction, which has the greatest potential effect on the environment under the
proposed project, is restricted to rehabilitation and expansion of buildings at existing sites.
Moreover, the quality of construction in Mauritius is good, as is that of water supply
systems and services.
18.   Program Objectives Categories. The project responds to the human resource
development objectives of the Government.
19.   Benefits. The economic rate of return for the project is 20% (the benefits are the
increased eamings --representing increased productivity-- of better educated and trained
workers). By improving and expanding higher and technical education, the project will
raise the quality and skills of the labor force, making available a larger and better-educated
pool of post-secondary graduates to facilitate the transition of the Mauritian economy to a
higher level of productivity. The number of annual university degree graduates will
increase from about 200 to about 700, the number of technicians graduating annually from
polytechnics will increase from 140 to 440, and the number of university faculty with
graduate degrees will increase from 120 to about 220. In addition, increased flexibility in
higher and technical education and closer links with employers will help to meet the
changing demands of an increasingly complex and dynamic economic environment.
Finally, the project will result in a more substantial role for UoM in national research and
development and the advancement of knowledge relevant to Mauritius' economic and
social growth.
20.   Risks. The project is subject to two main risks. The first relates to the political
willingness and ability of the Government to introduce some of the needed policy changes
in higher education at this stage. This risk has been addressed by prioritizing and agreeing
on the key reforms needed. The second risk is that UoM may fail to improve quality
sufficiently to be competitive with overseas studies. Elements of the project designed to
minimize this risk include: (i) further twinning with reputed international universities;
(ii) accreditation visits; and (iii) developing postgraduate and research programs.

21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan will comply with the
Articles of Agreement, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT STATUS
Mauritius' implementation performance in its investment operations has
traditionally matched the high quality of its economic management. Although a modest
decline in quality was experienced in FY92-93, the portfolio stabilized in FY94. The focus
of new operations has become the achievement of more difficult institutional goals, often
requiring the cooperation of various interest groups. This sometimes leads to slow
preparation of projects and delayed start-up of implementation. For example, the
preparation of the Industrial and Vocational Training Project was slow, as it required close
cooperation between the Government and the private sector. Efforts made in FY94 to
resolve start-up difficulties are beginning to yield results. In the Environmental
Monitoring and Development Project (EMDP) the legislative and institutional
prerequisites for progress have been met. Staffing problems that delayed the inception of
activities under the Agricultural Management and Services Project (AMSP) have been
overcome. The contract negotiations under the Sugar Energy Development Project
(SEDP) have been concluded and project implementation has begun. All projects have
implementation manuals and a project workshop was held in August 1994 to launch the
newest addition to the portfolio -- Technical Assistance to Enhance Competitiveness.
There are no problem projects and no issue of counterpart funding. There are also no
procurement problems. The key problem of the Mauritian portfolio of recent years --
slow pace of implementation of a new range of projects including the two ongoing
education and training loans -- is being resolved. The disbursement ratio in FY94 was
19.8% -- the same as in FY93 -- but this was only 64% of the forecast. Consequently,
although the Mauritian portfolio is returning to its status as one of the best in the Africa
Region, there is need to sustain the efforts to get it back to its former superior rating.
