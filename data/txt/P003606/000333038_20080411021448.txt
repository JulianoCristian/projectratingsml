1.      Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1     Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

China's energy policy has long included efforts to improve energy efficiency. China developed
a comprehensive energy conservation program during the 1980s, with policy directives,
procedures, regulations, technical assistance programs, and project financing initiatives. These
efforts had a certain degree of success, but the system was geared to the centrally planned
economic system of that time. As China entered the 1990s, needs for further improving energy
efficiency were becoming yet more urgent if the country was to meet its economic development
objectives. However, the systems in place were out of line with the emerging new market
economy and insufficient to meet the depth of the challenge.

Studies completed by the Bank and counterparts in China's State Planning Commission during
1992-941 shed further light on scale and nature of an enormous potential for cost-effective
improvements in energy efficiency which remained untapped, especially in the industry sector.
As in most countries, but not necessarily on the scale existing in China, uptake of financially
attractive energy efficiency investments was stymied by lack of information on these
opportunities, with attention of factory managers on perhaps more pressing priorities, and a lack
of mechanisms to develop and deliver the dispersed, often small projects. There was a general
lack of awareness of the potential profitability of many energy conservation investments, and
how these financial returns could be captured. As the Bank and government counterparts began
to discuss potential World Bank and GEF support for energy conservation, following completion
of the joint studies, both sides rejected traditional project models in favor of a more ambitious
agenda to develop new approaches to use forces of the market economy emerging in China
which could deliver investments for commercial profits of enterprises, but at the same time yield
environmental and energy security benefits to the country.

The project developed as a result aimed to introduce, demonstrate and disseminate new project
financing concepts and market-oriented institutions as a means to achieve large, sustained and
growing increases in energy efficiency. The project was a response to needs to balance strong
and successful work in the Bank program on energy supply improvements with demand-side
investment measures. With its aim to increase the supply of useful energy to industrial and
commercial users through environmentally benign increases in efficiency, the project supported
the objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China, dated 1997, to alleviate
infrastructure constraints and safeguard the environment. The project was fully consistent with
Operational Program Number 5 of the GEF Operational Strategy for mitigating growth in
greenhouse gases contributing to climate change. That Program centers on implementation of
measures to remove barriers to cost-effective, "win-win" energy efficiency investment.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the project was to achieve large, sustained and growing increases in energy
efficiency and associated reductions in growth of carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants
by: (a) introducing, demonstrating and disseminating new project financing concepts and market-
oriented institutions to promote and implement energy efficiency measures in China; and (b)
developing a more efficient national energy conservation information dissemination program.

Key performance indicators were the energy savings achieved per year from project investments
and associated reductions in the growth of carbon dioxide emissions. (The detailed indicators
are shown in the Data Sheet). For the core component of the project on development of new
Energy Management Companies (EMCs), key performance indicators were defined particularly
narrowly to include only the direct energy savings achieved prior to the project closing date
resulting from investments by the three demonstration companies who were direct beneficiaries
of the project. However, data on the energy savings achieved from the broad development of
EMCs in China stemming from the project also was collected and reported.

1.3     Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
Same as project development objectives.

The original global environmental objectives and key indicators were the same as those of the
IBRD-financed project.

1.4     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

The PDOs remained the same throughout the project. The year-by-year energy savings and
carbon emissions reduction were revised at the first project mid-term review in 2000 to reflect
the one year delay in project start-up. Final arrangements for company counter-guarantees and
establishment of project disbursement systems caused this delay. The original indicators set
forth in the PAD Annex 1 for calendar years were re-calibrated according to `project
implementation years', with the first year beginning at project effectiveness.

The levels of key performance indicators for the EMC Component for energy and carbon savings
were then revised downwards at the second mid-term review for the remainder of the project.
The original targets for the three demonstration companies were based on the investment plans
prepared by each company for these untried businesses at project appraisal. These investment
plans proved overly enthusiastic, with annual growth rates in investment of 32%, 35% and 47%
over the full nine-year period. The project team was aware that these plans were most likely far
too optimistic, but consciously decided to accept them at project appraisal as stretch-targets
prepared by the beneficiaries, especially as there was no experience in these types of businesses
in China before the project. As the company development patterns emerged, the targets were
then reduced substantially, as shown in the Data Sheet. As described later, the overall project
objectives were still fully achieved.




                                                2

1.5     Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

Same as the above section (1.4).

1.6     Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD and as
captured in the PDO/GEO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected to
benefit from the project)

The primary target group remained the same through project implementation as at appraisal.
Direct beneficiaries from the project included the three new EMCs especially established for the
project and the National Reform and Development Commission's Energy Conservation
Information Dissemination Center (NECIDC), also established under the project. As hoped at
appraisal, many Chinese enterprises benefited from adoption of energy efficiency measures
developed and financed by the three EMCs through energy performance contracts (EPCs), or
promoted by NECIDC. A far greater number of energy consumers, however, are realizing
energy savings and environmental benefits from the broad overall influence the project, through
further development of the EPC concept by a growing number of new EMCs and through
continuing dissemination of information on profitable energy efficiency investments. Benefits
include health benefits in the general population from reductions in local air pollutants,
especially fine particulates, as well as the benefits of less acid deposition due to reductions in
sulfur dioxide emissions.

1.7     Original Components (as approved)

The project components included the following:

    (a) EMC Demonstration Component. Three newly established demonstration EMCs were
        asked to develop energy performance contracting as a business mechanism, adapting
        principles developed by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in other countries, for the
        first time in China. Under the full-service energy performance contracting business
        model, EMCs design, develop, finance, implement and supervise initial operations of
        energy efficiency investments in other, "host enterprises." The EMCs are compensated
        for this with a share of the energy savings achieved from the investment, according to an
        energy performance contract executed between the two parties. Once the EMC has been
        fully compensated, the assets from the investment are retained by the host enterprise,
        which continues to reap the full benefits through the remaining life of the assets.

        The three demonstration EMCs were specially formed for the project by Chinese
        shareholders. The companies were developed to adapt energy performance contracting to
        the Chinese market, pilot a variety of investments using this mechanism, and expand as
        commercial businesses.

    (b) Information Dissemination Component. This part of the project was designed to support
        the development of a new system to provide practical information on energy conservation



                                                 3

       project results to Chinese enterprise managers. New information products were to be
       developed with particular emphasis on financial results actually achieved by enterprises,
       problems and solutions occurred during implementation, and any impacts on the
       enterprise's main production or other key risks. Dissemination work was to focus on
       influencing enterprise decision makers. The component aimed to achieve increased
       uptake of profitable investments by enterprises which received the Center's new
       information products.

    (c) Program Management and Monitoring Component. A Project Management Office
       (PMO) was created under the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) to support
       project implementation. The component supported the activities of two units in the
       PMO: the EMC Development Unit and the Project Management Unit. The EMC unit
       was to promote and assist the creation of new EMCs in China by any interested domestic
       or international parties. The Project Management Unit was to provide operational
       support and technical assistance for the implementation of the two other project
       components, provide policy advice to the government, and implement a series of training
       activities for staff and experts nominated by the PMO.

1.8    Revised Components

The components remained the same throughout the project.

1.9     Other Significant Changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

In 2003, the leading government counterpart for the project, the State Economic and Trade
Commission, was abolished, and relevant departments were merged into a new agency, the
National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). As a consequence, continued
operation of the project beneficiary for the information dissemination component, under the
original SETC, had to be reconfirmed under the new NDRC, and reconstituted.                 New
arrangements also had to be made for counterpart financing, especially to cover staff costs. This
process took over two years to fully complete. As a result, there was a big gap in the
implementation of information dissemination component. Management and staffing were
completely changed. The GEF Grant was extended for one year to allow for implementation of
this component to be completed and to help ground the NECIDC in its new institutional setting.

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

The basic design of the project stood up well to meet the challenges of implementation.
Essentially, this was an institutional development project, bringing major upfront risks. The
project aimed to incubate a new business model and investment delivery mechanism in the



                                                4

Chinese market which had not been tried before. Indeed, the concept of seeking profit in energy
efficiency projects was new to many---in the previous era, energy efficiency tended to be viewed
more as a social responsibility. The project's beneficiaries were all new organizations, created
under this project. The EPC business concept, developed in very different economic and legal
frameworks in North America and Europe, had to be adapted to the Chinese economic, financial
and legal setting, which itself was undergoing rapid change. New companies had to be
registered, chartered to pilot the new concept, with shareholders willing to invest upfront capital
in an untried proposition, and forward-looking and creative management. A new, national-level
institution needed to be created from the ground up, with a new charter, full set of new
government approvals, and new staff, to implement a new type of information development and
dissemination program.       Meeting these challenges required big upfront investments in
collaborative discussion, hands-on adaptation of ideas, new organization building, means to test
and pilot concepts, an ability to roll out implementation gradually, and needs for flexibility to
make continual adjustments.

Other project efforts of the Bank and other institutions to introduce ESCOs and EPC business in
other developing countries had met with some success, but many reviewed by the Bank and
Chinese team during project preparation had fallen short of success on the ground. Most past
Bank-financed energy conservation projects reviewed had focused on appraisal and financing of
a predetermined set of specific industry energy conservation investments. Previous projects
aiming to introduce ESCO concepts often focused on training alone, without the means in place
to follow through with investments. Training at times also focused almost exclusively on
introduction of North American and European EPC concepts, without mechanisms to then adapt
and transform these into concepts which might work in entirely different settings.

The designed sequencing of implementation activities and their financing worked well. A $4.5
million grant by the European Commission became effective in July 1997, and provided truly
critical support to both the groups forming the three new EMCs and the group establishing the
new information dissemination center. The grant funded major technical assistance efforts on
the energy performance contracting model, allowing practitioners from other countries to work
directly with the emerging EMCs to identify and develop subprojects, adapt contracts models
from overseas, and develop financial management systems. The grant also financed about $ 3
million in small pilot EPC projects, implemented primarily during 1998, allowing the EMCs to
gain critically needed experience trying out the new concepts in the Chinese market before the
main project commenced. This turned out to be especially important when the process of
executing various subsidiary agreements and setting up disbursement accounts and procedures
between the various government entities and EMCs took longer than expected, delaying
disbursement of GEF and IBRD funds until 1999 and 2000, respectively.

The GEF financing provided a critical source of risk coverage to the EMC shareholders to start
up untried businesses, without which it is highly doubtful that the companies could have been
formed or the IBRD loan to the companies approved. GEF funds were used to partially finance
pilot projects, especially projects in new subsectors or with new variations in contractual design.
The IBRD loan provided a source of dedicated financing for scaling up and company growth.
Finally, a Phase Two was conceived from the beginning as part of the program package, to
provide for scaling up the adaptation of the EPC business in China, if successful, to other



                                                 5

companies and on a larger scale. The project included funds for preparation of the second phase,
which were utilized to prepare the China Second Energy Conservation Project, approved in
October 2002.

The three EMCs themselves conducted all subproject identification, design, and negotiation of
mutually beneficial implementation arrangements with host enterprises during project
preparation, through piloting and scale up. However, the Bank and Government-supported
Chinese experts provided intensive, hands-on assistance during project preparation and
especially the early years of implementation, with all parties learning and adapting together.
Cross-exchange between the three companies was especially productive.

A Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA) was conducted for the IBRD loan. The overall
assessment of quality was rated satisfactory. See section 5.1 for detailed discussion.

2.2    Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and
actions taken, as applicable)

The process of adapting the EPC model to the Chinese market through the new EMCs required
intensive effort, especially by the EMCs themselves, but also by the PMO, government entities at
both provincial and central levels, and by the Bank team. Project legal documents required that
the Bank provide its no objection to all EMC subprojects unless or until waived by the Bank for
certain categories of projects. This arrangement proved productive. Initially, subproject
proposals were reviewed intensively by the Bank and PMO, and themes, problems, and various
specific cases discussed at length during project supervision missions. Over time, approval
requirements for various types of projects (`project lines') were waived, by product line and by
EMC, as the EMCs gained experience. Eventually, Bank approval requirements for all EMC
subprojects under $ 1 million were waived.

Procurement arrangements agreed at project appraisal proved cumbersome and inappropriate for
the EPC business, which required quick subproject closure and implementation. Adjustments
during implementation made procurement systems functional, but still far from perfect (see
Section 2.4).

Two mid-term reviews were undertaken, both of which proved productive. The November 2000
mid-term review instituted a system designed by the PMO and Bank teams to tie GEF EMC
subproject approvals to progress in implementation of subprojects using financing at more
commercial terms through the IBRD loan, to ensure leverage of the GEF financing as planned.
As subproject implementation had begun to pick up in the later part of 1999 and first half of
2000, a series of questions were also being raised, especially at local levels, as to how the EPC
business model was to be viewed by regulators, auditors and taxation authorities. Some parties
even questioned the legality of the EPC concept. Following review of these issues, the central
government confirmed the legality of the business, and assisted the EMCs to begin to work
through their choices of corporate accounting stances, to gain acceptance from the auditing and
taxation communities.




                                                6

During the November 2002 mid-term review the business plans of each EMC for the future were
thoroughly reviewed, based on the substantial experience which had then been gained.
Performance indicators were then formally revised accordingly.

During the second mid-term review, implementation of the first three years of the five-year
information dissemination component was rated as highly satisfactory. The new Information
Dissemination Center had put in place a very effective system for developing short case studies
of financially attractive projects, for producing more lengthy technical guides on promising areas
for energy efficiency investment and for disseminating these new information products through
SETC's electronic systems, using various dissemination meetings, direct mailings, and media.
Progress on the Center's 2003 work program, however, suffered setbacks from first the SARs
epidemic, halting domestic travel, and then from the Government's reorganization (see section
1.9). The final year of the five-year program, originally planned as 2004, was put in abeyance,
pending resolution of issues surrounding the establishment of the Center under NDRC and
securing counterpart financing, especially for staff costs. The final year of the program was
delayed until July 2006-June 2007, when the previous basic system for case study and technical
guide development and dissemination was re-energized.

During 2000 and 2001 a handful of additional companies began to pick up the EMC business
concept, especially from the concept dissemination work of the PMO, and even more expressed
interest in learning. With grants eventually totaling over $2.5 million, the United Kingdom's
Department for International Development (DFID) supported, through the Bank's Asia
Sustainable and Alternative Energy Program (ASTAE), a comprehensive program of training
and technical assistance for new, emerging EMCs, further buttressing the PMO's efforts. The
highly successful ASTAE-DFID program spanned 2001-2005, laying the foundation for
implementation of the longer-term Second China Energy Conservation Project.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The design for monitoring and evaluation was simple, yet it captured the fundamental, critical
aspects of the project objective. The key performance indicators were actual energy savings and
carbon dioxide emissions reductions achieved through the project, targeted and then reported
each year. Monitoring and evaluation reporting systems were fully implemented by the project
as designed.

Monitoring and evaluation of energy savings and associated carbon dioxide emissions reductions
achieved by the three EMCs were based on the actual energy savings data of all of the
subprojects invested in by the EMCs during the project period. This data came directly from the
feasibility studies and EPCs of the subprojects, for which the energy savings achieved was a key
determinant of the remuneration of the EMCs by the host enterprises. Data from subproject
investments, together with corporate financial reports and business plans for the immediate
future, were reported by each EMC biannually during project supervision, reviewed by the PMO,
and compiled by the PMO into project performance statistics.

The PMO's monitoring and evaluation of performance results were completed in a very
satisfactory manner, developing a valuable database of EMC investment and energy savings



                                                  7

information. At the end of the project, the PMO organized the careful preparation a 900-page
volume, "Case Studies of Energy Conservation Projects by Chinese ESCOs", published in 2006.
The volume includes hard data on 357 case studies implemented according to the EPC
mechanism, reviewed, confirmed and evaluated by outside experts. The PMO also prepared
many other monitoring reports and evaluations (see details in Annex 2). This information has
been very helpful to others eager to learn about the business model, and also has helped to
further enhance and renew the Government's commitment to the development of the EMC
industry in China.

Breaking from conventional approaches which focus only on information products produced,
numbers of participants in events, quantities of mailings, website hits, etc., monitoring and
evaluation of the information dissemination component included major efforts by third parties to
assess the actual energy efficiency investment results achieved through SECIDC/NECIDC's
information programs. Methodologies combined concepts for information program performance
monitoring used in the United Kingdom with practices used in surveys by China's national
statistical system. Three evaluation surveys were completed--the first two to provide inputs for
the project's mid-term reviews, and the third as a final survey. The energy savings results of this
project component were then calculated by the third parties based on these surveys. This
approach provided objective data on the benefits of the information program, which proved
useful in obtaining continued government support. At least as important, the detailed surveys
also provided important market feedback as to which information products and especially which
dissemination methods were providing the best results. After the first survey, in particular,
SECIDC made adjustments in its allocation of time and resources among different dissemination
methods.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

The project complied with the Bank's safeguard and fiduciary guidelines.

Procurement. The procurement arrangements agreed at project appraisal proved insufficiently
flexible in some respects during project implementation. While it was recognized at appraisal
that the EMCs were basically acting as financial intermediaries, the procurement arrangements
agreed still incorporated a mixture of approaches. ICB and NCB procurement were expected to
be used for over one-third of the goods procurement. This expectation proved unrealistic, as
subprojects were small and the EMCs needed to move on the timetables of each subproject
independently to meet the needs of their clients expeditiously. Very few business lines attracted
any interest from foreign suppliers, as most projects involved customized retrofitting of existing
equipment. No contracts emerged where international competitive bidding (ICB) was considered
advantageous. While the project team promoted the use of NCB aggressively, only a few
contracts were procured by the EMCs using NCB procedures. No contracts were executed using
Bank financing that exceeded the $2 million international shopping threshold, as the business of
the EMCs focused on smaller projects. The EMCs universally judged the simpler request for
quotation and comparison of up to three suppliers as the most suitable procurement method for
their businesses. The EMCs found, however, that quotations from foreign suppliers could not be
obtained for many types of standard equipment commonly produced in China. It was then



                                                 8

agreed that the EMCs should advertise for expressions of interest in the UN Development
Business journal if they were not able to obtain quotations from international suppliers, and
request quotations from any firms expressing interest to these advertisements. This procedure
was followed strictly by the EMCs, but rarely resulted in expressions of interest from outside of
China. In the end, contracts with foreign suppliers were executed for some projects, but
primarily in niche technology areas, such as heat pumps and chillers.

The three EMCs proved conscientious in seeking the best value contracts in their procurement,
as their revenues from EPCs depended upon equipment performance after installation, and they
had strong commercial interests in minimizing cost. With hindsight, reliance upon prevailing
Chinese commercial practices acceptable to the Bank for procurement up to the threshold of $2
million would have been a more appropriate approach.

Social and Environment Aspects. At appraisal no major social or resettlement issues were
expected from the implementation of the energy efficiency retrofitting subprojects. Mechanisms
agreed at project appraisal to ensure that subprojects followed country-system procedures were
implemented satisfactorily.     The EMCs reported that none of their investment projects
encountered social, land use or resettlement issues. EMC host enterprises were required under
Chinese regulations to obtain approval from local Environmental Protection Bureaus for any
major renovation projects or deployment of new technology with potential negative
environmental impacts, and the approval process required identification of impacts and
appropriate mitigation, if relevant. Bank team had reviewed relevant documentation at random,
and satisfactory documentation was provided in all cases.

Financial Management Aspects. The standard financial management procedures used for this
project were implemented satisfactorily.       Audit reports for each of the three EMCs,
SECIDC/NECIDC, and the PMO were submitted satisfactorily and without major delays. The
2002 and 2003 audit reports for SECIDC were qualified by the auditor, due to lack of certain
documentation needed to substantiate financial reports, and financial management aspects were
temporarily rated as unsatisfactory as a result until the matter was fully resolved to the
satisfaction of all parties.

2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

The project proved very successful in achieving its aim to introduce new concepts (especially the
EPC business model) and develop new institutions, providing a platform for long-term
sustainable scale up and increasing energy savings.

The three pilot EMCs have developed from the ground up to become strong, growing companies.
They have increased their assets by about nine-fold, on average, over the life of the project,
through operation of the EPC business. Beijing EMC's assets have grown from US$2.7 million
to $26.4 million, while Liaoning EMC's assets have grown from $3.6 million to $36.0 million
and Shandong's from $4.8 million to $31.8 million. EMC investment levels in projects



                                                9

increased every year over the decade of project implementation, with investments in EPC
projects reaching about $30 million in 2006, the final project year. Positive net profit ratios were
realized during each of the last six years. At project closing, each of the EMCs reported their
plans to continue EPC investments well into the future, as key parts of their mainstay energy
efficiency investment businesses. The companies have developed relationships within the
financial community to assist in providing further capital for growth.

As the EMCs matured, they each developed their own distinct characteristics, with different
market concentrations and comparative advantages. Liaoning EMC has developed an alliance
with a number of smaller EMC companies and formed a variety of business partnerships within
China and abroad, both with financing companies and with a variety of technical groups. The
overall Liaoning EMC (Liaoning Nengfa) group now also produces certain energy efficiency
products itself, and maintains especially strong technical design service capacity. Beijing EMC
has decided to retain its main focus for now within Beijing Municipality, and has developed
business platforms specially catered to investment and performance-based asset operation for
energy efficiency gains in commercial buildings. In recent years, Shandong EMC has focused
primarily on medium and large-sized energy efficiency investments in industrial enterprises.
The company recently became one of the few corporations nationwide to obtain a license from
the central government to operate a financial leasing business, and is scaling up its operations to
fully utilize the increased leveraging and new business opportunities this provides.

The success of the three pilot EMCs generated interest in many other companies in China in the
possibility of developing EPC business. The China Second Energy Conservation Project, with
GEF financing of $ 26 million, was approved in 2002 with an objective to help realize this scale-
up potential, and aggressively develop China's nascent EMC industry. The second project
includes programs to help new EMCs to obtain local bank loans through a special loan guarantee
program, and to receive hand-on technical assistance in all aspects of company and business
development. This project adds further institution building, through the creation and operation
of China's new EMC Association (EMCA), which provides a platform for delivery of technical
assistance, mutual support and EMC industry advocacy, and through development and
strengthening of ties between EMCs and local financial institutions, with the help of the China
National Investment and Guaranty Co. (I&G). Grounded in the demonstrated success of the first
three companies, then, the full package of effort is now yielding major energy efficiency
investment and energy savings results (see section 3.2). As the EPC mechanism is catching on in
the market, EMCs are becoming important parts of many new energy efficiency project delivery
initiatives in China, including the IFC's China Utility-based End-Use Energy Efficiency Project
and the new energy efficiency financing programs of several Chinese banks supported under the
planned new IBRD China Energy Efficiency Financing Project (proposed for FY08).

The NECIDC remains a permanent institution, charged with the important work of disseminating
information on energy conservation nationwide, under the supervision of NDRC. NECIDC's
business plan for the future shows a combination of ambition to continue development of
information products pioneered under this project, and to develop new efforts.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The overall relevance of the objectives and implementation work of this project are even higher
than when the project was approved. China's 2006-2010 Five-Year Plan includes a national
target to reduce the energy intensity of the country's GDP by 20%. As industry continues to lead
robust economic growth in China, achievement of this target is a major and difficult task. The
Government has organized massive efforts to promote energy efficiency in all sectors and all
regions, with determination to see the target achieved. Local governments and enterprises are
being held strictly accountable for achieving energy efficiency results. Expanded use of the new
EPC mechanism is explicitly highlighted as one of the measures to be supported (see Annex 6).
Demand for EMC services to identify, prepare, design, implement and often finance new energy
efficiency investments is high.

The project objectives are consistent with the current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, 2006-
2010). The third pillar outlined in the CPS is managing resource scarcity and environmental
challenges. China is to build a resource-efficient society and promote more efficient water and
energy supply systems. China has also made commitments under international environmental
conventions on climate change, ozone-depleting substance, persistent organic pollutants,
biodiversity, and international seas.         Bank group activities are to help to mainstream
environmental concerns into the development process, create a resource-saving society through
better regulation, pricing and taxation of natural resource use, and meet China's commitments
under international environmental conventions

The project objectives are also fully consistent with the Focal Area Strategies and Strategic
Programming for GEF-4 dated October 2007. The GEF aims to promote energy-efficient
technologies and practices in the appliance and building sectors, as well as industrial production
and manufacturing processes.

3.2     Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives   (including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 4)

The project clearly met its development objective to achieve large, sustained and growing
increases in energy efficiency and associated reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other
pollutants by (a) introducing, demonstrating and disseminating the new EPC mechanism and (b)
developing a more efficient energy conservation information dissemination program.                     In
particular, the high-risk venture to attempt to adapt the EPC model to Chinese conditions has
paid off well. In the year 2006 alone, total EPC project investment in China reached $ 280
million, providing life-cycle energy savings and carbon dioxide emissions reductions of over 21
million tons of coal equivalent and 12 million tons carbon, respectively. In 2007, these figures
are expected to further increase sharply.




                                                    11

The three pilot EMCs were each successful in their efforts to design pilot projects, learn and
adjust during implementation, and eventually roll out profitable business models. By the end of
2006, the energy performance contracting investments of the three companies had reached a total
of $180.8 million, invested in 514 projects. (See details in Annex 2.)

Excluding the energy savings which will be achieved after the project implementation period,
over the life of the energy savings assets created, total energy savings from these investments
amounted to 5.92 million tce by the end of 2006 (versus the target of 5.22 million tce set forth in
2002).2 Associated carbon dioxide emissions reductions already achieved amounted to 5.06
million t-c (versus the target of 3.77 million t-c set forth in 2002). Tables 1 and 2 provide these
details.

The idea to work intensively with the three specially created companies to test and demonstrate
the EPC model in China, and then try to replicate that later, worked well. The EPC business
model was adapted through `learning by doing' over a period of 3-4 years before workable
business models began to solidify, and could strongly expand. The existence of a dedicated
source of project finance was critical--allowing the EMCs to focus on marketing, technical
aspects, contract design, methods of risk mitigation, and means to bring transaction costs under
control, without having at the same time to also convince skeptical financiers to invest in the
untried new business model. As focus then began to turn to how to foster further development of
the EPC concept among other companies, the working and profitable demonstration examples of



2   Performance monitoring indicators were defined this way for the first Energy Conservation Project. In the
    Second Energy Conservation Project, however, performance indicators were defined to include the total life-
    cycle energy savings and carbon dioxide emission reductions for the energy savings capacity created, including
    benefits arising after the project closed. That definition, then, is used for the calculations in Table 3.
    Investments in energy savings and CO2reductions are calculated for the entire year of 2006 although the project
    was closed in June 2006. While all investments were contracted and completed disbursements continued into
    the second half of 2006.

the three EMCs proved invaluable. Almost invariably, the first question raised by potential new
investors was if they EPC concept had been shown to work under Chinese conditions. The three
EMCs devoted time and energy to explain their work and results to many others, becoming
natural leaders within the emerging new industry. They have played leadership role in training
courses, dissemination events, and in the establishment and operation of the new EMC
Association.

With the further efforts of the Government, the PMO, EMCA, I&G and scores of new companies
and financiers, supported under the China Second Energy Conservation project, more than 60
companies were implementing energy performance contracting project in 2006. Based on a
comprehensive survey undertaken by EMCA and the PMO, investments from EPC projects
totaled about $249 million in 2005. Estimates for 2006 show a total of about $ 280 million, of
which the three demonstration EMCs accounted only about 11%, even though they reached their
highest combined investment level ever (see Table 3). A variety of business model variations
have been successfully introduced, in addition to the "full-service" EPC model pioneered by the
pilot EMCs, including contracts in which the EMCs guarantee energy savings but host
enterprises are responsible for obtaining the primary financing themselves.

While the success so far of the scale-up effort stems in large part from the second project, the
successful demonstration of the first three pilot EMCs under the first project was a pre-requisite,
without which the second project would not have been possible.

The project achieved satisfactory results in developing a more efficient national energy
conservation information dissemination program. Prior to the reorganization of the previous
SECIDC to become NECIDC, the information dissemination component was rated highly
satisfactory by the Bank team. Outputs from the first four years of project implementation,
especially in terms of operation of the Center and its impact in China's energy efficiency market,


                                                    13

were impressive. SECIDC developed an effective platform for delivery of information on
energy efficiency investment opportunities which were attractive under market conditions (see
details in Annex 2). After the reorganization was finalized, NECIDC was able to continue the
work. By the time the GEF part of the project closed in June 2007, the information
dissemination center had prepared and disseminated 100 energy conservation investment project
case studies in areas of highly replicable technology, and produced 20 energy conservation
technical guides.     The case studies were produced by selecting from successful energy
conservation projects implemented nationwide which had demonstrated not only solid technical
results but also financially attractive returns. The Center's system for careful selection, study by
third parties, review and confirmation by a panel of experts, and then dissemination through a
variety of channels proved effective in generating new investment, based on the monitoring and
evaluation surveys completed. The technical guides were compiled by industry experts and have
been used by a wide audience, including research and training staff, statisticians and monitoring
personnel, as well as the main enterprise clients. Additional activities carried out by NECIDC
are described in Annex 2.

The last of the three independent evaluation surveys carried out at the end of the project showed
that from 1999 to 2006, energy conservation investments estimated to have resulted from the
disseminated new energy conservation information reached more than 130 times the cost of the
inputs for the program. Energy savings resulting from the investments realized were estimated at
about 26 million tons of coal equivalent over the entire period, with carbon dioxide emissions
reduction of some 68 million tons.

3.3     Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Economic returns.      The economic returns of this project were exceptionally high, as was
forecast at appraisal. The economic internal rate of return of the subprojects to be supported by
the IBRD loan were estimated in the original PAD to average about 47 percent, with a range of
30-90%. This was based on the planned product lines of the three EMCs at that time. The
returns include the full life-cycle benefits of the investments, most of which accrue to the hosts
of the EMCs after the standard 2-3 year energy performance contracts have been completed, and
the EMCs have been repaid for their investment. The actual average economic rate of return of
the subprojects of the EMCs was 78%, based on the detailed analysis of 357 subprojects
completed by the PMO. Returns of different product lines ranged from 36% to 168% (see
Annex 3). While the EMCs obtained only a fraction of the returns, and most host enterprises in
effect heavily discount future operating costs savings, this shows both the inherent total
profitability of the investments (shared by different parties) and the high return to the country
and global environment of these types of investments.
Financial Performance. Audited consolidated financial results for the three EMCs combined
over the period 1997-2005 and estimates for 2006 are set out in detail in Annex 3. The three
EMCs grew strongly from low base points at the beginning of the project, although not as
sharply as in the original, overly optimistic business plans of each company. Combined, assets
grew from about RMB 86 million in 1997 to an estimated RMB 757 million by the end of 2006.
The companies started slowly, and faced a sharp learning curve, with negative retained earnings



                                                 14

during the first six years. The EMCs then succeeded in increasing profits annually thereafter.
Over the ten year period since the companies were formed in 1996, turn-over increased at an
average of 37% per year, leading to a growth in net worth averaging around 5 percent per year.
All three EMCs have met the agreed financial performance covenants consistently. The financial
internal rate of return on investment, net of GEF and EC grants received, is estimated to be 17.6
percent in real terms.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDO/GEOs, and efficiency)

Rating:     Satisfactory.

The project was exceptionally successful in meeting its broad goals of introducing, adapting and
laying a foundation for scaling up the new energy performance contracting mechanism for
energy efficiency investment. This has proved especially important with China's current
aggressive national agenda to further increase energy efficiency. Assessed in a somewhat
narrower sense, however, considering specific operational results of the three EMCs and
SECIDC/NECIDC, the overall outcome of the project is rated conservatively as "fully
satisfactory." The project design proved effective, and the project met its development
objectives. The three EMCs clearly fulfilled their roles as effective demonstration companies for
the new business model, and overfulfilled the performance indicators officially revised during
the second mid-term review. SECIDC and NECIDC successfully completed the full program of
work assigned under the information dissemination component, fully meeting expectations and
hoped-for energy savings results.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not have direct goals for poverty reduction, gender aspects or social development.
However, the general population gained from the energy savings and pollution reduction benefits
of the project. These benefits certainly resulted in some health benefits from air pollution
reduction, although these benefits were not specifically studied or quantified.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

As described in sections 2.1, 2.5 and 3.2, this project was basically an institutional development
project. It achieved major successes in the adaptation of a new energy efficiency investment
business model to China, and the development and dissemination of new information
dissemination products emphasizing the attractiveness of specific energy efficiency investments.
The four new organizations created under the project to anchor these institutional innovations all
became successfully established, and are virtually certain to continue operations over the long
term. The three companies have grown into major enterprises, with sophisticated management,
financinal risk assessment, technical and marketing capacity to further pursue successful energy
efficiency investment business. NECIDC also is expected to continue its role as a key institution


                                                15

for energy conservation information dissemination nationwide, the importance of which is
emphasized in China's new Energy Conservation Law, passed in November 2007.
.
(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Chinese EMC experience has also attracted interest to others outside of China. A very active
cross-country exchange between energy performance contracting practitioners in China, India
and Brazil was undertaken with United Nations Foundation support during 2001-2006. The
practical experience and rapid growth of China's EMC industry, led by the three demonstration
companies, was one of the main areas of particular interest among foreign companies and
financiers--particularly China's adaptation of the original North American concepts in a rapidly
growing emerging market economy with different legal traditions and customs. Chinese EMC
representatives also have been increasingly active in other international arena, and Chinese
EMCs have received delegations from a variety of other developing countries, interested to learn
about their operations and to exchange experiences.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

A large conference was held in Beijing in November 2006 to discuss and share experiences
gained from implementing this project. Officials from the central government and implementing
agencies participated and spoke at the meeting. Many speakers stated that this project was very
successful in introducing a new mechanism in achieving energy efficiency. The impact of this
project over the sector was judged profound, with a significant number of EMCs now flourishing
and a variety of forms of energy efficiency investment methods emerging. Attention was also
given to discussion of the many issues which still face the industry as it seeks financing and aims
to further expand. Continuing needs for government policy support and further efforts to make
financing more available to new companies were emphasized. (See Annex 5.)

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Rating:

       Rating for Risk to Development Outcome: Negligible to Low
       Rating for Risk to GEO Outcome:       Negligible to Low

Section 2.5 and 3.1 indicate reasons to be fully confident that the project development and GEO
outcomes will be sustained. The Second Energy Conservation Project is providing a platform for
scaling up application of the EPC business model demonstrated through this project, and
additional IFC and Bank projects also are involving the new EMC industry. The Government's
commitment to energy conservation has increased greatly over the last several years, as it
mobilizes to achieve its target of reducing energy consumption per unit GDP by 20% during the
period of 11th Five-year Plan. China's Medium and Long Term Energy Conservation Plan states
that energy performance contracting should be further spread and the State Council's 2007
decision on intensifying energy conservation work specifically pointed out that the work on




                                                16

advancing EPC should speed up, to facilitate energy conservation technology renovations in
enterprises.

5.       Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1      Bank Performance

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating:        Satisfactory

The Bank team worked in full partnership with the Government, stakeholders and beneficiaries.
Project preparation was based on both previous sector work on energy conservation in China and
extensive study of energy conservation investment mechanisms in other countries. Experiences
and lessons learned from EC pilot projects in China were fully taken into account in the final
project design. The project development objectives were consistent with the country's and the
Bank's strategic priorities during project approval and at the time of this evaluation. Despite
hurdles at the beginning of project implementation, the project design and implementation
arrangements proved to be good choices. Fiduciary and safeguard arrangements followed
Bank's guidelines. Monitoring and evaluation were spelled out in a systematic approach. With
hindsight, however, the business plans of the EMCs confirmed at appraisal proved overly
optimistic.

A Quality at Entry Assessment was conducted for the part of the project financed by the IBRD
loan. The overall assessment of quality was rated satisfactory. The appropriateness of project
approach and Borrower ownership were given highly satisfactory ratings. The assessment
particularly noted that important lessons were incorporated in the project design. It noted,
however, that there was no analysis of, and linkage to, energy prices, although all contracts
include clauses for adjusting repayment due to increases/decreases in energy prices.

(b)      Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating:     Satisfactory

The Bank team effectively conducted regular supervision missions. The two mid-term reviews
carried out for the project proved to be useful as the project introduced new concepts to China
and needed to adapt to the country's systems. The reviews were appropriately scheduled for the
second and fourth years of project implementation. The two mid-term reviews, along with the
two annual supervision missions, provided opportunities for resolving various problems at the
appropriate stages of project execution. The timely Bank visits were considered valuable by the
EMCs.

The task team leader and team's principal financial specialist remained the same throughout the
project period, enabling consistency and continuity in the dialogue with counterparts. The team
provided the necessary comments on various feasibility studies, contracts, procurement
documents, and project verification documents. The team and PMO worked proactively to try
identify problems early on and resolve them. Marketing strategies and sound corporate financial
management were common themes in the Bank team's discussions with the EMCs. The EMCs
responded to steady encouragement to improve risk analysis and develop formal credit control
procedures. The Bank reviewed virtually all project proposal provided by the EMCs until the
EMCs gained experience and business models stabilized, after which the Bank gradually
released the review requirements. As project implementation proceeded, then, the Bank team
and PMO concentrated increasingly on the project's strategic directions and outcomes.

Project implementation work of SECIDC/NECIDC also was reviewed during every supervision
mission. Focus was devoted initially to the establishment of the new institutional platform,
design of new products, and definition of optimal dissemination channels. The Bank team
worked closely with both SECIDC and the consultants they engaged at start up. As time evolved,
supervision work placed increasing attention on monitoring and evaluation of results, and efforts
to adjust the program accordingly.

Post reviews were conducted for all procurement in the project and found that the Bank's
procurement guidelines were followed. The Bank team selected randomly and reviewed the
documentation related to environmental impacts, and in all cases, suitable documentations were
provided and there were no major problems recorded.

(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating:     Satisfactory

The research and consultations during project preparation yielded a sound project design.
Together with the Government and company counterparts, the Bank team focused on developing
an EPC model suitable for Chinese circumstances. The close collaboration with the Government
was critical to the successful implementation of the project. The Bank team was proactive in
working with the project to overcome implementation hurdles. Focus was place on strategic
directions and performance targets, as well as the business development of the EMCs.

Rating:     Satisfactory

The Government's commitment to the project's objectives was a key factor for success. The
basic project design was developed jointly by the Bank and several key working-level
Government counterparts. Workshops and conferences were held to discuss ideas with a wide
range of stakeholders and beneficiaries. Provincial governments, represented especially by their
economic and trade commissions, showed strong support. Government approval of SECIDC as

a new institution was completed on time and at a high level, which required a major effort by the
Bank's counterparts.

After the project was approved, initial difficulties in arranging counter guarantees for the Bank
loan and setting up disbursement systems caused delay. Central and provincial governments
collaborated with the project beneficiary companies to resolve the issues. Relevant government
agencies were instrumental in organizing a study on tax treatment of the EMCs and reaching
agreements with the provincial tax bureaus.                  Throughout project implementation, the
Government issued new policies, regulations or instructions which emphasized the importance of
energy conservation. The Government also worked closely together with the Bank in the
preparation of the Second Energy Conservation Project.

The performance of the three EMCs was exemplary. The EMCs were partners in the preparation
of the project, assessing the needs and demands of enterprises, and working with the Bank team
and foreign consultants to try to adapt the new EPC mechanism to meet these needs and
demands.

EMCs were proactive and creative in removing implementation barriers, without which the
project could not have been successful, and project objectives would not have been achieved.
Management teams in each of the EMCs were basically stable throughout the project. The
EMCs worked hard to resolve initial issues surrounding the legal characteristics of EPC contracts,
questions raised by domestic auditors on how to classify these businesses, their accounting
stances and tax treatment. They were equally savvy in creating new business opportunities by
forming alliances, extending opportunities outside of their normal territories, and forming
partnerships with relevant financial and commercial entities. They developed a number of
diversified business lines, and ensured that the targets for energy savings and carbon dioxide
reductions were achieved each year. The EMCs also provided leadership and direction to other
newly emerging EMCs, exceeding expectation as the pioneers and initial role models for the
industry. All EMCs followed the Bank's procurement guidelines, and ensured compliance with
project agreements. Progress and financial reports were produced on time and of good quality.

The Energy Conservation Information Dissemination Center achieved highly satisfactory results
prior to its reorganization in 2003. Its reorganization delayed completion of implementation.
However, with the extension of one additional year for the GEF part of the project, NECIDC was
able to continue and expand the information dissemination work, completing the final batch of
the total of 100 case studies and 20 technical guides. NECIDC also published many articles in

various professional magazines, held exhibits, maintained and expanded their website and
database.

The PMO under the NDRC was capable in managing and monitoring project activities. Along
with the EMCs, it also monitored and reported on the key performance indicators. (See details in
Annex 2.)

Government played a key role in the successful implementation of the project. Implementing
agencies' performance was exceptional and they achieved the agreed development targets.

6.      Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Consistent central government support was critical for the success of the project. Without this
steady support, the project would have likely floundered when faced with the many regulatory
and `system adaptation' issues that arose during the first 4-5 years. Government support
provided necessary legitimacy to the emerging new businesses. Provincial government support
also was important.

The GEF grants were essential for both the creation of the first pilot EMCs and their ability to
accept loans on commercial terms, and the catalyzation of the establishment and initial operation
of SECIDC. Even with the GEF and EC grants, the equity financing of the first EMCs to pioneer
a totally new and untried business concept was a high risk proposition--without these incentives,
it is difficult to imagine the creation of these companies, and particularly willingness of the
Chinese shareholders to arrange the counter guarantees necessary for the IBRD loan. There also
is little question that without international support and financing to match government
commitments, the new SECIDC platform was unlikely to gain approval and traction.

For the EMC component, there was a joint, conscious decision to begin with pilot investment
projects before all system-related issues concerning operation of the business model were
resolved. The idea was to learn by doing, and to confront various issues practically, with actual
cases, as they arose. This proved a good choice. Issues involving accounting for the new
businesses, the legitimacy of the energy performance contracts, taxation, reporting of ownership
of off-site assets, marketing strategies, measures to best ensure enterprise repayment, etc., were
best understood and resolved with actual cases and emerging experience in hand.                 If
implementation awaited attempts to resolve all of these issues upfront abstractly it was unlikely
that the project could have gotten off the ground.

Flexibility and adaptability were crucial in the design of such a project that introduces new
concepts and practices.      Application of the basic EPC concepts evolved and changed
substantially through the piloting phases, with the end results becoming unique for application in
Chinese market conditions and in line with Chinese business conventions. With very little



                                                20

multilateral development bank experience in developing such an investment project to use as a
guide post, it also was important to have flexibility to make adjustments in the operation of the
project itself.

The inherent profitability of untapped small and medium-sized energy effiency investments has
proved a key underlying reason for the eventual success of the energy performance contracting
business in China, as in other countries. As a relatively complicated investment mechanism
requiring multiple skills to implement effectively, the potential of this mechanism to pick up
quite profitable investments which otherwise are often overlooked is what has attracted new
companies and investors with strong entrepreneurial spirit.

The staging of energy performance contracting through pilots, demonstrations, operations,
dissemination in this project, with a source of dedicated financing, and followed with a second
project to build the necessary bridges to local financiers, and foster development of many more
companies, proved practical. Energy performance contracting is a complicated business, and
experiences from other countries have also shown that it is often too difficult to tackle all of the
issues involved at the same time.

Objective - Three demonstration EMCs were asked to develop energy performance contracting,
as developed by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in other countries, for the first time in
China. They were to adapt, begin operation, and expand as commercial business under this core
component. As the EMCs developed and began to make profit, the number of energy
performance contracts was to increase, which would translate into energy savings and CO2
reduction.

The three EMCs have successfully developed and expanded their EPC business. They have
established partnerships with local financial institutions. Liaoning and Shandong EMCs have
also formed their own subsidiary companies. The EMCs have demonstrated that EPC is the
viable way to achieve energy savings and carbon dioxide reduction in China.

The revised target set in 2002 for energy savings was 5.22 million tce, and the project achieved a
total of 5.92 million tce by the end of June 2006, when the loan portion of the project was closed.
The revised target for carbon dioxide reductions was 3.77 million tce, and the project achieved a
total of 5.06 million t-c.

Beijing EMC adjusted its targeted market according to the special characteristics of the city and
its surrounding area. As industrial facilities started to relocate outside Beijing and the
environmental requirements for residential and commercial building became more stringent, the
EMC took a gradual turn from industrial energy conservation to building energy conservation. It
focused on projects for heat supply, air conditioning, and building renovation. Beijing EMC
chose to select the projects with greater potential for energy conservation, proven technology and
lower risks. It increased its investments steadily, at the same time raising the technical content


                                                  25

and the level of complexity of projects. Throughout the years of project implementation, Beijing
EMC has strengthened its risk management in fund payback and financing risk control.

Liaoning EMC established a technical network with various domestic institutes and universities
to support project development and design. It secured agreements with local banks to assist in
credit assessments of prospective customers and monitoring of the financial strength of host
enterprises. To improve marketing prospects, Liaoning EMC implemented technical training
courses and workshops on energy management for technical staff from energy intensive
customers. The company maintained the principle of leaving zero risk for its clients related to
financing and technology. It provided 7 in 1 service which includes energy diagnosis, subproject
designing, subproject financing, equipment supply, installation and debugging, operation and
maintenance, and personnel training. At the early stage of its operation, Liaoning EMC relied
upon technologies developed by others.         In 2000, it moved to acquire its own energy
conservation technologies and related products. In 2002, Liaoning EMC was consolidated into
the Liaoning Province Energy Conservation Technology Company Ltd., encompassing Liaoning
Energy Conservation Planning Institute and other research entities.          It also took over
manufacturing companies and added shareholders who enabled the EMC to evolve into an
energy conservation group with new products in the field of boilers, pumps, valves and meters.
The expanded company combined the services of technology research, manufacturing and
marketing. Its ability to provide technical advice was increased, reinforcing the 7 in 1 service
business model. Liaoning EMC achieved a 100% success rate over the past ten years on EPC
projects.

Shandong EMC charted its course of business to match the concentration of large industrial
enterprises in Shandong province.        The EMC focused on enterprises with high energy
consumption. It selected projects that were easy to carry out technically and worthwhile to
replicate. Shandong EMC aimed to cultivate "project hosts" and develop "client groups"
emphasizing the long term, effective, and collaborative relationships with individual clients or
client groups where mutual trust was established. Two small successful projects experienced by
the Shandong EMC encouraged the company to tighten its credit assessments of enterprises and
technical appraisal of proposed projects, developing a particularly effective set of risk-control
mechanisms.

Component 2.            Information Dissemination Component
(Approved: $10 total including contingency, $5 GEF financing, $5 Government financing);
(Actual: $10 total, $5 GEF financing, $5 Government financing).

Objective: This part of the project aimed to support the development of a new system to
provide practical information on energy conservation project results to Chinese enterprise
managers. New information products were to be developed with particular emphasis on financial
results actually achieved by enterprises, problems and solutions during implementation, any
impacts on main enterprise production or other key risks. Dissemination work aimed to
influencing enterprise decision makers. These activities would increase the adoption of key
energy efficiency measures due to improved access to high quality information on successful and
financially attractive energy efficiency experiences.

The project achieved satisfactory results in developing a more efficient national energy
conservation information dissemination program. SECIDC was established under the project in
1998. Prior to the transformation of the SECIDC to NECIDC, SECIDC developed an impressive
platform for delivery of information on energy efficiency investment opportunities which were
attractive under market conditions. This platform included a sophisticated website, an inquiry
service, an expanded series of professionally developed and presented case studies and technical
guides, a market-tested and sophisticated dissemination system involving many local contacts
and a system of dissemination meetings, a well-developed network of energy efficiency experts,
and a strong and expanding relationship with media organizations. Website visitors reached an
average of 600 persons per day, and 5000 case studies were downloaded from the website during
the first six months of 2002 alone. The enquiry desk handled over 10,000 requests and
dissemination through magazines, newspapers and television programs expanded rapidly.

After the reorganization was finalized, NECIDC was able continue the work of information
dissemination. By the time the GEF part of the project was closed in June 2007, the information
dissemination center had in total prepared and disseminated 100 energy conservation case studies
and 20 energy conservation technical guides. The case studies were produced based not only on
the projects that demonstrated its strong technical results, but also on the effectiveness and
achievement of strong economic and financial benefits. The case studies were based on third-
party verification reports. Technical guides were compiled by industry experts and were judged
useful for practitioners, research and teaching staff, statisticians and monitoring personnel.

The evaluation carried out by a third party agency at the end of the project showed that, from
1999 to 2006, energy savings and emission reductions gained by disseminating energy
conservation information is more than 130 times than that of input for dissemination of
information. Specifically, for the same period, energy savings resulting from adopting energy
conservation measures which were promoted through information dissemination reached 26.01
Mtce, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction reached 67.89 Mt.

Component 3.           Program Management and Monitoring Component
(Approved: $4 total including contingency, $2 GEF financing, $2 Government financing);
(Actual: $4 total, $2 GEF financing, $2 Government financing).

Objective. A Project Management Office (PMO) was set up under the State Economic and
Trade Commission (SETC) to help supervise the implementation of the whole project. The
component supported efforts to promote and assist the creation of new EMCs in China by any
interested domestic or international parties. The component also provided operational support
and technical assistance for the implementation of the two other project components, provided
policy advice to the government, and implemented a series of training activities for staff and
experts nominated by the PMO. This component was important for ensuring the achievement of
project outcomes and development objectives.

During implementation, the PMO was very effective in its monitoring and management of the
project. One of the impressive accomplishments carried out under this component was the 900
page "Energy Conservation Projects Case Studies of Chinese ESCO" published by the China
Economic Publishing House in 2006.             The selected 357 projects had these common
characteristics: they were all EPC projects; all projects were under operation; both EMCs and the


                                                 27

host enterprises had confirmed their energy savings and economic efficiencies; and the
technologies used in these projects were proven reliable and replicable to the greater public. The
following lists some of the additional major achievements accomplished under this component:

       Organized and initial study on the feasibility of EPC in China.
       Conducted training for project managers from the three EMCs on business development,
       project management and commercial practices.
       Organized study tours for EMC and government personnel to US, Canada, England,
       France, etc. and visited the ESCOs and government agencies in these countries.
       Recruited consultants to design a software package for EMC management, including
       routine financial management, project management, financial projections and analysis.
       Held conferences with financial institutions and EMCs to mobilize financial resources.
       These conferences were productive, and provide valuable experience for the
       implementation of the Phase II project.
       Recruited experts to study the exchange rate risk that was faced by the EMCs concerning
       the World Bank loan.
       Organized discussion among different government agencies which led to a decision on
       the legal status of the EMCs.
       Selected an expert team to study and develop a guideline for the use of motor drive
       system in energy savings projects, as this kind of system was fairly new to practitioners
       but has great potential.
       Organized workshops with equipment suppliers for energy savings and encouraged the
       suppliers to establish their own EMCs.
       Organized conferences on strategic directions for the three EMCs. The PMO also
       assisted the NDRC in organizing the working meetings with the EMCs to exchange
       experiences.
       Conducted post evaluation of investments made by the three EMCs, three years into
       project implementation. The PMO selected a sample of 17 projects and provided detailed
       analysis and suggestions.
       Contracted third parties to evaluate the appropriateness of the investments made by the
       three EMCs using GEF funds. A total of 67 projects were evaluated under this
       arrangement. These evaluations all posted favorable results. From 2000 to 2003, PMO
       also organized on-site inspections by expert teams for over 50 projects implemented by
       the three EMCs. The clients met by the expert teams expressed their satisfaction for the
       service offered under the energy performance contracts.
       Compiled a collection of trends in energy savings work in China.
       Published over 2000 copies of the mid-term progress report, out of which 500 copies
       were in English, and 5000 pamphlets on the Phase I Energy Conservation Project. The
       PMO also disseminated to the public of the experiences of the three EMC using the mass
       media.
       Organized the evaluation of the Phase I Energy Conservation Project prior to project
       closure and the preparation of a series of evaluation reports.

  1.       Economic Analysis

  The PAD stated that the potential economic benefits of the project were enormous. The
  economic internal rates of return of EMC investments ranged from 30-90%, with the overall
  EIRR of the project estimated as 47%. This was arrived based on the planned product lines
  which were expected during the project appraisal. The value of external benefits such as
  environmental benefits, were not included in this simple analysis. The actual overall EIRR
  calculated by the project for all of the investments made by the three EMCs over the 10 years
  prior to project close confirmed the very high EIRRs of the EMC's subprojects. EIRRs for each
  product line, such as in industrial boiler renovation and cogeneration, and steam thermal system
  renovation are shown in the following tables, based on the cash flows of 357 actual subprojects.

2.      Financial Analysis

Financial Performance. Audited consolidated financial results for the three EMCs over the
period 1997-2005 and estimates for 2006 are set out in detail in Annex 1. While consistently
below the initial and over-optimistic PAD estimates, the operating performance of the EMCs
show consistent progress and robust growth in market development, turn-over and corporate net
worth (excluding the EU and GEF grants).Even though the PAD estimates had been down
graded during appraisal it was generally acknowledged that these were still overly optimistic and
did not fully take into account the difficulty in establishing the business, adapting the ESCO
model, and growing this novel market. Overall the companies performed very well, recovering
from a slow start and steep learning curve and managed to reach break even some six years into
the project. After that the EMCs established a sound growth path and succeeded in increasing
profits annually thereafter. Over the 10 year period since the formation of the companies in 1996,
turn-over was increased on average at an annual rate of 37 percent, leading to a growth in net
worth, or the value of the enterprises of around 5 percent per annum.

Financial Analysis. The overall ex post financial analysis is based on the consolidated results
that are summarized in Annex 1 and calculated from the net annual cash flow from operations
net of all equity infusions that were received directly from the various shareholders and
indirectly from grants that were received in perpetuity from the EU and GEF. On this basis the
net present of the project is estimated to be RMB 92 million in real 1997 terms and the FIRR is
estimated to be 17.6 percent p.a. in real terms.

                     Annex 5. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results


In November 2006, a large conference was held in Beijing to discuss and share experience
gained from implementing the Energy Conservation Project.             Officials from the central
government and provincial governments attended the meeting. Implementing agencies (3
EMCs) reported to the meeting. Other participants included new EMCs, the China National
Investment & Guarantee Co., Ltd., and the EMC Service Association.

During the meeting, the representative from the Ministry of Finance stated that the project
demonstrated its success in energy savings and carbon dioxide emissions reduction. The project
created good role models for the sector and provided valuable experience for the future
development in energy savings in China. Energy performance contracting mechanism proofed to
be very feasible for the energy conservation industry in China. The impact of this project over
country and the contribution made by the Bank in introducing this advanced concept to China
cannot be overlooked. The second and the third Energy Conservation Projects were continuing
the effort to expand the energy conservation effort in China. The project should expand this
experience within the country as well as to other countries in the world.

Representatives from the NDRC told the meeting that the achievement of this project can be seen
very clearly and the impact is tremendous. This project was different from others in terms
introducing and exploring new ways of doing business. It was about a set of fresh mind sets, and
new market mechanism. There were implementation difficulties in the beginning. Existing
regulations and arrangements were not compatible with this new type of operations. The project
overcame the difficulties and developed the new concept of energy performance contracting
much further. The impact of this project is profound.

A former Director of Natural Resources Savings Department in SETC concluded that the project
had pioneered a set of very valuable experiences. Energy performance contracting was already
included in the medium and long energy conservation strategy in the country. The country had
successfully introduced, piloted and dissemination this new mechanism. However, the road
ahead was still long. Although energy conservation was treated as a priority, there were still
issues related to financing, and scaling up of the mechanism. There were still many hurdles
surrounding financing, and the country would still need the policy support from the government
and international financing.

Representatives from the new EMCs also spoke at the meeting. These EMCs pointed out that
the energy performance contracting added life to their companies' business. Their companies
used their own energy conservation technologies, products and services, combined with EPC
mechanism, and expanded their business all over the country, and they both became very well
known in the energy efficiency field.         The companies strengthened their capacity in
implementing EPC projects, and they were making EPC type of projects their main form of
business and core for being competitiveness.

          Summary of the WB/GEF China Energy Conservation Project in Phase I
                                      (Executive Report)


I.     To Introduce into China a New Energy Conservation Mechanism of
       "Energy Performance Contacting"

1.     Origin of the project

From 1992 to 1994, under the support of the World Bank (WB) and the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), China completed a study on China Issues and Options in GHG Emission Control.
An important conclusion of the study is: China has huge energy conservation potential, and there
are a large number of energy projects with mature technology and excellent economical and
environmental benefits, but because of all kinds of market obstacles, these projects have not been
implemented at large.

Therefore, the Government of China has discussed with the World Bank for many times on the
issue of how to promote universal implementation of energy conservation projects. And they
have agreed: with the transition of economical system, the original energy conservation
management system can not adapt to the new situation, so the management means and operation
system of energy conservation should be changed with it. At the same time of establishing and
perfecting energy conservation laws and regulations, standards and incentive policies, there is a
need to implement the WB/GEF China Energy Conservation Project for introducing,
demonstrating and popularizing a new market-oriented energy conservation mechanism of
"Energy Performance Contacting" in China, and to promote the formation and development of
energy conservation service industry, so as to universally increase energy utilization efficiency in
China, to save energy, to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, to protect
global and regional environment, and to make active contributions to the establishment of
resource saving society in China.

2.     To introduce into a new market-based energy conservation mechanism-- Energy
       Performance Contacting in China

The objectives of the project are to introduce into and further popularize a new market-based
energy conservation mechanism ­ Energy Performance Contacting in China, which has achieved
fine effects in developed countries, through establishing three pilot Energy Management
Companies (EMCo).

Energy Performance Contacting is an energy conservation mechanism based on market.
Professional Energy Management Company which operates according to "Energy Performance
Contacting" mode and with a direct profit-oriented (it is called ESCO for short in the foreign
countries, and EMCo in China), provides services in the complete process like energy
conservation potential analysis, feasibility study of energy conservation subproject, subproject
designing, subproject financing, equipment procurement, construction, measure and verification

of energy saving, personnel training and so on, through signing energy service contract with
clients that have the willing to carry out energy conservation renovation. EMCo guarantees to
realize energy conservation capacity and benefits promised in the contract (shown in Chart 1).
During the validity period of contract, benefit of EMCo is directly connected with energy saving
benefits; after the completion of contract, the client can get all the equipment and profits. In a
word, profits of client and EMCo are all from energy conservation benefits of the subproject, and
make investment according to future energy conservation benefits. Obviously, it is a kind of
market-based mechanism beneficial to many parties, the client earns the energy benefits, EMCo
gets profits and development, and at the same time obtaining social and environmental benefits.

3.      Project Task

WB/GEF China Energy Conservation Project is implemented in two phases.

The first phase of the project started to implement in December 1998. Its main task is to
demonstrate Energy Management Company  EMCo  (Business Plan see Table 1) and
disseminating energy conservation information. In 1996, three pilot EMCos, Beijing Yuanshen
Energy Conservation Technology Co., Ltd, Liaoning Energy Conservation Technology
Development Co., Ltd and Shandong Energy Conservation Engineering Co., Ltd, were
established successively. In their initial stages, a grant of ECU was provided to support the
implementation of pilot subprojects during the initial operation stages. In December 1998, the
signing of "GEF Grant Agreement" indicated the official implementation of project at phase I.
Under the support of GEF grant and IBRD loan, these three pilot EMCos adopt "Energy
Performance Contacting" mode to carry out energy subprojects for client according to real
situation of China, and to demonstrate the feasibility of "Energy Performance Contacting"
mechanism in China, and to further sum up the experience to popularize it in the whole country,
so as to promote the formation and development of China energy conservation service industry.

In the mean time, in order to remove obstacles in energy conservation information dissemination,
in 1998, Energy Conservation Information Dissemination Center of National Development and
Reform Commission (former State Economy and Trade Commission) was established, aiming at
developing and distributing free authoritative and practical energy conservation information, and
popularize energy conservation technology that is technologically feasible and economic-
reasonable in the whole society.

4.     Capital utilization at the first phase of the project

Capital comes from international assistant capital and domestic counterpart capital, in which
international assistant capital mainly includes:

    (1) GEF GrantGEF provides grant of US$ 22 million supporting the Project, among
        them US$1.5 million with domestic counterpart funds is used to support three pilot
        EMCos to carry out energy conservation demonstration subprojects by "Energy
        Performance Contacting" mode; US$5 million with domestic counterpart capital is used
        to support the work of NDRC Energy Conservation Information Dissemination Center
        (NECIDC), rest US$2 million grant is used in technical assistance to pilot EMCos. By
        the end of June 30, 2006, GEF grant of US$15 million was used up by these three pilot
        EMCos (US$ 5 million for each EMCo). Partial plans of NECIDC and technical
        assistance will be fulfilled by the end of June 2007.

    (2) WB IBRD loanWB provides loan of US$ 63 million to support the Project. This loan
        with counterpart domestic capitals is used to support the three pilot EMCos to carry out
        energy conservation subprojects. By the end of June, 30 2006, IBRD loan of
        US$21million was used up by Beijing EMCo and Shandong EMCo, and IBRD loan of
        US$ 19.0827 million was used up by Liaoning EMCo.

International Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is a window of cooperation
among the Government of China and the World Bank (WB) and the Global Environment Facility
(GEF), which represents the Government of China (GOC) to sign "Loan Agreement" and "Grant
Agreement" with WB and GEF, and to implement supervision and management to the
application of project capitals.

Resources Conservation and Environment Protection Department of the National
Development and Reform Commission is a governing agency to the project, which implements
guidance and management to this project.

Project Management Office of NDRC/WB/GEF China Energy Conservation Project
(PMO) is a routine management unit of the project. To guarantee the successful implementation
of the project, when PMO is carrying out overseeing and managing subprojects implemented by
EMCos, it also provides a series of technical assistances for them. PMO has organized and
implemented evaluation works and a large number of policy research works for many times
aiming at implementation of the project, and has successively held 5 elementary training and 6
senior training courses, trainees that take part in the training are nearly 400.




                                                  39

Besides, the WB appraises the implementation effects of the project respectively in spring and
autumn every year, and has carried out medium-term appraisal to the project in 2000 and 2002,
which has promoted successful implementation of the project.

Under the great supports of the Government of China and international organizations, under the
common efforts of all parties, the first fruitful phase of the project is successfully completed on
30th June, 2006, the flourishing second phase of the project is unfolding. "Energy Performance
Contacting" mechanism has exhibited a vigorous life force in China. Energy service industry in
China has come into initial scale, which faces a vast and beautiful development prospects.

II Successful Demonstration of Phase I of the Project Exhibits that "Energy
        Performance Contacting" has a Strong Life Force

Since its establishment in 1996, the scale of 3 pilot EMCos are continuously expanding, energy
conservation subproject market is exploiting, energy investment is increasing steadily, working
capital is increasing year after year, profits-earning ability is gradually strengthening, integrated
operation ability is continuously improving, benefits of energy savings and emission mitigation
is obvious, excellent energy service achieves highly appraise from the clients, and the fixed
objectives set out in the agreement between GOC and WB have been realized. Practice of the
three pilot EMCos demonstrates that "Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism in China is
feasible, and phase I of the project has achieved a complete success.

Up to 30th June, 2006, the three pilot EMCos adopts "Energy Performance Contacting"
mechanism to accumulatively carry out 453 energy conservation subprojects for the clients with
total investment of nearly 1.3 billion RMB Yuan. Through the implementation of these
subprojects, EMCos get net profits of 420 million RMB Yuan, while the net profit of the client is
8-10 times of the profits of EMCos. These subprojects have brought good energy conservation
and environmental benefits: it obtains energy saving capacity of 1.37 million tons of coal
equivalent (tce)/year, emission mitigation capacity of CO2 1.36 million tons of carbon per year.
The actual energy conservation investment, the amount of energy saving and carbon emission
mitigation are all exceed those established by the WB in business plan (see Table 2).

Establishment, development and continuous growth of the three pilot EMCos show out that a
new energy conservation mechanism of "Energy Performance Contacting" has a strong life force
in China.

1.      Development and growth of the three pilot EMCos

A.     The scale of pilot EMCos is continuously enlarging, and the scale of energy
       conservation investment is steadily increasing

The assets of Beijing, Liaoning, Shandong pilot EMCos has increase to present 183, 313 and 247
million RMB Yuan respectively from 20.75, 27.69 and 37.27 million RMB Yuan in 1997, with
total assets sum as high as 743 million RMB Yuan. Personnel number of the company has
increased to present 283 from 24 initially. And Liaoning EMCo has developed into an enterprise
group with 9 members from 2002, and has carried out business cooperation with 39 regions of 9
provinces and cities and 19 countries.

From developing course of 3 pilot EMCos (see Chart 3 to Chart 6), energy conservation
subprojects implemented by using a new energy conservation mechanism of "Energy
Performance Contacting" have gone through three phases. The initial stage is from the year of
1997 to 2000. In this period, it is mainly to learn, make familiar with, and try to implement a
mechanism of "Energy Performance Contacting", and grope and acknowledge an energy
conservation investment market, so energy saving investment during this period is comparatively
small, with annual investment of only 30-50 million RMB Yuan. After the first WB Medium-
Term Appraisal in November 2000, 3 pilot EMCos summarizes experience at initial stage. At
this time, EMCos have been relatively familiar with the operation of "Energy Performance
Contracting" mechanism, and get a basic acknowledgment to energy conservation investment
market; thus EMCos have entered a growing phase. Energy saving investment starts to quickly
increase, and total investment of EMCos has been over 100 million RMB yuan annually. After
the second WB medium-term appraisal in November 2002, all the companies' further sum up
experience and with a comparatively profound acknowledgment to a new mechanism; energy
saving targeted market is gradually formed. In this period, EMCo has stepped into a mature
development phase. Energy saving investment steadily increases at high level. At present, annual
energy saving investment capacity of Beijing, Liaoning, Shandong pilot EMCos reaches 65
million, 120 million and 85 million RMB Yuan respectively, with total annual energy saving
investment capacity as high as 270 million RMB Yuan, which is more than 5 times of the year of
1997.

B.     Targeted market of pilot EMCos is gradually forming, and expanding continuously

Energy conservation investment market developing orientation of the three pilot EMCos have
experienced an exploration course, and are gradually developed to maturity and multi-direction.
Beijing EMCo has located its investment market orientation on giving a priority to building
energy conservation based on characteristics of market in Beijing. Investment of building energy
conservation subproject accounts for more than 70% of the total investment. Beijing EMCo
chooses space heating, air-conditioning energy conservation technologies as a focus to make
investment such as geothermal heating pump, water storage heating, ice storage cooling, heat
storage for electric space heating and so on. Beijing EMCo is now exploring its developing
direction of "demand side service (on user side) taking energy station as a representation".
Liaoning EMCo is located in the old industrial base in Northeast of China. Traditional large and
medium industrial enterprises spread widely in this area, with huge potential of energy savings.



                                               41

In the meantime, because of cold weather, energy use by heating is very high. Liaoning EMCo
decides to take boiler renovation as a prior while also giving considerations to motor driving,
industrial furnace and kiln retrofits and steam heat supply system renovation. So investment of
industrial energy saving project accounts for 83% of total investment. Shandong is a new and
large industrial province. Energy consuming equipment in most of iron & steel, chemical
industry, paper-making and petrochemical enterprises still applies a traditional technology.
Therefore, investment in industrial energy saving projects by Shandong EMCo takes 83% of
total investment. Shandong EMCo focuses its project line particularly on industrial boilers
renovation and co-generation, at the same time, also making renovation on motor driving system
and industrial furnaces and kilns. In the future, Shandong EMCo will extend into a field of power
generation with discharged combustible gas.

C.        Pilot companies have achieved good benefits from energy conservation investment

Because of optimization choice to energy conservation subprojects, and effective adoption of
risk guarding measures, in energy conservation subprojects implemented by the three pilot
EMCos, simple investment payback period with less than 3 years accounts for more than 90 of
total investment, and most of which is within 1-2 years. Investment of one tce energy saving
capacity is about 1000 RMB Yuan yearly/(tce/yr.), and investment of one ton carbon emission
mitigation capacity is less than 1250 Yuan/(ton carbon/year)3

D.        Operation ability of pilot companies is improving continuously

In the process of demonstrative operation, project investment, assets, profits of the three pilot
EMCos are increasing side by side, and capital strength of them is also continuously intensifying.
From 1997 to 2006, rolling investment is about 1.4 billion RMB Yuan. Total business income
exceeds 1 billion RMB Yuan with profits of about 80 million RMB Yuan. Up to the end of 2006,
the total assets is approaching to nearly 800 million RMB Yuan, and accumulative unallocated
profit is about 40 million RMB yuan. Percentage of EMCo itself-owned capital taking in
investment of energy conservation subprojects is continuously enlarged, accounting for over
60% of all the energy conservation investment after 2002.

At present, 3 pilot EMCos are all with sustainable development ability to carry out energy
conservation business based on "Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism. So capital
turnover of EMCos is speeded up obviously; capital operation efficiency is remarkably
improved; the scale of net income and investment increases rapidly; credit reputation and
financing ability in financing system has been established. All of these EMCos have the ability to
expand the scale of energy subproject investment, even if WB loan has been used up, they also
have the ability to raise the capital to develop energy saving business. The three pilot EMCos
will make full use of its advantages in the future, stick to energy conservation cause
unwaveringly, stick to "Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism unchangingly, and are
confident in sustainable development to their companies in the future.


3   It is the investment of equipment. If it considers the cost of management, and calculation is based on a complete
    investment of contract, investment of one tce energy saving capacity is about 1300 RMB yuan/(tce/yr.), and
    investment of one ton carbon emission mitigation is about 1600 RMB yuan/(tc/yr.).


                                                          42

E.     GEF grant brings a "leverage" effect into play

It is particular obvious that in the past decade, capital of GEF in the first phase of project is
US$22 million, while energy saving investment of the three pilot Companies reaches 1.3 billion
RMB Yuan, which illustrates that the sustainable development ability of the three pilot EMCos
are continuously improving, and in the other hand, GEF grant has brought about 8 times of
amplification effect into play in the first phase of the project.

2.      Accumulate valuable successful experience

In the beginning of 1996, Liaoning EMCo started its undertaking on the basis of "one room, 7
persons, 4 project line, no products of itself, no technology", while Beijing and Shandong EMCo
also faced the same situation. Because at that time, "Energy Performance Contacting" is a grand
new operation mode in China, in the initial stage of the project, the three pilot EMCos are all
facing the risk in company operation and market exploitation. In order to solve the coming
problems, three pilot EMCos explore and make innovation in business operation, market
development, risk control, and have accumulated a great deal of success experience for many
years of practice.

A.     Important experience of Beijing EMCo

       In the aspect of project market, Beijing EMCo adjusts targeted market of the company
       according to market changes. In view of rapidly development of the tertiary industry,
       continuously increase of residential buildings, stricter environmental quality requirements
       in Beijing, Beijing EMCo considers the situation and then gradually turns its targeted
       market from industrial energy conservation to building energy conservation fields. It has
       carried out a lot of energy saving subprojects in heat supply, air-conditioning and
       buildings renovation.

       Aiming at problems in client's capital payback during the initial stage of project, Beijing
       EMCo strengthens risk management in two aspects: fund payback risk control and
       financing risk control.

       Main measures adopted in the aspect of fund payback risk control includes: 1
       Beijing EMCo is to base oneself upon choosing client with good products marketing and
       economical benefits, and adds a procedure of evaluation to nearly 3 years financing
       report tables, so as to judge payback ability of client and to avoid capital risk of energy
       renovation subproject. 2pay attention to the choice of energy renovation subproject,
       equipment suppliers to avoid technology risk of energy renovation subproject. 3
       when signing energy renovation service agreement, it acquires client to provide
       corresponding guarantee. Once there is special situation occurred, it guarantees energy
       renovation subproject fund to be called back. 4 the signing of energy renovation
       service agreement and guarantee agreement must be examined by barrister and law
       consultant to guarantee validity and integrality of agreement and contract.  5 
       implement responsibility system that subprojects manager should be responsible for fund
       payback.


                                                  43

   In the aspect of financing risk control, it is mainly from the aspects of subproject
   developing, lowering credit reputation risk of client, strengthening capital payback
   management, forecast analysis of foreign exchange risk, control financing risk, lowering
   rate of assets liabilities to strengthen prevention and control.

B. Important experience of Liaoning EMCo

   Always stick to "007" service mode, that is to make client zero risk in financing and
   technology, to let client enjoy seven-in-one service including energy diagnosis,
   subproject designing, subproject financing, equipment supply, installation and debugging,
   running and maintenance, personnel training .
   Set up three sets of subproject management systems, which have become strong
   guarantee means of Liaoning EMCo in the past decade to realize 100% project success of
   "Energy Performance Contacting" subproject.

       Risk control system, core content is: one safety island, two safety lines, and four
   fireproof walls"

       "One safety island" means to make an effort to choose "gold client";
       "Two safety lines" means pay close attention to changing trend of client satisfaction
           and credit reputation;
       "Four fireproof walls" means four project operation measures that company adopts
       to guarantee capital payback:         close running of energy expenditures, it requires
       client to set up special account for project capital close management;           creditor's
       rights close running, that is, in the situation that energy expenditures of client can not
       be run close, it runs its comparatively steady income origin close, and to be taken as
       payback capital origin. trusteeship running: company or company assigns the third
       party to be responsible for operation management after the implementation of the
       project, according to agreement, it adopts normal financing settlement with client, and
       takes business income of project products as capital origin for payback. mortgage
       guarantee, this is a kind of guarantee measure learnt from financing organizations, but
       EMCo has made complementation and perfection. Mortgage range is not only limited
       in lands, house property, equipment, securities and so on, and also adds management
       rights mortgage, products order mortgage and so on. In this situation, guarantee has
       turned from original single project guarantee into multi-project integrated guarantee,
       which can shorten the cycle of project establishment.

       Subproject quality guarantee system: in the pre-phase of subproject, "accuracy" is
   required to assure the veracity and authenticity of subproject information; in
   implementation period of the subproject, it gives prominence to " reality", that is, all the
   work should set out from fact to carry out work on schedule according to subproject fact
   with no hidden trouble, and to assure success of subproject; in the period of subproject
   benefits sharing, it is to grasp" stability", in this period, the subproject is in the phase of
   ending, most of the work has been completed. If it is, in this period, too hurry for success,
   there will be careless mistake, which will cause serious consequence.



                                              44

            Complete life-span post-contract service system: core content is "do a project,
       establish a monument, develop a market, make friends" for erecting company brand, and
       guaranteeing client market

C.      Important experience of Shandong EMCo

       In subproject development, according to the characteristics of large-size industrial
       enterprises in Shandong province, huge energy potential of single enterprise, a large
       number of subprojects, subprojects can be implemented in groups and phases, so as to
       exert oneself to cultivate "project host", to develop "client group", and to establish long
       effective cooperation relationship with individual clients or a certain kind of client groups
       that have established mutual trust relations.

       In financing system, it sticks to industrial accounting system. Company and client can
       keep accounts according to equipment procurement, which solves tax and financing
       problems brought to company and client by keeping accounts according to energy saving
       benefits sharing. This can make Energy Performance Contacting mechanism basically
       adapt to domestic existing regulations.

       In the course of energy saving benefits sharing, it promises with client in advance that
       in the situation of enterprise under normal production, energy saving benefits should be
       affirmed according to promised quantity by the both sides, which can avoid possible
       dispute with client due to verification of energy effects, and assure harmoniously
       popularization of "Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism and harmoniously
       development of Shandong EMCo.

       It established a complete set of risk control system from initial evaluation of client and
       subproject, to implementation of subproject, at last to energy benefits sharing. Especially
       in the initial evaluation phase of subproject, financing department of company has the
       one-ticket veto to credit reputation evaluation of client.

3.     Successfully develop an energy conservation information dissemination platform

Energy Conservation Information Dissemination Center set up inside of former State Economy
and Trade Commission (now has transferred to National Development and Reform Commission)
has successfully developed a very effective information platform after many years of operation,
which develops and disseminates energy conservation investment project information with
potential of popularization. Practice has proved that enterprise can save a great deal of energy
and lower its cost if it adopts a similar technology renovation measure according to this
information. Up to now, Information Dissemination Center has made and disseminated 73
"Energy Conservation Case Study" and 14 "Energy Conservation Technology Guidance", and
before the end of June 2007, it will continuously make and disseminate 27 "Energy Conservation
Case Study" and 6 "Energy Conservation Technology Guidance". Evaluation outcome made by
the third party agency shows that energy saving and emission mitigation benefits gained by
disseminating energy conservation information is over 10 times than that of input for



                                                45

dissemination of information. This illustrates that energy information dissemination is a kind of
effective measure to promote energy conservation of the whole society. With the expansion of
center's business, it will exert fruitful promotion effect on continuous development in the aspect
of China's energy conservation investment. To further strengthen position of information
dissemination taking in energy conservation work, strengthen center ability building, quickly
drive multi-development in business field and information products have become important
guarantee in the sustainable development of NECIDC in the future.

IIIChina's Energy Service Industry is Developing and Expanding

Significance of successful demonstration of "Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism in
phase I is profound. A new energy service industry is rapidly taking shape, developing and
expanding in China.

The practice of three pilot EMCos has proved that "Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism
is feasible in China. In 2000, former State Economy and Trade Commission issued "A
Announcement of Further Popularization of Energy Performance Contracting Mechanism". After
that, it has done a lot of dissemination and training works, and then decided to startup the second
phase of the project. At present, market-based Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism has
taken a deep root in China, which has demonstrated a huge vigor market, and aroused widely
attentions from domestic and overseas.

Under successfully pushing forward by the first phase of the project, the second phase started to
implement in 2003. Its task is mainly to provide services to EMCos, to carry out EMCo loan
guarantee plan, and to promote the formation and development of a new energy conservation
service industry in China. In the second phase of the project, WB has provided GEF capital of
US$ 26 million, in which US$ 22 million is used to support EMCo loan guarantee plan, US$4
million is used to cover incremental cost and technical assistance of project implementation unit.

Under the support of the second phase of project, EMCo industrial organization--Energy
Conservation Service Industry Committee of China Energy Conservation Association (EMCA
for short) was registered and established in December 2003. EMCA has provided effective
technical assistance and service for new EMCo and potential EMCo, and let them develop and
expand healthily and rapidly. A new energy conservation service industry comes into being
rapidly in China. At present, there are more than 190 members in EMCA. Only in the two years
of 2004 and 2005, total investment of energy conservation project implemented by new EMCos
with Energy Performance Contacting mechanism has exceeded 1 billion RMB Yuan.

At the same time, under the support of the second phase of project, an implementation
organization of EMCo loan guarantee plan-- China Economy and Technology Investment
Guarantee Co., Ltd (I&G for short) provides loan guarantee for new EMCos that are in lack of
financing credit reputation by using quite limited guarantee capital. This can help them enhance
their financing capability of energy conservation subproject and improve their credit reputation.
To the end of August in 2006, 62 energy saving subprojects have received guarantee supports,
and accumulative guarantee sum reaches 186.47 million RMB Yuan. Thus it obtains energy




                                                 46

saving capacity of 179,573 ton of coal equivalent per year, and CO2emission mitigation capacity
of 109,352 ton of carbon per year by these subprojects implementation.

Energy conservation service industry in China is taking shape rapidly. The number of Energy
Management Company increased from 3 in 1997 to 30 in 2003, at present, more than 100
EMCos have implemented energy conservation subprojects in different energy fields by using
"Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism. Only in the two years of 2004 and 2005,
investment of energy conservation subprojects carried out by new EMCos through adopting
"Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism was over 1 billion RMB Yuan, which has
achieved obvious energy saving and emission mitigation effects and good economical and social
benefits. Energy conservation service industry in China is becoming more prosperous day by day.
Thus EMCo has become an important new force in promoting energy conservation work in
China.

While energy conservation service industry is developing and expanding, "Energy Performance
Contacting" mechanism mode is developed and innovated in practice too. Besides "energy
saving benefits sharing" business mode demonstrated by the three EMCos, many new EMCos
start to adopt business modes of "guarantee of energy saving" and "energy expenditure
trusteeship", and gradually developing into many compound modes on this basis.

The Government of China has attached highly attention to "Energy Performance Contacting"
mechanism. In many important government documents, it clearly proposes that it takes spreading
"Energy Performance Contacting" mechanism as an important measure to promote energy
conservation cause in China. For example, "China Medium and Long Term Energy Conservation
Planning" authorized by the State Council puts forward that it should "spread Energy
Performance Contacting mechanism so as to remove market barriers in promoting new energy
conservation technology; facilitate energy conservation industrialization, and provide one-in-all
service including diagnosis, designing, financing, renovation, operation and management for
enterprise conducting energy conservation renovation activities; to establish an energy
conservation investment guarantee mechanism, and promote development of the energy
conservation technology service system". "The State Council's Decision on Intensifying Energy
Conservation Work" lately publicized also definitively specifies that it should "speed up
advancing Energy Performance Contacting management, promote enterprise energy conservation
technology renovation". In the meantime, the World Bank (WB) and the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) appraisal missions have highly valued the outcomes of "Energy Performance
Contacting" mechanism demonstration in China. Besides, press media including TV, radio,
newspapers and periodicals, magazines, networks and so on have done utmost to report "Energy
Performance Contacting" mechanism. Many energy consumers such as industrial enterprise,
commercial building owner, logistics department in high education, hospitals and residential
district property management company have shown great interest in "Energy Performance
Contacting" mechanism. Moreover, a large number of domestic and overseas companies
including energy saving equipment manufacturers and energy conservation consultation
companies favors China-- the largest energy conservation investment market in the world, and
are eager to have a try to establish EMCo. In present China's energy conservation field, "Energy
Performance Contacting" has become a very fashionable noun. So energy conservation service
industry is now flourishing in China.



                                               47

At the moment of energy conservation service industry gradually coming into being in China, in
the end of 2005, the Government of China proposed a ambition goal of energy conservation that
China should "reduce energy consumption of unit GDP by 20 in the period of `11th Five-year
Plan'", which has given significant emphasis on energy conservation work. This offers
unprecedented moment for accelerating the development of China's energy conservation service
industry.

A lot of study conclusions have shown that China has a huge potential of energy conservation.
Currently, energy conservation potential that is feasible technologically and economically
reasonable in the market exceeds 300 million tce. To realize a goal of energy conservation in the
period of "11th Five-year Plan" and dig out energy conservation potential, governments at
different levels are quickly formulating energy conservation policies in the aspect of energy
conservation management system, incentives and energy conservation financing. This situation
has provided a huge stage for EMCo to implement energy conservation projects.

Highly valued by the government, huge energy conservation market demand, getting better and
better policy environment, and powerful international assistance have provided very favorable
conditions for the development of energy conservation industry in China. Presently, an energy
conservation service industry force based on the market is taking shape and developing. They
will make active contributions to promotion of realizing an energy conservation goal of "11th
Five-year Plan" and sustainable development of China's economy and society in the future. New
energy conservation mechanism of "Energy Performance Contacting" like a flower being in full
bloom will certainly give out more plentiful and rich fruits.
