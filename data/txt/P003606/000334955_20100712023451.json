           Project for China were as follows: outcome was satisfactory;\n            risk to development outcome was negligible or low; Bank\n            performance was satisfactory; and borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Lessons include: Energy Performance\n            Contract's (EPCs) require quick implementation and\n            closure, so it is important for the Bank's procurement\n            procedures to be flexible to provide the quick response\n            necessary to get the private sector involved in the Energy\n            Management Company (EMC) business. For an energy efficiency\n            project to succeed, it is important to engage government\n            officials across ministries in practical and operationally\n            focused dialogues to address specific implementation\n            challenges, such as regulatory instruments, financial\n            incentives, and provision of information. Although EPCs are\n            meant to be a market solution for energy efficiency, in a\n            transitional economy like China, strong government support\n            is crucial for the market to deliver successful results. In\n            the case of the Energy Conservation project, the\n            Government's policies, regulations and instructions on\n            reducing energy intensity were important drivers for the\n            expansion of the Environmental Management Bureau (EMB)\n            business. Strong country ownership requires adapting the\n            project to the country-specific context. Bank-generated\n            ideas work best when they are appropriately adapted to\n            country circumstances. In the case of the Energy\n            Conservation Project, the Government had adjusted tax\n            treatment and legal interpretation of EMCs, thereby creating\n            an enabling environment for the dissemination of the EPC\n            concept in China."}, "docdt": "2010-06-01T00:00:00Z"}
