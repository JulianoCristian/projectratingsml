1    IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.                    I
    About this Report
           The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
    first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's selfevaluation process and to verify that the Banks work is producing the
    expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and proceduresthrough the
    dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
    the Banks lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
    that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
    which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
    important lessons.
           To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
    documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
    and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
    in local offices as appropriate.
           Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
    internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
    relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
    the document that is sent to the Banks Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
    the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

    About the IEGWB Rating System
         IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
    lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
    arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
    (additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
         Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
    be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
    relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
    objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
    sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
    Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
    the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
    were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
    extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
    and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
    operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
    expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
    Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable. ,
         Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
    operation and supported effective implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
    transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
    achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
    Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
    Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
         Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
    agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
    agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
    performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
    Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
    Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) assesses the China Energy
Conservation Project. This project had a total actual cost of US$194.8 million equivalent,
which was financed through International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) Loan No. 43040 in the amount of US$60.51 million, a counterpart contribution
of US$107.8 million equivalent, a European Commission (EC) Grant EECT-209849 of
US$4.5 million equivalent, and a Global Environment Facility (GEF) Grant TF-028328
of SDR 16.3 million (approximately US$22.0 million). The loan was approved on March
26, 1998, became effective on December 16, 1998, and was closed on June 30,2006. The
loan was 100 percent disbursed. The GEF Grant was closed one year after the originally
scheduled closing date on June 30, 2007.

The Energy Conservation Project was selected for a PPAR because it is one of the
earliest energy conservation projects financed by IBRD and GEF in China and the
assessment will help to inform IEG's ongoing climate change evaluation.

This PPAR was based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion Report (Report No. ICR0000701), Project Appraisal Document (Report No.
17030-CHA), loan documents, mid-term review reports and other project files, as well as
discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project. An Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) mission visited China in April 2009 to discuss the project's development
effectiveness of with the government, the project implementing agencies at the national
and provincial levels, financial institutions, private investors and the business association
for energy conservation, research institutes, and other stakeholders. Their cooperation
and assistance are gratefully acknowledged.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the
government for their review, but no comments were received.

Summary
The China Energy Conservation Project was approved in March 1998. The project was
identified during the time when China was moving toward an increasingly market-
oriented economy. The heavily regulated energy conservation system that had been built
up during the 1980s had gradually lost its effectiveness as private sector ownership
diversified, and the government was faced with constrained fiscal revenues. With this
background, both the Chinese government and the World Bank recognized the need to
develop market-based instruments to encourage private participation in energy
conservation investment.
Energy performance contracting (EPC) was introduced with the Bank's assistance as a
commercially based financing mechanism to promote greater energy efficiency. Under an
EPC, Energy Management Companies (EMCs) provide customers with a comprehensive
set of energy efficiency measures and often guarantee that the savings produced by a
project will be sufficient to finance its full costs. Though they generally assume the
project's performance risk, the EMCs receive a share of the cash savings generated by the
reduction in energy consumption over the contract period. After contract expiration, the
clients retain all future energy savings benefits.
The EPC mechanism can help overcome several key market barriers to energy
conservation, including lack of awareness of energy efficiency, lack of access to
appropriate technology and financing, high transaction costs, and perceived high
technical risks. The government of China showed strong interest and endorsed the EPC
concept. As a result, the Energy Conservation Project was designed and implemented to
foster the development of an EPC market in China.
Both the project development objective and the global environment objective of the
Energy Conservation Project were to improve the efficiency of energy use in the People's
Republic of China and facilitate reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and other
pollutants through energy efficiency investments within the territory of the Borrower.
The project had three components: (1) to develop three pilot EMCs to introduce,
demonstrate, and disseminate the EPC concept; (2) to develop a national energy
conservation information center to disseminate energy conservation project results to
enterprise managers; and (3) a project management and monitoring component.
Project objectives and design were substantially relevant. The design of the project was
simple and focused on introducing the EPC model as a way to overcome some key
market failures and barriers to energy conservation. These initial barriers - such as lack
of regulatory oversight and market incentives for the private sector - became less
important during implementation due to more stringent Government regulations for
energy conservation, increasing energy costs, and adjusted incentives of state-owned
enterprises. These later improvements in market and regulatory conditions mitigated the
initial risks associated with the over-enthusiastic investment plans and stretch targets of
the three EMC demonstration companies. The project also had a well-planned sequence
of financing to cover risks of venturing into a new market. The overall relevance was
rated substantial.

The efficacy of the project is rated substantial. The project implemented the three EMC
pilots and introduced and demonstrated the EPC concept. The rapid growth of the three
                                            A




pilot EMCs confirmed the financial viability of the EPC mechanism in China and
generated significant interest among Chinese investors in developing various types of
EMC businesses. The mechanism is now being disseminated and replicated by more than
400 companies across the country. The project achieved its original targets established
during project appraisal for energy savings and emissions reduction mainly through its
demonstration effect and the resultant investments realized outside the project. The
project successfully established an information center which helped disseminate
information about relevant new technologies, surpassing targets for indirectly induced
energy savings (through information campaigns leading to investment decisions for new
technologies).
The project yielded very high financial and economic return, thus efficiency is rated
high. Based on substantial relevance and efficacy, and high efficiency, the project's
outcome is rated satisfactory. The Risk to Development Outcome is rated negligible to
low. The EPC mechanism has been recognized as an important instrument to achieve the
Chinese government's energy conservation goals. A series of Bank supported follow-up
projects has also been developed to scale up EMC business in order to improve energy
efficiency. At the industry level, a wider range of EPC models are being developed,
including more sustainable contractual arrangements that share the financing
responsibility between EMCs and their clients.
The Bank's Performance is rated satisfactory. The Bank adopted a clear EPC
instrument focus and a learning-by-doing approach to the creation of a new business line.
The Bank successfully mobilized co-financing and collaboration among donors, which is
particularly important in covering risks of venturing into a new market. During
implementation, the task team delivered timely and intensive supervision, and showed
flexibility as needed. One shortcoming of Bank supervision, however, is that it failed to
formalize the downscaling of the ambitious targets this operation had originally
promised.
Borrower performance is rated satisfactory. Strong government support and the
dedicated efforts of the implementing agency were critical to addressing the tax and legal
challenges encountered in adapting the EPC concept to the Chinese market. The pilot
EMCs were proactive and creative in developing contracts that suit the Chinese market.
They developed a unique mix of technical, financial risk assessment and management,
and marketing skills to ensure the companies' long-term success.
The main lessons emerging from this assessment are as follows:
   0   EPCs require quick implementation and closure, so it is important for the Bank's
       procurement procedures to be flexible to provide the quick response necessary to
       get the private sector involved in the EMC business.
       For an energy efficiency project to succeed, it is important to engage government
       officials across ministries in practical and operationally focused dialogues to
       address specific implementation challenges, such as regulatory instruments,
       financial incentives, and provision of information.
       Although EPCs are meant to be a market solution for energy efficiency, in a
       transitional economy like China, strong government support is crucial for the
       market to deliver successful results. In the case of the Energy Conservation
                                   xi

project, the Government's policies, regulations and instructions on reducing
energy intensity were important drivers for the expansion of the EMB business.
Strong country ownership requires adapting the project to the country-specific
context. Bank-generated ideas work best when they are appropriately adapted to
country circumstances.. In the case of the Energy Conservation Project, the
Government had adjusted tax treatment and legal interpretation of EMCs, thereby
creating an enabling environment for the dissemination of the EPC concept in
China.

    1. Introduction
Country and Sector Background
1.1     Since initiating economic reform in 1979, China has become one of the world?s
fastest-growing economies. From 1979 to 2000, China?s real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
grew at an average rate of 9.6 percent per annum.? This economic growth has been
accompanied by soaring energy consumption and production. Primary energy demand grew
by 4 to 5 percent per year during the same period. China is now the world?s second largest
energy consumer, accounting for one-tenth of the global total. Figure 1 illustrates the steep
upward trend in energy consumption in China.

1.2     Although energy use grew only half as fast as the economy, the disparity in energy
efficiency between China and developed countries was significant at the time of project
preparation. The average thermal efficiency of China?s power plants was 25-29 percent,
compared to 35-38 percent in Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
countries. In other segments, the difference was even higher, for example, 52 percent
compared to 72 percent for industrial boilers, 28 percent versus 52 percent in iron and steel
heat generation, and 15 percent compared to 55 percent for commercial and household
energy use (Blackman and Wu 1999).

1.3     Since the early 1990s, China?s energy deficit has sharply increased because of its
rapid economic expansion and its economy?s high energy intensity. The power supply has
fallen short of demand by about 20 percent annually; frequent power outages have caused

1.4    Low efficiency also magnifies local and global environmental concerns. China's
energy mix has been dominated by coal, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the
country's primary energy demand. With 1.28 billion tons of raw coal produced in 1995,
China ranked as the world's largest producer and consumer of coal. Inefficient coal-based
power generation has released substantial pollutants, including carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur
dioxide (S02), total suspended particulates, and so forth, causing severe health effects and
global warming effects. Figure 2 shows China's primary energy consumption by fuel type.

Government Strategy
1.5     Starting from the early 1980s, the Chinese government issued a series of
administrative measures to promote greater end-use energy efficiency. Efficiency programs,
particularly for the industrial sector, were based on consumption control through quotas and
prohibitions against new facilities with outdated energy-consuming equipment.

1.6     One important component of the early energy conservation system built up in the
1980s was a government-sponsored network of more than 200 energy conservation
technology service centers. They had more than 3,000 staff members throughout the ministry
systems and in all major cities across the country. These centers received government
directives and grants to conduct energy audits, pursue efficiency projects, provide technical
assistance to energy end-users, and disseminate energy saving technology and information.

1.7     These command and control-based efficiency programs had worked effectively in a
centrally planned economy. The energy intensity-that is, energy consumption per unit of
GDP-of the Chinese economy dropped from 35,241 British thermal unit (Btu) per US dollar
                                                                     3


to 12,238, a two-thirds reduction from 1981 to 2000. Figure 3 illustrates this decreasing
trend.

1.8     However, the effectiveness of the energy conservation system was severely weakened
throughout the 1990s by the deepening of economic reform, the shrinking government
control over the economic system, and increasingly restricted central budget. In particular,
the energy service centers had gradually lost government funding for mandated efficiency
projects; their capacity to execute serious energy conservation initiatives was largely
threatened. The government recognized the urgency of developing market-oriented policy
measures to mobilize private sector resources for energy conservation.

World Bank Group Assistance
1.9     Since the mid 1990s, the World Bank has served as a core partner of the Chinese
government in designing and implementing energy conservation programs. An energy
conservation study in 1993 (World Bank 1993) and a major Global Environment Facility
(GEF)-financed China greenhouse gas emission control study in 1994 (NEPA and others
1994) led to the initial dialogue between the Bank and China on developing national energy
efficiency strategies.

1.10 With China seeking the Bank's financial and technical support, two options were
considered. One was the development of a line-of-credit operation to support energy
conservation investments, and the other was the introduction of energy performance
contracting (EPC) as a market-based approach to promote energy efficiency. The government
strongly preferred the EPC concept, particularly because it represented a business model on
which energy conservation service centers could continue to operate on commercial terms.
Consequently, the Energy Conservation Project was designed. The Bank was on the forefront
in helping China develop the EPC mechanism.
                                                      4



 1.11 The Energy Conservation Project was conceived from the beginning as a two-phase
operation. The first phase aimed at demonstrating the viability of the EPC business by
                                                              and
forming three pilot energy management companies (EMCS)~ promoting the
dissemination of information on energy conservation. The second phase (Second Energy
Conservation Project, approved in 2002) supported the scaling up of EPC business both
through a loan guarantee program and the development of an EMC association (EMCA).
This PPAR only assesses the first phase because the second phase was ongoing at the time of
the assessment.

1.12 In addition to the Energy Conservation and the Second Energy Conservation Projects,
five other major stand-alone energy efficiency projects in China have been approved by the
Board since December 1996. These projects (with their approval year in the parentheses)
focused on:

    a. Disseminating more energy-efficient and cleaner industrial boiler technologies
       (Efficient Industrial Boiler Project, 1996)
    b. Moving to central district heating and implementing more stringent building
       standards (Second Beijing Environment Project, 2000)
    C. Developing market-based demand-side management, including heat metering and
       heat tariff system reform, and more stringent building standards (Heat Reform and
       Building Energy Efficiency Project, 2005)
    d. Strengthening commercial financing for EMCs and efficiency investment (China
       Energy Efficiency Financing Project, 2008)
    e. Improving thermal power efficiency, including mitigating the financial barriers of
       closing inefficient small coal-fired units, demonstrating the viability of investments in
       efficiency improvements in existing mid-sized thermal units, and supporting efficient
       generation dispatch (Thermal Power Efficiency, 2009).

1.13 Total Bank lending to the above projects amounts to US$650.1 million. The Bank has
also leveraged US$132.6 million in cofinancing grants from GEF. These activities are
summarized in Annex B.

1.14 In addition, an International Finance Corporation/ GEF-supported China Utility-based
Energy Efficiency (CHUEE) Program was approved in April 2006 in the amount of
US$146.9 million. The project goals were to provide marketing, development, and financing
services to commercial, industrial, and municipal sector energy users to install more energy
efficient equipment. In contrast to the Energy Conservation Program which used ESCOs as a
vehicle to address the information and credit constraints to energy efficiency investments,
CHUEE worked directly with domestic banks by providing loan guarantees. CHUEE also
provided technical assistance to a range of market players in energy efficiency, including
banks, market partners, and end-users.



2. Energy management companies (EMCs), as they are referred to in China - are also called energy service
companies (ESCOs) in other countries.
                                                5


1.15 The World Bank was also engaged in China's energy policy reform through sector
work and technical assistance. Among the policy and reform goals of the Bank's assistance to
China have been to promote energy pricing reform and decentralized power generation, both
of which would have important implications for energy efficiency development. (ESMAP
1994,2005; World Bank 1993, 1995).

Assistance of Other Donors
1.16 Many other donor agencies, including the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), continue to be involved in improving
China's energy efficiency. Annex C provides a list of the agencies, brief descriptions of the
projects, and the amount of the grant and loan provided by each for energy efficiency
development.

2. Project Objectives, Components, and Financing
Mechanisms
Objective
2.1     According to the Loan and Grant Agreements, both the Project Development
Objective (PDO) and the Global Environment Objective (GEO) of the Energy Conservation
Project were to assist the Borrower to improve the efficiency of energy use in the People's
Republic of China and facilitate reductions in C02 emissions and other pollutants through
energy efficiency investments within the territory of the Borrower.

2.2    The Project Appraisal Document stated the PDO and GEO as to achieve large,
sustained, and growing increases in energy efficiency and associated reduction in the growth
of C02 emissions and other pollutants. The PDO and GEO stated in the Loan and Grant
Agreements were used as the basis for this assessment.

2.3    The objectives would be achieved by: (a) introducing, demonstrating and
disseminating new project financing concepts and market-oriented institutions to promote
and implement energy efficiency measures in China; and (b) developing a more efficient
national energy conservation information dissemination program.

Components
2.4    The project had three principal components:

2.5     An EMC demonstration (US$136.8 million appraisal estimate; US$180.8 million
actual) was designed to develop three demonstration EMCs in Beijing Municipality and
Liaoning and Shandong Provinces. All three EMCs initially adopted a full-service shared
savings model, in which the EMC provides full project service, including design,
development, finance, implementation, and supervision of energy efficiency investments in
customer facilities. The customers, also called host enterprises, bear no financial obligation
other than to pay a percentage of the actual savings to the EMC according to provisions in
                                                6


the contract during the contract period. After contract expiration, the host enterprise retains
all assets and future energy savings benefits. The implementation of the component was in
four stages:

    0   1997: Training and technical assistance on the EPC concept, establishment of the
        EMCs, and initial project preparation (the European Commission [EC] financed about
        US$1.5 million).
    0   1997-98: Intensive training and technical assistance on EMC operations and
        implementation of the first pilot projects by the EMCs (the EC financed about US$3
        million)
    e   1999-2000: Implementation of a wide variety of demonstration projects
        (GEFkounterpart fund-financed).
    0   2000-06: EMC growth, through replication of successful demonstration projects
        (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development [IBRDIkounterpart fund-
        financed)

2.6                                                     __
        Information dissemination (US $10 million appraisal estimate; US $10 million
actual) supported the development of a new system to provide information on energy
conservation projects to Chinese enterprise managers. The information being disseminated
focused on the financial results actually achieved, problems and solutions during
implementation, any impacts on main enterprise production or other key risks, and contact
information on enterprises with relevant experience.

2.7     Program Management and Monitoring (US$4 million appraisal estimate; US$4
million actual). A Project Management Office (PMO) was created with two units: the Energy
Management Company Development Unit for promoting and assisting the creation of new
EMCs by domestic or international investors; and the Project Management Unit to provide
training, technical assistance, and operational support for the above two project components.

Project Implementation
2.8     The PMO was established to oversee project preparation and implementation. It was
chaired and partially staffed by the Department of Resource Savings and Comprehensive
Utilization of the State Economic and Trade Commission. The Commission was abolished in
2003, and relevant departments were merged into National Development and Reform
Commission (NDRC). This organizational restructuring partially contributed to a two-year
delay in the implementation of the information dissemination component. The GEF grant
was extended for one year to allow this component to be fully implemented.

2.9      Two midterm reviews were undertaken. During the first review (2000), investment
plans of the three EMCs from 2001-05 were downscaled by about two-thirds to develop more
realistic goals compared to the overly optimistic investment plans initially prepared by the
EMCs and accepted by the Bank. The schedule for year-by-year energy savings and carbon
emission reduction were also revised to reflect the one-year delay in starting project
implementation, which had been caused by the delays in arranging counter-guarantees and
establishing disbursement systems.
                                               7


2.10 During the second mid-term review (2002), the business plans of the three EMCs for
the remainder of the project implementation period (2003-06) were revised downward again.
The outcome targets on energy savings (13 million tce) and C02 emissions reduction (33.73
million tons), which were determined based on the original investment business plans, were
significantly downscaled to 5.22 million tce and 13.82 million tons, respectively. It was
determined, however, that all the GEF and IBRD funds would still be fully utilized. The
Region did not seek Board approval for the revised outcome targets as required by BP 13.05
(see paragraph 5.1).

2.1 1 The one-year delay in project implementation partially contributed to the failure in
meeting original outcome targets. But more importantly, both the Bank team and the
Chinese counterpart did not fully acknowledge the existing market and institutional barriers
that would constrain the growth of the EPC business, and set unrealistic targets at appraisal.
This will be discussed in detail in the Relevance section.

Costs and Financing
2.12 The project's total costs were estimated during appraisal at US$150.8 million. Actual
project costs amounted to US$194.8 million and were financed as shown in Table 1. The
project was co-financed by EC and GEF following the chronology below:

2.13 In 1997, an EC grant of US$4.5 million was made effective to support the initial
formation of EMCs and an information dissemination center. An average of US$l -1 million
was provided to each EMC to support some 8-12 EPC pilot projects.

2.14 From 1999 to 2000, a GEF grant partially financed demonstration projects, especially
projects in new subsectors or with new variations in contractual design. The GEF's
participation provided a critical source of risk coverage to the EMC shareholders to start
untried businesses.

2.15 Starting in 2000, the IBRD loans were onlent to the EMCs on commercial terms, to
finance replication of successful demonstration projects on a large scale and to support EMC
growth as commercial businesses.

2.16 The amount of EMC funds invested in energy conservation was considerably
expanded, contributing to the overall increase of the project cost. As EMCs gradually
intensified capital strength, they became more self-sustaining in developing energy saving
businesses. After 2002, EMC own-financing accounted for more than 60 percent of all
energy conservation investment.

3. Monitoring and Evaluation
3.1    Design. The project's key performance indicators were: (i) energy savings achieved
per year from project investments; and (b) associated reductions in the growth of C02
emissions. Although they focused on the most important aspects, these indicators did not
cover the project's development objectives fully, because the objectives also included the
reductions in other pollutants.

3.2    As a demonstration investment, the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) should
have also included provisions for measuring sector-level demonstration effect. This
measurement could have been used to quantify benefits resulting from the dissemination of
the EPC model so as to better assess to what extent the project contributed to achieving its
energy efficiency and emissions reduction objective (see further discussion on this point in
paragraph 5.5.)

3.3    It is commendable that the project M&E was designed to support the preparation of
the proposed Phase I1 EMC expansion. The Program Management and Monitoring
Component included evaluation of the implementation results, assessment of the lessons
learned, and identification of issues requiring further solution. Phase I1 efforts would build on
the evaluation and assessment of the implementation experience of the Phase I project.

3.4     Implementation. During project implementation, the PMO commissioned third-party
post evaluation of 67 subprojects carried out by the EMCs and organized onsite inspections
of 50 projects by expert teams. The PMO also requested that each EMC provide financial
reports and M&E data on each demonstration subproject biannually.
                                                      9


3.5     Based on the M&E reports, the PMO developed a valuable database on energy
efficiency investment. By the project's closing date, the PMO had prepared a large volume
(900 pages) of case studies of energy conservation projects by Chinese EMCs, which was
published by the China Economic Publishing House in 2006. It contains performance data
on 357 EPC subprojects which were peer-reviewed and confirmed by outside experts.

3.6    For the information dissemination component, the M&E involved third-party
assessments of the energy saving and emissions reduction achieved. The assessments were
based on three national surveys, and followed the methodology used in United Kingdom's
information dissemination programs.

3.7     The PPAR identifies two shortcomings that undermine the reliability of the M&E
Data. First, some subprojects reported deemedhtipulated energy savings that did not involve
actual measurements. Because no coherent monitoring and verification protocol had been
adopted in China, the methodology these subprojects used to estimate energy savings was not
standard or consistently matched to the risk of each particular energy efficiency technology.
As a result, the reported data might not provide rigorous evidence of outcomes.

3.8      Second, in the case of carbon savings monitoring, a carbon coefficient of power
consumption (0.2268 tons of carbon [t-c] / Megawatt hour [MWh]) was determined based on
the statistics of the national power structure in 1999, and was used to convert the amount of
                                                            .~
energy savings to the associated emissions r e d ~ c t i o nConsidering the considerable variation
that exists between enterprises and the likely changes in generation mix, fuel efficiency, and
transmission and distribution efficiency over time, a simple coefficient without time and
regional differentiation was hardly likely to produce accurate results. More efforts could have
been devoted to develop a better set of coefficients that would have provided more
convincing evidence.

3.9      Utilization. The EMCs have regularly monitored and reported investment outcomes,
which served as useful inputs for adjusting business plans. The EPC performance data
collected and disseminated by the PMO and the information dissemination center were used
to attract greater government support and private investments. Based on three surveys
conducted with various stakeholders, the difficulty of obtaining commercial loans and the
lack of EMC business skills were recognized as two barriers, and corresponding solutions
were built into the Phase I1 project. The surveys also provided important market feedback as
to which information dissemination methods provided the best results. After the first survey,
in particular, the information dissemination center adjusted its allocation of time and
resources among different dissemination methods.

3.10 Finally, being the first EMC project in China, the project produced valuable lessons
for financing energy efficiency investment in other developing countries. These lessons were
well documented and exploited in related studies and p r o j e ~ t s . ~


3. PMO 2002.
4. The lessons were summarized in Taylor and others (2008). The relevant project is the The Three-Country
Energy Efficiency Project, which aimed to substantially increase investments in energy efficiency by the
                                                      10


3.1 1 The overall quality of project M&E is rated substantial based on modest for design
and substantial for implementation and utilization.

4. Relevance of Objectives and Design
4.1      The stated PDO was substantially relevant to both government and Bank strategies
at the time. The 1997 Bank Country Assistance Strategy for China emphasized increasing
energy efficiency as a key means of increasing energy supply and safeguarding the
environment.

4.2     The GEO was also consistent with Operational Program #6 of the GEF operational
strategy for climate change. One of the long-term mitigation measures of that program is to
remove the barriers to energy conservation and energy efficiency.

4.3    The project objectives remain substantially relevant at the time of the evaluation. The
Government's 1lth Five-Year Plan calls for China's energy intensity per unit of GDP to be
reduced by 20 percent from 2005 to 20 10. An amended Energy Conservation Law enacted on
April 1, 2008, puts conservation at the top of China's energy development strategy.

4.4     The project also supports the current Bank Country Partnership Strategy (2006-10).
The third pillar of that strategy is to manage resource scarcity and environmental challenges.
In addition, the GEO is fully consistent with GEF-4's Focal Area Strategies and Strategic
Programming (October 2007), wherein GEF aims to promote energy-efficient technologies
and practices in the industrial, manufacturing, appliance, and building sectors.

4.5     The design of an EMC demonstration component was simple and well focused on
introducing EPC model as a way to overcome some key market barrierdfailures to energy
conservation, including lack of awareness of energy efficiency, lack of access to appropriate
technology and financing, high transaction costs, and perceived high technical risk.
Specifically, all three EMCs supported by the project initially adopted a full-service shared
savings model, in which customers bear no financial obligation other than to pay a
percentage of the actual savings to the EMC over a specified period. The EMCs arrange for
project financing, and customize a turnkey service required to implement an energy
efficiency project at the customer facility. Such a contracting arrangement not only reduces
clients' costs of adapting existing process of production and/or of learning about a new
technology, but minimizes the perceived uncertainty of futbre benefits.

4.6     The project had a well-planned sequence of financing: an EC seed grant, followed by
GEF "start-up" funding and IBRD "expansion" financing, which was directed toward
projects that had established an initial track record of operational success. The coordinated
sequencing of donor funding was successful and important for the government and the Bank
to reduce the risks of venturing into a new market.



domestic fmancial sectors in Brazil, China, and India. The project was a partnership among the World Bank,
the United Nations Environment Program, and institutions in Brazil, China, and India.

4.7      Although the introduction of the EPC mechanism provided an innovative instrument
to promote energy efficiency investments, at the time of project preparation, several
institutional and market barriers existed that tended to undermine the effectiveness of
performance contracting. These barriers included the lack of regulatory oversight, lack of
market incentive for the private sector, and principal-agent problem in the public sector.
These risks appeared to be significant at project appraisal but were less of an issue in later
stages due to more stringent Government regulation on energy conservation, increasingly
higher energy costs, as well as adjusted incentives of the state-owned enterprises. While
these risks were not fully acknowledged when the three demonstration companies
enthusiastically adopted stretch targets in their investment plans and associated energy
savings, the targets were eventually achieved with improved regulatory and market
conditions. The overall relevance of project design is rated substantial.

4.8     Information dissemination is critically important for generating sufficient awareness
among investors and energy end-users regarding the existence and profitability of energy
saving opportunities. However, the information dissemination component was designed to
target only the enterprise managers. In retrospect, the lack of information and educational
programs for financiers was a missed opportunity to increase awareness of the EMC industry
and efficiency investment within the domestic banking sector. While a decade has passed
since the launch of the project, the banks' unfamiliarity with industrial energy conservation
practices still imposes a challenging obstacle for the financing of energy conservation
investment.' It is commendable that the follow-up Bank projects, the China Energy
Efficiency Financing, were designed to address the issues.

4.9     The overall rating for project relevance is substantial based on substantial ratings
for the objectives and the design.

5. Efficacy
5.1    Both the stated PDO and GEO were to improve the efficiency of energy use in the
People's Republic of China and facilitate reductions in C02 emissions and other pollutants
through energy efficiency investments within the territory of the Borrower. The project did
successfully introduce and demonstrate the EPC concept. Investments of the three pilot
EMCs saved 5.92 million tce in energy, and reduced C02 by 18.55 million tons by the end of
2006. Energy savings and emissions reduction from other EPC projects outside the project
were higher: in 2006 year alone, these projects resulted in project life-cycle energy savings of
18.7 million tce, and C02 emissions reductions of 49 million tons. Although direct energy
savings and emissions reduction from the three EMCs fell short of meeting the targets set at
appraisal, results achieved outside the project due to EMC demonstration exceeded
expectations.6The Information Dissemination Component is estimated to indirectly have

 The targets were revised downward during the second midterm review but not submitted to the Board for
approval, per Bank guidelines (BP13.05, July 2001). Thus, the project will need to be assessed against the
original project targets.
                                                         12


helped save 27.2 million tce and reduced C02 emissions by 70.8 million tons, both outcomes
exceeding the targets. The overall efficacy is rated substantial.

5.2    The achievements of the project are assessed by outcomes and outputs in detail
below.

Energy efficiency and reduction in C02 emissions.

5.3    For EMC demonstration, by the end of 2006, the energy efficiency investments
financed under the project realized 5.92 million tons of standard coal equivalent (tce) energy
savings and associated reductions of 18.55 million tons of C O Z . ~

5.4     In addition, the project also had a considerable demonstration effect (see paragraphs
5.9-5.13), and the energy savings and emissions reduction achieved through the scale-up of
the Chinese EMC industry is much higher than those directly resulting from the investment
of the three pilot EMCs. Based on a comprehensive survey undertaken by EMCA and the
PMO, investments from EPC projects totaled about $280 million in 2006 alone, of which the
three demonstration EMCs accounted only about 11%. These investments resulted in project
life-cycle energy savings of 21.1 million tce, and C02 emissions reductions of 55.05 million
tons. The overall achievement of the EMC demonstration may well exceed the original
energy savings target of 13.O million tce and associated reductions in the carbon emissions of
18.55 million tons.*

5.5     The information dissemination center developed 100 Energy Conservation Case
Studies and 20 Energy Conservation Technical Guidelines, and delivered more than 200,000
energy conservation materials by the end of 2006. The center also developed a Web site, an
inquiry service, a system of dissemination meetings, a network of energy efficiency experts,
and an expanding relationship with media organizations.

5.6     To estimate the energy and C02 savings impact of the information dissemination
center, three surveys were conducted by a third-party agency. The agency randomly selected
10,000 enterprises for telephone interviews. Of the interviewed enterprises 18.7 percent
indicated having conducted energy conservation investment, among which 6.2 percent
attributed investment decisions to the center's information dissemination efforts. The
enterprises also provided detailed information on the amount of energy saving, total
investment, and payback period for the investment. Based on the survey results, total energy
and C02 emission saved were then estimated according to the energy conservation measures
adoption rate, the average energy saved from a conservation investment, and the total number
of enterprises in major energy consuming industries. The PMO reported that as of the end of
June 2007, the estimated cumulative energy savings associated with the information
dissemination center was 27.2 million tce, as compared to the target of 24.3 million tce set at
appraisal. The associated COZemission reduction was 70.8 million tons versus the target of

                                              13


63 million tons. Considering the large sample size and the fact that the samples were selected
randomly, the results appear credible.

Introducing, demonstrating, and disseminating new project financing concepts and
market-oriented institutions

5.7     Development and growth of three demonstration EMCs. During the course of the
project, the three pilot EMCs experienced strong and continued development. Their growth
was measured by the amount of investment conducted and the returns on investments.
According to the PMO, by the end of 2006, the three EMCs had carried out 475 performance
contracts with a total investment of more than RMB 1.5 billion. The average financial return
from these projects across the three EMCs exceeded 20 percent and the rate of project
failures overall was only one percent. The three EMCs have made net profits of RMB 0.48
billion (net profits of clients were 8 -10 times that of EMCs) and broadened their equity base
about nine-fold (from RMB 86 million in 1997 to an estimated RMB 757 million in 2006).

5.8     Project Demonstration Effects and Proliferation of EPCs in China:The project had a
considerable demonstration effect, as the rapid development of the three pilot EMCs verified
the financial viability of EPC projects in China and generated significant interest among
Chinese investors. The mechanism is now being disseminated and replicated by many other
companies across the country.

5.9     During the implementation period of the project, the EMC industry had experienced
triple-digit growth. As of the end of 2003 (before the launch of the Phase I1 project), the
                                                 14


EMCA reported that there were 59 operating EMCs. The total investment value reached
US$85 million.'

5.10 In 2007, a core of about 40 to 50 well-established EMCs who had fully mastered the
concept of EPC were operating in China, while the total number of companies reporting
experience with at least one EPC exceeded 400 (EMCA 2008). See Figures 4 and 5 for the
year-by-year growth of EMC business.

5.1 1 IEG Communication with the PMO, EMCA, and Beijing and Shandong EMCs
confirmed that the original EMCs played an important role in demonstrating and adapting the
EPC concept to the Chinese market. The operation of the three EMCs generated considerable
experience and expertise and numerous examples of how to market EMC services, evaluate a
profitable energy saving project, measure and verify energy savings, and solve specific tax
and/or legal issues. The pilot EMCs contributed to numerous technical training workshops
and dissemination courses, and received onsite visits from domestic investors, and investors
from India, Mongolia, and Brazil.

5.12 From 2001 to 2005, the United Kingdom's Department for International
Development supported, through the Bank's Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy
Program, a comprehensive program of training and technical assistance for new EMCs. The
training program, which was built on the expertise of the three EMCs, had trained more than
1,000 people, many of whom started their own companies after completing training.

5.13 The project also served as a "broker" to engage the State Economic and Trade
CommissiodNDRC to work with other relevant government entities in addressing tax and
legal interpretation issues raised. Because an EPC combines several economic activities,

including services, sales of equipment, and a special performance guarantee, local tax
authorities were unclear about which type of taxes should be assessed against the EMCs. In
addition, some regulatory authorities interpreted the EPCs to be financial leases, which
legally can only be undertaken by institutions licensed to operate as financial institutions.
Through proactive efforts from all parties, these issues were satisfactorily resolved. The
central government confirmed the legality of the business, and the three EMCs each chose a
corporate accounting stance that was accepted by the local auditing and taxation entities. The
IEG mission was informed that the PMO and EMCA have recently submitted a
comprehensive proposal to NDRC to reform the tax code for the EPC business, which would
benefit all other EMCs in the industry.

5.14 Limitations. Despite the rapid growth of EPC business, IEG identified two major
market and institutional barriers that have constrained the scale-up of the EMC industry in
China: financing constraints for EMCs and the high risk of counterpart breach of contract.
This is discussed in detail in a later section.

5.15 Regarding the project demonstration effect, the IEG mission found that although
Shanghai is an active zone for EMC development, where about 140 EMC companies have
been established since 2001, the project had limited impact in Shanghai.

6. Efficiency
6.1     The economic return of the subprojects that the EMC conducted compares well with
other similar energy efficiency investments. In the United States, the highest return on energy
conservation project saved approximately 14,100 Btu annually per dollar of capital
investment (DOE 2005), or 0.5 1 tce per thousand dollars of investment. That is 65 times
lower than the average return under this project (Table 4). This suggests that with lower
capital cost and higher potential for improving efficiency, China enjoys a much lower
marginal cost of energy conservation.

6.2     IEG analysis also shows that the three EMCs have made investments in product lines
that over time yielded larger energy and emission savings per unit of capital investment.
From 1997 to 2006, the annual energy savings per dollar invested increased from 17.95 tce to
44.39 tce, whereas the abatement cost per ton of C02 emissions was reduced from
US$l1.22/ton to US$ - 6.00/ton." This may result from the EMCs being more selective in
energy saving technologies and practices, and because more subprojects targeting coal or oil
consumption reduction were undertaken.




lo As explained in note 2 of Table 4, a negative marginal cost for C 0 2 abatement means that the economic
value of energy savings exceeds the value of investments needed for C 0 2emissions reduction.

a. Investments are based on the year the energy performance contract is signed. These figures do not include
the full savings resulting from the project; they account for accumulated savings from the date the contract was
signed until June 30, 2008.
b. Energy savings could be viewed as a coproduct of reducing COSemissions. To estimate the marginal
abatement cost of C02 emissions reduction, the economic value of energy saving is deducted from the total
investment cost. The PPAR uses the global economic monitor suggested coal prices to calculate the economic
benefits associated with the energy savings, which is then deducted from the total investment cost. The negative
costs of COZemissions reduction underline the fact that energy efficiency investment could be a win-win solution
for global climate change mitigation.


6.3    The Implementation Completion Report (ICR) reported the economic rates of return
(ERR) of the EMC's subprojects ranging from 36 to 168 percent, with the average ERR at 78
percent. The financial rate of return of the EMCs based on the net annual cash flow from
operations net of all equity infusions is 17.6 percent per year in real terms. 11

6.4     The ICR reported that ERR was estimated based on a sample of 357 best performing
projects, which were not exclusively the result of support by the three EMCS.'~Furthermore,
the ICR economic analysis was based solely on energy savings. Because the project is
considered as emissions abatement initiative, environmental benefits should have been
factored into the economic analysis. The PPAR reassessed the ERR based on 339 projects
carried out by the three EMCs whose data are available to IEG. These projects accounted for
all subproject financed by GEF grant and IBRD loan during the course of the project. IEG re-
estimated the ERR based on reported subproject investment, the amount of energy savings,
and C02 emissions reduction. The rate of US$6 per ton was used to estimate the economic
value of COz abatement. Assuming energy efficient equipment on average lasts for at least 9


1 1. The huge difference between ERR and financial rate of return does not suggest price distortion because both
analyses rely on actual market prices; the value of the external benefits, such as environmental benefits, was not
included in the ERR analysis. The difference is partly due to the fact that the financial rate of return only
estimates the value recouped by the EMCs, while ERR also includes the benefits to host enterprises.
12
   The 357 projects were selected fkom 1,000 projects based on the following criteria: (a) the projects were
carried out based on the EPC mechanism; (b) the projects' energy saving/economic benefits were confmed by
both EMCs and end-users; (c) the projects applied technologies that were proven and reliable; and (d) the
projects have large potential to be replicated (PMO 2006).

years, the corresponding ERRs with and without C02 benefits are 50 percent and 58 percent,
respectively (see Table 5).

6.5    There are a couple of caveats with the IEG calculation of ERRs that may have
underestimated the ERRs of the EMC subprojects. These caveats are:

    0   The ERR was calculated without adjustment of the output effect. Many of the energy
        efficiency technology options involve output effects such that - in spite of increased
        energy efficiency per unit of output - the total output and the accompanied emissions
        of the enterprise increase because of income and price effects. The ERR of output-
        value-increasing project will be underestimated without output adjustments.

   0    The ERR estimation only included initial capital investments, without taking into
        account project operating and maintenance costs. Because retrofitted facilities usually
        cost less to operate and maintain, the ERR was likely to have been distorted
        downward.

6.6   Annex D estimates the ERR of a green lighting subproject, addressing the two biases
mentioned above.

6.7     These analyses point to the high efficiency of the EMCs subprojects. The efficiency
is therefore rated high. However, it is important to note that the reported ERR results only
apply to the individual subprojects. The EMCs' administrative expenses, which were not
separately reported, were excluded from the calculation. The overall project ERR factoring
into the overhead costs would still be over 50 percent with C02 abatement benefits.

7. Outcome
7.1     The project outcome rating is satisfactory, based on project sub-ratings of
substantial for relevance and efficacy, and high for efficiency. Overall, the project
demonstrated the financial viability of what was initially a completely unknown concept.
Judging by the number of new entrants in the market and the program's impact on changes in
the tax code and other regulations that improved the business environment, its impact may
have gone far beyond the foreseen parameters in its design.

8. Risk to Development Outcome
8.1    The risk to the project's development outcome is rated negligible to low. With the
rapid development of EMC business, the EPC mechanism has been recognized as an
important instrument to help achieve China's energy conservation goals. In March 2007, the
State Council called for accelerated development of the EMC industry. In Shanghai, the
municipal government mandates energy audits for all enterprises, subsidizes EMCs to
undertake diagnoses to identify energy saving opportunities, and rewards EMCs RMB
300/tce of energy savings for the first year of the EPC project.13

8.2     A series of Bank follow-up projects has also been developed to scale up EMC
business in order to improve energy efficiency, including the Energy Efficiency Financing
and the Provincial Energy Efficiency Scale-up Projects. Annex B provides brief descriptions
of these projects.

8.3    At the industry level, a wider range of EMC business models is being developed,
including shared savings contracts, guaranteed savings contracts, outsourcing of energy
system management (such as commercial buildings, hospitals, hotels, and market), and
combinations of all three. Guaranteed savings and outsourcing are more sustainable for the
growth of EMC industry because clients shoulder the financing responsibility.

9. Bank Performance
9.1     Quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The Bank introduced an innovative approach
to stimulate greater private sector participation. It adopted a learning-by-doing approach of
staging the creation of a new business line through pilots, demonstration, operation,
dissemination, and a follow-on project. Despite the underestimation of some of the existing
market and institutional barriers at project appraisal, the Bank team did attempt to manage
the risks by successfully mobilizing co-financing and collaboration among donors, which
was particularly important in addressing barriers to venturing into a new market.

9.2     During project implementation, the Bank maintained a sustained dialogue with
government and business stakeholders. Communicating with all levels is crucial for
understanding concerns of the EMCs and for obtaining government support. For example, the
Bank emphasized, in a timely manner, the urgency on the issue of tax treatment and legal
interpretation of an EPC, which contributed to quick resolutions to the issue. In addition, to
ensure efficient implementation, the Bank showed flexibility in adjusting project
implementation. For example, although prior approval for all EMC subprojects was initially
required, the Bank team waived prior review requirements for some project lines once the
EMCs had gained adequate technical expertise and experience.

9.3     The Chinese authorities and industry practitioners highly appreciated the leadership
role played by the Bank. The borrower expressed its satisfaction with the way the Bank

carried out its responsibilities on many occasions during the IEG mission. The quality of
supervision is rated satisfactory.

9.4    While there was a procedural shortcoming related to the noncompliance with the
requirement to formally seek Board approval for revising key associated outcome targets, the
overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

lo*Borrower Performance
10.1 The performance of both the borrower and the implementing agency is rated
satisfactory. The government's commitment to the project's PDO and GEO was a key factor
in the positive outcomes throughout the design and implementation stages. The municipal
and provincial governments concerned (Beijing, Liaoning, Shandong) were also proactively
involved in establishing the EMCs. For example, both the central and provincial governments
collaborated to resolve initial difficulties in arranging counter-guarantees for the Bank loan
and setting up disbursement systems. Another example is the study on the tax treatment of
the EMCs, which was mobilized by the concerned government agencies and instrumental in
reaching agreements with provincial tax bureaus. The government was also responsive in
issuing new policies, regulations, and instructions to support energy conservation.

 10.2 The adaptation of the EPC concept to the Chinese market, and the development of
these new types of commercial companies have not been easy. This process would not have
been possible without the intensive efforts and resilient support from the PMO that helped
address many hurdles and challenges encountered. The three EMCs were proactive and
creative in creating contracts that suit the Chinese market and had developed a unique mix of
technical, financial risk assessment and management, and business marketing skills to ensure
the companies' long-term success.

11. Lessons and Outlook
11.1 Although the growth of the EMC business has been impressive, the scale of the
industry remains small compared to the needs and potential of energy conservation in China.
In 2007, the China EMC-deployed energy efficiency investment amounted to US$889
million, whereas the projected energy efficiency investment in China could reach as high as
US$l 1 billion per year according to EMCA estimates. By comparison, although the energy
intensity of the United States is smaller than that of China,14the annual investment of the US
Energy Service Companies market is approximately $2.5 billion (NAESC 2007).

11.2 The IEG mission identified two major market and institutional barriers that
constrained a wider-scale implementation of the EMC business:

        Limited financing constitutes a major constraint to more aggressive and
        sustained growth of EPC business. There are various reasons for the shortfall in
        financing. Lack of experience in dealing with investors on the part of EMCs is one

14. According to the US Energy Information Administration, China's energy intensity is about 13,780 Btu per
US.dollars in 2006, compared to 8,840 in the United States.
                                             20


       reason, but more issues seem to be related to the general impediments for small- and
       medium-size enterprises to access finance in China. Most of the Chinese EMCs are
       small start-ups, with registered capital ranging between US$35,000 and $600,000.
       Because of the EMCs' small size, Chinese domestic banks have generally been
       unwilling to lend. This phenomenon, although common to all small- and medium-size
       enterprises in China, has especially restricted the EMCs' potential growth. This is
       because executing EMC business usually requires a substantial working capital to
       support the up-front tax obligation, project financing, and project construction and
       commissioning before finally generating revenues through client payments. The
       follow-up phase I1 project has created a guarantee fund for EMCs, aiming to engage
       the Chinese financing community as the key financier for EMCs. The IFC CHUEE
       Program provided bank guarantees to energy efficiency loans, as well as technical
       assistance to stimulate energy efficiency lending in China. However, the IEG mission
       discovered that financing difficulty still remains as the biggest obstacle. The IEG
       evaluation on the CHUEE program (IEG, 2010) also recognizes that one of the main
       challenges that smaller companies continue to face is access to finance for energy
       efficiency investments.

       Lack of contract enforceability remains a fundamental challenge to EPC market
       development. In a business environment where trust and long-term relationship are
       more emphasized than the enforceability of the contact, EMCs usually incur huge
       administrative costs to secure creditworthy customers. The high risk of counterpart
       breach of contract, both in terms of collection of repayment and verification of energy
       savings, increases the investment hurdle rate. Anecdotal evidence suggests that
       companies are far more cautious about the counterpart risk that is inherent in
       performance contracting and willing to forgo business opportunities if the perceived
       contractual risks are too high. In fact, the IEG mission discovered that both Beijing
       and Shandong EMCs have turned away from the original "full-service" shared-
       savings model in order to minimize client credit risk. The Beijing EMC now focuses
       on developing outsourcing of energy system management EPC, whereas the
       Shangdong EMC was reorganized into a financial leasing company.

11.3 To address the challenges for the future development of the EPC business in China,
the PPAR identified several strategies for all parties involved.

Future Outlook
       STRATEGIES
BORROWER

11.4 To meet the large market potential for energy efficiency in China, it is important for
the EMC industry and the government to work collaboratively to remove several market and
policy barriers. The EMCs need to enhance technical skills to provide more comprehensive
                                                        21


service packages and to secure project financing. The government must establish financial
and contract enforcement policies to address financing and client creditworthiness issues.l5

BANKSTRATEGIES

11.5 The Bank has been persistent in promoting the EPC mechanism in China, including
provisions for only supporting EPC-type subprojects. Although such a narrow focus has been
paramount for the success of the project, the choice of business models would be best
determined by market conditions, by financing practices and systems, and by the institutional
environment. To meet the ends of improving energy efficiency investment, a variety of
approaches could tried, such as direct energy efficiency lending to small-and-medium-size
enterprises, energy utility demand-side management, technical assistance to domestic banks,
and so on. It is commendable that the follow-up Bank projects, such as China Energy
Efficiency Financing, are moving in this direction.

EMC INDUSTRY
           STRATEGIES

 11.6 New Sectors and Product Lines. The EPC market is dominated by industrial
customers and focused quite narrowly on energy saving concepts. The industrial sector
represents 97 percent of the total investment for Shandong EMC and 82.5 percent for the
Liaoning EMC. The Beijing EMC is an exception, for which the building sector constitutes
75 percent of investment. At the industry level, 63.1 percent of the EMC revenues in 2008
were attributable to the industrial sector market segment, and 33.4 percent and 3.5 percent
were attributable to building and transportation sectors, respectively. Although industry is
the largest energy consumer in China, other sectors, especially heating and cooling in the
housin sector, have enormous potential for energy savings (McKinsey Global Institute
2008).' The EMCs may wish to consider identifying a broader range of energy efficiency
investments across the sectors to capture the rich energy-saving opportunities in the
economy.

11.7 Single versus Bundled Projects. The EMCs usually focus on certain product lines
instead of conducting comprehensive energy audits to identify all the feasible improvements
that will save energy at the facility. As a result, the scope of energy savings was narrower.
The literature suggests that bundledcomprehensive projects that optimize energy through a
series of improvements tend to achieve an overall greater gain in dollar and /or energy

15. In its effort to spur the development of the local EMC industry, the Shanghai municipal government has
taken some cutting-edge initiatives. .An interministerial committee, Shanghai EMC Director Committee, chaired
by the vice mayor, was established. The committee sponsors a third-party evaluation on both the technical risk
and the creditworthiness of the client for each EPC project. The municipal- or district-level government also
works directly with guarantee agencies and local banks to ensure viable financing to EPC projects (conversation
with Shanghai Economic and Trade Commission, Shanghai Energy Conservation Supervision Center, the EMC
Committee of Shanghai Energy Conservation Association and the office of Shanghai EMC Supervision
Committee, April 22,2009).


 16. Heating and cooling of commercial and residential buildings constitutes 20 percent of the total energy
consumption. According to Chou Baoxing, Vice Minister of Construction, using highly efficient energy
technology to transform existing buildings may save about RMB 600 billion (US$SO.tibillion) each year.
                                                  22


savings. (DOE 2005). Of the 357 PMO documented projects, only 3 are this kind.
Furthermore, large enterprises usually prefer a systematic approach to maintain the reliability
of manufacturing process rather than changing one production process based on one single
technology. l 7 The single-project approach risks losing an important segment of the clients.

Lessons
1 1.8   The main lessons emerging from this assessment are as follows:

    0   EPCs require quick implementation and closure, so it is important for the Bank's
        procurement procedures to be flexible to provide the quick response necessary to get
        the private sector involved in the EMC business.
    0   For an energy efficiency project to succeed, it is important to engage government
        officials across ministries in practical and operationally focused dialogues to address
        specific implementation challenges, such as regulatory instruments, financial
        incentives, and provision of information.
    0   Although EPCs are meant to be a market solution for energy efficiency, in a
        transitional economy like China, strong government support is crucial for the market
        to deliver successful results. In the case of the Energy Conservation Project, the
        Government's policies, regulations and instructions on reducing energy intensity had
        been important drivers of the expansion of the EMC business.
    0   Strong country ownership requires adapting the project to the country-specific
        context. Bank-generated ideas work best when they are appropriately adapted to
        country circumstances. In the case of the Energy Conservation Project, the
        Government had adjusted tax treatment and legal interpretation of EMCs, thereby
        creating an enabling environment for the dissemination of the EPC concept in China.

Annex D. Estimation of a Subproject Economic Rate of
Return
(Green Lighting Project in Dafa Zhengda Chicken Company)
As discussed in the main report, the ERR estimation is biased downward with output effect
and without counting operation and maintenance costs. In this Annex, the ERR of a green
lighting project documented as one of the 357 EMC projects selected by the PMO (PMO
2006, P.487) was estimated, taking into account the two issues mentioned above.

In this case, the Beijing EMC used 3,095 9-w CFL bulbs to replace 1,600 40-w incandescent
bulbs for Dafa Zhengda Chicken Farm, where the lighting system was used 14 hours a day
for 270 days. The initial investment on the CFL bulbs was RMB 949,000. The electricity
shadow price was RMB 0.71 /kWh.

We assume that an incandescent bulb produces 22 lumens/watt and lasts for 1,890 hours and
a CFL bulb produces 100 lumendwatt and lasts for 11,340 hours. The new lighting system
can be used for 3 years and produces a lighting level that equals to 3,165 40-w incandescent
bulbs. To adjust for the scale effect, we assume that total lighting output with the project will
be used in substitution for production that would have occurred in the sector without the
project and that such production would have occurred with the old lighting efficiency.
Suppose the purchase price for a 40-w incandescent bulb is RMB 2.

Finally, using the carbon reduction coefficient used by the PMO, assume that for every MWh
of energy used, an average of 0.2268 ton of carbon is emitted into the air.

The annual energy consumption of the Chicken Farm's lighting system with and without the
project is shown in Table Al. The annual cash flow of the project is shown in Table A2. The
subproject ERR without and with COz abatement benefits is 302 percent and 303 percent,
respectively.
