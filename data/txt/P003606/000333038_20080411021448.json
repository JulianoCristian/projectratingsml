Conservation\n            Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory and for original global environment objectives\n            (GEO) were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            low or negligible and for GEO was low or negligible, the\n            Bank performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            consistent central government support was critical for the\n            success of the project. Without this steady support, the\n            project will have likely floundered when faced with the many\n            regulatory and 'system adaptation' issues that\n            arose during the first 4-5 years. Government support\n            provided necessary legitimacy to the emerging new\n            businesses. Provincial government support also was\n            important. Flexibility and adaptability were crucial in the\n            design of such a project that introduces new concepts and\n            practices. Application of the basic EPC concepts evolved and\n            changed substantially through the piloting phases, with the\n            end results becoming unique for application in Chinese\n            market conditions and in line with Chinese business\n            conventions. With very little multilateral development bank\n            experience in developing such an investment project to use\n            as a guide post, it also was important to have flexibility\n            to make adjustments in the operation of the project itself."}, "docdt": "2007-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
