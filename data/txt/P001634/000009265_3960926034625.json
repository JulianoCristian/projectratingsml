With that in\n            mind, the project includes improvement and rehabilitation of\n            roads in Malawi and Tanzania; construction of dry-cargo and\n            fuel storage transshipment facilities in Dar es Salaam and\n            Mbeya in Tanzania; provision of fuel tank wagons  and tank\n            containers to be used by Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority\n            (TAZARA) railway.  Further to this, the project provides for\n            improvement of shipping services on Lake Malawi;\n            construction of a border post and weighing station on the\n            Malawi-Tanzania border; and related consultancies and\n            technical assistance.  The project will benefit the entire\n            population of Malawi through lower prices on a wide variety\n            of imported products and through increased exports brought\n            about by more competitive export prices."}, "docdt": "1988-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
