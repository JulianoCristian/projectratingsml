for Malawian imports and\n            exports by improving the Northern Transport Corridor (NTC)\n            leading from southern Malawi to the port of Dar es Salaam.\n            The project also seeks to facilitate the expansion of\n            regional trade, principally between Malawi and Tanzania and\n            help develop Malawi's northern region.  With that in\n            mind, the project includes improvement and rehabilitation of\n            roads in Malawi and Tanzania; construction of dry-cargo and\n            fuel storage transshipment facilities in Dar es Salaam and\n            Mbeya in Tanzania; provision of fuel tank wagons  and tank\n            containers to be used by Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority\n            (TAZARA) railway.  Further to this, the project provides for\n            improvement of shipping services on Lake Malawi;\n            construction of a border post and weighing station on the\n            Malawi-Tanzania border; and related consultancies and\n            technical assistance.  The project will benefit the entire\n            population of Malawi through lower prices on a wide variety\n            of imported products and through increased exports brought\n            about by more competitive export prices."}, "docdt": "1988-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
