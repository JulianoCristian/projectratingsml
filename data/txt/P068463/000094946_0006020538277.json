The project\n            expands access to and improves the quality of services that\n            address young children's basic needs. There are five\n            project components. The first improves child health by\n            providing on-the-job and pre-service training to health\n            workers and caregivers; financing drugs, medical equipment,\n            and supplies and strengthening procurement, storage, and\n            distribution mechanisms; promoting adoption of healthy\n            practices such as breastfeeding and the correct treatment of\n            infections; using environmental health interventions to\n            control childhood illnesses; and improving communications\n            for behavioral change; The second component builds\n            capacities for families and communities for improving the\n            nutritional and health status of children, by reducing\n            micro- and macro-nutrient deficiency and improving food\n            security; and builds capacity within ministries to implement\n            the nutrition component. The third component improves\n            quality and access to early childhood education, and\n            institutional capacity at all administrative levels. The\n            fourth component strengthens the traditional safety nets for\n            child care and protection through community-based\n            reintegration and pycho-social support for orphans. Beside\n            supporting the over-all management of the multi-sectoral\n            program, the fifth component funds advocacy and\n            sensitization campaigns and establishes an innovation fund."}, "docdt": "2000-05-15T00:00:00Z"}
