   Development Project for Eritrea promotes the healthy growth\n            and holistic development of Eritrean children. The project\n            expands access to and improves the quality of services that\n            address young children's basic needs. Ratings for the\n            Education Improvement Project for Republic of Serbia were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was substantial, Bank performance was satisfactory,\n            and the Borrower performance was satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned from the project were that national ownership and\n            buy-in is important in achieving development outcomes; PMTs\n            can be functional if focused and adequately supported; it is\n            very common to underestimate the risk of insufficient\n            M&E capacity, especially in multi-sectoral,\n            decentralized operations as these require both horizontal\n            and vertical links; considering the intent of delivering an\n            integrated package of services, it would be advisable to\n            design project components around the level of\n            implementation; and formal, well coordinated partnership\n            among all the involved development partners, local and\n            international, is necessary for a successful outcome."}, "docdt": "2007-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
