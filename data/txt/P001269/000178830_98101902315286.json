The project would consist of:\n            (i) construction of 33 rural water supply schemes; (ii)\n            strengthening of MWD's operation and maintenance and\n            direct labor sections; and (iii) technical assistance for\n            implementation of the recommendations of the management\n            study aimed at strengthening MWD.
