East New Britain\n            Provincial Administration. To achieve the goals of restoring\n            social and economic wellbeing to the people of the Gazelle\n            Peninsula, the overall program and Bank-financed project\n            will support the following six components. The first\n            component, quality of life improvement in displaced\n            communities, will include: land mobilization; infrastructure\n            and utility services; social and public safety services;\n            community development; and economic support. Transportation\n            infrastructure, utility infrastructure, social services,\n            public safety, economic support, and government\n            administration reform comprise the second component,\n            Kokopo's consolidation as the provincial capital. The\n            third component, Rabaul's restoration as a regional\n            port, will deal with land management; port-related\n            infrastructure and facilities rehabilitation; and\n            restoration of essential utilities, infrastructure, and\n            public services. Utility infrastructure and social services\n            for the North Eastern Gazelle Peninsula are the fourth\n            component while the fifth is institution building for longer\n            term development planning. The final component will contain\n            design and supervision of project components for the first\n            phase of the project and design of components planned for\n            implementation during the second phase."}, "docdt": "1999-10-01T00:00:00Z"}
