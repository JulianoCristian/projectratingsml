Management Unit in accordance with this Policy.

of living adversely affected; or (ii) right, title or interest in any house, or interest

Census
A census of the affected population including an inventory of their assets lost will
be undertaken to form the basis for planning and implementation of a relocation
and compensation action plan.
The census will include all PAFs as follows:
No         Project affected persons                              Losses
Name of  Job lost  Marital  No of      Monthly       Plantation   Loss of     Access

________              ~~~~school   _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _
2 ___ _
Implementation
The census will be accompanied by information to the PAPs about the
entitlements regarding rehabilitation assistance and compensation provided by
the GoENB together with the time schedule for provision of assistance and
relocation.
Based on the census and inventory of losses, a time bound action plan with a
budget will be prepared. All compensation and relocation assistance including
assistance to find comparable jobs must be completed before the site is opened
for settlement by beneficiaries from the high risk villages.
To ensure transparency of procedures, all payments of compensation shouid be
made in the presence of the PAPs in question.
Monitoring
Progress of implementation and outcomes of the relocation and compensation
action plans will form part of the regular quarterly reporting by GRA.
