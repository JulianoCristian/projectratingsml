1      PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 After about 50 years of dormancy, two volcanoes in Rabaul, Mt. Tavurvur and Mt.
Vulcan, erupted in September1994 for the third time in 100 years. Almost all of the physical,
social, and economic infrastructure and facilities in Rabaul Town and surrounding areas were
completely destroyed, severely damaged, or ended up being located within the hazardous areas
after the eruption.

1.1.2 Deaths and injuries were relatively low (about five deaths and dozens injured) partly
because residents and officials were aware of the threat and took appropriate actions early.
However, there were significant social and economic disruptions and losses, with about 30,000
residents losing their homes and about two-thirds of them seeking permanent resettlement away
from hazardous areas. Estimates compiled by the Australian Agency for International
Development (AusAID) soon after the eruption placed public asset damage and losses at about
US$280 million, along with similar losses for private assets such as homes, businesses,
inventory, etc.

1.1.3 Both the national government (GoPNG) and the East New Britain Provincial
Administration (ENBPA) acted quickly to move people from harm's way and provide temporary
shelter and services to displaced residents. They also discouraged residents from reoccupying the
evacuated sites by implementing enforcement measures and offering incentives such as
promising to provide safer resettlement lands and to create a new town in Kokopo. Residents
were helped in demolition and storage of whatever material and belongings they could salvage
from the affected areas and those who had access to their farming plots continued to use them.
Many people continued to have their traditional burial ceremonies in Rabaul, an extremely
important sociocultural practice which the authorities continued to allow.

1.1.4 In 1995, the GoPNG commenced its Immediate Term Restoration Program (ITRP),
supported by about US$47 million from donors and lenders including AusAID, the European
Union (EU), Japan, Germany, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the World Bank (with
funds diverted from other ongoing activities). Early investments were primarily directed toward
improving the immediate socioeconomic conditions of the displaced population and planning for
longer term investments and development efforts. In light of the extensive damage to the town of
Rabaul and the continuing existence of hazardous conditions (ashfall, toxic gases, and tremors),
the national and provincial authorities decided to resettle the affected population away from the
existing town. They identified prospective areas for new permanent settlements throughout the
northeast Gazelle Peninsula and developed plans to build a replacement town at Kokopo, a small
village about 17 miles east of Rabaul.

1.1.5 To carry out this transition, the government proposed a seven-year, Medium Term
Restoration Program (MTRP) that would be implemented in two phases between 1999 and 2005.
The Bank's project appraisal document (PAD) notes that "during MTRP Phase I (1999­2002),
the primary focus will be to complete the emergency restoration works, relocate displaced
communities and provide services in and around the newly designated provincial capital at
Kokopo." The second Phase (2002­05) was to focus on continuing implementation of these


                                                1
plans and consolidation of the institutional framework for planning and executing urban/regional
development priorities with the integration of the Gazelle Restoration Authority (GRA) into the
ENBPA.

1.1.6 The Bank's Second Gazelle Restoration Project was designed as an Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) with two phases to support implementation of the MRTP by (a) helping complete
the emergency restoration works started under the ITRP and (b) facilitating the return to more
normalized development planning by the provincial government.

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1 While the project development objectives in the PAD and the loan agreement are not
identical, they are very similar. The objectives stated in the loan agreement are to "assist the
Borrower to: (i) provide to the people of the Gazelle Peninsula with government services similar
to those that were destroyed by the volcanic eruption of 1994; and (ii) ensure sustainability of
social and economic well-being and minimize adverse impacts of future volcanic eruptions on
lives, property and livelihood in the Gazelle Peninsula."

1.2.2 The PAD sometimes frames the PDO in terms of supporting the government's MTRP
program, which is essentially the same as the project, and summarizes the project's key
performance indicators (KPIs) as follows:

1.2.3 As explained later in this report, after achieving the triggers for APL2, the government
decided against implementing the second phase. This complicated the assessment of whether the
project met its end-of-project KPIs (which were also defined in qualitative rather than
quantitative terms). For the purposes of the ICR, the achievements of APL1 are measured against
the targets it was intended to achieve to trigger APL2. It is important to note that despite not
implementing APL2, the project still managed to achieve a substantial portion of the KPIs to be
achieved at the end of the second phase.

1.3    Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
  and reasons/justification

1.1.1 No revisions were made to the original PDO. However, as discussed later in the ICR,
there were three extensions to the original loan closing date and four formal restructurings. These
restructurings and extensions were required in large part because of delays and changes in
promised financing by both the counterpart and assistance from other donors and lenders, as well
as upgrading of some subcomponent designs, higher than expected bid prices, and inflation
during the implementation period. As a result, adjustments had to be made in the work program
and sequence of planned investments under APL1 as well as to the allocation of loan proceeds to
ensure continued implementation progress.

1.4        Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The PAD indicates that the APL1 benefits of "normalized basic infrastructure provision,
utility and social services" were targeted to "the population most directly affected by the
volcanic eruption including, in particular, about 19,000 displaced inhabitants."
1.5        Original Components

1.5.1 The components in the PAD and the legal agreement have slightly different names and
are organized into different subparts, but include the same investments and activities. The
subcomponents were defined in more general terms in the PAD but were described in the legal
agreement in terms of specific investments or activities. The components and subcomponents in
the PAD appear in the cost table in Annex 1 of the ICR and the ratings section of the ISRs, but
the parts of the project described in the loan agreement are used to reference disbursement
allocation categories and for loan reallocations, amendments, and restructuring.
1.5.2 Phase I (APL I), as defined in the loan agreement and discussed in the ICR, comprised
the following:
      Part A: Displaced Communities
      1. Relocation of communities displaced by the volcanic eruption in 1994, through provision
      of relocation sites, agricultural land, internal site roads, electricity, water supply, and
      sanitation.
      2. Provision of services for community development and economic support in the
      relocation sites under Part A (1) above, through agricultural extension services, improved
      access to schools, vocational and skills training, health and police services.
      3.    Resettlement and rehabilitation of Affected Persons.



                                                   3
Part B: Kokopo Town
Upgrading of Kokopo Town through: (i) restoration of the road between Rabaul Port and
Kokopo Town, (ii) restoration of the Burmah Road, (iii) restoration of roads and drains
within Kokopo Town, (iv) upgrading the solid waste disposal facilities, (v) provision of
back-up generators for essential public service facilities, (vi) upgrading facilities at the
Butuwin health center, (vii) construction of an elementary school and facility for women's
community activities, (viii) a government administration center and a commercial center, and
(ix) assessment of human waste treatment options in Kokopo Town.

Part C: Rabaul Port
1. Rehabilitation of port-related infrastructure and facilities at Rabaul Port through: (i)
restoration and upgrading of Ah Tam and Dawapia wharves, (ii) provision of erosion control,
and (iii) rehabilitation of Blanche Street and Kokopo Road and storm water drains.
2. Restoration of essential utility, infrastructure and public services at Rabaul Town/Port,
through: (i) rehabilitation of mains water supply, (ii) rehabilitation of storm water drains ,
(iii) construction of market facilities, (iv) restoration of education facilities, (v) rehabilitation
of the town clinic, (vi) provision of back-up electrical power generators for essential public
service facilities, and (vii) facility for women's community activities.

Part D: Gazelle Peninsula
Establishment of a less concentrated human settlement pattern in the Gazelle Peninsula,
through development of provincial townships in the North East area of the Gazelle Peninsula,
including (i) restoration of the road from Baliora to Warangoi Bridge, (ii) provision of water
supply at Baliora, (iii) expansion of existing high schools and health centers, (iv)
construction of a facility for women's community activities, and (v) establishment and
operation of the Village Development Fund.

Part E: Economic Planning and Diversification
Support to develop institutional capacity in the areas of land use, water resources and
wastewater management and protection of coastal zone resources, including: (i) carrying out
of a study for a longer-term economic and spatial framework and implementation strategy for
the North East Gazelle Peninsula, including preparation of a management plan and a hazards
mitigation plan for the coastal zone area thereof; (ii) carrying out of a study of air quality and
environmental health effects of ongoing ash emissions from Mt. Tavurvur; (iii) carrying out
of research into cash and food crops, livestock and fisheries development, cocoa and coffee,
and expansion of the Cocoa and Coconut Extension Agency; (iv) development of an
agricultural diversification strategy; (v) provision of an incinerator for the Department of
Agriculture and Livestock; and (vi) provision of consultants' services for the foregoing.
Carrying out of a program of institutional strengthening for the Administration of the East
New Britain Government, including planning and development, staff training and provision
of consultants' services.




                                                4
      Strengthening of GRA's accounting, financial management and monitoring and reporting
      capabilities through development of a computerized accounting system, including provision
      of computer hardware and software, staff training and consultants' services.

1.5.3 Support from other donors was aimed at (a) establishing sustainable livelihood for
displaced communities by providing basic infrastructure, including roads, electric power and
water supply as well as education and health facilities in relocation sites for displaced
communities; and (b) providing health, education and public safety facilities for the rural
population of the Gazelle Peninsula.

1.6      Revised Components

1.6.1 During implementation of Phase I of the MTRP, it became clear that the sequence of
several activities had to be changed (e.g. agriculture and jobs in settlement areas) and a growing
consensus emerged for targeting some Phase II priority investments at expanding economic
activity, livelihood and social development more broadly throughout the province.

1.6.2 As discussed below, revisions were made to some components, both in the quantity of
works done as well as the time within which they were done. This was due primarily to higher
than anticipated cost, design changes and early problems with government counterpart and EU
funding arrangements.

1.7      Other significant changes

1.7.1 After counterpart funding delays began to affect implementation, the Bank and
counterpart staff got AusAID's agreement for it to finance the Kokopo/Rabaul Road
Rehabilitation Component (the largest project component). This reduced overall counterpart
funding requirements by an estimated 5.2 million kina (almost US$2 million), but AusAID also
required a complete engineering redesign which delayed start of construction works by about
two years.

1.7.2 Delays arising from counterpart and EU funding, difficulty in finding qualified
contractors, design creep, and overall inflation contributed to substantial cost increases for many
components. Extensive design changes1 resulted primarily from the frequent stakeholder
consultations which were maintained with the affected communities.2 The PNG Central Supply
& Tenders Board (CSTB) also added to delays when GRA had to modify its system in line with
new CSTB financial and procurement procedures.




1. By February 2005, the estimated cost for the original program increased to more than double appraisal estimate
due largely to major design creep: Bank components (excluding Kokopo/Rabaul Road) up by 80%; EU components
up by 300%.
2. While it was important to consult with stakeholders to such matters, one drawback is that they tend to demand
higher than appropriate/affordable levels of service and standards.

2      KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 The Quality Assurance Group (QAG) undertook a Quality Enhancement Review (QER)
prior to loan negotiations at the Region's request. It found the project to be well-designed and
prepared and agreed with the positive assessment of GRA. The QER saw GRA as a model for
decentralized development in other areas and recommended assistance for participatory local
development benefiting host communities in the vicinity of relocation sites for displaced
communities. Responding to these recommendations, at negotiations, a Village Development
Fund component was added to the project.

2.1.2 The government's strategy for restoration called for a shift in the focus of settlement and
economic activity away from the high risk areas in and around Rabaul. Project components were
selected for their expected contribution to achieving the priority MTRP government objectives.
Given the range and frequency of natural hazards affecting PNG, the project strategy remains
highly relevant to government's priorities to reduce vulnerability and risk and is consistent with
the Bank's strategy.

2.1.3 Lessons of earlier projects taken into account in project design. Several key lessons noted
from the earlier ITRP phase included (a) grounding project planning in understanding of the
socioeconomic context and population dynamics; (b) seeking greater stakeholder
consultation/participation including the business community, displaced villagers, and host
communities at the relocation sites; (c) care in assessing location and characteristics of relocation
sites to support sustainable livelihood; and (d) broader skills-base in the GRA/PIU to ensure
robust justification for development proposals.

2.1.4 Unlike many emergency projects which stop at the reconstruction or resettlement phase,
this project had the APL1 to address the short-medium term needs while the APL2 was to have a
long-term focus. Even without the APL2, this added project continuity as well as relatively
greater rigor in assessing investment needs, sustainability, etc.

2.1.5 Adequacy of Safeguard Policies. The key safeguard policies were related to appropriate
and timely land acquisition and possible adverse social and environmental impacts. Timely
location and acquisition of suitable safe and desirable resettlement sites after the eruption was a
significant challenge. Keeping families from returning to their original plots and maintaining
similar village and group affiliations and socio-cultural interactions as much as possible added to
the challenge, as did the task of quickly providing basic services, including water and sanitation.
With most of the land communally owned and owners of freehold land not willing to sell their
land (or asking very high prices), a coconut plantation on the coast at Vunacambi was purchased
by ENBPA for occupation mainly by fisherman from the area around Mt. Vulcan. This allowed
them to continue much of their prior fishing activities and helped to reduce adaptation problems
at an inland relocation site.

2.1.6 In the process of acquiring the Vunakambi Plantation, the 19 existing workers and their
families had to be relocated. This was done in accordance with Bank guidelines for resettlement
and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was prepared and implemented to facilitate this process.



                                                 6
For those affected by the volcano, the Bank's policy on involuntary resettlement (Operational
Directive 4.30) did not apply because resettlement under the project was necessitated by a
natural disaster. However, in most cases, the authorities voluntarily took several steps to ensure
that preferences and community feedback were taken into account in the resettlement process.
Especially challenging was the fact that some of the affected families (e.g. those in Gelagela) had
previously had large rural plots and expected similar land in urban or peri-urban areas. The
ENBPA worked with community representatives to locate additional sites for subsistence
farming and also to give residents the option of moving to such areas if they wanted larger plots.

2.1.7 The project has an environmental assessment B category with the primary focus being
upon possible adverse impacts from construction and resettlement activities. As a condition of
disbursement, several components required environmental mitigation measures and safeguards
that also emphasized operation and maintenance issues, e.g., (i) the Rabaul/Kokopo Road
(subsequently financed and implemented by AusAID); (ii) Kokopo and Rabaul urban drainage;
(iii) Rabaul Port erosion control; land-use management, water supply, sanitation and solid waste
components in the relocation sites (financed by EU); and (iv) all urban solid waste and sanitation
components. It is not easy to predict future volcanic activity and the impact upon the population
in terms of ashfall, air quality, and related hazards so these were also noted as environmental
issues to be taken into account to the degree possible.

2.1.8 The shift of settlement and economic activity away from high-risk areas was expected to
concentrate development in and around Kokopo, which was just a village of about 1,000 people
prior to the eruption. Planning studies were therefore done to help guide development in an
environmentally-sustainable way. These include: (i) a study of the Kokopo/Tokua corridor; (ii) a
Disaster Risk Assessment Study focusing on natural hazards including in the Kokopo/Tokua
corridor and (iii) Economic and Spatial plans for the Gazelle area.

2.1.9 Mitigating Project Risks. Resettling the affected population away from the high risk areas
was the main action taken to mitigate the risks identified. Also important was discouraging
residents from returning to their land in hazardous areas and ensuring that no new settlers moved
into the vacated lands. This was accomplished by providing alternative lands, educating the
population on the dangers of trying to return and assisting the residents to dismantle and remove
what material they could salvage from their previous land. Arrangements were made to
constantly monitor seismic activities and air quality so that the population could be appropriately
advised. A methodology and study design was prepared with AusAID's assistance for a
comprehensive Air Quality Study to be conducted during project implementation, but because of
higher than anticipated ashfall and funding delay from AusAID, only some basic study designs
were done. A World Health Organization (WHO) study is currently underway. Preliminary
results indicate that while there are no immediate health risks, the long-term effects, especially
on children, need to be studied.

2.1.10 To minimize the impact of settling so many residents in a new area, the authorities
worked out a plan under which they maintained open consultation with representatives of the
affected communities. The host communities also received special attention. They participated
actively in the decision-making process and they shared in several of the benefits provided to the
affected population (e.g. water and sanitation service, schools, improved roads, electricity, etc.).



                                                 7
2.2     Implementation

2.2.1 Project works were subject to such hazards and problems as counterpart funding delay,
unseasonal rainstorms, equipment and material being stolen (before and after being installed) and
onsite workers being attacked and injured (and in one case, killed) by robbers. Early
implementation progress (IP) and achievement of development objectives (DO) were rated
unsatisfactory primarily because of a slow start-up process. After the government's initial
counterpart advance to the trust account, required for loan effectiveness, its annual counterpart
funding3 consistently fell well below program requirements, reflecting national budget
constraints during a severe economic downturn. Delays in review and approval of parallel donor
funding also had a negative impact on other downstream project activities. By the time the
project was restructured in 2005 the economy was improving and so was the flow of counterpart
funding.

2.2.2 The impact of initial counterpart funding problem on the EU components was more
pronounced. This was because the EU's European Development Fund (EDF) funding was
available mainly for construction costs, with most of the design costs to be financed early by
scarce government counterpart funding. As the designs were delayed, the EDF window closed in
September 2003 with few of the EU-financed components actually implemented. Without these
components in place, several other donor-lending complementary investments could not be
made.

2.2.3 Even with the initial restructuring, counterpart funding continued to fall well short of
program requirements. For a while, GRA was forced to stop awarding contracts. To help avoid a
complete suspension of all project works, in late 2002 the Bank agreed to a government request
to increase its financing percentage for civil works from 78 percent (and in one case 33 percent)
to 90 percent. This was possible because AusAID agreed to finance the Kokopo/Rabaul Road as
mentioned above. EU funding under the EDF7 and EDF8 financing agreements expired in
September 2003, leaving many components, including those for basic services for resettled
communities, unfunded. Funds from the EDF9 program for about 3.4 million (for a reduced
program of activities) did not become available until July 2005 and works had to be rescheduled

2.2.4 The government submitted a new 2 million financing request under the EU's
streamlined procedures and much later, it received funding to complete works on 14 of 20
original components plus additional items in relocation sites and host communities.
Unfortunately this did not include several investments important to the social and economic
well-being of large catchment populations (e.g., a new rural hospital at Kerevat, a new health
center at Warangoi and new markets at Kokopo and Rabaul).

2.2.5 After it became clear that these delays meant unfinished project works, the government
requested another extension of the closing date, to June 30, 2007 which the Bank agreed to in




3 Government elected to use the traditional reimbursement mechanism rather than the option of Bank loan
disbursements based on projected cash flows.



                                                      8
light of the reasons given. By this time, bid prices were exceeding engineers' estimates4 on many
contracts, reflecting the combined effects mentioned above. Most of the funds freed up from
AusAID's finances had been utilized and there was a projected shortfall of US$4.3 million in
Bank funding. The government's initial 2004 counterpart funding allocation plus delays in
obtaining final EU approval of additional funding made it clear that project viability was in
jeopardy and that a thorough review was urgently needed to redefine a core program with
available resources that would maximize achievement of project objectives. Improved measures
were also needed to better manage risks of further cost escalation and implementation delays.

2.2.6 Following extensive consultation with beneficiaries and other stakeholders and the Bank,
several components were rephased, resized, or canceled. These included: Kokopo Civic Center
(for which alternative funding was sought); studies to diversify and expand agricultural sector
activities (many of which were being undertaken independently); and design studies for a
possible Stage 2 of the APL. With delays and changes in EU funding for key components, the
revised program for Bank financing included: the survey for titling at Sikut (Talvat) relocation
site; the health center at Gelagela; and installation of water supply at all relocation sites as well
as a first phase of the urgently-needed rural hospital at Kerevat, health center at Warangoi and
markets at Kokopo and Rabaul, all of which had been dropped from the new EU Financing
Agreement. The expectation was that if EU financing came on stream by July 2005, these
components could revert back to EU for funding while the Bank could then rechannel freed
funds to such items as site development works at the Kokopo Commercial Center and key
sections of the Kokopo Roads and Drainage Component in partnership with the PNG Sustainable
Development Program (PNGSDP)5 picking up the remainder.

2.2.7 GRA also took steps to modify the scope of work without affecting functionality on a
number of components. It introduced measures to encourage increased competition in bidding
for the remaining contracts as well as more active monitoring and reporting to better manage
risks of further cost escalation and implementation delays for the revised program. These more
proactive risk-management measures together with additional counterpart funding provided by
the new government in late 2004, provided good prospects for implementation of the revised
program and a sound basis for Bank approval in June 2005 of a reallocation of loan proceeds
among disbursement categories, along with a two-year extension of the loan closing date to June
30, 2007.

2.2.8 With the Loan 96 percent disbursed (US$24.21 million of the original US$25.26 million)
at the end of May 2007, and all remaining contracts within ten percent of completion, the Bank
agreed to a third extension to the loan closing date to December 31, 2007 to ensure that
resettlement and institutional targets would be achieved and restoration works would be
satisfactorily completed. A long-term development strategy and plan for the area had also been
completed under direct provincial initiatives.



4 In interviews with contractors about the high prices they sought, they cited GRA's closer monitoring of
construction quality, rejection of work not meeting design specifications compared to opportunities from other
donors and lenders in urban locations who did not have such standards.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 Close monitoring of project implementation was maintained through frequent field visits,
progress reports and phone conferences among GRA, ENBPA, and the Bank. GRA's close site
supervision and use of a contract administration manual enhanced risk-management techniques.
There were frequent contractors' meetings which helped in resolving implementation issues,
ensuring good construction quality, and limiting cost escalation and implementation delays
following the restructuring in 2005. While there were initial cases of design creep, consultation
with stakeholders had a major positive effect on sustainable design, including those for simple
community-managed water schemes under the Village Development Fund that are intended to
have self-financing O&M. To facilitate greater beneficiary participation, GRA initiated a weekly
call-in show, augmented by periodic workshops which were often scheduled during Bank
supervision missions to provided feedback to all participants on project progress and
effectiveness in addressing expressed needs. Close monitoring and evaluation of issues affecting
project viability resulted in several timely and effective interventions, including restructuring of
financing arrangements and project composition, to avoid cessation of works, especially during
the early implementation period.

2.3.2 The active participation of beneficiaries in the construction phase continues to be seen in
the utilization of the facilities provided. The schools, health centers, and port facilities are all
being fully utilized and government financing is being augmented by contributions from users
who have created parent-teacher associations (for the schools) and other user groups.

2.4    Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Environmental Protection. Review of contractor compliance with environmental
management plans is highlighted in GRA's contracts administration manual and has been done
in all cases by supervision engineers, GRA's environmental specialist and Bank supervision
missions. AusAID followed its own procedures for the Kokopo/Rabaul Road Component.

2.4.2 The project is successful in consolidating the shift in settlement and economic activity
away from the high-risk areas in and around Rabaul. New planned development in Kokopo and
other parts of the Gazelle Peninsula is considerable and orderly. Studies of solid waste and
wastewater/sanitation management arrangements found the existing disposal site unsuitable due
to possible groundwater contamination. Two Bank supervision missions included solid waste
specialists and more suitable alternative sites were identified within the context of an overall
solid waste management system including collection and waste recycling and minimization. The
study of wastewater and sanitation reviewed the suitability of alternative technologies,
particularly in light of the permeable ground conditions prevailing in the Gazelle Peninsula, and
their financial and institutional implications. It also confirmed that septic tanks remain suitable
provided septage is disposed of satisfactorily. For rural areas, other on-site technologies for
treatment of human waste are also being developed locally including ventilated composting
toilets.




                                                 10
2.4.3 Although a comprehensive air quality study was delayed6, the Rabaul Volcanological
Observatory (RVO), WHO, and the local health authority have mitigated risks through constant
monitoring and frequent advisories to the affected population, particularly in and around Rabaul
Town. During periods of intense emissions, the regional hospital has been closed, with patients
evacuated temporarily to safer areas.

2.4.4 All damaged buildings in Rabaul have been demolished and the devastated areas as well
as the caldera walls have been seeded for vegetation to discourage redevelopment and to
minimize erosion and siltation of Rabaul port facilities and the harbor where silt traps have also
been constructed. Trees and grass now cover almost all of the affected vacant areas.

2.4.5 Social Issues. Before this project, the preliminary baseline survey of the target population
conducted in July 1998 indicated that 53 percent of the target population was residing in the four
established relocation sites that still lacked most basic services and in some cases, adequate land
for sustainable livelihood. It also found that 36 percent were back in their villages of origin
despite continuing emissions from Mt. Tavurvur, and the rest was either in unofficial "care
centers," temporarily residing with relatives in neighboring villages, or had resettled elsewhere at
their own initiative. To address the issue of small plot sizes that were insufficient for a
sustainable livelihood from subsistence farming and market gardening at some sites, the
Provincial Administration purchased a plantation on the northeast coast as an alternative
relocation site for fishing families. Basic services have also been provided through the project in
relocation sites and by late 2007 over 80 percent of the relocation sites were permanently
occupied.

2.4.6 Although it is not a requirement in the legal documents, the government was planning to
conduct a social assessment (including a household survey) of the outcomes of the project.
Because the government has not opted for the APL2 project, many of the issues which would
have been more fully addressed under that phase will have to be done by others. These include:
progress in more fully restoring or improving livelihoods and the sense of community among the
resettled populations and host communities; stresses leading to problems of social control and,
potentially, weakening social cohesion; concerns about security of tenure and land titling in a
matrilineal society uprooted from its ancestral lands; and some tensions in the relationship
between relocated villages/populations and host villages. A preliminary study design was
prepared by the Provincial Administration to be undertaken by local nongovernmental
organizations familiar with the Gazelle, but for funding and scheduling reasons, the assessment
is being undertaken directly by social specialists in GRA and ENBPA. From mission site visits
and several meetings with beneficiary groups, indications are that these groups feel that current
access to health, water and sanitation, and education levels are equal to or better than before the



6 An initial study was planned to assess impacts of periodic ashfall. The ash continues to fall almost daily and
there was an eruption in 2006 so a more comprehensive study is now being undertaken by the Rabaul
Vulcanological Observatory (RVO) with WHO assistance.




                                                        11
eruption. Overall economic well-being is more difficult to gauge; this and more detailed impact
figures are expected in early 2009 from that ongoing study.

2.4.7 Land Acquisition. The only land acquired under the project was the plantation at
Vunacambi as a relocation site. Nineteen plantation workers and their families were resettled
with compensation under the terms of a RAP in accordance with Operational Directive 4.30.

2.4.8 Indigenous peoples. Residents from the devastated areas in and around Rabaul who were
most directly affected by the eruption and, therefore, a key target population for relocation under
the project were mainly ethnic Tolai. Under the strategy for a more dispersed settlement pattern,
project facilities such as schools and health facilities are also more accessible to other ethnic
groups including the Bainings and other groups who are also indigenous to the area. Similarly,
the Village Development Fund Component was intended to provide priority services to host
communities adjacent to relocation sites but also covered villages in a wider catchment in the
Gazelle Peninsula with beneficial social impacts.

2.4.9 Fiduciary Aspects. Compliance with fiduciary requirements is rated satisfactory. GRA
commissioned the design and installation of a computerized project financial management
system to meet the Bank's reporting requirements under the Loan Administration Change
Initiative and all financial management reports were submitted to the Bank on time. In addition,
GRA maintained its existing spreadsheet-based project monitoring system that also tracked
project costs and financing, procurement, and implementation progress on the overall project,
including components funded by other donors. GRA's annual project accounts were audited
throughout by the Office of the Auditor General, consistently receiving unqualified audit
certificates and satisfactory reports on financial management. Minor points raised in the
management letters accompanying audits were addressed promptly. There are no outstanding
audit reports and all critical legal covenants have been complied with.

2.4.10 Procurement. Procurement of works, goods and services was consistently carried out
satisfactorily in accordance with Bank guidelines by GRA staff who had gained experience with
these guidelines during the ITRP from 1995 to 1998. With no foreign interest initially in the
generally small-scale works involved in a relatively remote area and a relatively small domestic
construction industry in PNG, contracts typically drew only a small number of bidders. Bid
prices often fluctuated markedly from engineers' estimates. Reviews of possible causes indicated
that it was possible that bidders were factoring in (a) likely extensions in the bid validity period
due to the lengthy contract award approval process, and (b) GRA's close, on-site supervision and
enforcement of contract engineering performance specifications.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Operations and Maintenance (O&M). An assessment during appraisal indicated that
maintenance implications of the restoration program would be administratively and financially
manageable by responsible agencies. O&M manuals have been prepared for components
transferred together with some training to responsible local, provincial, and national agencies.
Memoranda of agreement (MOAs) have been updated for the scope of maintenance required and
procedures have been implemented to integrate transferred project assets into the maintenance
planning and budgeting systems at the National Department of Works through inclusion of


                                                12
rehabilitated national roads into the Road Asset Management System (RAMS), at the National
Harbours Authority for Rabaul Port works (dredging and silt traps), and at PNG Power for power
supplies to resettlement areas. However, indications to date are that on an overall basis,
maintenance budgets are not yet adequate in these agencies, which reflects both low national
allocations and provincial revenues for such activities and capacity constraints among provincial
and lower level administrators.

2.5.2 Several initiatives are being taken at the provincial and local level to manage
maintenance activities and augment low O&M budget allocations. A draft legal agreement has
been prepared for a new management contract for the provincial Ah Tam/Dawapia port facility
and an autonomous market authority is being established to operate and maintain the two
principal markets in the province at Kokopo and Rabaul. A similar arrangement is being
established by the responsible district for O&M at the Kokopo Commercial Center. The local
education board and the local hospital board have been working in partnership with users and
others to increase income from user charges, special fees and fundraising activities to help defray
routine operation and maintenance costs. Water supplies are being operated and maintained by
respective Ward Committees with revenues from user charges and technical advice as needed
from the Water Board.

2.5.3 The good standard of maintenance by ENBPA of provincial roads, bridges, and other
facilities prior to the eruption was widely acknowledged. New project works were estimated at
appraisal to require an estimated 6 million kina annually to maintain the project assets to be
transferred to ENBPA and assessed as manageable in relation to projected provincial revenues at
that time. However, since the provincial sales tax was replaced by the national value-added tax in
2000, East New Britain's revenues have declined by about 30 percent in real terms and the
provincial maintenance budget in 2007 was 73 percent lower in real terms than it was before the
eruption, falling from 24 percent of revenues in 1994 to 10 percent in 2007. The province
therefore faces a large maintenance budget shortfall of about US$7 million per annum--about 45
percent of the province's overall 2007 revenue budget--and much required maintenance will
continue to be deferred. This is a national problem which has to be addressed at a different level
from this project.

2.5.4 To strengthen maintenance planning, AusAID's Provincial Performance Improvement
Initiative (PPII) is assisting the province to update the condition assessment and inventory of
infrastructure assets. ENBPA is trying to utilize alternative options to maintain its assets. For
example, it has introduced a surcharge on the vehicle registration fee to help meet maintenance
cost of provincial roads and bridges. However, recent indications are that this will generate
additional revenue of only about 200,000 kina rather than the 2 million kina estimated and will
not significantly affect the overall shortfall in provincial road maintenance funding.

2.5.5 Institutional strengthening and sustainability. GRA has established a well-earned
reputation for efficient implementation of development works and introduction of risk-
management techniques under the project have further enhanced its effectiveness. Similarly,
ENBPA has long been noted for its effective administration and capacity to deliver services to its




                                                13
people7 despite its relatively limited revenue base, compared to provinces that benefit from
mining industry royalties. Key officials from several provinces have visited East New Britain in
recent years to learn from its development planning and implementation management
arrangements under the project with a view to establishing similar arrangements to accelerate
development in their own provinces. The long-standing consensus between politicians and
administrators in East New Britain Province on development priorities, which may not be as
strong in other provinces, as well as the "seamless" relationship between GRA and the provincial
administration, have been invaluable in providing the strong foundation for successful
implementation of the restoration program in the Gazelle Peninsula of East New Britain.

2.5.6 The policies and procedures underpinning the successful restoration program in the
Gazelle are not limited to emergency reconstruction projects and could facilitate development
efforts in other provinces if consistently applied. The East New Britain Provincial Assembly has
approved the integration of GRA into the provincial system, as covenanted under the project.
GRA is now tasked with reviewing and managing all construction and maintenance of all
ENBPA's civil works and buildings and in light of the strong interest expressed by both the
national government and several provinces and autonomous entities to emulate the GRA
experience, it can also carry out "sustainable development programs" in other provinces.

2.5.7 Follow on project. Although the development priorities and opportunities now being
targeted are identified in the province's recently prepared Comprehensive Development Plan
(CDP), the government has not requested a second-phase APL operation for East New Britain. It
is reportedly very satisfied with the APL1 phase but it is trying to spread the impact of Bank
assistance in other areas. To this end, it has recently requested Bank support for a similar
operation in Manam, where a volcanic eruption has also caused severe social and economic
dislocation.

3       ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 Relevance of Objectives. The project provided comprehensive support for achieving the
objectives of the government's Medium-Term Restoration Program to restore the social and
economic well-being of the East New Britain people that prevailed prior to the 1994 volcanic
eruption and to ensure sustainability of outcomes and minimize adverse impacts of future
volcanic eruptions on lives, property, and livelihood. This is consistent with the Bank's strategy
for strengthening the capacity for service provision as well as the resilience of communities to
disasters. The principles underpinning project preparation and implementation management
arrangements are also highly relevant for non-emergency reconstruction development projects in
PNG.




7 Pre-eruption social indicators for health and education were consistently among the highest in PNG and the
province's economy attracted migrant workers from other parts of PNG.



                                                       14
3.1.2 Design and Implementation. Project design was highly relevant to and fully consistent
with the government's restoration strategy. Extensive stakeholder consultation ensured that the
project design was relevant to the needs of displaced communities and all affected groups.

3.1.3 The tools designed for future area and regional development plans were particularly
relevant because they provided a much clearer picture to many provincial and national
policymakers on the implications of different options and they also charted a path toward
achievement of the desired goals. The Village Development Fund was an important tool in
assisting not only the relocated population but also the host communities and this more inclusive
approach was very instrumental in getting cooperation from all major ethnic groups in the area,
thus facilitating the resettlement process.

3.1.4 Finally, although GRA is a statutory authority reporting to a minister of the national
government, it is based in Kokopo, the newly designated capital of East New Britain Province,
where restoration activities are centered and where it has been able to partner most effectively
with the province and affected population.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Satisfactory

3.2.1 The project achieved or exceeded the objectives for APL1 and achieved significant steps
toward the objectives of APL2, even though the government chose not to implement the second
phase. This decision to forego the second phase in part reflects the success of APL1 and the
government's desire to direct Bank assistance to higher priority development needs.

3.2.2 The project benefited from significant financing contributions from other partners (the
EU, AusAID, and the national and provincial governments), but also experienced serious
implementation delays partly due to problems with the fund flows and decisions from other
participants. These delays and funding problems (including severe counterpart funding
shortfalls) persisted through 2004 and caused the project to be rated unsatisfactory. However,
they were largely overcome and the project turned around dramatically beginning in 2005 and
ultimately achieved or exceeded its key performance indicators (KPIs) as detailed in Annex 2 on
Outputs by Component. These achievements were attained despite daunting conditions and
obstacles that at times made satisfactory completion of the project seem unlikely.

3.2.3 Briefly, the development objective of restoring government services similar to those
destroyed by the 1994 eruption were achieved through (a) provision of services and
infrastructure to those occupying the relocation sites, (b) upgrading the infrastructure and
services of Kokopo Town and establishing it as the new provincial capital, (c) rehabilitating and
restoring infrastructure and services of Rabaul Town/Port both for the areas considered safe for
residential occupation and for port operations, which are now functioning at pre-eruption levels,
and (d) providing infrastructure and other public services in various townships in the northeast
part of the Gazelle Peninsula. Infrastructure and services now meet or exceed those existing prior
to the eruption.

3.2.4 The development objective of ensuring the sustainability of social and economic well-
being and minimizing adverse impacts of future eruptions was achieved through some of the


                                                15
measures mentioned above related to providing services and infrastructure and also, more
specifically, by successfully (a) relocating populations away from vulnerable areas, (b) avoiding
resettlement in vulnerable areas, (c) implementing erosion control and silt trap measures in
Rabaul Port, (d) establishing a Village Development Fund to finance community-based
infrastructure and services, community development, and promote economic activities, and (e)
development of a comprehensive development plan for the province as well as conducting other
research on coastal zone planning and hazard mitigation.

3.3     Efficiency

3.3.1 Economic Rate of Return and cost effectiveness. This being a post-disaster resettlement
project, the APL1 component was focused more upon the infrastructure, resettlement, and related
needs of displaced groups. The strategy of the government was to shift the locus of settlement
and economic activity away from direct exposure to future volcanic activity at Rabaul to the
relatively low-risk areas of Kokopo and its surrounding hinterland. Many project benefits are
therefore not easily quantified in economic rate of return analyses. Instead, for most components,
e.g. health and education facilities, justification was based on a least-cost approach to satisfying
demonstrable demand at warranted service standards in keeping with best practice for emergency
reconstruction projects. The Kokopo-Rabaul Road was scheduled to have a cost-benefit analysis;
however, it was financed by AusAID and no information on such assessment was available. The
Vulcan sector was scheduled to be done at a later time to allow ash compaction and lower-cost
drainage design options to be studied.

3.3.2 As indicated earlier in this report, project investments are assessed to have met their
design objectives and close supervision and enforcement of design specifications by GRA
ensured satisfactory construction quality. All infrastructure and facilities are already well-utilized
and arrangements are being set in place to systematize and increase funding for maintenance as
well as to make commercially oriented components substantially cost-recoverable, thereby
improving project sustainability.

3.3.3   Financial Rate of Return. Not applicable.

3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

3.4.1 The overall rating is based on the full achievement of project objectives/KPIs; safeguards
and fiduciary compliance; the findings of quality assurance reviews both at entry and during
supervision and acknowledgement of its effectiveness of the GRA model by various
stakeholders.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 The economic and social dislocation of the eruption was considerable. About 20,000
people sought permanent resettlement in other parts of the Gazelle Peninsula including about
10,000-12,000 who were accommodated in relocation sites under the project. Relocation sites


                                                 16
were intended to maintain important socio-cultural aspects and to provide sufficient land for a
sustainable livelihood from subsistence and cash crops. Although it is an ongoing process,
growth in the province's economy generally and the urban economy in and around Kokopo is
providing access to increasing livelihood opportunities. Many project components particularly
benefit women. The Council of Women Centers provides skills development and counseling and
social services, and the community water supply schemes under the Village Development Fund
have reduced the considerable burden of fetching water borne by women and children in these
villages. The Village Development Fund also targeted priority needs identified by host
communities and extended services in villages of ethnic Bainings people, also indigenous to the
area.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.2 The studies discussed above that were implemented through the project have established
the tools for planning longer-term economic and social development in the Gazelle Peninsula.
Amendments proposed to the Gazelle Restoration Authority Act to incorporate GRA into the
provincial system and expand its mandate to assist development efforts in other provinces also
confirms the widespread recognition of the effectiveness of this as a development model.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.5.3 The success of the APL1 in this province is reportedly among the reasons why the
national government was reluctant to approve an APL2 in the same province since it was felt that
other provinces needed similar assistance.

3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Not applicable. While there was no requirement for this in the legal documents, in view of the
success of this model, the government is trying to document some of the more widespread
project impacts on both direct and indirect beneficiaries. The results will be available at a later
date and so it is not possible to put it in this report.

4      ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Moderate

4.1.1 The shift toward Kokopo and away from Rabaul created winners and losers and a small
but vocal group continues to press for redevelopment of Rabaul. ENBPA has shown its
commitment to the government's policy prohibiting redevelopment in the devastated areas
through recent decisive action ordering amendments to Rabaul Town Plan to prevent such
development. Recent relocation of key commercial enterprises, the main market and the post
office from Rabaul is slowly weakening calls for resettlement there. Now that Kokopo has been
designated the new administrative capital of the province and densification is continuing, the risk
of return to Rabaul is decreasing daily. The Disaster Risk Assessment and various planning
studies undertaken under the project also provide a credible regional development plan which the
ENBPA is committed to implementing.



                                                 17
4.1.2 Arrangements are being made by responsible national and local agencies to integrate
maintenance needs into operations and budgets. Both the national Port Authority and the national
Water Board have good track records on maintenance. Maintenance of national roads has
traditionally been badly under-funded, but the national Department of Works is making
improvements associated with the Bank-financed Road Maintenance Project (Ln. 7119-PNG).
Still, significant decline in the ENBPA revenue base following replacement of the provincial
sales tax by the national value-added tax has weakened the province's traditional capacity for
adequate maintenance funding and has, therefore, imposed some risk to sustainability of project
outcomes. With the current increase in national earnings from PNG's primary mineral exports,
increased revenue-sharing is more likely and this should assist in project sustainability.

5      ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1    Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.1 The Bank's performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated satisfactory. The team
reviewed several alternative design strategies and had extensive consultations with displaced
communities and other stakeholders to ensure broad consensus on project objectives and urgent
priorities, consistent with these objectives. Assessments were made of possible adverse
environmental and social impacts and of project sustainability in terms of post construction
O&M implications.

5.1.2 In light of the political risks in PNG at that time, the QAG was requested to conduct a
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) prior to negotiations to leave open the possibility for useful
changes in project design to be incorporated at negotiations The QER Panel found the project to
have been well-designed and prepared.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Highly satisfactory

5.1.3 The Bank's performance during supervision is rated highly satisfactory for a number of
reasons. Taking account of the status of the country as a fragile state, the Bank engaged
throughout the project in close supervision and follow-up, particularly during and after project
restructuring in 2005. There were at least two missions annually with frequent audio conferences
with the project team in Sydney plus additional specialist missions focusing on solid waste
management, social issues and other aspects. All regular supervision missions made site visits to
ongoing works and often met with project stakeholders, including at periodic workshops. The
Bank recognizes the special needs of fragile states and the project team demonstrated appropriate
flexibility in helping resolve problems affecting project-implementation progress and/or
achievement of development objectives. For example, it helped to address the adverse impact of
severe government counterpart funding constraints by working with AusAID and transferring the
Kokopo/Rabaul Road to AusAID in 2000 for grant financing. And in 2002, it used the resulting


                                               18
loan savings to increase its disbursement share of civil works and reduce the impact of low
counterpart funding. In 2005, when funding from another donor was being delayed, the project
team was able to shuffle available project resources toward key bottleneck tasks until the other
donor's funds became available. To help manage costs, the project team worked with GRA to
develop risk management strategies that proved effective in minimizing further cost escalation
and implementation delays; and in making additional adjustments when other funding came back
on stream in late 2005. Continuity of key Bank project team members resulted in an excellent
working relationship with counterpart officials at all levels throughout the process and this
facilitated constructive dialogue and quick actions throughout, including on issues affecting
project viability.

5.1.4 A QAG review in September 2006 rated the Bank's overall project supervision during
fiscal 2005 and 2006 as satisfactory (the second highest rating on a six-point scale). The ratings
for the main supervision assessment subcategories were: highly satisfactory for candor and
quality of ISRs; moderately satisfactory for focus on development effectiveness; satisfactory for
fiduciary/safeguard aspects; and satisfactory for adequacy of supervision inputs and processes.
The panel's report also noted the very high degree of commitment and effectiveness of the task
team in resolving many of the key problems that were encountered during implementation. At
the end of fiscal 2006, QAG had also agreed to grant the project a "golden flag" (to prevent it
from being classified as potentially at-risk) in recognition of the strong advances made toward
achieving project objectives despite challenging conditions (two of the project's three risk flags
were for country environment and country record) and success in overcoming earlier
implementation problems that had triggered a long-term risk flag.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.5 The extensive analysis of design strategies and investment priorities and stakeholder
consultation called for by the Bank during project preparation resulted in a broad-based and
abiding consensus on project objectives and outcomes. Bank commitment to resolving problems
and its flexibility in adjusting project financing arrangements to lessen the adverse impact of
funding problems by the government and one other donor helped the project to meet or exceed
development objectives set for it and to demonstrate an effective model for decentralized
development of local infrastructure and services in East New Britain and elsewhere in PNG.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.1 During the early years of implementation, the project faced severe difficulties from
inadequate government counterpart funding that limited implementation on the ground even after
an extension to the loan period, raising concern amongst stakeholders over project viability.
Even so, the government has remained strongly committed to the project and the ENBPA
worked side by side with the GRA throughout, standing firm against political pressure to


                                                19
redevelop Rabaul (which would have undercut the strategy for the restoration program and the
rationale for Bank involvement); maintaining close contact with stakeholders on project
implementation progress, and supervising or implementing a number of project studies directly.
With increasing commodity prices, counterpart funding improved markedly, helping the
restructured project to achieve its satisfactory completion and outcome. The government
recognizes the value of GRA's experience and capability and is in the final stage of formalizing
its association with ENBPA to enable it to also assist similar development efforts in other
provinces.

5.2.2 National, provincial and district agencies have incorporated project assets into their
maintenance planning and operations and ENBPA has introduced additional revenue measures
for maintenance on project assets it is responsible for. However, maintenance budgets remain
well below requirements highlighting the need for national structural changes to provincial
finances including government grants and transfers, in particular.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly satisfactory

5.2.3 GRA secured the confidence of the national government, the business community and the
population of the Gazelle Peninsula under the ITRP initiated in the immediate aftermath of the
eruption. Under the MTRP, GRA has again distinguished itself as a highly effective
implementing agency, despite severe complications relating to multi-donor financing and
inadequate government counterpart funding. During project preparation, GRA quickly adjusted
to the need for a stronger analytical underpinning for the MTRP including in relation to
environmental and social impacts and for extensive stakeholder consultation in selecting project
priorities. It hired specialists in its management team and installed a comprehensive project
accounting and financial management system. GRA staff quickly adopted Bank procurement
guidelines to ensure cost effectiveness and transparency in its operations. Following project
restructuring, GRA's proactive oversight and enhanced risk management techniques were
effective in limited further cost increases and implementation delays, ensuring satisfactory
project completion and achievement of all project objectives. GRA's vigilant, on-site supervision
of the large and diverse program of engineering works has been a hallmark of project
implementation and construction failures have been minimal.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.4 The initial counterpart funding problem reflected a national economic downturn rather
than project commitment problems. As country earnings increased, the government increased its
allocation to help improve project implementation. At both the national and provincial level,
sustained support throughout both the ITRP and the MTRP demonstrates the enduring
commitment to achieving a good project outcome for the people of East New Britain and trust in
the Bank as a key development partner.

6      LESSONS LEARNED

6.1    Major Projects can be successfully implemented in PNG

6.1.1 The PNG government has proved itself fully capable of creating conditions conducive to
good project outcomes and achievements. Aid and donor agencies as well as government
officials acknowledge that the Second Gazelle Restoration Project is a success story due to: the
sound government strategy guiding the restoration effort throughout; decentralized decision-
making on restoration priorities; highly effective and transparent implementation arrangements
by the GRA in close partnership with ENBPA and extensive local consultation to ensure
sustained and broad-based stakeholder support. Some of GRA's systems--particularly the
contract administration and quality control manuals--have been adopted by the Department of
Works and the Central Supply and Tenders Board. Other countries in the Pacific region are
reviewing these manuals and have expressed an interest in using them.

6.2    A time contingency in the implementation schedule would have been appropriate

6.2.1 Notwithstanding the successful implementation of the ITRP, the four-year
implementation period for the first phase of the APL was inadequate. Implementation delays
accumulated virtually from the outset, due largely to government counterpart funding problems.
By the initial June 30, 2003 loan closing date, less than 20 percent of the Bank loan had been
disbursed. Inclusion of a substantial time contingency in the implementation schedule would
have been appropriate, particularly given the project complexity and that that counterpart
funding constraints had been identified as a project risk.

6.3  Bank financing or channeling EU funds through Bank for works for displaced
communities would have reduced delays in basic services for them

6.3.1 Involvement by several donors with different financing and disbursement procedures and
information requirements imposed a considerable administrative burden on GRA's
administrative and engineering staff, in particular. In addition, reserving Bank-financing for
critical components for improving the quality of life for displaced communities would have
lessened the adverse impact of problems experienced with the EU financing mechanism by
accelerating provision of basic services in relocation sites as well as intensifying the dialogue on
social and livelihood aspects.

6.4    Comprehensive review is needed of financing arrangements for local services
including government grants and transfers, in particular

6.4.1 The assessment at appraisal indicated that O&M on project assets would be
administratively and financially manageable by all responsible agencies. The adverse impact on
provincial revenues following replacement of the provincial sales tax by the national value-added
tax apparently undercut the province's longstanding tradition of adequate O&M, something
which could not have been anticipated. The province's present limited revenue authority and
dependence on government transfers highlights the need for a thorough review of the current
arrangements.

6.5   Landholders are key stakeholders in ensuring equitable and efficient project
outcomes

6.5.1 The shift toward a more dispersed settlement pattern away from Rabaul had major
implications for land availability and use in Kokopo and the Gazelle hinterland, particularly
since most land is in customary ownership. The slow and limited release of land has narrowed
development options, possibly increasing public sector development costs and creating winners
and losers. For emergency reconstruction type projects, in particular, landowners should be seen
as key stakeholders in ensuring that project development objectives are achieved in an equitable
as well as efficient way as possible. The system of communally owned land adds to the
challenge.

6.6    Simple risk management techniques can limit cost escalation and implementation
delays significantly

6.6.1 The use by GRA of a contract administration manual and enhanced risk management
measures following project restructuring in 2005 was effective in minimizing further cost
escalation and implementation delays. While, implementation delays in the early years were
largely out of the GRA's control, these tools and techniques are transferable and could generate
major efficiency gains on development projects generally in PNG.

9.   The PAD allowed for the purchase and surveys of new resettlement estates, and further cadastral surveys at Sikut Matupit and Sikut Talwat.
     In the final programme less land was purchased, but the two surveys at Sikut were completed.
10. The PAD included internal roads at Sikut, electricity and water supplies to Gelagela, Clifton, Sikut, and Vunakabi, for a sanitation study, and
    the upgrading of Gelagela aid post to rural health centre. In the final programme, all of these projects were completed, with additional areas
    covered by the electricity and water supplies - Asing (water and electricity) and Warena (water only). The water supplies (8 no.) were all deep
    bores, except for an additional component for water tanks to the community resource centres.
11. The PAD allowed for the upgrading of an existing aid post to rural health centre. The health centre provided is considerably larger than that
    planned at appraisal with a maternity ward, two general wards, an operating theatre, and several clinic buildings.
12. The original project allowed for agricultural extension services to the resettlement estates, mainly in the form of the provision of cocoa
    seedlings to displaces farmers. The final programme included the extension services, as well as the construction of an agricultural nursery at
    Sikut to provide further seedlings to the resettlement estates.
13. The original project included both the upgrading of the Kokopo to Rabaul road (excluding Vulcan), and the upgrading of the Kokopo Town
    roads and drains. The Kokopo to Rabaul Road was moved to project component 4 (see note 19 below). The upgrading of the Kokopo Town
    roads and drains was completed, with increase in the length of roads and drains being constructed (7.6 km over 7.1 km drains, 5.9 km over
    4.1 km roads).
14. The PAD allowed for the supply of generators to key institutions in Kokopo and elsewhere, the provision of a water supply at Butuwin health
    centre, a feasibility sanitation study for Kokopo, and the improvement of the solid waste dump at Raniolo. The original project also included
    the construction of a central community school in Kokopo, and a provincial headquarters for women's groups. The majority of the generators
    were supplied under component 4 (see note 19 below), the Butuwin water supply was successfully installed together with extensive civil
    works required by the ENBP Physical Planning Board, the sanitation feasibility study was completed, as was a study for the Raniolo solid
    waste dump. Unfortunately the solid waste dump at Raniolo was not feasible, and the ENB Provincial Government is seeking alternative sites.
    The construction of the community school was upgraded under the education reforms to a primary school. The women's groups provincial
    headquarters were constructed under a separate programme, and the design of a district headquarters was completed as well. Two additional
    components were added, being the construction of four residences for the Department of Justice and Attorney General, and the construction
    of an STI Clinic building at Butuwin health centre.
15. Originally the project included construction of a new market at Kokopo, the proposed Kokopo Commercial Centre, and the provincial
    administrative headquarters at the Ralum Civic Centre. Although the designs for all three components are complete, due to severe cost
    overruns the construction was not completed: 60% of the market has been constructed, 5% of the Commercial Centre (55% if the surrounding
    roads are included), but the Ralum Civic Centre was cancelled from the project and will be completed with other financing.
16. The original PAD included the survey of a portion of government land at section 46 in Rabaul for eventual development for public institutional
    use (for police station, fire station, health centre, district offices, women's facilities etc). The survey was completed successfully as well as the
    full civil works design of the proposed subdivision.
17. The original project included the construction of silt traps and a groyne to reduce siltation of the harbor, extensive erosion control works
    throughout Rabaul, the restoration and upgrading of the Provincial Government wharf, the removal of damaged structures in the town, and the
    upgrading of the main port road. The groyne construction was deleted as it was no longer required, but all other works were successfully
    completed. The silt traps are considerably larger than the pre-eruption structures, and the facilities at the ENBPG wharf have been
    considerably enhanced for the fishing industry.
18. The original project included the rehabilitation of the town water supply, health and education facilities for the remaining population, the
    construction of a new market and facilities for women's groups, and the provision of an incinerator for the national quarantine services. The
    provision of a mains water header tank was completed successfully, as was the restoration of a primary school at Malagunan village to cater
    for the town population. The design of the planned replacement health centre was completed, but the facility was not constructed due to
    limitation of funds. The new market and women's facilities were successfully completed at Page Park and on Malaguna road, and the
    incinerator was supplied and installed for NAQIA. A project has been added to this component to provide maintenance to the temporary
    health facilities in Rabaul.
19. The PIP and PAD included a large variety of projects to establish a more dispersed pattern of settlements in the Gazelle Peninsula. These
    projects included upgrading the road from Baliora to Warangoi, provision of water supplies at Baliora township and Vunamami FTC, stand-by
    generating facilities at National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC) transmitters and restoration of the transmitting station at Kurakakaul,
    completion of Utmei High School, restoration of Malabunga High School, support to the Vuvu High School / Kabaleo TTC switchover,
    upgrading of rural health centers at Kerevat and Warangoi, rural police facilities at Bitapaka, women's district headquarters facilities at
    Kerevat, a village development fund to assist host communities, and a cocoa nursery for CCI PNG at Kulaun (Londip). These projects have
    been successfully completed, with a 70% increase in the length of the Warangoi road upgraded. There was also a considerable increase in
    the scope of works at the two rural health centers, now upgraded to rural hospitals (with stage 2, at each, to be completed with other
    financing), and the addition of an new subcomponent at Tauran Primary School, and of five further health sector projects to be implemented in
    2008. The village development project provided 20 facilities--water supply, educational facilities, electricity, etc--to a higher standard (and
    cost) than planned during preparation.
20. The original project envisaged feasibility studies for and implementation of agricultural development in alternative crops, beef production, and
    fisheries development. However, the implementation of the agricultural studies was not successful, mainly due to the failure of the province's
    DPI to formulate an agricultural development strategy on which to base the studies.
21. The original project included the formulation of economic and spatial development strategies and plans for the area, and an air quality
    environmental study. The economic and spatial development studies were completed successfully with the reports on disaster risk
    assessments, physical planning of the Kokopo - Tokua corridor and Kokopo Urban Development Plan, a provincial growth centre hierarchy,
    an economic development plan. All of these reports were presented to and accepted by the PEC at a policy level. Regrettably, the support of
    AusAID for the air quality study was withdrawn after completion of the first phase. WHO is currently assisting in the second phase.
22. The original project allowed for design and supervision costs for most projects - based on percentage costs of the projects themselves - and a
     component for the design of Phase 2 projects, based on the agreed list of projects. The designs of all projects were completed successfully,
     but supervision was mostly undertaken by the GRA PIU staff at no cost to the project. In addition, a sub-component was added for the
     provision of technical assistance by an international consultant to increase the technical capacity of the GRA PIU in areas where expertise
     was lacking, and for the review of designs by other consultants. Design and supervision of the Kokopo to Rabaul road was the single most
     costly design and supervision item (at cost to AusAID).

ANNEX 2. OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT

This annex provides an expanded account of project outputs, using as a point of departure each
component's link to the original triggers for APL2 (which were used as KPIs to assess
implementation of APL1). In reality the outputs of APL1 went a long way toward achieving the
ultimate goals and outcomes outlined for the end of APL2 (see matrix in Section 1.2), which was
a key reason the government chose to target future international development financing toward
other national priorities rather than implementing APL2.

Component 1: Displaced Communities

KPI 1: Completion of Infrastructure and Services and at least 80 percent occupancy at all
relocation sites. Satisfactory. The electric power grid has been extended to relocation sites and
water supply has been provided to 10,000 people in these sites to reduce costs of trucking in
water to users. The health post at Gelagela has been upgraded to a full health center, reflecting
the size of the community there and a new rural hospital and a new health center were
constructed at Kerevat and Warangoi respectively that also serve communities in relocation sites.
Community Resource Centers have been constructed and staffed to provide community
development and economic support as well as health awareness and health education services at
relocation sites and a new Council of Women's Center that provides training programs for
women has been constructed at Kerevat. Seedling nurseries have been developed in Gelagela,
Sikut & Londip, access roads have been rehabilitated to facilitate production and marketing of
food and cash crops in relocation sites and a study on access to micro-credit has been
undertaken.

With 80 percent occupation by displaced communities at relocation sites, the KPI for this
component has been fully achieved indicating more settled communities and improved
livelihood.

While relocation is entirely voluntary, it has not been frictionless and there were some social
issues in adjusting to new sites. These were exacerbated by the lengthy delay in provision of
some basic services and facilities due to approval delays of another donor's financing
arrangements. Among such social issues, the weakening of social cohesion affecting mainly the
youth in these communities seems to be part of a national trend and it will require continued
attention.

Component 2: Kokopo Town

KPI 3: 75 percent Completion of Other Infrastructure, Utilities and Social Services Under Phase
I, Including Rabaul-Kokopo Road (except for Vulcan Section). Satisfactory. With AusAID
financing, reconstruction of the Rabaul-Kokopo Road has been completed except for the Vulcan
section. Reconstruction of Kokopo town roads and drainage works that were to be done under
the project have been done while some remaining (non-project) contracts are underway with
funding from the PNGSDP. The project leveraged substantial additional domestic and foreign
funds for such works. A new community school for 880 pupils age 8-12 was constructed. The
first phase of Kokopo market has been completed. It will assist the marketing of produce from
the Gazelle hinterland and along with the Kokopo Commercial Center, accelerate the


                                               26
consolidation of Kokopo as the new town. Management contracts have been prepared through
user and provincial arrangements for maintenance of these facilities. In addition, and outside the
original project scope, a new sports field has been constructed for the increasing number of
sporting events being held in Kokopo and alternative financing is being sought for the Civic
Center to house national and provincial government agencies (this was deferred due higher than
estimated cost to build to current design specifications). Overall, Kokopo has undergone a
transformation from small village of about 1,100 people prior to the eruption to a large town of
about 15,000 people now and the boundary has been extended to include Takobar, another
village east of Kokopo.

Component 3: Rabaul Port

KPI 2: 100 percent Completion of port-related protection works in Rabaul and approval of
revised zoning plan that prohibits redevelopment in the devastated areas of Rabaul. Satisfactory.
The provincial Ah Tam/Dawapia port for coastal shipping has been rehabilitated and a
management contract prepared for outsourcing O&M. Berthing areas at both the national and
provincial wharves have been dredged and international cargo can again be shipped directly to
and from Rabaul Port which is now functioning at pre-eruption levels (305,000 tons in 2007
compared to 322,000 tons in 1993), serving both international and regional shipping. Devastated
areas in Rabaul have been cleared and, together with the caldera walls, have been reseeded to
reduce erosion. Silt traps have been constructed around the caldera walls and at the port to
reduce siltation of the harbor and port facilities. The approach road to the port has also been
reconstructed. To serve the small remaining population in Rabaul, the water supply system has
been rehabilitated and a market has been constructed. Rabaul Town Plan prohibits resettlement
in vacated areas and this is constantly being monitored and enforced.

Component 4: Gazelle Peninsula

The project implementation plan (PIP) and PAD included several initiatives to establish a more
dispersed pattern of settlements in the Gazelle Peninsula. These projects included upgrading of
the road from Baliora to Warangoi, provision of water supplies at Baliora township and
Vunamami Farmers Training Center, standby generating facilities at National Broadcasting
Corporation (NBC) transmitters and restoration of the transmitting station at Kurakakaul,
completion of Utmei High School, restoration of Malabunga High School, support to the Vuvu
HS / Kabaleo Teachers College switchover, upgrading of rural health centers at Kerevat and
Warangoi, rural police facilities at Bitapaka, women's district headquarters facilities at Kerevat,
a village development fund to assist host communities, and a cocoa nursery for the Cocoa
Coconut Institute (CCI) at Kulaun (Londip). These projects have been successfully completed,
including the upgrading of 70 percent more of the Warangoi road than originally planned. There
was also a considerable increase in the scope of works at the two rural health centers, now
upgraded to rural hospitals (with stage 2, at each, to be completed with other financing), and the
addition of an additional subcomponent at Tauran Primary School, and five further health sector
projects underway. The village development project provided 20 facilities--water supplies,
educational facilities, electricity, etc.--to a higher standard (and cost) than was planned during
the preparation stage.




                                                27
Component 5: Economic Planning and Diversification

KPI 4: Formulation of a Spatial and Economic Strategy Framework and Institutional Plan for
Longer-Term Development Including Coastal Zone Management and Mitigation of Coastal
Hazards in East New Britain. Satisfactory. A Comprehensive Development Plan was prepared.
It reflects the priorities and opportunities now being targeted as the restoration works are being
completed. It draws on the Regional Development Study that identified a growth center
hierarchy as a basis for future spatial development in the Gazelle Peninsula including: the
Physical Development Study for the Rabaul to Tokua Corridor that set guidelines for
development along the coast east of Kokopo; the Disaster Risk Assessment Study that focused
on mitigating the future impact of natural hazards including in the Kokopo/Tokua corridor; the
Hydrological Mapping Study for the northeast Gazelle; and the Urban and Regional Economic
and Spatial Strategy Study consolidating earlier analysis, including the work done to formulate
an agricultural sector strategy for the province. Taken together, these activities and documents
respond fully to the objective to restore longer-term development planning tools in the province.

KPI 5: Approval of ENBPA of detailed arrangements to integrate GRA into the provincial
government. Satisfactory. The provincial and national authorities have agreed to amendments to
the Gazelle Restoration Authority Act to incorporate GRA into the ENB Provincial
Administration system and expand its mandate to assist development efforts in other provinces.
This confirms the widespread recognition of the effectiveness of this as a development model.
The National Executive Council (NEC) approval process to confirm this agreement is currently
underway.

ANNEX 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR

GRA (Borrower's) Completion Report ­ Summary (Full text in project files)

1. Assessment of the project objective, design, implementation and operation experience

Overall, the project has performed well with respect to the overall goal of restoring the social and
economic well-being of the population of the North East Gazelle Peninsula, and to the objectives that
were set up in the PIP and the PAD.

The primary constraint to completing all the components designated to achieve the objectives was one of
increased costs, and the secondary constraint was the deferring or cancellation of components due to the
inability of the stakeholders to agree on a scope of works or to establish the guiding criteria or strategies
of their component projects.

With the exception of one component - the Rabaul to Kokopo Road - the design and implementation of all
projects was undertaken by the GRA PIU, with technical assistance from a variety of consultants for the
physical design works.

The significant increase in the overall cost of the project components, is attributable to a lesser extent to
inflationary costs during the life-cycle of the project, at 33.1 percent, and to a significantly larger extent to
the increase of scope of work on almost every project, accounting for a 103.4 percent increase of those
projects that were implemented, and a 198.8 percent increase of those few projects that remain unfunded.

During the construction of the project components, the development of the PIU's contract administration
and quality control manuals made a significant contribution to overall quality and cost control
management, resulting in fair value for money being obtained on all of the works.

Overall, the PIU has attempted to maintain a spirit of co-operation and teamwork with each and every
contractor to reduce the risk of non-performance by the contractors, and to achieve the programmed goals
and outputs with the minimum of conflict.

The sound partnership and harmonious relationship that has been consolidated between the GRA and the
respective provincial government agencies does much to ensure the sustainability of the various facilities
constructed under the project. The vast majority of the projects were handed over to the ENB Provincial
Administration, with some of these being further handed over to other agencies --PNG Ports, Department
of Works, CCI PNG, PNG Water Board, and the like.

The GRA has provided all end-users with an operation and maintenance manual, to assist with the
management of these assets. The Provincial Administration is well aware of its obligations to manage and
maintain its assets, and therefore, despite the climate of poor operation and maintenance of public assets
in the country, the operation of the assets created or upgraded under the project has not been as bad as it
might have been. The province has the will to operate and maintain its assets and has a plan of action for
the ENB government's operation and maintenance of the assets developed under the GRA's programs. It
is the revenue that is lacking.

It is most likely that those assets that depend on funding from the National Government are by and large
destined to be under-maintained. However, those that are suitable for user-pay systems have their own
revenue-generating ability and are better maintained.

The project beneficiaries in the respective areas where amenities have been provided are accessing them
and show great appreciation for the interventions.

2. Evaluation of the borrower's own performance during the evolution and
implementation of the project

The Borrower's performance both during the establishment and during the implementation of the
project was good.

Many problems were encountered during the implementation phase. Some of the more critical
of these in terms of impacts on implementation progress and / or demands on GRA management
capabilities were the timely release of adequate counterpart funding by the National
Government; the skills and knowledge deficiencies of key stakeholder organizations; the
complexity of, and variation in the review procedures, documentation and reporting requirements
of the various donors; the poor performance of consultants that were not in tune with local
requirements and appropriate practices; and the practical difficulties during the construction of
some infrastructure projects.

During the project design period, there was an unusual level of co-operation between the relevant
government agencies and the GRA. Frequent meetings were held, and a continuous dialogue -
particularly with the ENB Provincial Administration - ensured that all interests were catered for
as much as possible. This dialogue continued throughout the implementation period, and,
combined with the high motivation of the staff at the GRA PIU, did much to keep the project
running as smoothly as possible.

There were many positive outcomes within the GRA's organization as procedures and systems
were developed during the life of the project. For financial and progress reporting, the GRA
developed its own project management reporting (PMR) system allowing financial reporting in a
variety of format--by project, by sector, by funding source, etc--with a format that is flexible
enough to be consistent with the requirements of the many organizations to which the GRA is
bound to report. A wide variety of progress report formats were also developed for a similar
range of stakeholders.

During the life of the project, the GRA entered into thirty-seven contracts various consultancy
contracts for difference technical assistance requirements. With a few notable exceptions, the
performance of consultants was not as satisfactory as had been anticipated, and, as the technical
experience of the PIU staff increased, more and more of the consultants' work was taken over by
the PIU.

Similarly, during the life of the project, the GRA entered into one hundred and one construction,
and seven supply contracts, a procurement achievement in itself, and a challenge to any
organization in terms of quality control and meeting donor requirements.

In 2003/2004, the GRA PIU developed its own contract administration and quality control
manuals in order to improve and optimize the administration and management of its construction
contracts. With almost no exceptions, the PIU supervised all of the construction contracts.



                                                   35
Throughout the implementation of the project, the PIU held regular three-weekly implementers'
meetings to review the progress and discuss the problems on each and every project. These
meetings were always attended by the PIU's Community Development Officer and
Environmental Officer, whose assistance in community and other consultation and in
environmental management was invaluable.

We are often asked why the Gazelle Restoration Authority has been successful and whether our
model can be reproduced elsewhere? It is true that there are certain factors that have contributed
to the GRA's success, but we believe that there is no magic formula for reproduction of the GRA
model. It is the individuals who make up the team that are responsible for the GRA's success to
date with independence, flexibility, character, and teamwork being key elements.

3. Evaluation of the performance by the Bank, any co-financiers, or other partners during
the evolution and implementation of the project

It would be fair to say that the co-operation and support of the Bank through its Task Managers
and their teams was just about as good as it could be, during the preparation and implementation
of the project.

The support of AusAID on the Rabaul to Kokopo road component, and in the provision of
technical experts for the initial phase of the air quality study, for the disaster risk assessment
report, and for the economic and spatial development studies was highly appreciated. Further
support was forthcoming from the European Commission that took over some twenty-three of
the projects. Although highly appreciated, this support was often seriously hampered by the
EC's complex and impenetrable administrative procedures.

Throughout the project, the co-operation and support of the East New Britain Provincial
Administration was immeasurable, and, generally speaking, the GRA has received understanding,
support and assistance from all sectors of the government and the community.

The single most damaging event that had the widest implications on the relationship between the
GRA PIU and the Bank was the investigation into corruption and fraud that was undertaken early
in 2004. The GRA PIU was never given any official feed-back on this investigation. Other
problems were minor by comparison, and were far outweighed by the positive relationship
between the Bank's staff and the PIU. They included the time lost in obtaining No Objection
Letters, and variations in requirements.

On the other hand, the positive impact of the Bank's support cannot be overstated. From the
start of the project the Bank's Task Managers have been extremely supportive in all aspects of
the project including assistance with development of the project, assistance with implementation
and reporting, assistance with financing, and assistance with discussions with the national
government on the GRA's behalf, showing that there was an excellent degree of co-operation
between the two organizations during the life of the project.




                                                 36
The main lesson learned from the GRA PIU's working relationship with the various partners on
the Medium Term Restoration Program has been that continuous dialogue with the partners is
essential to the smooth and continuous operation of the programme.

A second lesson has been that, however hard it was to assimilate the different procurement and
procedural guidelines of the different donors, and, indeed, the changes to procedures during the
lifespan of the project and / or individual components, the guidelines had to be followed; and the
changes accepted. The GRA PIU has done its best to cope with the "moving goalposts" during
the project, and gratefully acknowledges those who have worked behind the scenes to assist.

ANNEX 8. COMMENTS OF COFINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS


AusAID agrees that factors for success include the high quality tender and contract
documentation and procurement process, the strong management and supervision by site staff;
and the positive involvement of the local authorities and communities taking ownership of the
project. The ENBPA policy of not paying land compensation in hazardous zones was also a
factor for success, and this and the GRRP community involvement model could be adopted on
other similar projects in PNG.

Evidence indicates that the project has generated many benefits for the general population in
terms of establishing a more reliable transport system and lower operating costs which also
manifests itself in better and cheaper access to markets, social, education and health facilities.
Some of these benefits include improved public transport, reduced travel time and vehicle
operating cost, increased economic activity along the roadsides, increase in vehicle ownership,
introduction of 25- seater buses due to increased demand for travel, increased attendance at
schools, expansion in agricultural production (access to markets) and less traffic on secondary
roads.

AusAID will be conducting an Impact Assessment of the GRRP in early September 2008 to
capture the socio-economic impact of the AusAID project on the local community. A number of
secondary beneficial impacts were achieved, including; the accreditation of the GRA Soils
Laboratory; removal of UXO which has made the Rabaul­Kokopo Road much safer, seawalls
were replaced; pullover bays and shelters have been provided at bus stops. The Community
Participation activities provided an effective model for future projects.
