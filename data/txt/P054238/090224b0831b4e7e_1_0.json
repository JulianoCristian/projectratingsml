After fifty years of dormancy, two\n            volcanoes in Rabaul, Mount Tavurvur and Mount Vulcan,\n            erupted in September1994 for the third time in 100 years.\n            Around 30,000 residents lost their homes and about\n            two-thirds of them sought permanent resettlement away from\n            hazardous areas. Second Gazelle Restoration Project helped\n            to rebuild infrastructure from scratch in several\n            communities, relocating thousands of villagers to safer\n            ground, providing them with new water supplies, and a new\n            school for their children. The project also ensured the\n            sustainability of social and economic well-being while\n            minimizing the adverse impacts of future volcanic eruptions\n            on lives, property and livelihoods in the Gazelle Peninsula."}, "docdt": "2011-04-11T05:27:04Z"}
