Guinea (PNG) were as\n            follows: outcomes were satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: involvement by several donors with\n            different financing and disbursement procedures and\n            information requirements imposed a considerable\n            administrative burden on Gazelle Restoration Authority (GRA)\n            administrative and engineering staff, in particular. In\n            addition, reserving Bank-financing for critical components\n            for improving the quality of life for displaced communities\n            will have lessened the adverse impact of problems\n            experienced with the European Union (EU) financing mechanism\n            by accelerating provision of basic services in relocation\n            sites as well as intensifying the dialogue on social and\n            livelihood aspects. The assessment at appraisal indicated\n            that operations and maintenance (O&M) on project assets\n            will be administratively and financially manageable by all\n            responsible agencies. The adverse impact on provincial\n            revenues replacement of the provincial sales tax by the\n            national value-added tax apparently undercut the\n            province's longstanding tradition of adequate O&M,\n            something which could not have been anticipated. The\n            province's present limited revenue authority and\n            dependence on government transfers highlights the need for a\n            thorough review of the current arrangements. The use by GRA\n            of a contract administration manual and enhanced risk\n            management measures project restructuring in 2005 was\n            effective in minimizing further cost escalation and\n            implementation delays. While, implementation delays in the\n            early years were largely out of the GRA's control,\n            these tools and techniques are transferable and could\n            generate major efficiency gains on development projects\n            generally in PNG."}, "docdt": "2008-12-19T00:00:00Z"}
