satisfactory. The main problem areas lie in: a) slow\n            progress in implementing National Rural Electrification\n            Program; b) failure to privatize the systems in the smaller\n            cities; c) the weakness of the National Secretariat of\n            Energy; d) several technical disputes related primarily to\n            the order of dispatch and the payments due to the generation\n            companies; and e) lack of popular understanding and support\n            for the reforms. The lessons learned include: 1) A well\n            defined legal and regulatory framework, and transparency\n            throughout the reform process are prerequisites for\n            successful privatization. 2) In smaller cities,\n            privatization is likely to be harder to accomplish than in\n            major centers. 3) Policy design and implementation are best\n            carried out by a strong local core of permanent government\n            professionals with a dependable administrative budget. 4)\n            Reform of the power sector is a long-term process that\n            requires continuous adjustments. 5) When project\n            implementation spans a change in administration, allowance\n            should be made for at least several months' delay while\n            the new administration reviews the situation and determines\n            its approach. 6) When preparation of a loan or credit is\n            delayed, it is important to have access to other resources.\n            7) With the shift to E-mail, assembling all the necessary\n            documents for an Implementation Completion Report is\n            becoming harder."}, "docdt": "2001-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
