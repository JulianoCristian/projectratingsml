surance mechanisms, all of which had failed to adequately
address the health problems of the poor, Argentina realized
it would need to change the operating culture of its health
system, in particular by incorporating performance incen-
tives at all levels. At the government’s request, IBRD as-
sembled a rapid, sequenced package of support beginning
in 2002. Analytic work first diagnosed the main causes
of the inequity and inefficiencies in the health system and
identified options to better meet the needs of the poor. This
work highlighted the central role of the provinces in health
services, the advantages of linking finance to performance,
the need to strengthen public services in areas of particu-
lar concern to the poor (especially sexual and reproductive
health), and the importance of strengthening federal capac-
ity to make and enforce health policy. The findings of these
studies informed policy discussions between IBRD and
the government, based on evidence and helped to inform
the government’s thinking as it designed the reforms. IBRD
then provided a policy-based loan (Provincial Maternal
Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan, 2003) to support
the institutional changes that would form the foundation
for the reforms. These included the adoption of a federal
health plan, strengthening the council where federal and
provincial health authorities coordinate, the creation of
provincial management units, and a public information sys-
tem, and development of a system to identify and enroll the
uninsured.
