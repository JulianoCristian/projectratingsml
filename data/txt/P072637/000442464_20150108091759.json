By\n            moving from a traditional system based on inputs and fixed\n            budgets to one geared around outputs and results, Plan Nacer\n            has given beneficiaries more influence on service providers\n            , enhanced transparency; increased accountability of all\n            actors in the system; and improved public performance and\n            productivity. Drawing upon International Bank for\n            Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) funding and expertise\n            since 2002, Argentina has delivered health insurance and\n            secure access to health services to more than one million\n            uninsured pregnant women and children, and has helped drive\n            immunization rates up to 94 percent."}, "docdt": "2010-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
