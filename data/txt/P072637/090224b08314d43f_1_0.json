When economic crisis struck in 2001, poverty\n            rates shot up, more than half of low-income households lost\n            their health insurance, and health outcomes deteriorated\n            sharply among the poor. The government of Argentina launched\n            Plan Nacer in 2004 as a free, voluntary, public insurance\n            program to cover uninsured mothers during pregnancy and up\n            to 45 days after delivery, as well as children under the age\n            of six. As part of the Plan Nacer reform effort, the\n            government changed the operating culture of its health\n            system to offer incentives for performance. International\n            Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) assisted with\n            the process by providing analytical support to diagnose the\n            main causes of health system inefficiencies and identify\n            options to better meet the needs of the poor. IBRD approved\n            a Provincial Maternal Child Health Sector Adjustment Loan to\n            support institutional changes that would form the foundation\n            for planned reforms. As a result, more than one million\n            previously uninsured pregnant women and children have basic\n            health insurance and secure access to services. By moving\n            from a traditional system based on inputs and fixed budgets\n            to one geared around outputs and results, Plan Nacer has\n            given beneficiaries more influence on service providers,\n            enhanced transparency, increased accountability and improved\n            public performance. IBRD continued to support Argentina in\n            its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and\n            its own national health goals."}, "docdt": "2010-03-30T09:38:02Z"}
