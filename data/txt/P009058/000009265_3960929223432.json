to\n            support firm-level productivity growth within competitive\n            markets through: (a) investing in the Metrology, Standards,\n            Testing and Quality System (MSTQ); (b) funding research and\n            development activities; and (c) strengthening the framework\n            for capital market activities. Despite gains made in these\n            three areas, weaknesses persist constraining the performance\n            of the Turkish economy. The project therefore has three\n            components. The first component will bring the MSTQ system\n            to standards by: (a) capacity building in the key public\n            sector institutions; and (b) fostering private participation\n            in the system. The second component finances a foundation\n            that will use seed capital to catalyze private sector\n            investment in ITD (especially applied research). The third\n            component aims to develop a venture capital industry by: (a)\n            establishing a legal and regulatory framework; (b)\n            rationalizing the tax treatment of venture capital funds;\n            and (b) financing a role model venture capital fund and\n            management company."}, "docdt": "1991-01-29T00:00:00Z"}
