Project for Turkey was satisfactory with a\n            likely sustainability. Improvement occurred in three\n            important areas: the creation of a research and development\n            culture among Turkish industry and increased private sector\n            participation in technology development; launching of a\n            technology finance industry where non existed; and an\n            improved capacity and access to technology infrastructure\n            and services. Key lessons learned include: When launching\n            new activities, emphasize private sector participation in\n            decision making. Specific market deficiencies in\n            technological development must be identified and addressed.\n            The design of technology development projects needs to be\n            kept as simple and as flexible as possible. Priorities and\n            strategies for investment should be clarified for each\n            component as early as possible, the methodologies for each\n            country can be subject to experimentation and may be\n            approached on a pilot basis. Public support is critical in\n            launching proactive measures to inform industry of benefits.\n            Measures to stimulate firm-level technology upgrading\n            require the development of specialized skills to evaluate\n            and monitor technology projects on the part of the provider\n            institution. Supervision should be maintained at a fairly\n            intensive level throughout implementation, and can be\n            enhanced by the use of external experts."}, "docdt": "1999-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
