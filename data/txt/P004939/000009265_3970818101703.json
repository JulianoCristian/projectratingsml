One of\n            the key lessons learned is that successful reforms in the\n            financial sector and reorganization of the banking system\n            are a prerequisite for the overall reorganization of public\n            enterprises, particularly in the industrial sector. The\n            project was over dimensioned considering the limited\n            capacity of certain implementing agencies, the slow\n            introduction of reforms in the financial sector, the\n            enormous needs for training and the infancy of the external\n            audit sector."}, "docdt": "1997-04-11T00:00:00Z"}
