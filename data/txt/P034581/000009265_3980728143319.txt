HOUSING PROJECT
(Loan 3985-UA)
1.    This Project Completion Note is for the Housing Project in Ukraine, for which a
loan of US$17.0 million equivalent was approved on March 14, 1996. The loan did not
become effective and was terminated on September 25, 1997.
Introduction
2.   In 1993, the housing sector in Ukraine had started the gradual process of
transformation from central planning and government control to a market based system.
The Law on Privatization of State Housing in Ukraine was passed in 1992 and becamne
operational in early 1993. Following the start of housing privatization, a market for real
estate, although limited, was slowly emerging in the urban areas. The Bank's housing
sector strategy was to support and accelerate the development of this embryonic housing
market through a pilot project targeted to reform oriented cities in Ukraine.
3.   Initial discussions on developing a housing project were held with the
Government in 1993. The cities of Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa were selected as project
cities because of their interest in attempting alternative, market based approaches to
housing provision. The project was appraised in June/July 1995, negotiated in January
1996 and approved by the Board in March 1996.
Project Objectives and Description
4.    The Housing Project was designed to support the development of a housing
market in Ukraine by: (a) completing and selling municipal apartments to city residents;
(b) promoting formation of homeowners associations and resident take-over of the
management and maintenance of their buildings; (c) encouraging the growth of private
housing developers through access to land with infrastructure for housing construction
and building regulation simplification; and (d) furthering housing reforrn through policy
studies.
5.    The project was to be carried out over a three year period and consisted of the
following components:
a) Housing Completion (US$16.7 million of which US$14.3 million is
incremental): Completion of unfinished city housing stock for sales to private
households in Lviv and Odesa;
b) Land Development (US$10.0 million of which US$6.6 million is
incremental): Provision of off-site infrastructure to develop serviced land for
sale to private developers for housing construction in Kharkiv and Lviv; and



2
c) Technical Assistance (US$1.2 million): Financing for housing policy and
land and building regulation studies and consultancies and training to assist
with the project implementation both at the national and local levels.
The total project cost was estimated to be US$27.9 million equivalent, excluding local
taxes but including cost of works already completed by the city administrations on
buildings and sites to be financed under the project. A Bank loan of US$17.0 million
financed 61% of total project cost net of taxes (55% of costs including taxes) or 93% of
the foreign costs and 42% of local costs.
6.    The project cities (Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa) were to be responsible for
implementation of the housing completion and land development components. US$16.7
million of the Bank loan (excluding US$300,000 retained by the national government for
technical assistance) was to be onlent by the national government to the three project
cities in US dollars on the Bank's terms and conditions with a spread of 1% to cover the
administrative costs and risk. The allocation of the Bank loan among the three project
cities was as follows: (a) Kharkiv, US$1.5 million; (b) Lviv, US$7.6 million; and (c)
Odesa, US$7.6 million.
Loan Signing and Effectiveness
7.    Lack of familiarity with Bank operations and the lengthy approval process in the
Government resulted in delays in loan signing and meeting project specific conditions of
project effectiveness. It took until December 1996 for the Government to obtain the
necessary clearances to sign the loan agreement. In addition to the standard effectiveness
conditions outlined in the General Conditions, the loan agreement included the following
project specific conditions of effectiveness: (a) execution of subsidiary loan agreements
between the Ministry of Finance and two out of the three project cities; and
(b) establishment of city project executing units in two out of the three participating
cities. It took the Bank and the Ministry of Finance several iterations to develop
subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to the Bank. Further delays were incurred in
obtaining the legal opinion on the loan agreement, project agreements and subsidiary loan
agreements. The cities proceeded to establish their project executing units.
Reasons for Termination
8.    The Bank extended the deadline for loan effectiveness twice to accommodate
these delays. At the time of the second extension in June 1997, the Bank notified the
Government of the Bank's policy to cancel loans which do not become effective within
18 months from Board approval. The Bank then set the deadline for loan effectiveness
for September 14, 1997, or 18 months from the date of Board approval, March 14, 1996.
9.    The loan agreement was submitted to the Ukrainian Parliament for ratification as
required under Ukrainian law but Parliament failed to do so. While the process for



3
submitting the loan agreement to the Parliament was initiated in early 1997, right after
loan signing, a formal vote was not taken until September 18, 1997. The parties opposed
to the Government voted en block against the loan agreement and the Government was
not able to muster sufficient support to overcome this opposition. The Bank notified the
Government on loan termination on September 25, 1997.
Lessons Learned
10.   The experience under this project reflects the difficulty of developing lending
operations at the sub-national government level in a transition economy with a new
borrower such as Ukraine, which is not familiar with Bank operations, and where the
executive branch does not enjoy full cooperation of the legislature. The project was
designed as a small pilot to attempt market oriented approaches to housing provision
while minimizing the risk associated with an uncertain economic outlook which
constrained peoples' ability to afford new housing and the capacity of the cities to incur
debt and manage a Bank project. While the project cities were keen to proceed with the
project, there was not commensurate enthusiasm at the national level since the national
government did not benefit directly from the project and the loan was small. Similarly,
the legislature did not consider this project a high priority because of its size and limited
number of beneficiary cities. Follow up with some legislators indicated that they did not
necessarily oppose the project design but were lukewarm in their support since the project
only benefited Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa. The Bank did not adequately gauge the
legislators' interest in and support for the project.
11.   The introduction of learning and innovation loans and adaptable lending will
assist the Bank and the Government overcome some of the constraints faced in the
Housing Project. A learning and innovation loan would allow the Bank and the
Government to pilot novel approaches as a basis for designing larger interventions. An
adaptable loan will allow the Bank and the Government to agree to a relatively ambitious
project over a multi-year timeframe but start with a smaller, more manageable
intervention in a limited number of cities. A larger program, especially one that leaves
open the possibility of expanding the number of participating cities in the latter stages,
should generate more interest and support both within the executive and the legislative
branches of government.
