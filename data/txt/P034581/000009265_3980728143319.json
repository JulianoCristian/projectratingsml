The loan did not become effective and was\n            terminated on September 25, 1997. The Housing Project was\n            designed to support the development of a housing market in\n            Ukraine by: (a) completing and selling municipal apartments\n            to city residents; (b) promoting formation of homeowners\n            associations and resident take-over of the management and\n            maintenance of their buildings; and (c) furthering housing\n            reform through policy studies. Reasons for termination were\n            as follows: the Bank extended the deadline for loan\n            effectiveness twice to accommodate these delays. At the time\n            of the second extension in June 1997, the Bank notified the\n            Government of the Banks policy to cancel loans which do not\n            become effective within 18 months from Board approval. The\n            Bank then set the deadline for loan effectiveness for\n            September 14, 1997, or 18 months from the date of Board\n            approval, March 14, 1996. The loan agreement was submitted\n            to the Ukrainian Parliament for ratification as required\n            under Ukrainian law but Parliament failed to do so. While\n            the process for submitting the loan agreement to the\n            Parliament was initiated in early 1997, right after loan\n            signing, a formal vote was not taken until September 18,\n            1997. The parties opposed to the Government voted en block\n            against the loan agreement and the Government was not able\n            to muster sufficient support to overcome this opposition.\n            The Bank notified the Government on loan termination on\n            September 25, 1997. Lessons learned were as follows, the\n            experience under this project reflects the difficulty of\n            developing lending operations at the sub-national government\n            level in a transition economy with a new borrower such as\n            Ukraine, which is not familiar with Bank operations, and\n            where the executive branch does not enjoy full cooperation\n            of the legislature."}, "docdt": "1998-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
