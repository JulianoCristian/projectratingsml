Amendment to the Development Credit Agreement
Dear Mr. Minister:
Please refer to the Development Credit Agreements entered into between the 
Republic of Bolivia (the Borrower) and the International Development Association 
(the Association), respectively dated June 2, 1986, September 11, 1986, July 31, 
1987 (Nos. 1809, 1818, 1828 and 1829), August 7, 1987 and March 4, 1988 as 
amended.
The Association has decided to institute a system of variable commitment 
charges on its development credits, set on an annual basis, with a maximum charge 
of 1/2 of 1 percent (0.5%) per annum, which has been the rate of commitment 
charges since their introduction in 1982.  Under the new system, the Association 
will set the commitment charges payable on its development credits on June 30 in 
each year, and, for an initial period, commencing July 1, 1988, the rate has been 
set at zero (0).  The current rate of 1/2 of 1 percent (0.5%) per annum will 
continue to be applicable until June 30, 1988.
To effect these changes, the Association proposes to amend development 
credit agreements already signed. Therefore, the Association hereby amends 
Section 2.04 of each of the Development Credit Agreements entered into between 
the Borrower and the Association for the above-captioned Projects to read as 
follows:
"Section 2.04 (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Association a 
commitment charge on 
the principal amount of the Credit not withdrawn from 
time to time at a rate to be set by 
the Association as of June 30 of each 
year, but not to exceed the rate of one-half of one 
percent (1/2 of 1%) per 
annum.
(b)
The commitment charge shall accrue from a date sixty days 
after the date.of this Agreement to the respective dates on which amounts 
shall be withdrawn by the Borrower from the Credit Account or cancelled at 
the rates set from time to time pursuant to paragraph (a) above. The rate 
set as of June 30 in each year shall be applied as of the next payment date 
in that year specified in Section 2.06 of this Agreement, except that the 
rate set as of June 30, 1988 shall be applied as of July 1, 1988.
(c)
The commitment charge shall be paid: (i) at such places as 
the Association shall reasonably request; (ii) without restrictions of any 
kind imposed by, or in the territory of, the Borrower; and (iii) in the 
currency specified in this Agreement for the purposes of Section 4.02 of 
the General Conditions or in such other eligible currency or currencies as 
may from time to time be designated or selected pursuant to the provisions 
of that Section."
Kindly confirm the agreement of the Borrower to the foregoing by signing 
and dating the enclosed copy of this letter in the space below and returning it 
to us for our files.
Very truly yours,
