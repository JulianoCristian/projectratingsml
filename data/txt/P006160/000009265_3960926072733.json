         programs to improve organization, staff and systems in the\n            following three key areas. First, during the first two\n            principle years of project implementation, reliable and\n            timely financial administration and control systems as well\n            as a core of qualified staff will be functioning in the most\n            important ministries and public entities. Second, the tax\n            administration will be overhauled so that the 1986 tax\n            reform could be implemented. Finally, the financial\n            intermediation system will be improved by restructuring the\n            Central Bank of Bolivia as well as the development Banks."}, "docdt": "1987-05-06T00:00:00Z"}
