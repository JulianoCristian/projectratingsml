A. LIL Justification
1. What is to be learned (why the piloting)?
The Project will test the viability of a distance leaming institution in Burkina Faso and will test the ability
of this approach to accessing international knowledge to: (i) improve the implementation of (a) the PRSP
and/or the PRSC and (b) the IDA-financed projects; and (ii) help coordinate all the local training
institutions in regard to the national capacity building policy.
Despite a lot of expertise in Burkina Faso, there is no means to share information and to exchange success
stories. As reforms require capacity and knowledge, the GDLN would be an essential tool providing a
forum of discussion for decision makers. There is no coherence among the disjointed approaches offered
by the different academic institutions in Burkina Faso. Moreover, trainings abroad are reserved to a few
and are very expensive.
The distance leaming initiative will aim to (a) strengthen the environment for policy reforms and (b) build
capacity in the public and private sectors by increasing local access to global knowledge and specialized
information using internet-based technology. Burkina Faso hosts many training institutions, some of them
offer very good quality trainings. But there is no coherence among all the different curricula and no
coherence between these curricula and the national capacity building policy. The project will try, through
the Development Learning Center, to put in coherence all the courses and training offered by the existing
training institutions (from private and public sectors).
The Development Learning Center will be govemed by a Board including all the main academic
institutions. It also includes the public and private sectors, and the civil society, in particular NGOs.
Therefore, they will try to offer a common and coherent curricula via distance learning. The presence of the
public sector in the Board will ensure the consistency of these courses with the public/private sectors
national capacity building policy.
Distance Leaming will facilitate the increased dissemination of knowledge and cross-country experience in
support of reform. Public and private sector decision-makers will access interactive multimedia training
programs developed by the World Bank Institute, major universities, private corporations and technical
organizations around the world.
2. How are the results going to be used (vis a vis CAS objectives and any follow-on operation)?
Document number: 21285     Date of latest CAS discussion: 11/30/2000
The need to invest in the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) is not explicitly identified in the
current CAS. The Bank agreed to consider providing support in this area at the specific request of the
Government. The approach proposed in this LIL is however consistent with the CAS objectives.
3. Other countries or situations where similar efforts have shown promise.
Managed by the GDLN Services at the World Bank Institute (WBI), the Global Development Learning
Network (GDLN) is looking to expand its clients' access to learning and knowledge by helping other
content providers use distance learning methods that are compatible with GDLN. Typically these providers
are already delivering leaming services to development decision-makers through seminars and similar
events. We are also developing sharing agreements with content providers to access the large number of
established courses and other types of instructional content that are currently available from within the
Bank and from extemal content providers. The courses and materials will be modified as necessary and
provided through the GDLN to DLC clients.
-2 -



The GDLN curriculum contains all topics addressed by WBI courses, such as social security and pension
reform, policies for economic growth, building knowledge and expertise in infrastructure finance, health
sector reform and sustainable health sector financing, water policy reform, social dimensions of
development, economics and business joumalism, environmental economics for development policy, and
macroeconomic management In order to offer clients a wider range of learning opportunities, we are also
working with partners in other divisions of the Bank as well as outside organizations, to help them develop
courses for distance learning.
The GDLN has completed its first year of operation with quite significant success in developing
prcigmraming and content. Already operational in eight countries in Africa and in more than fifteen around
the: world, the Development Learning Centers are today very successful learning tools. After only one year
of operation, the DLC in Dakar has already reached the objectives of the second year in terms of operating
costs recovering, learning program and number of clients. The Centers of Tanzania and Uganda use their
facilities every day and have reached a use rate of almost 80%.
With Mauritania, Guinea and Mozambique, Burkina Faso will benefit from this new learning network as
part of the third phase of the GDLN deployment. Moreover, the Development Learning Center in
Ouagadougou willfbe part of a francophone African DL Center including Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Benin.
These three Centers benefit from a close relationship with the DL Center in Paris which provides courses,
training and seminars of many French institutions such as Bank of France Institute, HEC, etc. Canada also
provides a lot of French content to the GDLN.
B. Structure of the Pilot
1. How will learning take place?
The learning will take place through a pilot distance learning institution which aimed at supporting, in
par.ticular but not only, local efforts to strengthen institutional capacity within the civil service. A larger
number of Govemment staff will be trained through distance learning, and will apply what they have
leamed, improving governance in the public sector. The Pilot will support IDA policy dialogue with
regional decision-makers, hitherto excluded from sector deliberations in Burkina Faso. By convening them
in one forum, it will also facilitate internal debate on the reform agenda. It will help link the regional
decision-makers to the information super highway and facilitate regional input in national planning.
The LIL will likewise test the ability of this approach to enhance private sector efforts to adopt
international principles of corporate governance and train executives in financial and management skills.
Exposure to modem methods of planning, finance and management will enhance corporate governance. The
Pilot will bring together the local public and private sector in high-profile deliberations on issues of national
interest.
One of the main goals of the new Burkina Faso Development Learning Center is to respond to the local
demand in terms of trainings and workshops. After having accurately assess the burkinabe needs, the DLC
Bcard will try to find, through the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) and other DL Centers
in different countries, the best academic institutions or specialists able to deliver adequate trainings and
workshops and so ensure the quality of the courses offered on the GDLN. Another goal is to develop local
couarses production. The GDLN through its Development Learning Centers is a two-ways interactive tool.
Burkinabe experts can provide courses and share their experiences by producing and delivering trainings
and workshops locally from the Burkina Faso DLC.
-3-



The CEDO has been created as a new, completely autonomous entity, and therefore will not benefit from
the facilities of a host institution. The experience in other countries showed that the creation of a DLC as
an autonomous entity within the site of an existing Institution was very often a source of conflict.
Moreover, given the number of Institutions which really were eager to host the CEDO, the choice of the site
would have been a problem and would have delayed the project implementation by months.
2. Outcome-level test to be conducted
The Project will (a) test the viability of this information tool; (b) test the use of new telecommunication
technology tools for building capacity and put in coherence all the trainings and curricula available locally.
The financial states of the CEDO will be audited at the end of the project to assess its viability. A
comparison of the ratio training costs/number of trainees in the administration will be made before and
after the pilot implementation to determine whether the use of the DLC allows a wider access to trainings.
Regular trainees surveys and CEDO activity reports will show how many training institutions use the
Center and the relevance of these training and courses in regard to the national training policy.
3. Steps involved in conducting the pilot
The Pilot will be undertaken utilizing the following steps: (i) identify the local needs in terms of trainings
and capacity building; (ii) promote the content available on the GDLN; (iii) put in coherence the content
offered by the local training institutions; (iv) develop additional partnerships to meet the local needs; (v)
assess the coherence of the trainings and courses offered by the CEDO; (vi) review the financial activities
of the CEDO; (vii) conduct evaluation of the CEDO activities; (viii) analyze and report results.
4. Learning expectations to be documented in the pilot
1 Economic      Z Technical    13 Social      1 Participation
Q Financial     1 Institutional  O Environmental 3 Other
Economic: It is the expectation of the project that increased access to global knowledge will help to
facilitate better policies, improved governance.
The project is also expected to demonstrate an economically viable method of delivering relevant training to
replace the current and expensive practice of sending officials abroad for specialized training or the import
of international trainers. The project will enable more trainees to have access to high-quality traiinig in a
wider variety of fields in Burkina Faso. Moreover, increased training will be provided locally at lower cost
leading to an effective use of funds.
Technical: The project will introduce advanced communications technologies in trainings. This will
increase the use of the Internet in the public sector and introduce administrators to a range of information
technology options. The LIL will support the use of the Internet for policy planning and training purposes.
The project also will introduce state-of-the-art videoconference facilities in Burkina Faso and so bring
knowledge to local engineers in terms of maintenance and concrete use.
Institutional: The CEDO is an autonomous entity run on a commercial basis. Arrangements will be sought
for close partnership with the public and private sectors, donors and global education communities, as well
as civil society. The Pilot will enhance the capacity of all the sectors to manage together a single entity
through its Board and work on achieving the same objectives.
Participation: This LIL relies on a high degree of participation at all levels: (i) active participation of the
local training institutions in the elaboration of the CEDO's strategy through its Board; (ii) participation of
the potential clients in the evaluation of the Pilot by: (a) proposing a panel of courses and training they
need; (b) using the Center when the curriculum meets their needs; (c) assess the quality and the relevance of
-4 -



the trainings offered by the CEDO.
5. Triggers for a follow-on operation
A, follow-on mainstream of this technology, and expansion of the system to include other sites within the
country would be justified if:
* the Pilot Institution reaches its financial sustainability by the fourth year of operations
* the surveys show the ability of the DLC to meet with the local demand
* the surveys show the relevance of the trainings offered by the GDLN
* the project monitoring shows the consistency of the GDLN curriculum and the local needs.
6. Results-based Monitoring and Evaluation System
The monitoring and evaluation framework is partly described in Annex 1. Monitoring will be done at two
levels: the relevance of the trainings and workshops offered by the CEDO and the viability of the
institution.
The overall Monitoring and Evaluation component will be carried out by the PCU (DGEP) at the MED.
The PCU will centralize all the reports and results from the different surveys. The M&E models defined
during project preparation will allow an overview of the CEDO's activities and viability. The M&E
component includes capacity enhancement of the PCU in terms of monitoring and evaluation by contracting
independent entities with significant skills such as universities, research centers, etc.
The CEDO management will assess the quality of its curriculum through a survey among the attendees
(form to be filled at the end of a session or a training) on a monthly basis. The model will be defined with
the assistance of the Board and of the PCU. It will include qualitative indicators. The Center management
will also monitor the relevance of its curriculum through a survey to be made among its clients. This survey
will have to assess the ability of the CEDO (and the GDLN) to respond to the local demand. The data and
results of these surveys will be transmitted to the PCU.
Quarterly reports will be made by the CEDO to monitor both financial sustainability and overall use of the
CEDO. Monitoring indicators will be mostly quantitative and financial and will show the number of
trining institutions that are involved in the curriculum development, the number of organizations using the
CEDO and the ratio public/private/civil society among the clients. The PCU will collect the reports and
give its feedback to the CEDO Board.
C. Project Components and Implementation Arrangements
1. L1L Components
This LIL has three main components: (i) CEDO's construction and equipment; (ii) Support of the CEDO's
operations during three years; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation of the Pilot conducted by the Project
Coordination Unit at the MED. The first component is financed through a Project Pireparation Facility
(FIPF). The Credit will only finance the Center's operations during the first three years of operations on a
decreasing basis. The first year, the Credit will cover 80% of the Center's operating costs. The second year,
it will cover 60%, and the third year 40%.
The first component will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit at the MED. This component is
entirely financed through the PPF.
- 5 -



The second cornponent will start with the credit effectiveness. The CEDO staff must be recruited before the
credit effectiveness and so, during the construction of the Center to let the Director: (i) hire his own team
and be ready by the end of the Center installation; (ii) make his business-plan based on a market survey.
During this transition period all the staff salaries and operating costs are financed by the PPF.
The management staff of the CEDO will elaborate a business-plan which will describe the management
policy of the Center. The business-plan will help the CEDO to reach financial sustainability by the fourth
year of implementation.
The third component will be implemented by the Project Coordination. A simple and practical monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) system would be established to ensure qualitative and quantitative feedback on
project performance.

2. Implementation Arrangements
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) is located at the Direction Generale des Etudes et de la
Planification (DGEP) in the Ministere du Developpement Economique (MED). The PCU is in charge of
conducting the first and the third components implementation. The second component will be implemented
by the CEDO.
The CEDO is an Association governed by a Board. The legal statutes of the CEDO and the composition of
its Board has been adopted and ratified by the Burkinabe authorities. A Director, in charge of the CEDO's
management, will be appointed by the Board before the Credit Effectiveness. The Director, selected
through a competitive process, will hire the CEDO's staff (a facilitator, a technician, an accountant and an
administrative assistant).
The Board comprises representatives of the public and private sectors, as well as the civil society. The
Board will: (i) monitor the CEDO's management team activities; and (ii) ensure that CEDO's activities and
services are in adequacy with the objectives of the Pilot.

a. Procurement
A procurement assessment will be carried out by a Bank procurement accredited staff once CEDO is
established and in any case, befdioe Credit effectiveness. In the meantime, some mitigating measures are
proposed (see details in Annex 6; paragraph 4). The Administrative Assistant of the Center will be in
charge of the procurement relaled matters during the implementation and will need to attend the
Piocurement Workshops organized annually by the Region.
b. Financial Management
Bofore the negotiations, an action plan for the establishment of a financial management system was agreed
on between the Bank and the CEI0. This system which will cover cash management, accounting, internal
control and financial reporting will be fully in place prior to project effectiveness. It will be established by
the CEDO before Credit effectivehess and acceptable to IDA, and will provide the CEDO and IDA with
accurate and timely information regarding resources and expenditures. In addition, before effectiveness a (i)
full-time project accountant/finantcial management specialist will be hired by the CEDO, and (ii) an
external audit firm will be contracted.
Before credit effectiveness, all tirancial and accounting matters will be handled by the PCU at the MED.
ToRs for the financial assessmelihT have already been provided to the PCU. The assessment should start
before July 15, 2002.-

Annex 2: Detailed Project Description
BURKINA FASO: Development Leaming Center Project
By Component:
ProJect Component I - US$1.20 million
Construction and Establishment of the CEDO: the project preparation will include the following
activities
(a) building facilities on its own site in Ouaga 2000 for establishment of the CEDO, including:
(i) a videoconference room with a 30-person capacity;
(ii) a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations (hardware, software and Intemet
hook-up);
(iii) a technical and administrative center; and
(iv) mechanical outfitting such as installation and/or upgrading of electrical and telephone
wiring.
(b) equipment of the CEDO, including
(i) a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) (satellite communication terminal);
(ii) video, telecommunications and microprocessor equipment;
(iii) office and classroom furniture; and
(iv) various other equipment for CEDO operation and security.
The Ministry of Economic Development (MED) is responsible for the establishment of the CEDO and
the construction of the Center. It will also be responsible for the project coordination and ensuring the
participation of the public and private sectors and donor community in project monitoring and training
development activities (through the CEDO's Board). The MED will conduct the Monitoring and
'Evaluation component of the Pilot.
So that distance learning activities could begin as soon as possible after project effectiveness, project
preparation included establishment of the CEDO (legal procedures, formation of the CEDO's Board,
recruitment of Director and staff) and preparation and equipment of the site (classrooms,
videoconference room, computer room, administrative offices, etc. Project preparation activities are
handled by the Ministry of Economic Development with the assistance of Faso Baara, for works,
equipment, institutional aspects and studies. These activities'have been funded through a Project
]'reparation Facility (PPF) advance. In addition, the Bank, through its Information Solution Group
(ISG) Department, will provide assistance and expertise to procure, install and test videoconferencing
equipment.
Projoct Component 2 - US$1.00 million
S'upport for CEDO's Operation: This component aims to assist the CEDO begin operation and
become financially viable. It includes:
(a) financing of CEDO operation costs on a decreasing basis over the first three years of operation;
(b) purchase of a vehicle to facilitate transport and marketing of CEDO services; and
(c) technical assistance for the training of Center staff, periodic evaluation of Center operation and
management effectiveness, and establishment of financial accounts and their annual audit.
T'his component will be implemented by the CEDO, established as an autonomous nonprofit agency (an
- 13 -



Association) and located in Ouaga 2000. It is considered a nonprofit association in recognition of its
role in promoting advances in policy, culture and technology among a wide range of actors.
The CEDO is governed by a Board, comprising representatives of the Ministries of Economic
Development, Finance and Education, academic institutions, the private sector and civil society
(cultural associations, the media, etc.), and chaired-by an official elected from among the members. The
CEDO's Board will oversee project implementation, through its executive secretariat. The Board is
charged with monitoring CEDO management and deciding CEDO development policy, approving the
annual business plan and program of activities, assessing the Center's financial statements and
providing recommendations to help the Center become financially self-sustaining.
Daily management of the CEDO will be entrusted to a Director selected on the basis of proven
experience in enterprise management or management of similar educational entities. The Director will
be assisted by a team consisting of a technician (computer specialist with telecommunications
knowledge), a facilitator/trainer, an experienced accountant and an office assistant.
Upon taking office, the Director will prepare a business plan based on a survey of training requests
from the public and private sectors. The business plan, to be submitted for CEDO Board and IDA
review and approval, will include: market data, budget and sources of financing, training and other
services to be provided (lectures, seminars, other), source and programming of training, rates for
different types of training and financial projections in the form of a budget, operating account and
marketing strategy. The business plan will be updated and submitted for IDA and CEDO Board review
and approval on an annual basis. To this effect, the implementing agency will continue to assess
demand for training, identify and program appropriate training courses, market the services of the
CEDO and increase its visibility in Burkina Faso and abroad.
For the first year of project implementation, most training courses will be selected from those offered
by the World Bank Institute through its Global Development Learning Network. However, over the
first year, the CEDO management team will identify and establish contacts with a variety of other
training institutions capable of providing training over the GDLN. Over subsequent years, the CEDO
will match demand for training to the most appropriate supplier institution, both in terms of course
content and schedule availability.
Project Component 3 - USS 0.10 million
Monitoring and Evaluation of the Pilot: this component will include the following activities:
(a) monitor the CEDO activities;
(b) evaluate the Pilot achievements and performance indicators.
This component will be implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at the MED. The PCU will
monitor the CEDO's activities and look at the Pilot performance indicators. The PCU will establish a
simple and practical monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to ensure qualitative and quantitative
feedback on project implementation.
The PCU with the assistance of the Board and the CEDO's management team will define a monitoring
model and monthly reports on CEDO's activities. Quarterly and in particular during the mid-term review,
the PCU will report on the overall Pilot implementation.

Annex 4: Financial Management
BURKINA FASO: Development Leaming Center Project
Government countermarts
The Government's counterpart funds needed to cover 15% of local costs of goods and civil works,
and 10% of local costs of consultant services, will be deposited by the Government in a Project
Account at a Commercial Bank acceptable to IDA. The Government will make an initial deposit of
F CFA 73 million (US$150.000) representing about a year of project expenditures which will be a
condition to project effectiveness, and will subsequently replenish the account on a yearly basis.
The Government counterparts will also include the financing of a three-year subsidy to the new
postal entity.
Financial Management
Before the negotiations, an action plan for the establishment of a basic financial management
system was agreed on between the Bank and the DLC. This system which will cover cash
management, accounting, internal control and financial reporting will be fully in place prior to
project effectiveness. It will be established by the DLC and acceptable to IDA, and will provide
the DLC and IDA with accurate and timely information regarding resources and expenditures. In
addition, before effectiveness a (i) full-time project accountant/financial management specialist will
be hired by the DLC, and (ii) an extemal audit firm will be contracted.
Accountin
Intemal account controls for the project will be set out in detail in the financial procedures of the
Manuals of Procedures to be satisfactory for providing reasonable assurances that accounts are
properly recorded and resources safeguarded. The accounting system for the DLC will be
computerized using appropriate software before project effectiveness.
Financial reportina
The Project will provide Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) every six months. The annual
financial statements of the project will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and will include (i) sources and uses of funds, (ii) use of funds by project
activities (iii) procurement progress report, and (iv) review of physical progress. The audited
financial statements will be submitted to IDA no later than six months after the end of the fiscal
year. The computerized accounting system will be customized to ease generate the FMRs required.
Before the effectiveness of the Credit, the project will be assessed by a certified financial
management specialist on the project team whether the project can function by using Financial
Monitoring Reports (FMRs) based on traditional disbursements methods. There is a need to ensure
that the systems put in place will be operating effectively. The monitoring and evaluation process
will include output monitoring reports which are consistent with the FMRs requirements.
Auditing
The financial statements of the project will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to
IDA. One auditor will be appointed for the entire life of the project and his selection will be a
-17 -



condition of effectiveness.
The auditor will provide an opinion on:
(a) the project's financial statements
(b) statement of expenditures (SOEs)
(c) special account
(d) project account,
(e) project own revenues,
and will issue a management report on internal controls outlining any recommendation for
improving internal controls system (accounting and assets safeguard).

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
BURKINA FASO: Development Leaming Center Project
Procurement
General
The Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) carried out in March - November 1999
and published in November 2000 includes recommendations to: (i) create a procurement system
based on efficiency, competition and transparency; (ii) simplify procedures; train and provide
accreditation to procurement officials. The CPAR also recommended that the General
Procurement Decree be overhauled as to reduce single-tender contracting; introduce flexibility
for small contracts with SMEs; and combat corruption. As a result, the Govemement has taken
aggressive steps and has issued a new procurement code which has been found in the whole
soundly configured. The new code does not conflict with IDA Guidelines, and allows IDA
procedures to take precedence over any contrary provision in national laws and regulations.
National Competitive Bidding (NCB), advertised locally, would be carried out in accordance with
Burkina procurement laws and regulations acceptable to IDA, provided that: (i) all bidders are
given sufficient time to submit bids (four weeks); (ii) bid evaluation and bidder qualification are
clearly specified in bidding documents; (iii) no margin of preference is granted to domestic
contractors and manufacturers; (iv) no bid is rejected during bid opening; (v) eligible firms are not
precluded from participation; and (vi) award is made to the lowest evaluated bid to the bidder
who meets the appropriate standards of capability and resources in accordance with
predetermined criteria specified in the bidding documents.
Guidelines
1.    Procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for
procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (published in 1995 and updated in January and August
1996 and in September 1997 and January 1999). The Bank's standard bidding documents for goods and
civil works will be used for ICB. Consultant services contracts will be procured in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Selection of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (published in January 1997 and
updated in September 1997 and January 1999). The Bank's Standard Request for Proposals will be used
and fonns of contracts as needed as well as the Sample Form of Evaluation Report for Selection of
Consultants. The DLC and the PCU will use standard Faso Baara bidding documents for goods and civil
works approved recently by IDA (February 2001) for NCB.
Procurement Notices
2.     A General Procurement Notice (GPN) with pertinent information on estimated contract
opportunities scheduled during the next twelve months will be published in the UN Development Business
(UNDB) after Board approval. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) for goods and works contracts will be
advertised in a national paper of wide circulation and the UNDB where appropriate. Individual contracts
for consulting firms are estimated below US$200 000, consequently, the request for expression-of interest
will be published only in a national paper of wide circulation. However, if foreign firms express interest,
they will not be excluded from consideration.

Procurement Implementation Arrangements
3.     The Center will be implemented by the Centre d'Enseignement ai Distance de Ouagadougou
(CEDO), headed by a Board, under the Ministry of Economic Development (MED). The Ministry has
already extensive experience with managing Bank projects and its staff is familiar with Bank procedures.
However, the Director of CEDO will be assisted by an Office Assistant who has procurement experience to
monitor procurement activities and ensure timely project execution.
Capacity assessment
4.     CEDO was not in place yet and its capacity could not be assessed at the time of appraisal.
However, as all major procurement would be taken care of under the PPF, it is expected that procurement
would be minimal and will involve very small amounts. In addition, the overall capacity of the Ministry of
Finance has been found commensurate with the activities to be implemented under the credit. Nevertheless,
there is risk that there would still be some procurement anticipated under the PPF, yet to be pursued
before Credit effectiveness. Mitigating measures to address the risk include (i) the hiring before Credit
effectiveness of an Office Assistant who has procurement experience (ii) training on contract management
and on the new features of Bank procedures related to the hiring of Consultants (iii) proper coverage of
procurement under the Operational Manual to be finalized by Credit Effectiveness. In addition, as most
procurement under the credit would be done through shopping, CEDO shall have a proper filing system to
ensure that all records are properly maintained for easy retrieval and reviewed by supervision missions and
auditors. The capacity assessment will be carried out once CEDO is in place and in any case, before
Credit effectiveness.
Civil Works (US$0.12 Million)
5.     Main civil works are financed under the PPF for an amount of $450,000 and will start in July
2002. The procurement and supervision of works will be conducted by the Faso Baara agency. Faso Baara
signed a Convention of Delegated Management with the MED to procure and supervise the construction
and installation of the Center. All the contracts signed under this Convention will be financed under the
PPF.
The project main civil works component under the Credit will be the maintenance and improvement of the
CEDO facilities. These contracts estimated to cost less than US$30,000, equivalent, up to an aggregate
amount of US$120,000, would be procured under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors invited in writing to bid. The invitation shall
include a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a
basic form of agreement acceptable to IDA, and relevant drawings where applicable. The awards will be
made to the contractors who offer the lowest price quotation for the required work, provided they
demonstrate they have the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully.
Goods (US$0.12 Million)
6.     Most of goods will be procured under the PPF. Satellite and informatic equipment will be
procured with the assistance of ISG department of the World Bank. Furniture and other goods necessary to
the Center installation will be procured under the Convention of Delegated Management signed with Faso
Baara.
- 21 -



Goods financed under the project's Credit would include a vehicle, additional computers, and equipment for
the implementing agency. Prudent shopping based on written price quotations obtained from at least three
reliable suppliers can be used for small quantities of goods, provided that: (a) these goods cannot be
grouped into packages of at least US$50,000; and (b) the aggregate amount does not exceed US$120,000.
7.     The above aggregate for non-ICB procurement methods for goods and works are limitative and
cannot be exceeded without the prior no-objection of the Bank. The procurement unit responsible for the
project will maintain a tracking system to monitor such procurement in order to alert the Bank timely when
this may occur.
Consulting services and Training (US$03 Million)
8.     The project will finance consultant services provided by firms to assist the DL Center to (i)
organize workshops and seminars (ii) provide assistance in the Monitoring and Evaluation, and (iii) finance
the key personnel's salaries. Except as otherwise indicated, The Quality and Cost Based Selection (QCBS)
method will be used for consulting assignments carried out by firms. Services for supervision of works
contracts, and the organization of a National Workshop and other training assignments to be carried out by
firms or training institutions, estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$50,000, may be awarded
based on Consultant qualifications. For audit contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
US$50,000, the Least-Cost Selection (LCS) will be the most appropriate method: the firm with the lowest
price will be selected, provided technical proposals received the minimal score
9.     Short-lists of consultants for contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$100,000
may be comprised entirely of national consultants, if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three)
are locally available at competitive cost.
10.    Services for small assignments, studies, organization of or lecturing at seminars, workshops or
study tours which can be carried out by individual consultants including consultants recruited as DLC key
staff, will be selected through comparison of qualification and experience among those expressing interest
in the assignment or approached directly.
Operating Costs (USSO.6 Million)
11.    The project will finance the DLC operating costs on a decreasing basis. The credit will cover 80%
of the DLC operating costs the first year, 60% the second year, and 40% the third year. The operating costs
will include: (i) the support staff salary; (ii) the payment of the satellite bandwidth; (iii) the maintenance of
the Network/Communication equipment; (iv) the purchase of office supply; (v) the maintenance and
operation of the vehicle.
The procurement methods and related amounts are summarized in table A below.

IDA reviews
12.    Goods and works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more will be subject
to prior review by IDA. All other contracts will be subject to post review during supervision missions and
audits.
13.   Consultant services : All contracts with consulting firms exceeding US$100,000 equivalent; and
with individual consultants exceeding US$50,000 equivalent will be subject to prior review. For contracts
with firms above US$50,000, but less than US$100,000, IDA will be notified of the results of the
itechnical evaluation before the financial envelops are opened. All other contracts will be subjected to post
review. However, this exception for prior review will not apply to terms of references of such contracts, to
single source selection of consultants, amendments of contracts with firms raising the contract value to
!US$100,000, amendments of contracts with individuals raising the contract value to US$50,000, and to
oontracts for audits. For training abroad or in the country, the program containing names of candidates,
cost estimates, courses, period of training and institutions selected would be reviewed by IDA
semi-annually. Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold levels will apply to about

one in five contracts during supervision missions, and procurement audits.
14. The Office assistant/Procurement specialist, the financial management agents and the Heads of DLC
will be recruited with IDA no-objection based on comparison of at least three resumes.
15.    As a condition for- effectiveness, the Government will submit to IDA: (a) a Project Operations
Manual with a specific section on procurement detailing (i) procedures for planning, calling for bids,
selecting contractors, suppliers and consultants, and (b) a Project Implementation Plan and a procurement
plan for the first year of operations.
16.    The Government has given assurances at negotiations that it will: (a) use the Project Operations
Manual and Project Implementation Plan for. Project Implementation (b) use Bank standard bidding
documents for ICB; and requests for proposal and models of contracts for consultant services (c) apply the
procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the above documents; The Government has agreed
on the principle that the Manual of Procedures will only be modified with prior IDA approval.

Disbursement
The IDA credit will be disbursed against (i) for goods and civil works: 100% of foreign expenditure, 80%
of local expenditures; (ii) for consultants, including training and workshops: 80% of expenditures; and for
(iii) operating costs: 80% of expenditures the first year.
The IDA Credit will be disbursed from October 10, 2002, to December 31, 2006. The estimated
disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit is:

The project is expected to be completed over a three-year period according to the categories shown in Table
B above, and the Credit closing date would be six months after the third year to allow payment of last
invoices for contracts completed before the completion time. Government counterpart funds needed for
each fiscal year to cover the share of recurrent costs not financed by IDA will be deposited by the
Government in a Project Account managed by the CEDO on a semi-annual basis.
Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). Disbursements for all expenditures would be made against
full documentation, except for items of expenditures for. (a) contracts for consulting firns in an amount
inferior to US$100,000 equivalent, (b) contracts for individual consultants in an amount inferior to
US$50,000 equivalent, and (c) contracts for works and goods, in an amount inferior to US$100,000 and
operating costs, which would be claimed on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting
documentation for SOEs would be retained at a suitable location at the CEDO and readily accessible for
review by periodic IDA supervision, missions and external auditors.
SFiecial Account. To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications,
the CEDO would open a Special Account in FCFA in a commercial bank on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA. The Special Account would finance all project expenditures and the authorized
allocation would be 160,000,000 FCFA and would cover about six months of eligible expenditures. Upon
credit effectiveness, IDA would deposit the amount of 80,000,000 FCFA into the Special Account
representing fifty percent of the authorized allocations. The remaining balance would be made available
whlen the aggregate amnount of withdrawals from the credit account plus the total amount of all outstanding
special commitments entered into by the Association shall be equal or exceed the equivalent of $1 million.
- 25 -



The Special Account would be used for all payments inferior to twenty percent of the authorized allocation
and replenishment applications would be submitted monthly. Further deposits by IDA into the Special
Account would be made against withdrawal applications supported by appropriate documents.
