Some lessons learned included:\n            strong support from the government is another key success\n            factor for a Global Development Learning Network (GDLN)\n            center to become a well recognized and well utilized\n            capacity building facility, since the primary target\n            audience of a GDLN center consists of senior policy makers\n            within the public administration. In other countries, the\n            Governments have provided continuous support through the\n            sponsoring of learning activities and the promotion of the\n            center's services across the ministries and the major\n            administrations. Moreover, a government should not invest\n            into a GDLN center unless it has allocated sufficient budget\n            funds to develop and implement a clear national capacity\n            building strategy. Although participation in a number of\n            GDLN learning events can be sponsored by donor agencies, it\n            is essential that key ministries and governmental agencies\n            have an annual budget for training and capacity building\n            activities, part of which can be organized through the local\n            GDLN center."}, "docdt": "2009-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
