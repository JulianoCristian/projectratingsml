This component\n            has been financed by the Project Preparation Facility (PPF),\n            so that distance learning activities could start immediately\n            after project effectiveness; 2) support for CEDO's\n            operation, by financing operating costs on a decreasing\n            basis over the first three years of operation; and, by\n            providing technical assistance for staff training, to\n            conduct periodic evaluations on the Center's operation,\n            and management, as well as for the establishment of\n            financial accounts, and annual auditing; and, 3) monitoring\n            and evaluation of CEDO's activities, and the pilot\n            achievements and performance indicators, respectively."}, "docdt": "2002-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
