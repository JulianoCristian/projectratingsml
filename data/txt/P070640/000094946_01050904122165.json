Programmatic Financial Sector\n            Adjustment Loan Project, aims at raising efficiency in\n            financial intermediation, and broaden access to financial\n            services, by improving the infrastructure of credit contract\n            enforcement, debtor information, and the payments system, in\n            addition to fostering securities market development, and\n            reducing government-imposed intermediation costs. Moreover,\n            the project will enhance financial system transparency, and\n            the effectiveness of regulation, and supervision, for both\n            the banking system, and securities market, by strengthening\n            prudential norms, and their enforcement, and by enhancing\n            the institutional capacity of supervisory agencies. Steps to\n            bolster defenses against financial crisis include improved\n            functionality of key components of the safety net - bank\n            failure resolution, and deposit insurance system - and,\n            effective contingency crisis planning. Notwithstanding the\n            benefits of efficient financial intermediation, and sound\n            banking systems, macroeconomic risks may hamper the reform\n            consensus, and, institutional weakness, particularly that of\n            the regulatory institutions in capital markets, pension, and\n            insurance, may suffer setbacks."}, "docdt": "2001-04-26T00:00:00Z"}
