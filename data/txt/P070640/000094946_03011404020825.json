convey satisfactory project\n            outcomes, likely sustainability, and modest institutional\n            development impacts. Several lessons are drawn from the\n            project outcome as follows. It was felt that the\n            programmatic approach gave greater flexibility to introduce\n            new items to the agenda, and reassess reform priorities\n            within the programmatic agenda, which indeed allowed for\n            building a better, and genuine partnership, and dialogue\n            with the Government. This led in turn to a strong Government\n            commitment, and ownership of the program, which was a\n            determining factor in the highly satisfactory implementation\n            of reforms in the financial sector. Moreover, the early\n            in-depth analysis by the Bank of financial sector issues,\n            and vulnerabilities helped to speed up the loan design of\n            the program, and the preparation of the project, which\n            included numerous financial sector experts, who maintained a\n            productive dialogue with the Government. This work had been\n            initiated in 1995-1996, and deepened by the multi-focused\n            analytic and advisory activities, which helped identify key\n            issues, relevant for the Brazilian experience. Likewise, the\n            accompanying technical assistance was a key element in\n            building dialogue, and in several areas of reform. However,\n            the poverty reduction objective could have been addressed\n            more directly, specifically through policy reforms with more\n            immediate impacts, adding greater sensitivity by the Bank to\n            the assessment of political factors regarding the design of\n            significant legislation."}, "docdt": "2002-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
