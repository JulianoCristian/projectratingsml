A.     Summary

1.     The pur pose of t his r estructure i s t o e xtension of t he c losing d ate b y t welve
months J une 30, 2012 i n a ccordance with B P 13.30 a nd t o reallocation of f inancing
proceeds pursuant to BP 12.00. This is the first restructuring for the operation.


B.     Project Status

2.       IDA C redit i n t he a mount of S DR 7.3 m illion w as pr ovided t o i mprove t he
soundness of t he M ozambican banking s ector a nd t o i mprove publ ic de bt m anagement.
This is being supported by (i) strengthening the banking sector, including improving the
institutional capacity of the Bank of Mozambique; (ii) improving financial accountability
and transparency; (iii) strengthening public debt management; and (iv) improving money
and government bond market efficiency and depth.

3.      The project, while performing reasonably well overall, has been rated moderately
satisfactorily due to delay in the procurement process for some of the larger consulting
contracts, change in the administration of the project implementing unit, and legislative
measures that were required under some of the components as described in the following
section. T hese issues have been resolved and the project is now in accelerated pace of
implementation; however, a twelve month extension of closing date is needed to allow
for t he c ompletion of t hese de layed a ctivities. T o t hat e nd, t he G overnment of
Mozambique ha s s ubmitted t he a ttached a r equest f or pr oject e xtension. N o a dditional
financing is requested and this extension request will not result in a change of indicators
but will result in a reallocation among cost categories.

4.     Specifically, the following provides the activities that remain to be undertaken for
each component:

           •   Component I: C apacity Building f or Bank of M ozambique: There a re a
               number of p ending i tems unde r e xisting c ontracts t hat w ill ne ed s ome
               more time to b e c ompleted w hich in clude: ( i) a ssistance to th e B ank o f
               Mozambique on t he i mplementation of International F inancial R eporting
               Standards, a s w ell a s t he s upport t o i ts I T a nd H R de partments; ( ii)
               completing t he work on t he e -banking a nd a nti-money l aundry (AML)
               regulations following the passage of the relevant legislation; (iii) finalizing
               the t echnical a ssistance on i mplementation of Basel II accords, and on
               bank sector “stress testing”.

                2009. W hile the technical assistance has been in place since then, more
                time will be needed to ensure that the staff at the Tax Authority have the
                skills a nd s ystems i n pl ace t o pr operly pr ocess a nd a ssess IFRS -
                compliant r eturns f rom t he c orporate s ector w hich w ill be gin t his year.
                Furthermore, work with medium enterprises has only recently commenced
                and therefore there will be need to ensure a smooth transition for medium
                enterprises t o IFRS t hrough t raining, di ssemination, a nd t echnical
                assistance.

            •   Component III: Strengthening Public Debt Management: This component
                is rated satisfactory and planned activities are substantially completed.

            •   Component IV: Improving M oney a nd D ebt M arket a nd F inancial
                Infrastructure: The activities r elated t o t he B ank o f M ozambique ar e o n

9.       The e xtension of t he c losing da te i s r equested in or der t o be a ble t o c onclude
certain project activities. The project, while performing reasonably well overall, has been
rated m oderately s atisfactorily as t here h ad be en a num ber of de lays i n s ome of t he
activities envisaged. Delays were caused by two factors: 1) lengthy procurement process
for s ome o f t he l arger c onsulting c ontracts, a nd 2) l egislative m easures required und er
related to A ML and IFRS a ctivities. W ith all th e ma jor c ontracts n ow in p lace,
legislative m easures approved a nd a ne w coordinator a s of December 2 010, t here ha s
been a n acceleration i n t he pa ce o f i mplementation. N onetheless, a n e xtension i s s till
needed to provide the necessary time to complete activities which in turn would help in
achieving t he P DO a nd a s ubsequent upg rade of t he pr oject t o s atisfactory s tatus. T o
that end, the government of Mozambique has submitted the attached request for a twelve
month pr oject extension. N o additional f inancing i s r equested. T he e xtension w ill not
result in a ch ange of indicators but will result in a reallocation among cost categories as
detailed above.
