The project, while performing reasonably well\n            overall, has been rated moderately satisfactorily due to\n            delay in the procurement process for some of the larger\n            consulting contracts, and change in the administration of\n            the project implementing unit. These issues have been\n            resolved and the project is now in accelerated pace of\n            implementation; however, a twelve month extension of closing\n            date is needed to allow for the completion of these delayed\n            activities. To that end, the Government of Mozambique has\n            submitted the attached a request for project extension. No\n            additional financing is requested and this extension request\n            will not result in a change of indicators but will result in\n            a reallocation among cost categories."}, "docdt": "2011-05-27T00:00:00Z"}
