                         The project has performed well overall. Its support to the Government and sector has clearly contributed to assuring the continued soundness of the banking sector. Its extensive
                         and long running technical assistance support has also resulted in a much more robust public debt management capacity and improved public debt management. This is borne out
                         by the achievement (fully or largely) of the vast majority of indicators in the four PDO areas of (i) strengthening the banking sector, including improving the institutional capacity of the
                         Bank of Mozambique, (ii) improving financial accountability and transparency, (iii) strengthening public debt management and (iv) improving money and government bond market

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The project has performed well overall. The agenda for strengthening Mozambique's financial system, especially in promoting greater access and financial inclusion, remains
                         relevant and ongoing and will require continued leadership from the Government's side as well as follow-up technical assistance from international partners which is already in
                         process.
