major\n            objectives are the development and mobilization of local\n            resources and the strengthening of local institutions\n            responsible for the rural water supply and sanitation sector\n            through financing part of the Government's rural water\n            supply and sanitation program. The project's rural\n            water supply component provides for about 10,000 protected\n            wells with pumps and 400 communal faucet systems benefitting\n            about 1.5 and 0.2 million persons, respectively. The rural\n            sanitation component provides for sanitary disposal of\n            excreta for some 750,000 rural households (4.5 million\n            persons) and is supported with health education and water\n            quality surveillance. The project also includes research,\n            training, and consulting services for rural water supply and\n            sanitation works. Technical assistance is also provided for\n            the preparation of high priority flood control, drainage and\n            solid wastes management projects."}, "docdt": "1982-09-30T00:00:00Z"}
