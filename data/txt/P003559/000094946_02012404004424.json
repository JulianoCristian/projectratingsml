The project has successfully\n            achieved its objectives. Agricultural development and\n            project implementation suffered from the severe floods in\n            both 1994 and 1998. Some lessons drawn from this project\n            include: 1) Strong, stable and consistent management both\n            for the Borrower and the Bank is essential for the\n            successful implementation of institutional development\n            projects. 2) In multi-province projects, special\n            arrangements and greater autonomy in project procurement\n            needs to be given to the individual provinces in the\n            interests of appropriate equipment procurement and good\n            accountability. 3) Project staff should receive more\n            substantial training in contract management, International\n            Competitive Bidding and World Bank procurement procedures at\n            or before project commencement. 4) The project Special\n            Account is intended to provide some accelerated\n            reimbursement of expenditures made from local counterpart\n            funds and can only operate effectively if it is managed by\n            the agency responsible. 5) Adequate funding and priority has\n            to be given to monitoring and evaluation if project\n            management is to have up to date and good information for\n            project operation."}, "docdt": "2001-12-17T00:00:00Z"}
