MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recomnenda-
tion on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of China for
SDR 83.7 million ($115.0 million equivalent' to help finance the Agricultural
Support Services Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms,
with a maturity of 35 years. The proceeds of the development credit would be
onlent to the provinces or municipalities of Beijing, Gu-ngxi, Hebei,
Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jilin, Liaoning, thaanxi, Shanghai, and
Sichuan for 20 years, including six years of grace, with interest at 4 percent
per annum. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by the provincial govern-
ments.
2.        Backaround.  China's decade-long rural reform program, with its
introduction of the production responsibility system (PRS), revitalized the
agricultural sector, increased producsr prices and enlarged the role of the
market. The agricultural GNP increased at 6 percent per annum during the
1978-91 period in real terms. While significant growth in grain production
was achieved in the early part of the period, stagnating grain production in
later years (in the 375-400 million ton range) has been the Government's cen-
tral concern, and major efforts have been made to increase grain production.
They appear to have had considerable success in the last two years, with grain
productior. of 445 and 435 million tons, respectively, in 1990 and 1991. The
Government's strategy to increase grain production includes diverse measures,
such as increasing state investment in agriculture, mainly in irrigation reha-
bilitation and expansion, restoring saline and alkaline land, and introducing
reforms in grain procurement, distribution, prices and subsidies. Production
of cash crops and livestock increased at spectacular rates over the 1978-91
period.
3.        Agricultural development under the existing support structure, how-
ever, appears to be fully exploiting current technologies, and significant
incremental production will require more effective technical services. The
Government realizes that the present crop and livestock support services are
weak and that the institutions which provide these services need to be
strengthened. Recent changes to the PRS have also created new types of com-
mercially oriented clients who are decision-makers and demand better produc-
tion technologies and support services. Crop and livestock services need to
improve in response to these new demands from farmers.
4.        Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  Lessons learned from
closely related completed projects have been used in the design of this proj-
ect. Emphasis has been given to strengthening and linking institutions from
national to local levels through improved management and information systems.
Another lesson incorporated in the design of the project is that equipping and
training lower level institutions should be a major project thrust. Previous
Bank projects have found it important to provide during project development



for extensive policy dialogue with the Government on reforms. Accordingly,
dialogue on restructuring extension and research systems and introducing *ost
recovery for services are continuing in the context of this project. In line
with the experience of other projects, emphasis would be given to equipment
and instrument maintenance, inventories of spares and equipment operator
training.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project is designed to
address the weaknesses of the present crop and livestock support services.
The project would benefit from cross-regional experierae and lessons learnt
from previous Bank/IDA operations in agricultural support services projects.
IDA involvement would provide financial and technical assistance to the Gov-
ernment to review institutional weaknesses systematically, evaluate the total
system from national to local levels, including linkages, and develop correc-
tive measures, including a substantial reorganization and streamlining of the
support services of th. Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). Tne project would
introduce new tools, such as management information systems for better plan-
ning, coordination and evaluation; would strengthen human resources dev,lop-
ment; and would provide facilities required by the reorganized services. The
strengthening of animal and plant quarantine services would expose staff to
international practices, ignorance of which is a major deficiency at the
moment.  IDA involvement would provide guidelines and encouragement for the
development of demand-driven adaptive research, cost recovery in support ser-
vices and commercialization of seed and other services. The strengthened crop
and livestock extension system in the project jurisdictions would be used as
models for other areas across China.
6.        Proiect Objectives.  The project's main objective is to assist the
Government in increasing agricultural production and farmers' incomes. This
would be achieved by strengthening institutions that provides support services
to farmers. The project would increase the efficiency of their operations and
the effectiveness of their research, extension and other programs. Emphasis
would be given to the participation of women in support service3s activities,
the training of women extension workers, and the establishment of farmer asso-
ciations. The indirect result of this improvement in institutions and pro-
grams would be to increase the productivity and intensity of crop and live-
stock production.
7.        Prolect DescriDtion.  The project would provide, over six years,
support for improvement of the agricultural support services which cater to
the needs of the farmers. The project would (i) strengthen agricultural,
animal husbandry, and animal and plant quarantine management capability
through improved information, computer networking and monitoring and .valua-
tion systems; (ii) reorganize the agricultural technical extension system from
national to county level; set up new extension, training and communications
units to accelerate technology dissemination and farmer training; and estab-
lish extension linkages with research institutes, agricultural universities
and farmers; (iii) strengthen agricultural extension services by providing
necessary facilities (construction/extension of laboratories, offices, stores;
procurement of essential scientific, office, farm, processing, publication,
audiovisual/training, and transportation equipment and materials); and upgrad-
ing staff skills through in-service, diploma, degree training, overseas and
local study tours; and technical assistance; (iv) strengthen the Agrotechnical
Extension Centers' (ATECs') ability to both tailor general recommendations to



- 3 -
local needs through adaptive research and technology testing and also address
farm-level problems through demand-driven research programming; (v) reorganize
seed centers to separate seed production from certification and regulation and
suosequently strengthen their operations (equipment, facilities and training)
and promote efficient commercialization of seed supply; (vi) improve livestock
extension services, strongthen veterinary and preventive animal health ser-
vices (construction of buildings, provision of equipment, vehicles, and train-
ing), develop systems of forage and feed production and utilization, tighten
quality control in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and feed industries,
strengthen quarantine services and establish well-coordinated national breed
improvement programs; and (vii) promote cost recovery for services provided to
farmers. The project would also strengthen project management at all levels
by providing facilities, training and technical assistance.
8.        Proiect Implementation.  The MOA would have overall responsibility
for implementing the project. A Project Leading Group (PLG) has been estab-
lished under the leadership of a Vice Minister to oversee its management,
resolve policy matters and solve interdepartmental/interagency problems. The
PLG consists of directors of relevant departments and representatives from the
State Planning Commission -md the Ministry of Finance. At the national level,
the Departments of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and the National Animal
and !lant Quarantine Service, have established their own project implementa-
tion units (PIUs) to implement their components. A central Project Management
Office (PMO) has been established in MOA to coordinate project activities on a
day-to-day basis, monito progress in project execution, coordinate interna-
tional procurement and supervise reporting to the Association. Similar proj-
ect management structures would be established at provincial and lower levels
and would implement project activities at these levels. The project cost is
estimated at $238 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$123 million equivalent (52 percent). The project cost, excluding reserved
procurement, is estimated at $221 million equivalent. The Association would
finance $115 million equivalent (48 percent of total project costs). To take
advantage of labor availability during the 1992/93 winter season, as well as
to facilitate early start-up activities of the project, retroactive financing
of up to $4.7 million equivalent is provided for expenditures made after
June 30, 1992. A breakdowr. of project costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are pre-
sented in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps (IBRD Nos. 23859R, 23909R,
and 23910R) are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 11147-CHA,
dated January 22, 1993, is being distributed separately.
9.        Proiect Sustainabilitv.  The project would result in sustainable
activities in two ways. First, it would finance the elevation of support
capability to a higher level, through institution strengthening and human
resources development, which would persist and evolve over time. Services
would be better linked to research and technical bas-s and would be more
responsive to farmers' needs due to a demand-driven .pproach and to farmers'
involvement throuah farmer associations, which would be promoted under the
project. Secondly, the introduction of cost recovery and commercialization
into a range of services would allow these activities to be self-financing
over time. Funds previously required to support them would also be released
to more effectively operate and maintain non-income generating services.



- 4 -
10.       Aareed Actions.  The main assurances obtained were as follows:
(a) the agrotechnical extension and support services under MOA'a Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services
would be reorganized on the basis of an organizational structure agreed with
IDA, to be completed by June 30, 1994; (b) farmer associations activities
would be carried out under the termc of reference and timing agreed with IDA;
(c) a pilot program for commercialization of the seed industry would be sub-
mitteA to IDA for review by -uly 1, 1994, and implemented thereaftert (d) by
December 31, 1993, the Borrower would prepare and furnish to IDA, a plan of
action to ensure that quarantine procedures are consistent with the best
international practices, and thereafter, implement the program as agreed with
IDA; and (e) as a condition of effectiveness, the project provinces would
enter into Project Implementation Agreements (PTAs) with the Ministry of
Finance and MOA, to ensure that their project component is carried out, and
credit funds would be onlent.
11.       Environmental Asrects.  No negative environmental impact is expected
from the project as most of the project interventions are aimed at strengthen-
ing the support services system and upgrading the skills of extension person-
nel. The project would, in fact, reduce environmental problems associated
with the use of pesticide and fertilizer through more stringent quality con-
trol of agrochemical producers and user3, and the promotion through adaptive
research and extension of integrated pest management.
12.       Proatram Objective Catesories.  The project would increase the par-
ticipation of women in all types of project-related training activities to
specified levels, and selectioa of female candidates for in-service training
for professional development opportunities would be emphasized. A number of
reforms would also be introduced--such as institutional restructuring of the
extension system, commercialization of enterprises and services, cost recovery
for services, enhancement of the environment through strengthening of the
quality control aspects of agrochemicals and fertilizers and field application
of integrated pest management, and linkages between national and local leve'l
agricultural services.
13.       Pro1ect Benefits.  Project intervention would result in stronger
institutions providing more effective agricultural services to farmers. At
the national level, the project would benefit a sizeable proportion of the
country's 200 million farmers through (a) better-coordinated national agricul-
tural services and improved policy formulation; (b) improved national capacity
to support provincial and lower level crop and livestock extension services;
(c) expanded Central Agricultural Broadcasting and Television School (CABTS)
facilities to provide in-service education to extension workers and farmer
technicians; (d) improved breeding programs; (e) greater production and
improved quality of vaccines, pharmaceuticals and bioproducts; (f) improved
regulation and quality control of fertilizer, pesticides, seed and feed; and
(g) more effective protection from imported animal and plant pests and
diseases and better services for agricultural exporters through strengthening
the quarantine services.
14.       At the provincial and lower levels, approximately 5.6 million farm
households (in 112 counties in the project area) would directly benefit from
the project throughs stronger extension centers with trained staff, who are
equipped with facilities and able to respond to farmers' demand; farmer asso-

ciations involving farmers in direct participation with extension services,
inputs and marketst and commercialized services which would provide quality
competitive services in the areas of input supply, seeds and animal health.
At full development, the adoptees would double or triple their incomes. The
project EUs range from 24 percent to 63 percent, depending on technology
adoption scenarios. The project would also alleviate poverty in eight of
China's poorest counties and create substantial demand for labor in intensive
farming, handling, distributing and processinig the incremental output of the
project, including more job opportunities for women. Changes in organiza-
tional, management, and regulatory approaches are expected to serve as models
for national replication and may provide the most important long-temm benefits
of the project.
15.       Risks.  The main project risk is institutional.  The large number of
organizations involved in implementing the project and the project's depen-
dence on revised management methods, techniques and information systems makes
its implementation and supervision difficult, and requires motivated, sound
project management. The risk is minimized through intensive training and
strengthened project management. In addition, China has a good track record
in handling complex projects, and implementation of the several components
would be organized through largely independent channels. Supervision plans
are also in place involving IDA and both central and provincial project man-
agement offices, together with the assistance of a senior consultant. Other
project risks include the possibility that the technology being developed and
int-oduced may not be targeted at th* main production problems and may encoun-
ter acceptance problems by the farmers. This would be minimized through the
design of technology based on feedback from farmers/farmer associations and
verified with farmer participation in demonstration. There is also the risk
that farmer incentives would be eroded in that fertilizer and other key inputs
might not be available in needed quantities to support the advanced technology
packages being promoted by the project. These factors are beyond the scope of
this project, but are being handled through preparation of a series of fertil-
izer industry projects.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
