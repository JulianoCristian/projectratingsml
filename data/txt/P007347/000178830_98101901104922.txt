APPRAISAL OF THE SIXTH POWER FROJECT - HONDURAS
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the sixth power project of the Ehpresa
Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) of Honduras, which has requested Bank
assistance in its financing.
ii.       Since 1959 the Bank/IDA has provided major financial assistance
to Honduran power development through five loans and two credits totaling
US$45 million for five ENEE power projects. The first three projects have
been completed successfully, and completion of the fourth is expected by
year-end 1974, a year behind schedule. Completion of transmission lines
in the fifth project will be delayed by at least a year because of delays
in completing negotiations between ENEE and the Nicaraguan utility and a
potential major customer.
iii.      ENEE is a government-owned company responsible for the development
and operation of power facilities in Honduras. Its total installed capacity -
predominantly hydro but also including diesel plants and gas turbines - is
146 MW. This represents almost all of the country's total capacity available
for public power supply.  Funds from previous loan/credits for training
assistance have imprcoved the capability of ENEE's staff; further improvement
is still necessary.
iv.       The June 1972 appraisal report of ENEE's fifth project indicated
that the next project would be the 450-500 MW El Cajon hydroelectric develop-
ment, to be completed in 1978, which would utilize part of Honduras' large
hydro electric potential to satisfy the country's own requirements and trans-
mit excess generation to Nicaragua, which has few economic hydro sites. How-
ever, the El Cajon feasibility study (completed in 1973) recommended that
completion of El Cajon would be more economic in the mid-1980s instead of 1978.
v.        The sixth project's principal component is the 2 x 20 MW (with peak-
ing capability to 46 MW) extension of the Rio Lindc hydroelectric plant, the
third stage of the Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo hydro development. It will cover the
countryts electricity needs through 1979, but Honduras would then have to im-
port power and energy from Nicaragua untilfirst stage completion of El Cajon,
now assumed to be 1982. The project also includes ENEEts distribution system
improvements for 1975-78, rural electrification, studies and training.
vi.       The project, whose expected completion date is year-end 1978, is
estimated to cost US$60.0 million with a US$45.0 million foreign component.
The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million would finance about 78% of its foreign
cost. Loans from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration would
provide the rest of the foreign and some local currency. ENEE would finance
the remaining local currency component from government contributions for
rural electrification and its own net internal cash generation.



- ii -
vii.      ENEE's staff will carry out the design and construction super-
vision of the project's components for which they have experience, namely
the distribution improvements and rural electrification. Consulting
engineers will perform these duties for the hydro plant extension and will
do the studies.
vii.      Procurement of Bank-financed project components would be in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Retroactive financing of US$500,000
is required to finance engineering of the Rio Lindo extension.
ix.        The Rio Lindo extension  is the least-cost solution for meeting
Honduras' electricity needs for discount rates of up to 20%. The rate of
return on the project investment is estimated to be at least 22%.
x.        With a tariff increase to raise overall revenues by about 25%
to be in effect on February 1, 1975, ENEE's earnings and financial position
are expected to remain satisfactory.
xi.       The project would form a suitable basis for a US$35 million Bank
loan with a term of 25 years including !i years of grace. The loan would
be made to ENEE and guaranteed by the Republic of Honduras.



APPRAISAL CF THE SIXTH POWER PROJECT - HONDURAS
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises-the sixth power project in Honduras, for
which the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) has sought Bank
assistance.
1.02      The project includes the 2 x 20 MW (with peaking capability of
2 x 23 PMW) extension of the Rio Lindo hydroelectric plant, the third stage
of the Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo hydro development. It also includes ENEE's
distribution system improvements for 1975-78, facilities to extend the
electrical services to rural areas, studies of future projects and staff
training. The project's estimated cost is US$60.0 million, including a
foreign exchange component of US$45.0 million.
1.03      The sixth project represents a continuation of schemes carried
out under five previous Bank/IDA lending operations totaling US$45 million
for power development in Honduras as detailedin Annex 1. The first three
projects, which included the initial two stages of the Yojoa-Rio Lindo
development, have been completed successfully. The fourth project is
practically completed, albeit with delays of about one, year caused by re-
visions in the design layout of transmission works and late deliveries of
major project components. in the fifth project,_completion of the Honduras-
Nicaragua interconnection line will be delayed by about one year because of
delays in negotiation of a contract (signed in May 1973) with Enpresa
Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALTUF), the Nicaraguan utility. The extension of
service to the Aguan Valley will be delayed by at least a year because of
delays in negotiations with the principal potential customer in the valley,
Standard Fruit. Other elements of the fifth project (extensions to new areas,
the 26 MW La Ceiba diesel plant, consulting services and training) have either
been completed or are proceeding on schedule.
1.04      The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million would cover about 78% of
the projectts foreign cost and would be made to ENEE, a government-owned
company responsible for development and operation of electric power facili-
ties in Honduras. The Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI)
would provide the remaining foreign and some local currency. ENEE's net
cash generation and government contributions for rural electrification would
meet the project's remaining local currency requirements.
1.05      This report is based on a feasibility study of the Rio Lindo
extension prepared by Harza Engineering International of the United States
and on the findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. John E. Graves
and Helmut Wieseman, which visited Honduras in April/May 1974.

2. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.01      Studies of Honduras' fossil fuel and geothermal supply base have
just begun. There are some indications of natural gas, oil and low-grade
coal deposits. Minor oil discoveries have been made, but commercial via-
bility of deposits has not been established. The government recently re-
quested a UNDP reconnaissance mission to undertake a study of the country's
geothermal potential, concentrated in the Pacific zone.
2.02      Honduras' hydroelectric potential is large.  A 1967 hydro survey
of western and central Honduras by Harza identified the best potential sites
for future development. ENEE's present plans (see paragraphs 2.09-14) in-
clude development of the most promising schemes identified in that survey.
Harza is now conducting a similar survey of hydro resources in eastern
Honduras, financed by Loan 841-HO, which is scheduled for completion in 1976.
Electric Power Sector
2.03      Already the dominant sector entity, ENEE is further increasing its
scope of operations by absorbing privately- or municipally-owned utilities,
extending its service to villages previously without public electricity supply,
and replacing captive generation of large industrial installations. In 1973 it
produced about 83% of the country's public-service electricity generation.

Total                            17 l0
2.04      ENEEwill produce at least 95% of Honduras' public-service genera-
tion in 1974 and future years, because it acquired the La Ceiba di stribution
system from Standard Fruit in 1973 and began in 1973-74 to supply bulk electri-
city to the distribution systems in Tela and Progreso, which are owned by a
United Fruit subsidiary. The fruit companies have placed their old, inefficient
diesel generators in those cities on standby. Only a few small rural munici-
pally-owned utilities remain to be absorbed by ENEE. Increased electricity
supplies from ENEE to the Mochito mines and Bijao cement plant in 1973-74 have
enabled those industries to place their captive diesel plants, the largest
in the country, on standby.
2.05      Annex 2 shows ENEE's installed generating capacity of 140 MW in six
power plants (2 hydro, 2 diesel and 2 gas turbines) in its main system, inter-
connected by about 600 km of 138 kV and 69 kV lines. In addition, ENEE has
approximately 6 MW installed in eight isolated diesel stations.  The hydro
facilities have annual storage which allows a high annual plant factor of over
60%. As shown on Map 3745-R2 and detailed in. Annex 1, ENEE currently
is constructing transmission lines to extend its main system to all principal
cities in Honduras and interconnect it with the Nicaraguan system. No further
transmission lineE will be needed until completion of the next generating
development.



-3-
2.06      In 1971 ENEE established a rural electrification program, which
established priorities for extending service to 23 rural areas presently
with limited or no public electricity supply. From the 23 areas, ENEE
selected six zones with the best potential market and located closest to
its existing facilities for inclusion in the first phase of the program.
Using funds from the fourth and fifth project loan/credits, ENEE has com-
pleted 34 kV lines to and distribution facilities in the Comayagua and
Tamara valleys, and similar works are under way to serve towns near La
Ceiba, Tela, Puerto Cortes and in the southern zone. With government con-
tributions (see paragraph 6.08) and funds from the proposed loan, the utili-
ty would continue this work.
Electricity Consumption
2.07      As shown in Annex 3, electricity production in Honduras has almost
doubled in the last five years. However, annual generation of about 150 kWh
per capita remains low, even in comparison with other Central American
countries, where annual per capita generation ranges from 145 to 700 kkh.
2.08      While ENEE has almost tripled its number of customers in the past
ten years, public electricity supply is still available to only about 18% of
the country's population. ENEE's load is primarily conmmrcial-industrial,
as shown in the table below. ENEEts high annual load factor (62%) is ex-
plained by the large proportion of sales to industrial customers.

72,300       328.1       100.0      720.6   100.0
With the rural extensions and distribution works underway and included in the
project, ENEE intends to provide service to 126,500 customers by the end of
the project period, making public electricity supply available to about 3C%
of the population. Average annual kWi sales per connection (excluding bulk
sales to large industrialcustomers) are expected to increase from 3,370 in
1973 to 3,930 in 1978. Expected year-by-year progress in achieving these
goals is shown in Annex 4.
Sector Development
2.09      Thefifthpower project appraisal report (No. PU-90a, June 2, 1972)
indicated that ENEE's probable next project would be the El Cajon hydroelectric
plant, with capacity then estimated at 450 MW, to be in operation by year-end
1978 to supply the incremental requirements of both Honduras and Nicaragua.
However, the project feasibility study (completed by Motor-Columbus of Switzer-
land in 1973)concluded that it would be more economic to complete a slightly



-4-
larger - about 500 MW - version of El Cajon in the mid-1980s. After review
of the Motor-Columbus study by the Comite Consultivo de Obras Hidraulicas of
Mexico, ENEE's board decided in November 1974 to proceed with the first
(300 MW) stage of El Cajon, and the utility has requested the Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank to participate in its financing. ENEE has
also begun to seek commitments from Guatemala and Nicaragua to buy electricity
produced at El Cajon.
2.10      Because of the postponement of El Cajon, ENEE now intends to meet
its incremental requirement for 1978-79 with the 40 MW extension of the Rio
Lindo hydro plant, which is the principal component of the proposed project
(see chapter 4). ENEE and ENALUF will use the interconnection line for
transferring surplus energy on a short-term basis and emergency power between
their two systems, thus reducing overall reserve requirements (Annex 2). The
interconnection line would also provide reserves for Honduras in case of ex-
tremely dry years or delays in completion of the Rio Lindo extension. Upon
completion of El Cajon, ENEE would sell ENALUF large blocks of power and
energy through 1985, replacing thermal energy in Nicaragua.
2.11      Subject to its final decision on El Cajon, ENEE now plans to meet
its future demands with the following hydro developments:
Mw        Operation
(about)      planned for
El Cajon (first stage) on Rio Humuya        300            1982
El Remolino on Rio Humuya                   120           1989
Naranjito on Rio Jicatuyo or thermal        100           1991
ENEE studied various alternative sequences of completion for these three
developments (using pre-feasibility cost estimates for the last two) to de-
termine that the order of installation shown above is the least-cost solution
for discount rates of up to about 15%.
2.12      The first stage of El Cajon would have foer units of about 74 MW
each and a concrete arch dam 200 m high; including price escalation and
associated 230 kV transmission but without interest during construction the
development would cost about US$254 million, based on feasibility level design.
2.13      The 120 MW Remolino project, downstream from El Cajon, would be the
most likely hydro project after the first stage of El Cajon. Since no feasi-
bility work has yet been done on Remolino, the proposed loan includes funds
for its full feasibility study. If the survey of eastern Honduras (paragraph
2.02) indicates that a more economic development exists in that region, a
feasibility study of the eastern project would be substituted for Remolino.
The second and final stage of El Cajon which would add only peaking capacity
might be undertaken in the 1990s.
2.14      Arranging financing for El Cajon (both foreign- and local-cost com-
ponents) may be difficult because of its large size, even though it has been
shown to be the most economic next development in the Honduras-Nicaragua inter-
connected system. In case of difficulty in obtaining finance for El Cajon, ENEE
plans on building the smaller Naranjito project, whose feasibility study has
been prepared by Motor-Columbus, as an alternative next step, even though
Naranjito is less economic.



2.15      The Bank has proposed a UNDP-financed study, with itself and
CABEI acting as executing agency, to analyze the feasibility of inter-
connected power system development in Central America. It is expected
that future ENEE development would be coordinated with other utilities in
the region once completion of such a study has laid the groundwork for
further interconnection of electric systems in the region.
Isolated System Development
2.16      Many of ENEE's isolated systems are unlikely to be connected to
the main system soon because of their small size and remote location. Re-
cent increases in the cost of diesel fuel have improved the possibilities
of economic development of small hydroelectric sites, including works
abandoned by ENEE's predecessor, known to exist near certain of the isolated
systems. Construction of facilities to improve electricity supply to
customers in isolated areas would be part of the second phase of ENEE's
rural electrification program (paragraph 2.06), which concentrates on poten-
tially good markets in more remote regions of the country. The proposed
loan therefore includes funds for such studies, to be carried out by foreign
engineers who would work with and train ENEE engineers to make similar studies
in the future.

3. THE BCRROWER
Management and Staff
3.01      The proposed loan would be made to ENEE, an autonomous government-
owned corporation established in 1957 for the development and operation of
power facilities in the country. ENEE is governed by a five-member Board of
Directors, including the Ministers of Natural Resources and Communications
and Transport and representatives of the Planning Council, the National
Development Bank and the private sector. The Board appoints ENEE's general
manager, who is responsible for all managerial and administrative activities.
The present general manager, a civil engineer, has served in that capacity
since August 1971 and is performing his duties capably.
3.02      ENEE's general manager is assisted directly by an assistant manager
for power, responsible for all engineering, planning and operations, and by
a director of administrative services, responsible for accounting, purchasing,
legal, treasury and personnel functions. These individuals and their senior
assistants are capable.
3.03      Until the late 1960s, ENEE's engineering staff was quite weak.
Using funds from the fourth and fifth project loan/credits, ENEE has hired
expatriate engineers to assist and train its staff and sent key staff members
to foreign utilities and engineering consulting firms for training related to
specific tasks. While the utility's technical capability has improved signif-
icantly, further training is necessary; funds from the proposed loan would
assist this effort (see paragraph 4.04).
3.04      Progress in achieving administrative efficiency has been slower,
however. Until implementation of a computerized system in 1973, customer
billing and collection was inefficient and slow;  this is now improving.  ENEE's
management consultants (R. W. Beck of the US) are now developing computer-
based systems for inventory control, payroll and budget applications, using
fifth power project funds. Further improvement will be needed in implement-
ing effective budget control, and proposed loan funds are provided for that
purpose.
3.05      ENEE employs about 1,600 people, of Whom about 300 are engaged in
construction or hydrologic measurement. As a result of management's policy
of limiting hiring, ENEE's customer-to-employee ratio has improved from
55:1 in 1972 to about 67:1 in 1974 (based on 87,000 customers and 1,300
operations-related employees).  This ratio is expected to continue to improve
to 84:1 by 1978 (see Annex 4), which is reasonable.
Tariffs
3.06      The law establishing ENEE gives the utility the right to set its
own tariffs, which are summarized in Annex 5 (exclusive of adjustments in
late 1974). The tariffs have not changed substantially since 1964 and are
no longer sufficient in view of increases in ENEE's fuel expenses and other
costs of doing business. At the Bankts suggestion, ENEE hired R. W. Beck to
design fuel adjustment clauses to be included in its tariff schedules, to
revalue its net fixed assets and propose an overall tariff increase to earn
a fair return on revalued assets (see paragraph 6.12). Beck found: that



-7-
ENEE required a tariff increase sufficiently high to increase overall re-
venues by about 25%; and that most of the impact of the increase should
fall on large industrial customers -whose average rates are expected to in-
crease by as much as 50%. A fuel adjustment clause and tariff increases
(paragraph 6.12), substantially as proposed by Beck but to go into effect
not later than February 1, 1975, has recently been approved.
3.07      Earlier this year, most other Central American utilities put into
effect higher tariff increases, so that the spread between ENEE's tariffs,
which were the highest in the region through 1973, and those of neighboring
utilities will decrease.
3.08      To ensure that ENEE's tariffs promote in the future the most
economic pattern of energy consumption, ENEE's rate structure should be
reviewed. The review should consider: interruptible sales of off-peak
* power and energy to large customers, which would better utilize ENEE's
facilities; and changes in tariff structure to increase sales in newly-
electrified villages where customer response has been low. Any losses in
revenue from tariff-structure changes could be offset by increasing charges
to higher-income customers. The proposed loan includes funds for such
studies with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
Auditors
3.09      ENEE's accounts are audited by Price Waterhouse, which is satis-
factory. The proposed loan agreement repeats existing covenants whereby
ENEE agrees to have an accounting firm acceptable to the Bank audit it and
transmit the auditorts full report to the Bank within four months of the
end of each fiscal year.

4. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Program through 1982
4.01      ENEE's program through 1982 includes:
a.   completion of transmission and rural electrification works in-
cluded in the fourth and fifth projects, as detailed in Annex 1
and paragraphs 2.05-06;
b.   completion of 1974-75 distribution works not included in the
fourth and fifth projects, mostly in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro
Sula;
c.   the sixth power project, including the 2 x 20 MW Rio Lindo hydro
plant extension, described below;
d.   construction of the 300 MW El Cajon hydroelectric development
(paragraphs 2.09-12), or the smaller Naranjito hydro project
(paragraph 2.14); and
e.   future distribution works not included in the sixth project.
Description of the Project
4.02      The sixth power project consist of:
a.   the 2 x 20 NW (with peaking capablity of 46 MW) extension to the
Rio Lindo hydro plant, including four dams to divert three rivers
in the Lake Yojoa area and construction of a new pipeline and pen-
stock (see Annex 6) as well as engineering and construction super-
vision of the works;
b.   transmission/distribution system improvements and extension of
electricity supply to rural areas not presently served for the
four-year period 1975-78 (paragraph 4.03);
c.  materials and equipment needed for system repairs and rehabilita-
tion resulting from damages caused by Hurricane Fifi in September
1974;
d.   studies of possible future projects (paragraphs 2.13 and 2.16),
administrative improvements (paragraph 3.04) and tariffs (para-
graph 3.08); and
e.  training of ENEE's professional staff (paragraph 4.04).
4.03      The transmission/distribution system improvements include:  a mobile 138 kV
substation of about 251MVA capacity, a 138/13.8 kV-25 MVA substation in the
San Pedro Sula area, as well as primary (13.8 kV) and secondary lines, trans-
formers and meters needed to satisfy increased requirements from existing
customers and to provide electricity supply to new customers in the cities
ENEE serves. ENEE requires a 138 kV mobile substation to restore service
quickly to areas affected by system outages. It now has no such equipment
although its transmission system, formerly mostly 69 kV, is now primarily
138 kV. Extension of supply to new areas will follow the pattern begun in the



-9-
fourth and fifth projects (paragraph 2.06), in which ENEE builds 34 kV lines
to and installs distribution facilities in villages where the government has
recently invested in other infrastructure; ENEE has agreed to provide the
Bank with satisfactory economic justification for the selected service ex-
tensions before proceeding with them.
4.04      The training component of the project focuses on development of the
following staff:
a.   top level managers, who will attend courses and seminars designed
for public utility personnel at universities and other institutions
overseas. Upon return, they would give in-house seminars and
courses on their subjects;
b.   supervisory personnel (including recent university  graduates), who
will be instructed in modern practices of design, engineering,
construction, operation, and maintenance of distribution, trans-
mission and generation equipment. This training will be at a
facility which ENEE plans to set up at the Canaveral plant (with
expatriate training staff initially) and at foreign utilities and
equipment suppliers: and
c. technical. personnel, who will be trained in operating and maintain-
ing interconnected systems in preparation for the Honduras-Nicaragua
interconnection, scheduled for initial operation in early 1976. The
training would take place at equipment suppliers and public utilities
(probably in Mexico, Puerto Rico, France and Central America) where
ENEE staff has previously received excellent technical training.
As part of the next project, ENEE intends to establish a permanent training
facility for all levels of personnel, substituting Honduran training staff for
expatriate. Training to be carried out under this program would be coordinated
with Honduras' Instituto Nacional de Formacion Profesional and would be made
available to other companies or agencies requiring the specialized skills to
be provided.
Estimated Cost and Financing
4.o5      The project's estimated cost totals US$60.0 million with a uS$450.
million foreign component. The costs are summarized below and detailed in

4.o6      Harza estimated the cost of the Rio Lindo extension and ENEE, the
distribution improvements, based on end-1973 prices, which the appraisal
mission adjusted to fourth-quarter 1974. Price contingencies for both local
and foreign price inflation were computed on all project components except
studies and training using the following annual inflation rates:

The unit cost of the Rio Lindo extension, US$640/kW of peaking capability (ex-
cluding price contingencies), is acceptable in view of its 248 GWh of additional
annual hydroenergy production.

CABEI would also provide local financing of US$0.8 million equivalent for con-
structing the Rio Lindo diversion and engineering services provided by a local
firm (Honconsult) for the Rio Lindo extension.
Engineering
4.08      ENEE contracted in April 1974 with Harza, which served as consultant
for the first two stages of the Yojoa-Rio Lindo development, for the design,
engineering, procurement and construction supervision of the diversions of the
Rios Lindo, Yure and Varsovia and of the Rio Lindo plant extension. Under
Harza's overall responsibility, Honconsult is designing and supervising con-
struction of the Rio Lindo diversion, already underway, and the Yure and
Varsovia diversion canals. As in the fifth project, ENEE's staff will design,
engineer and supervise construction of all distribution system improvements;
the utility intends to use an individual consultant on the San Pedro Sula
substation. Consultants acceptable to the Bank would be engaged for studies
of possible future projects, administrative improvements and tariffs.



- 12 -
Project Execution
4.09      A local contracting firm has already begun construction of the
Rio Lindo diversion. ENEE intends to award contracts for the rest of the
project in the following manner:
a.   a "supply and erect" contract for the pipeline, penstock, surge
tank, and accessories;
b.   a single general contract (with possible participation of local
firms as subcontractors) for the Yure and Varsovia diversions,
the La Pita dam, pipeline, penstock and surge tank foundations,
powerhouse construction, tailrace widening, and installation of
major equipment, under supervision of factory representatives;
and
c.   individual supply contracts for other generating and distribution
equipment.
4.10      Completion of various river diversions is scheduled as indicated
in Annex 6, and the Rio Lindo extension is expected to be commissioned by
June 30, 1978. The estimated project completion date is December 31, 1978.
Performance indicators showing the expected achievement during the project
period are shown in Annex 4.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      All contracts for Bank-financed civil works, plant and equipment
would be awarded following international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
4.1l2     Honduras has effectively withdraw  from the Central American Common
Market, so that regional preferences will not apply. As none of the items
financed by the Bank loan are produced locally, the question of preference
for local manufacturers does not arise.
4.13      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for:
a.   the foreign-currency cost of:  the "supply and erect"  contract
for pipeline, penstock, surge tank and accessories; studies and
training; and the portions of Harza's contract dealing with final
construction design and engineering and construction supervision;
b.   the cif cost of equipment and materials including foreign-currency
cost of factory representatives to supervise erection, as
appropriate;
c.   55% of the total cost of the general contract, representing the
estimated foreign cost component; and
d.    interest on the Bank loan through July 31, 1978, the estimated
completion date of the hydro plant extension.



- 13 -
4.14      Except for engineering, no contracts would be awarded before  loan
approval. To meet completion dates for the various elements of the hydro
scheme, retroactive financing of up to US$5OO,O0O is recommended for engineer-
ing services provided after March 1, 1974. Estimated loan disbursements are
shown in Annex 8. Any undisbursed funds upon completing the project should
be cancelled.
Environment
4.15      The river diversion scheme will raise Lake Yojoats maximum level
by about one meter and create two small reservoirs. The land to be inundated
is practically uninhabited; ENEE has agreed to submit to the Bank, within six
months of the date of the loan agreement, plans for the resettlement and em-
ployment of the few (about ten) families living in that area, and to put such
plans into effect in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Diversion of the Rio
Lindo will reduce water flow over the scenic rapids near the village of Rio
Lindo by about 50% in the dry season but without serious visual effect. The
population living downstream from diversions of the Rios Varsovia and Lindo
will continue to obtain sufficient water for domestic use from other tribu-
taries which flow into the rivers. To avoid sediment accumulations in the
reservoirs and canals, the government has agreed to enforce under existing
legislation soil conservation measures and control of logging operations in
the area.
4.16      ENEE agreed:  to provide the Bank by June 30, 1977 a program for
periodic inspection of the La Pita, Varsovia and Yure dams and associated
structures; and to carry out an inspection program of those dams satisfactory
to the Bank.
Employment
4.17      Project construction will create employment opportunities for about
800 workers for a three-year period. Operation of the Rio Lindo extension
will provide about 20 permanent jobs.
Project Risks
4.18      The project's critical element in terms of both price and construc-
tion period is the pipeline/penstock. While the price contingencies (which
are slightly higher than those generally used for projects of this nature)
and construction period assumed in the appraisal appear sufficient now,
further accelerated worldwide demand for steel could result in project delays
and cost increases.

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
General
5.01      The purpose of the project is to meet from local hydro resources
Honduras' growing demand for power and energy and thereby reduce imports
of fuel or thermally-generated electricity. Under the project, installed
capacity will increase from 144 to 184 MW (28%) and average hydro year energy
production from 408 to 656 GSh (61%). The project will provide electricity
service to 300,000 additional people in Honduras.
Demand and Sales Forecast
5.02      With the incorporation of new areas (paragraph 2.04), ENEE's sales
are expected to grow about 32% in 1974.  Thereafter, until9s0, ENEE's
main-system and total sales are expected to increase about 11% annually.
The forecast, which is shown in Annex 9, is based on ENEE's prediction of
bulk sales after consultation with large and medium-sized industrial con-
sumers and of area trends established by ENEE's continuing observation.
Because of their uncertain timing, energy sales to the fruit companies for
irrigation pumping have not been included in the forecast. ENEE sales grew
at about 13% annually during 1969-73 while it was taking over service to
many new areas, which will not be the case after 1974, and the projected rate
of increase of 11% is therefore reasonable.
5.03      Changes in the distribution of total sales by consumer category are
shown in paragraph 2.08, which indicates that from 1973 to 1979 residential
sales are expected to grow annually 16% on average; commercial sales 13%;
industrial sales 14.8%; bulk industrial sales 11.5%; and government and other
sales 15%. On this basis, the project will benefit residential and medium-
sized industrial consumers somewhat more than commercial and bulk users.
Unsatisfied demand for residential use will be reduced significantly as ENEE
expects, mainly because of the proposed project, to increase the proportion
of the population with access to electric service from the present 18% to
about 30% by 1980.
5.04      Wilth various river diversions completed in 1975-76 (Annex 6), hydro
generation at existing Canaveral and Rio Lindo units will increase by about
200 GWh even before the two new Rio Lindo units are in operation in mid-1978,
resulting in fuel cost savings of about US$2.0 million. After 1979, and until
completion of the next hydro project, ENEE will have to cover the increase in
energy requirements with thermal power and imports from Nicaragua.
Least-cost Solution
5.05      To determine the least-cost solution to Honduras' electricity needs
Harza first selected the least-cost alternatives among the various possible
river diversions and extensions to Canaveral and Rio Lindo power plants and
then compared the selected project with the least-cost thermal alternative,
a diesel installation of about 40 MW, as detailed in Annex 10. It found that
the hydro works included in the project were the least-cost solution for
discount rates up to about 20%.



- 15 -
5.o6      To verify Harza's determinations, the hydro alternative has been
divided into two parts: (i) the portion of the river diversion sufficient
to provide additional water for generation of about 100 GWh/year using exist-
ing penstock and generating facilities, and (ii) the new pipeline/penstock,
power plant extension and remaining river diversions needed to supply ENEE's
capacity requirements through 1980 and the balance of its energy require-
ments. As shown in Annex 10, part (i) is the least-cost solution for provid-
ing additional generation for discount rates of up to at least 50%, and part
(ii) is the least-cost solution for meeting ENEE's additional requirements
for discount rates of up to about 12%, both when compared to the least-cost
thermal alternative. This analysis therefore confirms that carried out by
Harza for the project as a whole.
Return on Project Investment
5.07      The rate of return on the project - defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to the project
with its costs - is 22.3%, as shown in Annex 11. While these calculations
do notreflect price inflation beyond 1974 in the projectts capital or
operating costs, it is expected that revenues would be increased to offset
any future inflation-related cost increases. The economic rate of return
is undoubtedly higher because the electricity rates used in the computations
do not adequately measure the full benefits to customers.

6. FINANCE
Introduction
6.01      ENEE maintained a high rate of return - from 10 to 16% on an
original-cost rate base - from 1966-73. Because of recent worldwide and
Honduran price inflation, its rate base is now undervalued; the 1975 tariff in-
crease (paragraph 3.06), is expected to enable ENEE to earn a 10% return
on its revalued rate base during the project period. ENEE's low contri-
bution-to-expansion ratio for the project period and high debt/equity ratio
at the end of the period reflect large borrowings necessary for construction
of the next project, the very large El Cajon hydroelectric development,
rather thanpoor financial performance.  Were it not for El Cajon, all of the
utility's financial indicators would be satisfactory throughout the project
period.
Earnings Record and Financial Position
6.02      ENEE has had a high rate of growth in net utility plant, revenues
and operating income, which have increased by 150%, 90% and 75% respectively
in the five-year period through 1973. Its annual rate of return on rate base
(net utility plant in service), which had been as high as 16% in 1969-70,
decreased to the 10-11% level in 1971-73. Despite its high earnings, the
utility has had to borrow heavily in the five-year period to finance new
investments in plant, so that its debt/equity ratio has increased from 50/50
to 59/41. Its 1971-73 income statements, balance sheets and key financial
ratios, are shown in Annexes 12, 13 and 14, respectively.
6.03      The Bank is ENEE's largest creditor; together with loans received
from the government to pass on the proceeds of IDA credits, IBRD accounts for
approximately 70% of ENEE's long-term debt at year-end 1973.  ENEE has also
borrowed from CABEI, the US Agency for International Development and Honduras'
Central Bank. Details of ENEE's outstanding debt at the end of 1973 and fore-
cast debt service are included in Annex 15.
6.04      ENEE's books of account have been maintained at originally recorded
values, adjusted only to reflect the effect of worldwide currency realign-
ments since 1971 on its indebtedness and fixed assets. During appraisal, ENEE
management agreed with the Bank mission that its rate base was undervalued
since it did not reflect recent inflationary trends. The utility subsequently
hired R. W. Beck to estimate the current value of its rate base. Based primarily
on construction price indices applicable to the types of plant involved, Beck
has determined that the rate base value should be increased by about 50%. To
avoid possible confusion in future rate determinations, ENEE has agreed to re-
flect this and any future asset revaluations in its books of account and
financial statements.
Overdue Receivables
6.05      As a result of negotiations on Loan 841-HO, the government indicated
in a supplemental letter its intention to pay to ENEE a total of L1.8 (US$0.9)
million, respresenting outstanding electricity bills and other receivables,
over the five-year period 1972-76. It has paid about half the originally
outstanding amount.



- 17 -
6.o6      The only substantial receivable remaining under discussion is that
of Servicio'Aiutonomo Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (SANAA), the
government water-supply agency, which owed ENEE L370,000 (US$185,000) at the
end of 1973. ENEE had for many years used SANAA water for two small hydro-
electric plants near Tegucigalpa but declined to pay what it considered to
be exorbitant charges for use of the water for electricity generation; SANAA,
in turn, never paid electricity bills to ENEE. The generating plants were
retired from service in 1970 and 1973, so that SANAA's only remaining reason
for not paying ENEE is its lack of funds. ENEE has undertaken negotiations
with SANAA-so that each agency would release its obligations for charges
against the other prior to 1974. Since SANAA's financial condition is not
expected to improve in the foreseeable future, the government has agreed to
pay or cause to be paid SANAA's 1974 bills by year-end 1975 and its future
bills, within two months of the billing date.
Financing Plan
6.07      During the five-year project period 1974-78, net internal cash
generation will finance about 14% of ENEE's construction program plus addi-
tions to working capital. This internal contribution is low because the pro-
gram includes about half of El Cajon's construction period. The con-
struction program's size - L527 (US$263) million  - is enormous in compari-
son with ENEEs present size - its 1973 rate base (valued at historical cost)
was L107 (US$53) million. Substitution of the alternative Naranjito hydro
development in place of El Cajon would decrease the anount of construction
spending to the extent that net internal cash generation would pay for about
30% of the program .
6.08      Except for government contributions for rural electrification
(representing the differential between the debt service ENEE pays to the
government and the government pays to IDA on Credit 201-HO), it is assumed
that the remaining 86% of the funds requirements would be met by borrowing.
While ENEE intends to request equity contributions from the government in lieu
of loans to cover part of El Cajon's local cost, a final decision has yet to
be taken on this request. The financing plan also assumes the reinvestment
of all net income; as it has in past lending operations, ENEE has agreed to
retain all its earnings during the project period for investment in new facili-
ties. The following table presents a summary financing plan, details of which
are shown in the projected funds statement (Annex 16).

6.09      The proposed Bank loan would be made to ENEE for a term of 25 years,
including 41 years of grace, at the current Bank interest rate (assumed to be
8%). It would be guaranteed by the Republic of Honduras.
6.10      ENEE has completed arrangements with CABEI for two loans:  a 15-year
loan (including two years of grace) at 8% annual interest for US$400,000 to
finance construction of the Rio Lindo diversion; and a 7-year loan (including
two years of grace) at 6% annual interest for US$1.4 million to finance engineer-
ing and contract document preparation for the Yojoa-Rio Lindo extension. It
has applied to CABEI for the remaining US$8.3 million of financing for the
foreign cost of the distribution works.  CABEI, which financed similar works
for ENEE in 1974, has declared the loan eligible for financing.
6.11      The utility has requested the Bank to take the lead in arranging
a coordinated financing package for the El Cajon project and to be a major
participant in that package.

Tariff Increases and Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.12      ENEE's consultants (R. W. Beck) originally proposed tariff in-
creases which would increase its overall revenues by 25% to be effective
October 1, 1974.  Because of the psychological impact of Hurricane Fifi,
effectiveness of the recommended tariff increases and fuel adjustment clause
was delayed four months.   While ENEE's rate of return will be only about
7.5% in 1974, it would increase to 10-11% for the remaining years of the
project period (assuming no further rate base revaluations) and would therefore
be satisfactory. Existing covenants providing for tariff adjustments to
yield at least a 10% return on ENEE's rate base, valued or revalued satis-
factorily, have been repeated in the proposed loan agreement.
6.13      In agreements relating to the fourth power project, ENEE and the
government agreed not to adjust electricity tariffs from then-existing levels
until completion of the project without the Bank/IDA's consent. At ENEE's
request, a similar covenant was not included in agreements relating to the
fifth project because of potential problems in their ratification by the now
defunct Honduran congress. Because of ENEE's need for sufficient cash, even
somewhat above the 10% rate of return level, to complete the sixth project
successfully, a clause has been included in the proposed loan agreement re-
quiring the utility not to reduce tariffs from their increased levels (para-
graph 6.12) during the project period,
6.14      Wiile ENEE's rate of return (paragraph 6.12), debt-service coverage
and current ratio are expected to be satisfactory with the 25% tariff increase,
its debt/equity ratio will increase from 42/58 at year-end 1974 to 75/25 in
1979. This reflects the substantial borrowing to be undertaken for El Cajon,
offset only in small part by increases in equity resulting from the 1974 re-
valuation of assets. (If ENEE did not proceed with El Cajon and undertake
Naranjito as its next project instead, its debt/equity ratio would rise to
only about 50/50 by 1979). Government contributions to ENEE's equity in lieu
of loans for most of El Cajon's local cost would improve the utility's capital
structure; this should be taken up during appraisal of the El Cajon project.
Forecast income statements, balance sheets and key financial ratios are shown
in Annexes 12, 13 and 14.
6.15      The debt-service test included in existing loan agreements, whereby
ENEE will not incur long-term debt without the Bank's approval unless its
most recent 12-month internal cash generation is at least 1.4 times its maxi-
mum debt service for any succeeding fiscal year, has been repeated in the
proposed loan agreement. The financing plan includes borrowings for the start
of the next stage of ENEE's expansion program which would have to be contracted
in 1975. Because ENEE's future debt service will increase sharply, Bank approval
for those borrowings is expected to be necessary.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      In agreements related to the proposed loan, the following covenants
have been repeated:
a.   appointment of auditors and submission of audit reports (paragraph
3.09);
b.   retention of earnings (paragraph 6.08);
c.   rate of return (paragraph 6.12); and
d.   debt service coverage test (paragraph 6.15);
ENEE has agreed to:
a.   provide the Bank with satisfactory economic justification for
service extensions to new areas (paragraph 4.03);
b.   relocate the population affected by the reservoirs (paragraph 4.15);
c.  provide and carry out a dam inspection and maintenance program
(paragraph 4.16);
d.   reflect asset revaluations in its books of account (paragraph 6.O4);
and
e,   not reduce tariffs without Bank approval (paragraph 6.13);
and the government has agreed to:
a.   enforce existing legislation on soil conservation and logging control
(paragraph 4.15); and
b.   pay or cause SANAA's electricity bills to be paid on a current basis
(paragraph 6.06).
7.02      With the above assurances, the project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$35 million for a term of 25 years including 4½ years of
grace.

2.        The capacity factor of the extension and of the complex will be about
61%.  Through the increased inflow (of about 50%) to Lake Tojoa from the river
diversions, energy production at Canaveral will be increased without additional
capacity, as its present capacity factor is only about 43%.
River Diversions
3.        As shown on Map I1219, the Yure and Varsovia rivers will be diverted
into Lake Yojoa, the small La Pita dam will control outflows from the lake,
and the Rio Lindo will be diverted into the tailrace of the Canaveral plant.
4.        Construction details of the main civil works are listed on page 3
of this annex and summarized as follows:
-    Rio Yhre: 50 m high earthfill dam and 1.9 km canal to be completed
by mid-1976; in view of a possible fault along the river valley,
soil testing and drilling to establish the best dam axis alignment
is underway.
-    Rio Varsovia: 30 m high rock fill dam with gravity center section
spillway, 2.4 km canal and 300 m tunnel to be completed by mid-1976;
no known geological fault.
-    La Pita:  9 m high earthfill dam.
-    Rio Lindo:  9 m high earthfill dam, 450 m long concrete conduit
to be completed by mid-1975

sign; based on available soil test borings, foundation conditions have been
judged to be satisfactory; construction materials are available near the four
proposed dam sites; and all works are in a seismically inactive area.
Pipeline and Penstock
6.        The Rio Lindo extension will use some of the facilities of Stage I
and II. It will take its water supply (derived from Lake Yojoa and the Rio
Lindo diversion) from the Canaveral tailrace through an existing pipeline,
regulating reservoir, tunnel and bifurcation to the two new Rio Lindo units.
The new pipeline and penstock (which will start at the bifuracation) will be
all welded, corrosion-protected by paint, mounted on reinforced concrete
saddles, and use: a penstock shut-off valve near the bifurcation, longitudinal
expansion joints,and concrete thrust and anchor blocks at directional changes.
The penstock will taper from 2.4 to 1.95 m diameter. A penstock shut-off valve
will be added to the existing penstock. Installation is to be completed by
about mid-1977.
Mechanical and Electrical Equipment
7.        The new units at the Rio Lindo plant will have Pelton turbines for
about 390 m net head with nominal 20 MW generators and 24 MVA transformers of
the same size and type as the initial units No. 1 and 2. The powerhouse will
be extended by two bays for the installation of the two new units using the
existing crane, erection bay and station auxiliaries. The tailrace channel,
downstream of the power plant, will be widened for the increased discharges.
The expected commissioning date for the plant extension is June 30, 1978.
8.        The Rio Lindo switchyard will be extended to connect the two new
units to the existing 138 kV transmission lines to Canaveral, San Pedro Sula
and Tegucigalpa. With the additions included in the fourth and fifth projects
and the new 25 MVA 138/13.8 kV substation in San Pedro Sula area, 138 kV mobile
substation of about 25 MVA and distribution system extension of the proposed
project, these transmission lines and the system in general will be adequate
to receive and distribute the maximum Canaveral-Rio Lindo generation capacity
of 122 MW.

0ONPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE POWER PROJECTS
1.        The recommended river diversions and the Rio Iindo plant extension
are the result of an economic comparison of several diversion layouts and
combinations of capacity additions at the Rio Lindo and Canaveral power
plants. Harza analyzed: four layouts each for diversion of the Yure and
Varsovia rivers and two for the La Pita dam; Rio Lindo plant extensions of
1 x 20, 1 x 25, 2 x 20 and 2 x 25 MW; and the installation of a third 15 MW
unit at Canaveral. The addition of two 20 MW units at Rio Lindo was the
'most economic solution.
2.        Harza then compared the selected Rio Lindo extension scheme with the
least-cost thermal alternative, which would be the installation of 6 x 6.6 MW
medium-speed (400-500 rpm) diesel generating units burning Bunker C oil to be
installed near the refinery at Puerto Cortes. Using January 1974 costs of
construction, operation and maintenance and the government's official price
of L 16 (US$8)/barrel for fuel, Harza determined that the Rio Lindo extension
was the lesser-cost alternative for discount rates up to about 20%.
3.        ENEE will be able to generate about 100 GWh/year of additional energy
by passing water derived from new diversions through existing Canaveral-Rio
Lindo facilities. Therefore, the entire extension scheme is theoretically
divisible into two parts: the portion of the river diversions which would
generate that additional energy; and the pipeline/penstock, new generating
units and remaining portion of the diversions needed to meet ENEE's capacity
and additional energy requirements.
4.        The least-cost thermal means of providing 100 GWh/year would be the
installation of 16 MW of medium-speed diesel generating capacity, operating
at a plant factor of about 0.71. Based on Harza's estimates, the total
construction cost of the river diversions, which would produce 248 GWh/year,
at January 1974 prices is L 16.6 million. For comparison with thermal
generation, the estimated capital cost of the diversions needed to generate
100 GWh/year in the existing facilities was balanced against costs of the diesel
facility, using the assumptions shown on page 3 of this annex. Since the
capital costs of the two are of the same order of magnitude, and the river
diversion scheme does not entail any fuel costs, it is the lesser-cost method
of providing the additional generation for discount rates of up to 50%.
5.        The cost of the remaining RiQ Lindo extension facilities was then
compared to the least-cost thermal facilities to provide the remaining
148 GWh/year and meet ENEE's total capacity requirement of 40 MW. The thermal
facilities selected were 24 MW of medium-speed diesels operating at a 0.71
plant factor and a 16 MW gas turbine, which would be installed at ENEE's

La Puerta substation in San Pedro Sula, already the site of an existing
13 YU gas turbine.  As shown on page  4  of this annex, the Rio Lindo
extension is the lesser-cost method of meeting ENEE's additional energy and
capacity requirements when compared to this thermal alternative for discount
rates of up to about 12%.
6.        Thus, the entire scheme may be regarded as the least-cost method
of meeting Honduras' incremental electricity needs.

RETURN ON PROJECT INVESTMENT
1.        The cost and benefit streams for the project investment are shown
on page 2 of this annex for the assumed 50-year life of the hydro portion
of the project. Construction costs exclude price escalation beyond the
fourth quarter of 197h and interest during construction. In estimating the
project benefits, it was assumed that the value of the hydro energy supplied
to the system would at least equal the difference between they incremental
revenue (at rates expected to be in effect beginning early in 1975) and the
incremental costs.
2.        The rate of return of the project - defined as the discount-rate
which equalizes the stream of expected net revenues attributable to the project
with its costs - is about 22.3%.    This may be regarded as a minimum rate
of return, because ENEEIs electricity rates do not adequately measure the
full benefits to customers, especially commercial and industrial.

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN FORECASTS
Sales and Revenues
1.        ENEE prepares forecasts of GWh sales detailed by locality and/or
large customer, as shown in Annex 9 and described in paragraph 5.02 of the
text. The utility estimates revenues from sales in a similar fashion, using
a separate average rate per kWh for each locality. The average rate per
kWh for the entire utility therefore fluctuates slightly from year to year
depending on MENE's assumptions regarding new large customers and differing
growth rates of markets in various localities.
2.        Forecast revenues reflect an overall 25% increase in electric
tariffs effective January 1, 1975.

General equipment                       10.0
Other Operating Expenses
5.        ENEE bases its projections of fixed expenses on a detailed historical
analysis, using actual data beginning in 1966 to establish cost trends for each
account, which corresponds to each generating station, substation, transmission
line, and distribution district. It then uses historical cost trends, adjusted
for inflation of 4% for 1974-75 and 6% for following years, to estimate
expenses for each account.
6.        To check its projections, ENEE also develops historical and projected
costs per unit of generation, transmission or distribution, as applicable.

For example, transmission operating and maintenance expense are compared
for each line of like voltage on a per-km basis; distribution and customer-
service expenses, on a per-customer basis; generation expenses, on a KWh
and kW basis.
