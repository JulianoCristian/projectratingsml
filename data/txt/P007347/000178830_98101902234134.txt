REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENeRGIA ELECTRICA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF HONDTJRAS
FOR A SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica, with the Guarantee of the Re-
public of Honduras, for the equivalent of US$35.0 million to help finance a
Sixth Power Project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
4-L/2 years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economic Position and Prospects of Honduras"
(Report No. 339a-HO), dated April 29, 1974, was distributed in May, 197L. A
Country Data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Honduras, with a per capita income of about US$320 in 19721/ is
the poorest country in Central America. The majority of the population ob-
tains a bare subsistence income. The adult literacy rate is only about 50 per-
cent and the average national calorie and protein intake is well below minimum
requirements. Progress in overcoming these deficiencies is difficult owing
to the rapid population growth rate, presently estimated at 3.5 percent per
year.
4.        Honduras is a predominantly agricultural economy; in 1973 about 35
percent of GDP at factor cost originated in the agricultural sector, 65 per-
cent of the economically active population was employed there and about ff6
percent of all exports were agricultural products. Four products made
up 80 percent of total exports: bananas (37 percent); coffee (19 percent):
wood (15 percent) and meat (9 percent). All four have grown fairly rapidly
during the last ten years, with meat and wood showing the highest growth rates.
5.        Following a few years of rather rapid economic growth during the mid-
sixties, the Honduran economy entered a period of low growth and serious
economic difficulties from 1969 through 1972. Several factors contributed to
the relative stagnation of the economy during these years. Among them were
the severe hurricane damage to banana and other crops in 1969, a widespread
drought which resulted in a large loss in agricultural production in 1972, and
the armed conflict between Honduras and El Salvador. The latter resulted in
a reduction in private investment and the withdrawal of Honduras, in December
1/ At 1972 prices, calculated according to World Bank Atlas methodology.

1970, from the free trade arrangements of the CACM, a move which adversely
affected a number of export industries. These difficulties were accompanied
by balance of payments and fiscal crises and contributed significantly
to the circumstances which resulted in a coup in December 1972 and brought
the present administration to power.
6.        Some improvement in the economic situatior. was apparent by the end
of 1972, following Government adoption of a stabilization program, and in
1973 a general economic recovery appeared to be taking place, led by a boom-
ing growth of export earnings of meat, coffee and wood. Some progress towards
the reopening of the CACM was also made through the signing of bilateral trade
agreements with Nicaragua in 1972 and with Guatemala and Costa Rica in 1973.
Fiscal revenues increased sharply in the latter year, public current expend-
itures were kept under control and there was a moderate increase in the net
international reserves. With private investors regaining confidence, private
investment increased strongly during 1973.   Public investment, whiLe up from
the preceding year, continued at undesirably low levels because very few
projects had been initiated in the previous few years and, partly because of
the restructuring of several executive units, the preparation of projects by
the Government had been slow.
7.        The medium-term outlook for the Honduran economy at the start of
197h was encouraging. The Government was making progress in the preparation
of its medium-term Development Plan and i^-vestment program, which stressed
agrarian reform and utilization of the country's extensive forest resources.
In spite of the oil price increase of late 1973, which is expected to increase
Honduras' net oil import bill from US$22.0 million in 1973 to US$56.0 million in
1974, and the subsequent increases of Honduran import prices generally, it
appeared possible for Honduras to carry out its development program and mail.-
tain balance of payments equilibrium over the medium-term, especially as wo:Id
market prospects for some of its main expor+ nrodacts 1were eznco'agu-g.
°¾.       Two developments during the ccurs- of lT: I'ave created -ccnomrc
difficulties of unprecedented magnitude in Honduras.   In the first prace, three
of Honduras' major exports, coffee, beef and wood. have been seve^e'y affect~d
by an unexpected deterioration in world market conditions. Secondly, on
September 19-20, Hurricane Fifi hit the most develoDed areas in Northern Hondu-
ras and caused substantial loss of life and damage to crops -- especially
bananas and corn -- as well as to livestock, roads, bridges and other infra-
structure.
9.        Declining world prices for coffee have led exporters to withhold
shipments in the expectation of better prices. Some purchases from local pro-
ducers had been made at prices higher than the presently prevailing world prices
and little coffee is being exported at the present time. Instead exporters have
engaged in substantial short-term borrow-ng, especially foreign borrowing, in
order to finance their inventories.   Jezen  declines in beef prices have con-
tributed to a i0 percent drop in export volumes thus far in 1)711. compared with
the same period in 1973. As a result of the decline in world economic activity,



- 3 -
wood prices have also leveled off recently, and demand for Honduran sawn
lumber has declined substantially from last year.
10.       At the same time the value of imports increased by 60 percent during
the first eight months of 1974,compared with the same period in 1973. The
increase in imports results from a variety of factors including higher import
prices, a substantial expansion of domestic credit, the availability of
foreign credit,and inventory build-up in anticipation of higher world prices.
By the end of August (i.e. before the hurricane), the net international
reserves of the banking system had fallen from a level of US$33.0 million at
the end of 1973 to US$19.0 million. A still worse showing had been avoided
only by the large scale short-term external borrowing mentioned above
(paragraph 9).
11.       On the other hand, the financial situation of the Central Government
remained strong and encouraging. Between January and September 197h, compared
with the same period in 1973, current revenues increased by 15 percent, current
expenditures grew at a slightly more rapid rate of 16 percent and savings were
up by 12 percent, reaching L 40.6 million; most significantly, Central Govern-
ment capital expenditures were up 28 percent and the stagnation of the past
few years appeared to have come to an end. Fixed capital formation during the
first nine months of 1974 (L 46.3 million) exceeded that of the whole of 1973.
Also, a new banana export tax of US$0.25 per box was introduced in mid-1974,
to be raised in subsequent years by 5 cents per year until US$0.50 cents per
box is reached. The new tax was expected to yield about L 10.0 million in
1974 and about L 30.0 million in 1975.
12.       Hurricane Fifi led to large    scale destruction of Honduras'
principal export crop, bananas. The volume of bananas exported during
the remainder of the year will be minimal and for the whole of 197h about 30
percent below expected levels, while in 1975 banana exports are projected to
be only about 50 percent of normal. Among the other crops, corn, the most
important food crop whose principal harvest was just beginning when the hur-
ricane hit, was also seriously damaged and substantial imports may be neces-
sary to make up for the deficit. Roads, bridges and housing were also heav-
ily damaged. The emergency relief effort mounted in September will have to
be followed by a large public reconstruction program during 1975.
13.       Honduras will need extraordinary international assistance if it is
to be able to carry outthe reconstruction program required and maintain the
momentum of its development efforts. Balance of payments support will be re-
quired in 1975-76 even if, as expected, traditional exports other than bananas
show a substantial recovery. Coffee exports should increase strongly as coffee
inventories are drawn down and prices recover somewhat from their recent very
low levels. Wood exports are expected to experience a gradual recovery in 1975;
this reflects an improvement in the marketing efficiency of the new Honduran
forest corporation as well as better world market conditions. Wood prices, however,
are not expected to grow in real terms over 1974 levels. The volume of beef ex-
ported is also expected to recover gradually in 1975, but world market prices
will grow little over1974 and decline in real terms. Mainly because of the
the drop in banana exports, total export earnings will fall far short of needs
during 1975. In view of the inventory build-up during 1974, merchandise im-
ports have been projected to grow by only about 7 percent in current terms



- 4 -
(or decline by about 5 percent in real terms). Representatives of the
foreign banana companies have stated that the companies plan to invest the
amounts required to finance rehabilitation of their plantations (and have
indicated that they would not make revocation of the new export tax a con-
dition of such investment). Nevertheless, after taking into account a large
inflow of funds from the companies for rehabilitation and other normal capi-
tal inflows, and assuming no net repayment of the short-term credits built
up in 1974, an unfinanced balance of payments gap of about US$60.0 milliun
would be in prospect for 1975.
L1.       During 1976 export earnings may grow by close to 40 percent in cur-
rent terms over 1975. Assuming an import growth of about 6 percent in volume
(i.e., somewhat less than real output) and about 16 percent in current terms,
and given expected normal capital inflows, an unfinanced balance of payments
gap of about US$30 million is projected. Banana exports should be back close
to normal levels by 1976. A small expansion in the volume of coffee exported
is to be expected, and coffee prices are projected at the same real level as
in 1974. The volume of wood exports is expected to recover to its 1973 level,
with prices growing at the rate of world inflation. Also beef export volumes
should continue their recovery to close to earlier levels, but world prices
are expected to grow little and decline further in real 1974 terms. (The
long-term outlook for wood and beef remains favorable, however, both in terms
of volume growth and in terms of world prices, which are expected to grow
significantly in real terms towards the end of the decade.)
15.       On the fiscal side, Honduras' need for extraordinary international
assistance in support of its reconstruction and development efforts is reflected
in the fact that, even with much needed revenue measures, heavy budget deficits
would remain in prospect for 1975-76. The current high rate of inflaticn--the
consumer price index is officially estimated to have increased at a rate of 5.5
percent in 1973, and 18 percent in 1974,versus about 2 percent in the years prior to
1973 -- does not permit, in view of the inelasticity of the tax system, a tax
revenue growth of sufficient magnitude to meet needed current expenditures and
still generate savings to finance expanding investment expenditures. Tax
revenues in 1975 will be adversely affected as a result of the hurricane, yet
the basic problem is of a long-term nature and emergency taxes for 1975 woulc
not be an adecuate solution. Additional tax measures are needed which would
permanently yield at least one percent of GDP (US$13.0 million equivalent in
1975). Under this condition and assuming that the new banana tax remains in
effect, it should be possible to generate the savings needed to finance an
adequate share of reconstruction and development expenditures in 1975 and
1976 while at the same time covering high priority current expenditure require-
ments. The latter -- which include a long overdue salary increase for public
employees and agricultural development expenditures -- are vital for the
success of the Honduran development program.

wood prices have also leveled off recently, and demand for Honduran sawn
lumber has declined substantially from last year.
10.       At the same time the value of imports increased by 60 percent during
the first eight months of 1974,compared with the same period in 1973. The
increase in imports results from a variety of factors including higher import
prices, a substantial expansion of domestic credit, the availability of
foreign credit, and inventory build-up in anticipation of higher worLd prices.
By the end of August (i.e. before the hurricane), the net international
reserves of the banking system had fallen from a level of US$33.0 million at
the end of 1973 to US$19.0 million. A still worse showing had been avoided
only by the large scale short-term external borrowing mentioned above
(paragraph 9).
11.       On the other hand, the financial situation of the Central Government
remained strong and encouraging. Between January and September 1974, compared
with the same period in 1973, current revenues increased by 15 percent, current
expenditures grew at a slightly more rapid rate of 16 percent and savings were
up by 12 percent, reaching L ho.6 million; most significantly, Central Govern-
ment capital expenditures were up 28 percent and the stagnation of the past
few years appeared to have come to an end. Fixed capital formation during the
first nine months of 1974 (L 46.3 million) exceeded that of the whole of 1973.
Also, a new banana export tax of US$0.25 per box was introduced in mid-1974,
to be raised in subsequent years by 5 cents per year until US$0.50 cents per
box is reached. The new tax was expected to yield about L 10.0 million in
1974 and about L 30.0 million in 1975.
12.       Hurricane Fifi led to large    scale destruction of Honduras'
principal export crop, bananas. The volume of bananas exported during
the remainder of the year will be minimal and for the whole of 1974 about 30
percent below expected levels, while in 1975 banana exports are projected to
be only about 50 percent of normal. Among the other crops, corn, the most

up in 1974, an unfinanced balance of payments gap of about US$60.0 milliun
would be in prospect for 1975.
14.       Daring 1976 export earnings may grow by close to 40 percent in cur-
rent terms over 1975. Assuming an import growth of about 6 percent in volume
(i.e., somewhat less than real output) and about 16 percent in current terms,
and given expected normal capital inflows, an unfinanced balance of payments
gap of about US$30 million is projected. Banana exports should be back close
to normal levels by 1976. A small expansion in the volume of coffee exported
is to be expected, and coffee prices are projected at the same real level as
in 1974. The volume of wood exports is expected to recover to its 1973 level,
with prices growing at the rate of world inflation. Also beef export volumes
should continue their recovery to close to earlier levels, but world prices
are expected to grow little and decline further in real 1974 terms. (The
long-term outlook for wood and beef remains favorable, however, both in terms
of volume growth and in terms of world prices, which are expected to grow
significantly in real terms towards the end of the decade.)
15.       On the fiscal side, Honduras' need for extraordinary international
assistance in support of its reconstruction and development efforts is reflected
in the fact that, even with much needed revenue measures, heavy budget deficits
would remain in prospect for 1975-76. The current high rate of inflation--the
consumer price index is officially estimated to have increased at a rate of 5.5

employees and agricultural development expenditures -- are vital for the
success of the Honduran developaent program.

16.       The projected US$50.o million equivalent needed from external sources
to support the public sector reconstruction and development program in 1975
and 1976 takes into account not only projected public savings levels but also
the need to keep to a minimum internal financing of the public sector in
order to accommodate private sector credit needs in 1975 and 1976.    These
needs are expected to be unusually high, given the prospect of reduced private
savings coupled with the need to finance reconstruction expenditures.
17.       At a meeting of the major international and bilateral financing
agencies in Honduras in early December, the Government stated its intention
of increasing tax revenues in order to finance an appropriate share of re-
construction and development expenditures, and of exercising control of the
expansion of domestic credit and private foreign borrowing in order to pre-
serve the medium- and longer-term creditworthiness of Honduras. The major
international agencies indicated at the meeting that if these measures are
forthcoming, they would respond positively to Honduras' needs for the above-
mentioned extraordinary assistance to assure adequate financing on appropriate
terms of reconstruction activities and the most important of the planned de-
velopment expenditures. 1/(In this connection, we are considering proposed
Bank Group program assistance of US$15.0 million.)
External Assistance.
18.       At this ooint, the Bank is Honduras' largest creditor, holding 36 per-
cent of the US$207.0 million external public debt outstanding -- including
undisbursed -- repayable in foreign currency, as of December 31, 1973. IDA
holds an additional 16 percent of the total. Although IDB has made loans total-
ing the equivalent of US$87.0 million, almost the entire amount is reDayable
in local currency, so that IDB's share of the public debt repayable in foreing
currency is only 2 percent. CABEI accounts for 20 percent of the total, the
U.S. Government for 22 percent and privately held debt for 4 percent. Of the
US$T .0 million outstanding debt repayable in local currency, the IDB accounts
for 80 percent, CABEI for 1 percent and the USAID for 6 percent. The debt
service ratio is currently 3.4 percent.   It will increase as a result of bor
rowing to offset the effects of the hurricane and the decline in terms of urau ,
however if Honduras is able to obtain generally concessionary terms as has been
the ease in the Dast. the debt service ratio should still remain relatively low.
'19.       While the bulk of Bank Group assistance would be on IBRD terms,
Honduras' poverty and meager resource endownment,coupled with the impact of the
Hurricane on the productive sector of the economy, justify continuation of some
IDA financing. Apart from the Bank Group, external assistance has been provided
principally by USAID, the IDB, and the Central American Bank (CABEI). The lend-
ing of these agencies by sector is summarized below:
1/ Subsequent to the meeting, the Venezuelan Government announced the establish-
ment of a special oil facility for the countries of Central America and Pana-
ma. While we have not yet been informed as to the exact amount that will be
available to Honduras in 1975-76 under this arrangement, it is clear that it
will substantially increase the probabilities of Honduras' obtaining financing
for the full amount of its 1975-76 extraordinary assistance requirements.

PART II - BASK GROUP OPERATIONS IN HONDURAS
20.       Beginning with a loan of US$h.2 million for roads in 1955, Honduras
has to date received thirteen Bank loans totaling $S$)2.2 million and seven
IDA credits totaling US$33.6 million, both net of cancellations. The proposed
loan would raise the total of Bank assistance from US$125.8 million to
US$160. 5 million.
21.       Execution of projects financed by the Bank Group has, on the wli-uie,
been satisfactory.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, ID'
credits and IFC investments, and notes on the execution of on-goirg projects.
22.       In the past, Bank and IDA lending has been heavily concentrated on
transport and power, where inadequate facilities hampered the development of
the country.  The livestock development credit approved in 1970, however,
marked a first step towards the diversification of our lending. Our most
recent operations, signed in FY74, have been for a Second Livestock project
and for a First Education Project which included as major components, pri-
mary teacher training schools and vocational centers. As mentioned above,
we expect to present to you shortly a proposed hurricane reconstruction
program loan and credit. In future lending to Honduras, we plan to support
the priorities of the Government's investment program by giving increased
emphasis to investment in the agriculture and social sectors, while con-
tinuing to lend for physical infrastructure, where there are still substan-
tial deficiencies to be overcome.



- 7 -
23.       As progress in the rural sector is crucial to the country's economic
and social development, we intend to expand our activities in agriculture and
rural development. The objectives of lending in this area will be to support
the Government's efforts to diversify the economy, to develop competitive exports
in high-value products, and to carry out its programs of agrarian reform. To
this end, the IBRD/FAO Cooperative Program is assisting the Government in the
preparation of the proposed Comayagua Valley integrated rural development pro-
ject, which is conceived as the first of a series of projects of a similar
nature. We intend also to further assist the development of the growing live-
stock sub-sector, continuing the trend begun under the second livestock project
of giving increased emphasis to assisting the smaller livestock producers. The
basic problems that must be dealt with if projects are to be developed that will
help achieve Government sectoral objectives, particularly as they apply to small
farmers, are institutional weakness and lack of qualified personnel. Technical
assistance and training will thus be an important component of Bank Group pro-
jects.
24.       Bank assistance in other sectors will in the future be more directly
related to the Government's efforts in the rural sector. Our recent education
loan finances teacher training facilities and application schools for rural
areas and provides assistance to the national agricultural secondary school.
As part of its agrarian reform program, the Government has proposed the creation
of rural development centers, which would provide comprehensive educational
services to rural communities.   Bank assistance in this effort will be considered
as a possible component of a second education loan. In transport we hope to
continue to assist the Government in completing the highway links between the
main regions of the country, but we would in the futurepLace greater emphasis
on assistance in the construction of a network of feeder and access roads to sup-
port the Government's agricultural program. In addition, we have assisted in
port development, and we hope to continue our support for port expansion prograns
which will facilitate the growth of Honduran exports.
25.       Other sectors which are important to Honduras' development efforts,
and wh1ch may receive Bank support, are forestry development and tourism. Hondr
ras' extensive forest reserves are its principal natural resource, and the deve'-
opment of a wood and pulp and paper industry will provide an important source of
growth for future export earnings. Honduras also has potentially excellent tour-
ism sites which are now being studied for future development.
26.       IFC's activities in Honduras have so far included a 1964 loan and a
share subscription,of US$295,ooo and US$66,750 respectively, in a tannery, Em-
presa de Curtidos Centro Americana,S.A.(IECCASA);and a US$75,ooo share subscrip-
tion in a pilot promotional company, Compaflia Pino Celulosa de Centro America
(COPINO) in 1969. COPINO was established to develop an industrial project based
on timber from the Olancho Forest Reserve. The project has been dormant since
1971 for a variety of reasons. Although the Government now appears prepared to
proceed with it, their intentions regarding a future role for COPINO remain to
be determined.



PART III - THE SECTOR
Principal Characteristics
27.       There is a continuing and growing demand on the part of industry
and agriculture for the development of the electric power sector. Generation
has almost doubled in the past five years,and in addition to development
of the urban distribution network , a start has been made in extending service
to rural villages previously without public electricity supply. Annual
electricity consumption of 150 kWh pcr capita is one of the lowest in Central
America, where average consumption in the other countries ranges from 145 kWh
to 700 kWh per year.
28.       Already the dominant sector entity, the Government-owned Empresa
Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) is further increasing its scope of
operations by absorbing privately -or municipally-owned utilities, extending
its service to rural villages, and replacing captive generation of large
industrial installations. As shown in the following table, ENEE in 1973
produced about 83 percent of the country's public-service electricity gene-
ration:
GWh        Percent
ENEE generation - hydro                330           74

Total ENEE                             370           83
Other utilities                        75           17
Total                                  445          100
29.       ENEE has an installed generating capacity of 140 MW. Its main
system includes six power plants (2 hycro, 2 diesel and 2 gas turbines),
interconnected by about 600 Km of 138 kV and 69 kV lines.   In addition.
ENEE has approximately 6 MW installed capacity in eight isolated diesel
stations.
30.       ENEE acquired the La Ceiba distribution system from Standard
Fruit in 1973 and has begun to supply bulk electricity to the distribution
systems in Tela and Progreso, which are owned by a United Fruib subsidiary.
The fruit companies have placed their old, inefficient diesel generators
in those cities on standby.  Only a few small rural municipally-owned
utilities remain to be absorbed by ENEE.
31.       With the incorporation of the La Ceiba and Tela areas, ENEE's
sales are expected to grow about 32 percent in 1974. Thereafter, until
1980, ENEE's main-system and total sales are expected to increaseat about
one third this rate. The forecast is based on ENEE's prediction of bulk



-9-
sales after consultation with large and medium-sized industrial consumers,
and of area trends established by ENEE's continuing observation. Because
of their uncertainty due to the possibility that the fruit companies may
provide their own power, energy sales for fruit company irrigation pumping
have not been included in the forecast. ENEE sales grew at about 13
percent annually during 1969-73, while it was taking over service to many
new areas, and are projected to increase at 11 percent per year.
32.       While ENEE has almost tripled its number of customers in the past
ten years, public electricity supply is still available to only about 18
percent of the country's population. ENEE's load is primarily commercial-
industrial, as shown in the table below. ENEE's high annual load factor
(62 percent) is explained by the large proportion of sales to industrial
customers.

With the rural extensions and distribution works underway and included in
the project, ENEE intends to provide service to 126,500 customers by the
end of the project period, making public electricity supply available to
about 30 percent of the population.
Bank Operations
33.       Since 1959, there have been five Bank/IDA lending operations
totalling US$45.0 million for power development in Honduras as detailed
in Annex II. The first three projects, which included the initial two
stages of the Yojoa-Rio Lindo development, have been completed successfully.
The fourth project is practically completed, although with delays of about
one year caused by revisions in the design layout of transmission works
and late deliveries of major project components. In the fifth project,
completion of the Honduras-Nicaragua interconnection line will be about
one year behind schedule because of initial delays in negotiation of a
contract (signed in May 1973) with Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF),



the Nicaraguan utility. As part of the Fourth and Fifth Projects, ENEE
has undertaken an extensive program of extending its service to rural
villages previously without public electricity supply. Under this program,
installation of 34 kV lines to serve the Comayagua and Tamara valleys was
completed in 1972-73.
34.       The Bank's lending program for electric power is designed to
enable us to continue institution-building begun under earlier loans, to
help Honduras offset the effects of the fuel crisis, to foster the deve-
lo,pment of a regional approach to power development in Central America,
to assist the Government to mobilize the external resources required for
its hydro-electric development program, and to support the rural electrifi-
cation program which is an important complement to the Government's agrarian
reform activities.
Future Development
35.       Studies of Honduras' fossil fuel and geothermal supply base have
just begun. There are some indications of natural gas, oil and low-grade
coal deposits. Minor oil discoveries have been made, but commercial viability
of deposits has not been established. The Government recently requested
a UNDP reconnaissance mission to undertake a study of the country's geothermal
potential, concentrated in the Pacific zone.
36.       Honduras' hydroelectric potential is large0   A 1967 hydro survey
of western and central Honduras identified the best potential sites for
future development. ENEE's present plans include development of the most
promising schemes identified in that survey. The consulting firm which
prepared the 1967 survey is now conducting a similar survey of hydro resources
in eastern Honduras, financed by the Fifth Power Project, which is scheduled
for completion in 1976.
37.       The Fifth Power Project appraisal report (No. PU-90a, June 2, 1972)
indicated that ENEE's probable next project would be the El Cajon hydro-
electric plant in central Honduras, with capacity then estimated at 4'° MW,
and that it should be in operation by year-end 17 8 t;o supply the incremental
requirements of both Honduras and Nicaragua. However, the project feasibility
study concluded that it would be more economic to complete a slightly larger
- about 500 MW - version of' El Cajon in the mid 198Os. Based on teasibility
level design, the 300 MW first stage of El Cajon would cost about US$254 million
including price escalation and associated 230 kV transmission, but without in-
terest during construction. If the first stage is to be completed by the early
1980s, construction would have to begin in 1975-76 since it will take seven
years to build. A final technical review which confirmed the results of the
project feasibility study has been made,and on this basis ENEE's Board decided
in November, 1974, to proceed with El Cajon. Assistance has been requested
from the World Bank, the Inter-Anerican Development Bank and the Central Ameri-
can Bank (CABEI) for its financing, and ENEE has also begun to seek commitments
from Nicaragua to buy electricity produced at El Cajon (via the interconnection
which is now being constructed).



- 11 -
38.       In view of its large size, arranging financing for El Cajon may
be difficult. There is, however, an alternative (though less economic) hydro
Froject available, if necessary, which consists of construction of the
smaller Naranjito project as a next step. The feasibility study for Na-
ranjito should be completed shortly.
39.       Because of postponement of El Cajon beyond 1978  ENEE now intends to
meet its incremental requirements for the period before either El Cajon or Na-
ranjito comes on stream with the 40 MW extension of the Rio Lindo hydro plant,
which is the principal component of the proposed project. ENEE and the Nica-
raguan power company will use the interconnection line now under construction
for transferring emergency power and surplus energy on a short-term basis
between their two systems, thus reducing overall reserves requirements. The
interconnection line would also provide reserves for Honduras in case of dry
years or delays in completion of the Rio Lindo extension.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
-40.       This project constitutes the third stage of the Lake Yojoa-Rio
Lindo hydro development the first two stages of which were financed by the
Bank under its second and third loans for power; it was appraised in April/
May 1974. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington during
the last week of November. ENEE was represented by Messrs. Caballero, the
General Manager and Cosenza, the Assistant Manager for Power. The Honduran
Government was represented by Mr. Jimenez, the First Secretary of the Hon-
duran Embassy. A report entitled ?tAppraisal of Sixth Power Project, Honduras "
(dated December 17,197h) is being distributed separately. The main features
of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III.
Project Description and Financing Plan
41.       The sixth power project consists of:
(a)   2 x 20  v     extension of the Rio Lindo hydro plant including
four dams to divert three rivers in the Lake Yojoa area, and
construction of a new pipeline and penstock as well as engineering
and cQnstruction supervision of the works;
3   With peaking capacity of 46 MW,



- 12 -
(b)  distribution system improvements, and extension of electricity
supply to rural areas not presently served, for the four year
period 1975-78;
(c) materials and equipment needed for system repairs and rehabili-
tation necessitated by Hurricane Fifi which occurred in September
1974;
(d) studies of possible future projects, administrative improvements
and tariffs; and
(e) training of ENEE's professional staff.
42.       The project would be carried out during 1975-78.    The Rio Lindo ex-
tension is expected to be commissioned by June 30, 1976. The estimated pro-
Ject completion date is December 31, 1978.
43.       The distribution system improvements include a 138/13.8 kV-25 MVA
substation  in the San Pedro Sula area, as well as primary (13.8kV) and sec-
ondary lines, transformers and meters needed to satisfy increased requirements
of existing customers and to provide electricity supply to new customers in
the cities ENEE serves. The loan would also finance a 138 kV mobile substa-
tion to restore service quickly to areas affected by outages.
44.       Extension of supply to rural areas will follow the pattern begun in
the fourth and fifth projects, in which ENEE builds 34 kV lines to, and installs
distribution facilities in villages where the government has recently invested
in other infrastructure. This program, established by ENEE in 1964, gives
priority for extending service to 23 rural areas with limited or no public
electricity supply. From the 23 areas, ENEE selects zones with the best po-
tential market and located closest toits existing facilities for inclusion in
the program. ENEE has now completed transmission and distribution facilities
for several valleys, and similar works are under way to serve towns near La
Ceiba, Tela, Puerto Cortez, and in the southern zone. With gover-nment contri-
butions and funds from the proposed loan, the utility would continue this
work. The Loan Agreement provides (Section 3.01(b))that ENEE will give the
Bank satisfactory economic justification for the selected service extensions
before proceeding with them.
45.       The studies for future projects proposed to be financed under this
project include a feasibility study for the 120 MW Remolino project downstream
from El Caj6n, and studies for the construction of facilities to improve elec-
tricity supply to customers in isolated rural areas.    The other s-ludies to be
financed involve development of systems for effective budget    onr-rol, and a
review of the tariff structure to ensure that it promotes the most economic
patterns of energy consumption.
46.       The project's estimated cost totals US$5507 million wLth a US$40.7
million foreign cost component.   The proposed loan of US$35.0 xillicn would
cover 86 percent of the foreign cost and would also include int-rest during
construction of UJS$4.30 million. The remaining 14 percent of foreign cost
would be financed primarily by CABEI.   Local cost financing in -i;e amount
of US$15.0 million would be prcvided by ENEE from its own resources. (Detail-
ed information on the financing plan is provided in Annex III.)



- 13 -
Project Entity.
47,ft      The proposed loan would be made to ENEE, the autonomous government-
owned corporation established in 1957 for the development and operation of
power facilities in the country. It is governed by a five-member Board of
Directors, including the Minister of Natural Resources, the Minister of Com-
munications and Transport, and representatives of the Planning Council, the
National Development Bank and the private sector. The Board appoints ENEE's
general manager.who is responsible for all managerial and administrative
activities.
48.       Until the late 1960s, ENEE's engineering staff was quite weak. Using
funds from the fourth and fifth project loan/credits, ENEE has hired expatriate
engineers to assist and train its staff and sent key staff members to foreign
utilities and engineering consulting firms for training related to specific
tasks. While the utility's technical capability has improved significantly,
further training is necessary. Funds from the proposed loan would assist
this effort.
49.       Progress in achieving administrative efficiency has been slow. Until
implementation of a computerized system in 1973, customer billing and collec-
tion was inefficient, but this is now improving. Using fifth power project
funds, ENEE's management consultants are developing computer-based systems
for inventory control, payroll and budget applications.
Financial Position of the Borrower
5b.       ENEE maintained a high rate of return -- from 10 to 16 percent on
an original cost rate base -- from 1966-73. Because of recent worldwide and
Honduran price inflation, its rate base is undervalued and its tariffs, which
have not been increased since 1964, are no longer sufficient to produce the
10 percent return as required by previous loan agreements. (In 1974 ENEE's
rate of return was 7.5 percent.) Revaluation is now being studied, and
the Loan Agreement requires ENEE to reflect the asset revaluation in its
books of account (Section 5.01(b)). In order to continue earning a 10 percent
return on its revalued rate base during the project period (a requirement which
has again been included in the Loan Agreement (Section 5.04(a)),ENEE has re-
cently approved   an increase in tariffs by an amount sufficient to provide
an increase in revenues of about 25 percent and has introduced a fuel ad-
justment clause. As in previous Loan Agreements, a clause is included (Section
5.04(c)) requiring the utility not to reduce tariffs from their increased
levels during U-he project implementa-ion perioa.



- i4 -
51.       As a result of the substantial borrowing that will be necessary if
the El Caj6n project is undertaken, ENEE's debt/equity ratio will increase from
42/58 at year-end 1974 to 75/25 in 1979. If ENEE does not proceed with El
Caj6n and instead undertakes Nlaranjito as its next project, its debt/equity
ratio would ascend to only about 50/50 by 1979. ENEE's debt service coverage
by net internal cash generation is projected to be satisfactory,ranging from
1.6 in 1974 to 2.4 in 1978. However, since ENEE's future debt service will
increase sharply, the debt-service test included in previous loan agreements,
whereby ENEE will not incur long-term debt without the Bank's approval unless
its most recent 12-month internal cash generation is at least 1. times its
maximum debt service for any succeeding fiscal year, will be repeated in
the proposed Loan Agreement (Section 5.07).
52.       During the five-year project period 1974-78, net internal cash
generation will finance 14 percent of EiEE's construction program plus additions
to working capital,if they proceed with the construction of El Caj6n in 1975/76.
ENEE's low contribution-to-expansion ratio for the project period reflects the
large borrowing necessary for construction of this project, rather than poor
financial performance. Were it not for El Cajon, all of the utility's financial
indicators would be satisfactory throughout the project period.
53.       The financing plan assumes   the reinvestment of all net income; as
has been the case in past lending operations, the loan agreement provides
that ENEE agrees to retain all its earnings during the project period for
investment in new facilities (Section 5.35).
54.       The only substantial outstanding receivable whose collection is
questionable is that of Servicio Autonomo Nacional de Acueductos y Alcantarilla-
dos (SANAA), the government water-supply agency, which owed ENEE about L370,000
(US$105,000) at the end of 1973.   ENEE  had for  many  years  used   SANAA
water for two small hydroelectric plants near Tegucigalpa,but declined to pay
what it considered to be exorbitant charges for use of the water for electric-
ity generation; SANAA, in turn, never paid electricity bills to EIPEE.  The
generating plants were retired from service in 1970 and 1973, but SANAA still
is not paying for electricity purchased from EUEE. ENEE has reached tentative
agreement with SANAA providing that each agency release its obligations for
charges against the other prior to 'l)74. Since SANIAA's financial condition
is weak and not expected to improve in the foreseeable future, the Guarantee
Agreement provides (Section 3.04) that the Government will take the steps
necessary to cause payment of SANAA's 1974 bills to ENEE by year-end 1975 and
its future bills within two months of billing date.
Procurement and Disbursement.
55.       All contracts for Bank-financed civil works, plant and equipment
would be awarded following international competitive bidding in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Local preferences would not apply, since
none of the items financed by the Bank Loan are produced locally.



- 15 -
56.       Disbursements from the loan account would be made for:
a.   the foreign costs of: 'supply and erect" contract for pipe-
line, penstock,surge tank and accessories; studies and train-
ing: and the portions of the consultant's contract dealing
with final design and engineering and construction supervision;
b.   the cif cost of equipment and materials plus foreign costs
for factory representatives to supervise erection, as appro-
priate;
c.   55 percent of the total cost of the civil works contract,
representing the estimated foreign cost component; and
d.   interest on the Bank loan through July 31, 1978, the estimat-
ed completion date of the hydro plant extension.
57.       Except for engineering, no contracts would be awarded before loan
approval. To meet completion schedules for the various elements of the hydro
scheme, retroactive financing of up to US.$500,000 is recommended for engineer-
ing services provided after March 1, 197h. Estimated loan disbursements are
shown in Annex III.
Economic Justification
50.        The project is technically sound, and the least cost means of meet-
ing demand at discount rates up to 20 percent. The financial rate of return
oII the project investment -- defined as the discount rate which equalizes the
stream of expected revenues attributable to the project with its costs -- is
22.5 percent. While these calculations do not reflect price- inflation beyond
1974 in the project's capital or operating costs, it is expected that revenues
would be increased to offset any future inflation-related cost increases.
Xtisks and Special Factors.
59.       The project's critical element in terms of both price and construc-
tion period is the pipeline/penstock. While price contingencies (which are
slightly higher than those generally used for projects of this nature) and
construction period assumed in the appraisal appear sufficient now, further
accelerated worldwide demand for steel could result in project delays and
cost increases.
6o.       The following envfrnmental aspects should be noted:    (a)  the river
diversion scheme will raise Lake Yojoa's maximum level by about one meter and
create two small reservoirs. The land to be inundated is practically uninhabit-
ed; the Loan Agreement (Section 3.07) provides that ENEE agrees to resettle
Qr compensate the few (about ten) families living in this area in a satisfac-
tory manneri(b)to minimize sedimentation in the reservoirs and canals, the
Guarantee Agreement (Section 3.03) provides that the Government will take the
measures necessary to enforce existing legislation for soil conservation and
control cf logging operations in the area.



- 16 -
61        In order to insure the safety and proper functioning of the dams and
related structures, EiE will provide the Bank, by June 30, 1977, with a program for
their periodic inspection and maintenance, and will put such program into effect
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank (Section 4.01 (d)).
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.       The   Loan Agreement  between the  Bank and ENEE,  the Guarantee
Agreement between the Republic of Honduras and the Bank, the Report of the Com-
mittee provided for in Article III,Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. Features of the loan documents of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 44, 50, 5i,53,5h, 60 and 61 of this report.
63.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOI'MEODATIO:NS
64.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECIUTION
Loan /credit No.
Ln. 692            Fourth Power Project: US$5-5 million loan of
June 24h, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
This project,now practically complete, was delayed
by about a year as a result of revision in the design
layout of transmission works and late deliveries of
major project components.
Ln. 767            Second Port Project: US$6.0 million Loan of June 25,1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project consist of the expansion of Puerto Cortes on
the North Coast of Honduras, and the construction of the
new port of Henecan, in the South. The project was
delayed about 18 months as a result of Government recon-
sideration of the location of the South Coast port.
Progress has been good on the expansion of Puerto Cortes,
and it should be cmuipleted in March,1975. Bids for the
construction of the port at Henecan are due in November
1974, and if work starts in March 1975 it should be
completed in November 1976. As a result of inflation
and currency realignsents  we estimate a US$2 million
cost overrun on this project. The Bank is now consid-
ering a borrower request for additional financing.
Ln 841             Fifth Power Project: US$12.3 million Loan of June 28,1972;
Closing Date: June 30,1976.
Campletion of the Honduras-Nicaragua interconnection line,
a principal element of this project, will be delayed by
about one year because of delays in negotiation of a
contract (signed in May 1973) with Empresa Nacional de
Luz y Fuerza (ENALUJF), the Nicaraguan utility. The
extension of service to the Aguan Valley will be delayed
by at least a year because of delays in negotiations
with the principal potential customer in the valley,
Standard Fruit. Other elements of the fifth project
(extensions to new areas, the 26 MW La Ceiba diesel
plant, consulting services and training) have either
been completed or are proceeding on schedule.
/ These notes are designed to inform the Excecutive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems which are
being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan/Credit No.
Ln. 896            Sixth Highway Project: US$18.8 million Loan of May 30,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
This project, for construction of the Tegucigalpa- Ta-
langa highway,.was delayed by about six months while
the Goverhment redesigned sections of the road in an
attempt to lower costs. Bids were opened in mid-May
and an award was made. Construction has begun and
should be completed by September 1976. Engineering
studies of feeder roads to complement the highway
are also underway.
Cr. 434            Second Livestock Project:  US$ 6.6 million Credit of
October 29,1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
This credit became effective January 18, 1974. CGm-
mitments of loans funds to sub-borrower have begun
and disbursements are proceeding on schedule; however,
some sub-borrowers under the ?irst Livestock Project
may have had cattle and installations destroyed by
Hurricane Fifi, and we will consider using funds under the
Second Project to provide assistance to previous sub-
borrowers who suffered losses as a result of the storm.
Ln. 954.           First Education Project: US$3.0 million Loan and US$3.0
Cr. 452            million Credit, both of January 9, 1974; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
The Loan and Credit became effective on April 8, 1974.
The project is proceeding normally with preparation of
plans for teaching and training facilities.
