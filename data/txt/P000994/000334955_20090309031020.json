Project\n            achievements fell short of ambitious appraisal scope and\n            design complexity. The benefits of components such as\n            technical assistance and provision of recurrent costs were\n            low in relation to their costs. Lessons learned from the\n            project are: project preparation should select implement\n            able key components; construction components should be\n            properly prepared, although they are usually less\n            significant than software components in addressing sector\n            issues; although technical assistance is essential\n            particularly when the capacity of the sector agencies is\n            low, it should be tailored to the agency's absorptive\n            capacity, and should be closely supervised; and project\n            management units should help in institution building and\n            receive close review from the management of the implementing\n            agency. Further, national counterparts should always be\n            involved in project preparation and start-up activities and,\n            as much as possible, there should be continuity or, when\n            staff changes are unavoidable, there should be well planned\n            and smooth transition of Government counterparts during implementation."}, "docdt": "1993-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
