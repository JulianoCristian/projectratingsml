To address these\n            objectives, the project intends to (i) support a\n            reorganization of MINSAP including the creation of a\n            planning and evaluation unit and the separation of hospital\n            management from primary health care (PHC); (ii) introduce a\n            management information system and develop a reliable\n            population, health and nutrition (PHN) data base; (ii)\n            implement rational financial planning and management\n            procedures; (iv) support implementation of a plan to improve\n            drug system management; and (v) develop and implement a\n            model for routine supervision for the PHC delivery\n            throughout the country's eight regions. Further to\n            this, the project entails (vi) rehabilitating and\n            reequipping some 25 health centers; (vii) providing drugs,\n            vehicles, supplies and other inputs to rural facilities; and\n            (viii) instituting a regular program of in-service training\n            to upgrade skills of health personnel at all levels."}, "docdt": "1987-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
