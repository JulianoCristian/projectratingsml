FIRST TELECOMMINICATIONS PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:        Office Natiop,l des Postes et Telecommunications du Maroc,
ONPT (National Posts and Telecommunications Office)
Guarantor:       Kingdom of Morocco.
Amount:           $125 million equivalent.
Terms:            20 years, including 5 years of grace, at standard variable
interest rate. ONPT will bear the foreign exchange risk
and will pay a 1% guarantee fee to Goverament.
Project          The project is an integral but self-contained part of
Description:     rNPT's investment program and will be implemented during
1987-1994. It aims at expansion, improvement and
modernization of the telecommunications network. Major
emphasis is placed on institutional development as the
principal means of strengthening implementation capacity.
The project comprises: (a) installation of exchange
capacity by about 290,000 telephone lines and 6,500 telex
lines, together with the associated external plant and
transmission equipment which includes replacement of worn
out switching equipment (34,000 telephone lines) and
rehabilitation of lïne distribution networks; (b)
automation of networks fo, about 20,000 subscribers in
distant rural districts, and provision of service to 89
isolated areas; (c) improvement and expansion of
specialized services (telex, data systems, mobile land and
maritime radio-communications); (d) strenghtening of
ONPT's subscriber lhue connection, maintenance and service
quality monitoring capacity; (e) improvement of common
service facilities; and (f) training and technical
assistance.
Project Benefits The project will benefit all sectors of the Moroccan
and Rises-:      economy.  An adequate telecommunications infrastructure is
a prerequisite to achieving Government's objectives of
overall economic growth and balanced regional development,
and allows more efficient utilization of transportation,
including energy conservation. The project vill also
serve as a catalyst to mobilize and transfer resources to
Goverument. The project faces no unusual risks.  Project
implementation would be adversely affected if the
anticipated organizational and management improvements are
not fully attained or delayed. This risk is contained by
the technical assistance component and by the mouitoring
and review procedures included in the project.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Goverument of Morocco has requested Bank assistance in
financing a high priority telecommunications project. Principal project
objectives are: institution building, sector expansion and service
improvement. The Bank has had no previous lending operation in this sector
in Morocco. Government requested a Bank sector study in 1982 and agreed
that sector restructuring would take place prior to a Bank project. As a
result, the Office National deG Postes et Teiecommunications (ONPT) vas
created ln January 1984, to operate all posta and telecomminications
services in the country on a commercial basis.
1.02      After years of underinvestment in the sector, Government bas
accorded high priority to the development of a sound telecommunications
infrastructure. Presently inadequate telecommunications facilities have
hampered balanced regional development and have been a constraining factor
în the developuent of industry and trade, particularly in the export
sector. In addition, it has hampered efforts to expand the economy's
agricultural base and to decentralize industry and commerce away from
the Casablanca-Rabat-Kenitra axis. Consequently, Governument decided to
increase annual expenditures on telecommunications from about 0.09% of GNP
on average during 1980-1984 to 1.5% of GNP during 1985-1990. lu fact,
however, program implementation is expected to be stretched through 1994,
which reduces annual expenditures to about 1.0% of GNP.
1.03      The Government's sector objectives during the program period are
to lncrease accesa to service in urban, rural and isolated areas to meet
part of the large unsatisfied demand and to improve service. A second
major objective is to utilize the revenue earning potential of an efficient
telecommunications service to increase resource mobilization. Tc meet
demand, ONPT aima to more than triple existing telephone line capacity
during the program implementation period. The program also provides for
balanced expansion and modernization of long distance, international and
rural telecommunications systems, and facilities to improve operation,
maintenance and service.
1.04      The Bank-financed project emphasizes the need for institutional
improvement in order to achieve rapid implementation of the investment
program. During project preparation, a substantial technical assistance
component vas implemented under separate financing. The project provides
further technical assistance and provides 290,000 telephone and 6,500 telex
lines of installed exchange capacity and related facilities for the
intvrurban, international and rural networks.



-2-
1.05      The estimated cot of the project 1s DR 6,072 million ($674.5
million) vith a foreign exchange component cf DR 2,835 million ($314.9
million). Local costs of DU 3,237 million ($359.6 million), including
DR 1,163 million ($129.2 million) for customas duties and taxes, are
expected to be financed by ONPT from net internal cash generation.  The
Bank vould finance $125 million of foreign costs for such items as local
networks and transmission equipment for regional and specialized systems.
Parallel financing is being arranged for about $190 million worth of other
project components, notably sophisticated switching and transmission
installations.
1.06      The project vill be substantially completed by end-1992, with
retention payments falling due in 1993 and 1994.  The disbursement schedule
is in line with the Bank's standard disbursement profiles for projects in
Morocco and for telecommunications projects worldwide.
II. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
A. Background
Sector Reorganization
2.01      Until the end of 1983, postal/financial and telecommunications
services were operated by the Ministry of Posts and Telecomminications
(MPT).  Following the recommendations of a Bank sector study (1982), which
concluded that a large telecommunications investment program could only be
implemented following substantive institutional reform, Government
undertook to change the sector organization. ONPT was created on January
1, 1984 and responsibility for posts and telecommunications services Was
transferred from MPT to ONPT. The entity operates on a commercial basis
and has legal and financial autonomy.  A separate government-owned company,
Societe Marocaine de Telecommunications par Cables Sous-Marins (MATELCA.)
operates and maintains the transmission facilities of the international
submarine cables linking Morocco with European and African countries.
Demand for Service
2.02      As of end 1986, there vere about 253,000 telephone DELs in
service and a waiting list of 169,000 registered applicants; only about
60% of expressed demand vas satisfied. Historical and projected growth of
expressed demand (DELs in service plus unsatisfied demand) for telephone
service is shown in Annex 1.  From 1979-86, the anzual growth of expressed
demand and connected DELs averaged 9.5% and 7.0% respectively. The waiting
time for obtaining a telephone connection is currently six years. There is
significant suppressed demand, since potential subscribers are discouraged
from registering by these extremely long waiting times. Demand for



-3-
telephone service is estimated to continue to grow at about 12% per year
over the 1987-94 period. Under the proposed project, connected DELs are
'orecasted to increase by 16% per annum, compared to an average of about 7%
at present. Even at that rate, only about 80% of expressed demand would be
met by 1994. The number of telex subscribers has more than quadrupled
during the last decade to about 6,700 DELs in service, but unsatisfied
demand ls still 17% of expressed demand. The current waiting time for a
telex connection is two years. Under the proposed project, demand for
telex and specialized services vould be fully met by 1994.
Access to Service
2.03      Telephone density In Morocco as of end 1986 vas about 1.0 DEL per
100 population. This is about half that of neighboring Mediterranean
countries, e.g., Algerîa (2.0) and Tunisia (2.0). Existing telecommunica-
tions services are concentrated in urban areas. Almost 80% of the DF.Ls in
service are located in nine large cities and provincial centers, with 42%
of the population (Table 2.1).

Telex service is primarily used for public administration, business and
international communications. It is heavily concentrated in Casablanca,
Rabat and Tanger, which account for over 80% of telex lines and about 90%
of telex traffic. Despite this urban concentration, some form of
telecommunications service is available in most provinces and rural areas
and only 4% of rural conmunities is without service. ONPT operates about
2,100 public call offices throughout the country. Details of the regional
distribution of telephone service are in Annex 2.
2.04      Subscriber trunk dialing la available for 90Z of all DEL's.
International service is provlded through submarine cables to France,
Por.ugal and Senegal, two standard A and one standard B earth satellite



-4-
stations, and microvave and coaxial cable links to Spain and Algeria.
About 85% of telephone subscribers in large urban snd some provincial areas
have direct dialing accesa to 22 countries. The autematic telex network is
connected to four principal and six satellite exchanges, and to a
countrywide telegraph service. All telex subscribers have automatie access
to 80 countries, and manual accese to about 70 other countries.
Usage of Service
2.05      As of the end of 1986, 17% of telephone DELa were for Government
and public agencies, 35% for business and professionals, and 48% for
residential premises. Given the large unsatls'ied demand (para 2.02) some
tesidential telephones are aise used for commercial activities. Telex and
telegraph facilities are a.so principally used for business. Average
telephone usage is currently about 7,500 metered pulses per DEL; this
number is far higher than the worldwide average (about 5,000) and is
another indicator of large unsatisfied demand. The level of congestion
tmplied by these figures actually reduces system efficiency (para 2.06),
guality of Service and Existing Facilities
2.06      Existing facilities are reasonably well maintained and operated,
but the quality of service is unsatisfactory because of unsufficient
traffic handling capacity. With installed capacity of 285,000 exchange
lines and 253,000 DELs in service, telephone exchange fill averages about
89%, which is very high. In the commercial districts of Casablanca and
Rabat, the exchange fill is as high as 92%. This results in traffic
congestion. About 20% of installed exchange capacity and subscriber line
networks iL large cities is obsolete and worn-out, and small manual
switchboards are still used in rural and isolated areas. Peak hour local
call completion rates are below 60% in Rabat and 50% in Casablanca. Only
20% to 30% of peak hour interurban and international calls are completed.
Faults averaging 0.9 per line in service per annum (an acceptable level
would be 0.5) principally originate in subscriber line networks and outside
plant. Only about two-thirds of faulte are cleared within 48 hours (90%
would be an acceptable standard in urban areas). Basic data on existing
telecommunications facilities are presented in Annex 3.
Manufacturing, Assembly and Installation Industry
2.07      Morocco has a small telecommunications manufacturing, assembly,
installation and construction industry. It comprises one government-owned
company, Societe Nationale des Telecommunications (SNT) and four small
private companies. SNT participates in the installation and construction
of ONPT's local and urban networks, installs and maintains private
telecomu.nications equipment, and has equity participation in the four
private firms. The four private companies are local subsidiaries of
foreign suppliers. Three of them assemble or produce minor switching,
radio, teleprinter, and power equipment components; the fourth factory



- 5 -
produces cables and meets a substantial part of ONPT's needs for cables and
accessories. Value added in this type of manufacturing is limited. This
is not expected to change during the project period due to the relatively
small 81ze of the domestic market and rapid changes ln technology.
Government and ONPT intend to strengthen the local manufacturing industry,
where justified by market size and benefits from import substitution, and
to encourage participation of local private entrepreneurs in the
installation of cable networks and subscriber plant. However,
opportunities to establish economical manufacturing plants are limited and
need to be carefully selected. During negotiations, assurances Were
obtained from Government that acceptable feasibility studies will be
undertaken before making additional public sector investments in the
telecommunications tanufacturing industry, and that copies of those studies
and the recommendations based thereon vill be furnisted to the Bank [para
7.01(a)].
B. The Sector
Sector Goals
2.08      In light of Goverument's decisioni to improve the
telecommunications infrastructure, ONPT's investuent program for 1987-1994
alms at increasing installed exchange capacity from 285,000 (end 1986) to
about one million in 1994, i.e., an average growth rate of 17% per year.
Over the same period, the number of connected subscribers would increase
f rou 253,000 to 820,000, or 16% per year. In addition to the prlmary goal
of system expansion, emphasis is teing placed on improvement of existing
facilities and service and on meeting the demand for new services.
Central to the achievement of these objectives are improved management and
organization and a high degree of financial self-sufficiency.
2.09      In addition to meeting these quantitative targets (para 2.08),
ONPT has set itself the following broad program objectives during the
project imp4zmentation period:
(a) institutionial improvement through improved management and
organization, notably in the areas of planning, project
implementation, subscriber connection, and financial
management;
(b) replacement of obsolete and worn equipment;
<c) provision of access to service to ail areas currently
without it and meeting 80% of expressed demand by 1994;
(c) improvement of traffic flow, service, operation and
maintenance, using digital technologies;
(d) provision of specialized and new services; and



-6-
(e) development of efficient network construction, subscriber
plant installation and equipment manufacturing
industries.
Sector Constraints
2.10      Institutional - The principal constraint on efficient
implementation of the proposed investment program is ONPT's organization
and management. Until recently ONPT Was, de facto, etill a government
department in this respect. The organization did not allow for integrated
decision-making by principal branch of activity. Consequently, the
management framework, financial and manpower policies, and the information
base vare fragmented. These factors limited ONPT's capacity to act swiftly
in implementing an investment program that calls for increasing installed
capacity by 17% per year and the number of connected subscribers by 16% per
year over an eight-year period, and to efficiently manage the assets 80
created. Therefore, improvements in organization and management (para
4.02), development of a more commercial approach, and realistic phesing of
the proposed investment program through 1994 (para 3.02) vere decided upon
during project preparation and will be implemented under the proposed
project, starting in 1987. While institutional factors, notably management
ant organization, will remain the most critical variable affecting project
implementation, it is felt that these measures are adequate to ensure
smooth project implementation.
2.11      Financial - The scarcity of foreign exchange is another
constraint to very rapid sector development, reflecting Morocco's adverse
balance of payments situation. External financing must be in compliance
with IMP restrictions on the average length of maturities (12 years
minimum). ONPT is seeking cofinancing for the project through price and
terms bidding and tied procurement, whereby commercial loans would be
blended with concessionary financing to obtain the required average
maturities. However, the external resource constraint is expected to
remain significant at least through FY89. Local cost financing is another
constraint. If the program were implemented as originally proposed by
ONPT, the entity would have been able to finance only about 30%-35% of
investment expenditures from net internal cash generation. Since local
costs represent about 53% of total investment expenditures, that would
have re8ulted in local borrowing requirements of about DH 4 billion over
the program period; this vould have far exceeded the capacity of the local
capital market, given demands from other sectors.  Therefore, the external
and local financing constraints also mitigated in favor of rephasing the
investment program over a longer period. This immediately reduced ONPT's
annual external borr.wing requirements and is expected to enable the entity
to meet most local funds requirements from net internal cash generation
(para 5.11).



- 7-
The Bank's Role
2*12      The Bank has had no previous telecommunications lending operation
in Morocco. A Bank sector study (1982) recommended sector restructuring as
a prerequisite for rapid sector expansion. While the legislative framework
for sector restructuring Was established effective January 1984, actual
implementation of the necessary organizational, managerial and legal
measures have lagged behind. It should be emphasized that ONPT is a sound
entity vith a solid record of technical and financial achievements.
fowever, the demande of the proposed investment program require further
improvements in management and organization. Therefore, the Bank's
strategy in the sector has been to help ONPT identify and then alleviate
the institutional and financial constraints facing sector expansion. The
proposed project underscores the need for further organizational
improvement and upgrading of management and management systema to ensure
optimum use of human, financial and material resources. During project
preparation, significant progress vas made in this regard; all necessary
legal measures have now been taken and implementation of improvements in
organization and management is about to start. This vill have maximum
impact on ONPT's project implementation and subscriber connection capacity,
and on its financial performance.  The project coordinates technical
assistance being provided to ONPT and supplements this where necessary, to
ensure that all areas that have a critical impact on program implementation
and financial performance are adequately reinforced. The proposed project
addresses the external financial constraint by funding a sizeable part of
the foreign cost of the firat phase of the investment program and by
assisting ONPT in organizing a cofinancing package that meets IMF
conditionality (para 2.11), while obtaining the best possible prices for
equipment to be procured internationally.
III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
A. Description
The Program
3.01      ONPT's telecommunications investment program comprises: (a)
ongoing works (2Z); new works, including the proposed project (88%); and
preinvestments (future works) for the next investment program (10%). Total
program expenditures are estimated at DH 16.9 billion ($1.71 billion), vith
an estimated foreign exchange component of DH 7.4 billion ($757 million).
Under the program, telephone system capacity would be increased from
285,000 (end 1986) to 1,060,000 lines (end 1997). Telex capacity would be
increased from 7,500 lines to 17,500 lines. Specialized new services would
be provided and domestic long distance, rural, regional and international
telecommunications systems would be modernized.



- 8 -
3.02      In view of existing sector constraints (para 2.11), the Bank
proposed during project preparation that the program implementation period
be extended from 1990 to 1994.  This extended implementation period has
been adopted by ONPT. It allows more sustainable levels of grovth of about
16% per annum; enables ONPT to gradually improve its implementation
capacity, and reduces annual borroving requirements. The program vas also
divided into two phases, with the most urgent works to be implemented
first. The first phase (43% of the program cost, achieving about 47% of
the physical objectives) includes ongoing works and the proposed Bank
project, and would essentially be implemented over 1987-92. Under this
phase about 290,000 lines of new exchange capacity vould be installed in
the system, including replacement of about 34,000 lines. The second phase
(57% of the program cost) vould partly overlap with the first phase and
would be implemented over 1989-94. The decision to proceed with the second
phase would be taken ouly after implementation of the first phase is vell
underway. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained that ONPT vill:
(i) consult with the Bank before lntroducing major changes in its
investment program involving more than 10% of the aggregate amount of
investments during any one year; and (ii) ensure that no such changes will
be introduced unless ONPT and the Bank have agreed that these changes are
justified [para 7.01(b)l.
The Project
3.03      The project is a self-contained part of ONPT's investment program
and would essentially be implemented from 1987 to 1992, with final
acceptance testing to be completed in 1994. It vill add about 290,000 new
lines of exchange capacity and local cable distribution networks for
300,000 subscriber connections, including rehabilitation of obsolete local
distribution networke. Long distance systems will be modernized and
expanded, thus reducing congestion and improving the overall efficiency of
the networks. By end 1994, telephone density vould be about 3 DELs/100
population and approximately 78% of expressed demand would be satisfied,
compared to 1 DEL/100 population snd 59% respectively currently (para
2.02).  At project completion most sector constraints would have bee.
overcome (para 2.10).
3.04      In accordance with sector objectives (para 2.08), the project
comprises:
(a) providing and installing:
(i) about 290,000 lines of local switching and
subscriber equipment in 165 exchanges; and related
switching equipment for domestic and international
trunk exchanges.
(iI) associated local networks and subscriber outside
plant for connection of about 300,000 new
subscriber lines;



- g -
(iii) long distance transmission systems;
(iv) equipment teo expand domestic and international
telex service by about 6,500 exchange lines;
(v) specialized services such as mobile/maritime radio
and data transmission;
(vi) equipuent to upgrade and automate services in 89
distant rural districts and isolated areas;
(vii> technical support services and facilities for
upgrading and strengthening of the organization of
network operation, maintenance and construction;
and
(viii) specialized transport, tools, data processing,
office and training equipment.
(b) replacing about 34,000 lines of worn out exchange
equipment and rehabilitating local distribution networks;
(c) improving ONPT's organization and management systems
through coordination of technical assistance, provision
of 100 manmonths of additional consultancy services, and
purchase of training and data processing equipment.
Details of physical components are shown in Annex 4. Improvements in
organization and management are discussed in Section IV.
B. Costs
Prolect Cost
3.05      The total project cost is estimated at DH 6,072 million ($674.5
million) with a foreign exchange couponent of DH 2,835 million ($314.9
million). About 90% of the total project co0t would be for expansion, 7%
for rehabilitation and 3% for institution building, training and consultan-
cy services. Project base cost estimates reflect end 1986 prices. The
local cost component of DU 3,420 million ($348.9 million) includes DU 1,888
million ($192.6 million) for taxes and customs, the latter averaging about
44% of the c.i.f import cost of telecommunications equipment. Taxes on
local works and services average about 8%. Detailed project costs are in
Annex 5 and summarized in Table 3.1;

Contingencies
3.06       Physical contingencies are 5% on local and foreign costa.   Price
contingencies are based on annual foreign cost increases of 1% in 1987, 1%
in 1988, and 3.5% per annum thereafter. Local cost increases are 8% per
annum during the project period.

3.08      Virtually all local costs will be financed by ONPT (para 5.11).
Foreign cosets will be financed by the Bank ($125.0 million) and other
external sources ($189.9 million). The expansion of existing switching and
transmission facilities requires the use of proprietary and compatible
equipment. About $74.5 million of such equipment will be financed through
mixed credit arrangements currently being negotiated by ONPT and government
under bilateral agreements. The remaining $115.4 million will be financed
through contracts under price and terme international competitive bidding
and limited international bidding (LIB). The decision to award most of
these contracte is expected shortly.

Equipment and works for $75.0 million (including contingencies) financed by
the Bank would be procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines. Selection of Bank-financed consultants ($1.4 million) would be
in accordance vith Bank guidelines. Limited international bidding would be
used to procure $2.2 million of tools, measuring instruments and spares for
local line construction and maintenance centers, workshops and the training
institute to be financed by the loan. LIB has been selected for these
packages as there are only a limited number of suppliers. A preference
limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods or the customs duty,
whichever is lover, vould be extended to domestic manufacturers in
evaluating bids.  Prior Bank review of procurement documentation would be



- 13 -
required for those contracta estimated to be larger than $1 million for
goods and services and $1.2 million for civil works.  About 30 contracta,
(about 40% of all contracta) equivalent to about $100 million (80%) of the
proposed Bank loan vould be reviewed.  Other Bank-financed contracte will
be subject to random post-avard review. Issuance of tenders for a list of
goode and services consisting of: urban cables, joining and supporting
equipment for about 30,000 installed subscriber pairs; equipment and works
for about 400 kilometers of ducts; and microwave equipment for about 4 long
distance links, (para 7.02 (a)] is a condition of effectivenes6 of the
proposed loan.
3.10      ONPT will construct ducts and manholes for amall local and
regional networks by force account. To minimize implementation delays in
the construction of larger local networks, with expansion of more than
6,000 uew subscriber lines each, ONPT will use subcontractors for the
associated civil works.  This meets about half of the requirements under
this 'sub-item vith total costs of about $44.2 million for civil works
including ducts and other construction materials. The indirect foreign
exchange component of these works and construction materials, which is
estimated at $29.1 million, la proposed for Bank financing.  The size and
dispersal of the works for these relatively small subprojecta is unlikely
to attract foreign bidders. Consequently, contracta for civil works for
local network construction, not to exceed $1.0 million each and $22.0
million in total, and supply of contracts for construction materials for
these works, not to exceed $300,000 each and $6.0 million in total, would
be procured under local competitive bidding (LCB), which is open to
participation by locally represented foreign firms.  The project has been
advertised internationally, and all interested foreign firms have
established local representation in Morocco. LCB procurement procedures
vere reviewed during appraisal and are satisfactory.  Civil works contracts
exceeding $1.0 million each and aggregating about $16.2 million equivalent,
including construction materials, would be procured through ICB in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
3.11      Procurement under cofinancing vould be in accordance with the
guidelines of the respective institutions. Negotiated contracta vould be
used to finance $74.5 million of equipment. This includes 90,000 lines of
digital switching equipment, additional line and multiplexing digital
transmission equipment on about 30 existing medium and high capacity
inter-urban links, ten new high capacity cable ant radio transmission
links, and telex, mobile radio and data transmission installations.  About
$40 million of the negotiated contracts are currently under discussion vith
suppliers from France, Sweden and Spain for delivery in 1986-88.  The
remaïning equipment will be procured under price and terme bidding
procedures ($115.4 million). The decision to avard contracts for 200,000
lines of switching and associated transmission equipment vas recently
taken, and contract signature is expected shortly. The remaining tenders
vill be issued in 1988.



- 14 -
3.12       Disbursemerts for contracts above S20,000 would be made against
fully documented withdrawal applications.  Disbursemente for contract less
than $20,000 would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures
(SOEs) detailing individual transactions in a given period, together with a
certification of payment of the amounts involved, and of their eligibility
under the proposed credit. Supporting documentation for SOEs would be
retained by ONPT and made avallable to Bank supervision missions for
review. In order to accelerate disbursements, a replentshable Special
Account of $7.0 million equivalent would be established for ONPT's
diabursements against all expenditures. The Account would he held in the
Bank of Morocco.  Applications for replenishment would be submitted to the
Bank on a bimonthly basis. The estimated disbursement achedule for the
project is shown in Annex 7. This profile is in line with the Bank
standard profile for telecommunications projecta worldwide. The loan would
be clo'ed on December 31, 1994. Proposed disbursements by category are

foreign exchange risk and pay a 1% guarantee on the outstanding balance of
the loan fee on the outstanding balance of the loan to the Government.
ImDlementation
3.13     The project will be implemented by ONPT,  During the previous five
year plan, about 120,000 lines were installed and 50,000 lines and
associated facilities were replaced. New switching and transmission
technologies were introduced. ONPT's implementation capacity will be
substantially reinforced during the proposed project (para 4.03). Major
Bank-financed components, including transmission links and radio equipment,
are expected to be completed by end 1992.  Remaining expenditures comprJse
continued delivery of cables and materials for local networks and do not



- 16 -
involve sophisticated installations. Therefore, the project te expected to
be subtantially completed by December 31, 1992 (Anmex 8). The list of
goods and services to be procured la given in Annex 6.
Implementation and Performance Monitoring
3.14      ONPT's overall performance during the project implementation
period vill be monitored by means of an Action Plan. This Plan contains
indicators relating to subscriber connection, technical and financial
performance, and staffing (Annex 9), and monitors introductior of measures
to obtain institutional improvements. In addition, ONPT and the Bank vill
monitor procurement and project implementation. Continuous monitoring vill
assist ONPT in improving its management and vill allow timely corrective
action to be taken where necessary. During negotiations, assurances vere
obtained from ONPT that it vill carry out the Action Plan for 1987-1994;
present proposed targets for joint review vith the Bank by October 31 of
each year, at which time corrective measures would te taken, if necessary,
to achieve agreed targets; and report progress against the Action Plan by
April 30 of each year (para 7.01(c)). Targets for 1987 and 1988 vere
agreed upon as representing feasible levelas of achievement; the targets for
subsequent years ar. indicative.
IV. THE ENTITY
Statute
4.01      ONPT is responsible for all public telecommunications, postal and
Postal/financial services in Morocco. All operational and contractual
responsibilities for these services> including staff (para 4.08) and assets
and liabilities (para 5.06) vere transferred from the Ministry of P&T to
ONPT. ONPT operates on a commercial basis, has legal and financial
autonomy, and is entitled to borrow externally and domestically.
Organization an, Management
4.02      As a former Government department, ONPT has a legacy of
administrative organization and procedures which are still predominant.
The managerial framework, financial and manpover policies and the
information base are fragmented. Investment planning, procurement
strategies and project implementation are not sufficiently integrated.
Performance la measured by budgetary yardsticks; formulation of corrective
action and utilization of data processing capabilities are inadequate. ln
view of the ambitious targets set under ONPT's investment program, these
deficiencies must be addressed systematically. ONPT recognizes that
overall institutional reform is crucial to efficient project implementation
and has taken initiatives in this respect (para 4.03). Broad areas where
improvement is needed are: (a) ONPT's overall organization and management,



- 17 -
to ensure that its principal branches of activity have a measure of
autonomy and direct responsibility without impairîng overall control and
coordination; (b) stream1ining of the telecommunications branch's
organization and management, and measures to reinforce aubscriber
connection and project implementation capacity; (c) management information
systems, including data processing and accounting; (d) staffing
requirements and recruitment and promotion policies; and (e) training.
4.03      In order to expedite institutional reform and to take advantage
of available concessionary financing, preparation of the organization and
management improvement program was started in June 1985 with the aid of
consultants, under terme of reference acceptable to the Bank. The
management consulting firm SEMA-METRA prepared proposals for ONPT's overall
organization and management (para 4.05), accounting system (para 4.13) and
accounting staff training requirements (para 4.14>. The telecommunications
consulting firm SOFRECOM prepared a proposal for the reorganization and
strengthening of the Department of Telecommunications (para 4.06). The
final proposals, as modified by ONPT, will be implemented during the year
1987. Implementation vill be monitored under the Action Plan (para 3.14),
4.04      ONPT has an eight-member Board of Directors.  The Board is
chaired by the Prime Minister; other Board members are the ministers of
Finance, Interior, Defense, Planning, Economic Affaire, Industry and
Equipment and Transport. The general issue of the composition of the
boards of public enterprises in Morocco is being reviewed by the Bank in
the context of a proposed Public Enterprise Rationalization Loan; the aim
is to make these boards more professional and effective by opening them up
to people vith technical and managerial experience. The Minister of P&T is
serving as acting Director General of ONPT. During the current transition
period and until new organizational and management systems are in place,
this is a satisfactory arrangement. A permanent Director General is
expected to be appointed by 1988.
4.05      The current organization of ONPT consista of a General
Secretariat and six Departments: Telecommunications, Poste and Financial
Services, Finance, General Administration (personnel, social affaire and
legal), Common Services (buildings and transport), and Procurement. The
organization is highly centralized and hence allows for only limited
autonomy at the operational level. A new organizational structure vas
recently recommended by consultants (para 4.03). The consultants proposals
(Annex 10, page 1), as modified by ONPT after consultation vith the Bank,
will be implemented in phases starting in March, 1987. It provides for
adequate autonomy of ONPT' s principal branches of activity
(telecommunications, poste, and financial services), while increasing
responsibility and accountability at all levels. Regional delegations will
have increased operational responsibilities, eile policy control at
headquarters will be strengthened. To achieve this, the number of regional
delegations vil be reduced from the eurrent 41 to 4. As a con4ition of



- 18 -
effectiveness of the loan, ONPT should furnish to the Bank the proposed
program, including an action plan and a time schedule for implementation,
to improve its overall organization, management and operations [para 7.02
(b)I.
Telecommunications Branch
4.06      ONPT's telecommunications branch is responsible for planning
construction and operation of telephone, telegraph, telex and data
transmission services (excluding sound and video broadeasting) within
Morocco and to other countries. It coordinates all civilian use of
telecommunications installations in the country, authorizes independent
private networks, provides dedicated circuits, and is responsible for the
licensing and control of radio frequencies spectrum. As the network has
grown, the Directorate of Telecommunications (DT) at headquarters became
overloaded. Consultants (para 4.03) have presented detailed
recommendations to strengthen DT's management and staff and improve overall
network planning and management. At the same time, the regional
delegations would receive increased authority and responsibility,
particularly in matters of project implementation, operation, maintenance,
and customer relations. DT's new organization structure vill be
implemented concurrently with the overall reorganization (para 4.05). The
organization chart of DT is at Annex 10, page 2.
Postal/Financial Branch
4.07      ONPT's postal/financial branch provides postal services, operates
a nationwide checking account system (Comptes Cheques Postaux--CCP), and
collects funds on behalf of the National Savings Bank (Caisse Nationale
d'Epargne--CEN). Postal/financial services in Morocco are generally
reliable. As of December 31, 1986, there were about 1,100 post offices and
agencies, handling about 300,000 CCP accounts and 575,000 CEN accounts.
CCP is legally part of ONPT. However, its funds are transferred directly
to the Treasury upon receipt. ONPT is compensated at the rate of 1.5% per
annum on the average outstanding balance of private deposits. CEN is
independent of ONPT; the latter is remunerated for its services at the rate
of 0.9% per annum on the average outstanding balance. All funds received
for CEN are transferred directly to the Caisse de Depots et de Gestion.
The remuneration of ONPT for CCP and CEN services is probably inadequate,
considering staff and equipment involved. Accurate costing of these
services will be obtained following the introduction of a cost accounting
system (para 4.13).
Staff and Training
4.08      As of December 31, 1986, ONPT's total staff was about 14,000.
Telecommunications staff, including 45% of common services staff, totalled
7,400, equivalent to 29 employees per 1,000 DELs in service. This is still
high but compares favorably to neighboring countries, e.g., Algeria (36).
Telecommunications staff is expected to double in size to about 14,800 by
end 1994. This would be equivalent to 18 per 1,000 DELs, representing a



- 19 -
substantial improvement ln productivity. This staff ratio is one of the
principal Action Plan indicators to be monitored during project
implementation (para 3.14). A new personnel statute, meeting the
requirements of a commercially oriented autonomous public enterprise, vas
recently adopted. It allows ONPT to attract staff of the necessary caliber
by offering adequate salaries, and introduces adequate flexibility in
personnel policy.
4.09      Current training arrangements are generally satisfactory.  ONPT
ensures specialized staff training through the Institut National des Postes
et Telecommunications in Rabat and four small regional training centers for
field trainlag of lower level staff, The Institut received assistance from
UNDP/ITU in preparing its curriculum. It also uses a significant number of
foreign teachers for specialized courses under a long-tern agreement with
the French PTT. Present capacity is 800 students, under staff-trainee
contract with ONPT. About 200 engineers, senior technicians and
operational/administrative supervisors and about 360 lower level staff
graduate each year from the Institut.
4.10      ONPT will have to train an estimated 7,400 additional
telecommunications staff through 1994. Under the proposed project, ONPT
vill increase current student capacity by about 60%, adapt existing
programs and create new ones, notably in accounting and finance (para
4.13), and improve laboratory and vorkshop facilities. ONPT vill also
increase the trainihng capacity of the regional centers, which vould handle
most lover level training in the provinces. An amount of $3.9 million has
been allocated within the loan for the purchase cf telecommunications
equipment for the Institutels laboratories and training equipment for the
regional centers.
Technical Assistance
4.11      An aiount of $1.4 million has been allocated vithin the loan for
consultancy services plus some fellowships. With the exception of the
consultancy services required for preparation of the data procensing master
plan (para 4.12) and for the tariff study (para 6.07), they are not
earmarked for specific purposes. Rather, these consultancy services can be
called upon by ONPT to meet additional techn$cal assistance requirements,
not presently foreseen, as the need arises.  Terms of reference for such
experts as ONPT may need to recruit would be agreed to during project
supervision.
Data Processing
4.12      ONPT's data processing facilities are oentralized ln Rabat.
Staff of 165 £s generally qualified. Current major data processing
applications are: (a) billing and collection; (b) CCP and CEN transactions
(para 4.07); and (c) preparation of the telephone directory. Other uses
expected to be introduced in 1987 are payroll, selected general accounting



- 20 -
applications and network management. These applications fall short of what
is required. Systematic planning la needed to determine the dimensioning
and structuring of ONPT's future data processing systeme in order to
provide adequate management iLformation for varlous levels of decision
making while coping with the expected rapid growth in transaction
processing volumes during the period 1987-1994. The number of telephone
subscribers is expu-cted to increase from 253,000 to 820,000; CCP accounts
from 275,000 to 800,000; and CEN accounts from 542,000 to 1,500,000.
As part of the proposed project, eighteen manmonths of consulting services
vill be provided to assist ONPT in preparlng, by June 30, 1988, a data
processing master plan covering applications, design, equipment,
management, staffing and training requirements. Implementation vill be
monitored through the Action Plan. Furthermore, an amount of $4.0 million
has been allocated to finance data processing equipment. Local arrangements
for most other training needs are satisfactory.
Billing
4.13      ONPT introduced a computerized bimonthly billing cycle in 1980.
For most customers, except central governuent, service is cut off if
payment is not received vithin six weeks after billing. The priv4te sector
accouats presently for about 75% of billing and the public sector for 25%.
To reduce the frequency (8%) of customer billing inquiries, ONPT vill
anstall automatic message accounting equipment and introduce a monthly
billing cycle. Experience elsewhere has shown that both these measures
tend to reduce billing inquiries and improve the accounts receivable
situation (para 5.07).
Accounting
4.14      ONPT's accounting system is on an accrual basis.  The entity does
not yet have a cost accounting system producing separate financial
statements for its principal branches of activity. Rovever, consultants
(para 4.03) have presented a proposal to introduce a detailed co0t
accounting system, combined with adequate staff training and software
support. The proposed system la satisfactory. During negotiations,
assurances vere obtained that ONPT vill introduce a cost accounting system
producing separate financial statements for its main branches of activity
by January 1, 1988. Pro forma separated financial statements for 1986 and
1987 vili be submitted to the Bank vithin nine and six months respectively
after the end of each fiscal year [para 7.01(d)].
4.15      The accounting division is still not fully staffed, but
recruitment of qualified staff is in progress, in particular for the
analytical accounting unit; this unit vill be responsible for separation
of accounts between ONPT's principal branches of activity. In addition,
the qualifications of existing accountlng staff need upgrading. During
project preparation, consultants (para 4.03) determined the staffing and
training requirements of the varlous accounting services and assisted ONPT



- 21 -
în the design of an appropriate accounting staff training program
Implexentation of an in-house training program sturted ln mid-1986;
training responsibilities vill be transferred to INPT by 1988. These
arrangements are satisfactory.
External Auditing
4.16      ONPT la obliged to prepare Lts financial statements by March 31
of each year. Like all other "public establishments," the entity vill be
subject to annual review of its accounts by the Inspection Generale des
Finances of the Ministry of Finance. However, Ln view of ONPT'a commercial
character and the need to introduce a relatively sophisticated accountîng
system and ensure its proper functioning (para 4.13), full-scale annual
external audits viii be performed by qualified external auditors. During
negotiations, assurances vere obtained that ONPT vill: (t) have annual
audits of its accounts performed by qualified external auditors acceptable
to the Bank; and (ii) furnish audited financtal statements to the Bank
vithin six months after the end of each fiscal year [para 7.01(e)].
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance
5.01      Prior to the creation of ONPT, financial stqteuents did not
exist.  The financiai performance of the Ministry of P&T vas measured by
the degree of implementation of its budget. During preparation of the
proposed teleconmunications project, income and funde flow statements vere
reconstructed for 1980-1983 and an openlng balance sheet (para 5.06) vas
prepared reflecting the situation as of December 31, 1983 (Annex 11).
5.02      During 1980-1983, the Ministry's financial performance vas
adequate. Cash flow vas utilized as followa: (a) construction (50%); (b)
debt service (5%); and (c) transfers to Government (45%). Net internal
cash generation thus financed 100% of applications; this vas feasible
because investments vere limited. External borrowings vere contracted by
the Ministry of Finance and on-lent to the Ministry of P&T on concessionary
terrs, similar to those obtained by other Government entities in Morocco.
5.03      Pro-forma separation of the financial statements shows that the
postal/financial branch maintained, on average, a break-even position
during 1980-83.  Net internal cash flow financed about 21% of its mode«t
construction requirements, vith the remainder being financed by transfers
from the telecommunications branch. The remainder of this section deals
exclusively with the telecommunications branch of ONPT.
5.04    -Key financial indicators for the telecommunications branch during
the period 1984-1986 are ahoya in Table 5.1. Figures for 1983 (the year
prior to the creation of ONPT) are included for comparison:

**/ As a percentage of construction requirements.
Since the Ministry of P&T did not maintain balance sheets, it recorded no
depreciation charges through 1983. Estimated depreciation charges of
DH 200 million in 1983 would result in an adjusted operating ratio of 58
and a rate of return of about 15% on average net fixed assets in
operation. Depreciation charges in 1984 and 1985 vere very high, due to an
accelerated write-off of assets by the newly established entity. This
artificially increased the operating ratio and reduced the rates of return
in those years. Overall, however, the financial performance during
1984-1986 vas satisfactory, with net internal cash generation averaging
148%, thus exceeding construction requirements by a considerable margin.
Opening and Present Position
5.05      The opening balance sheet (para 5.06) as of January 1, 1984, and

The above figures show that the strength of the opening balance sheet has
been maintained and, in certain aspects, enhanced. The current debt/equity



- 24 -
ratio of 13.6 reflects the heavy reliance on self-financing in the past
and the fact that lnvestments in 1985 and 1986 d'd not proceed as rapidly
as anticipated. The current ratio of 2.0 is satisfactory, in particular
ONPT's cash position; this places the entity in a very strong position to
finance a large part of the local cost component of the investment program
(para 5.11). Other eurrent assets consist almost entirely of accounts
receivable; 75% of the latter are owed by Government. Current liabilities
consist mostly of amounts payable by ONPT to Government, representing
accrued taxes. ONPT intends teo repay its liabilities to Goverument at the
same rate at which Government vill repay its arrears to ONPT (para 5.07).
5.06      ONPT's opening balance sheet vas recently approved by
Government. By decree of August 14, 1986, the corresponding assets vere
transferred (para 4.01).  Some minor fixed assets, not presently carried on
the books, may in future be transferred to ONPT, depending on the outcome
of a review process currently underway. The outcome, however, vill not
affect ONPT's revenue producing capacity. The assets included in the
balance sheet are appropriately valued.
Accounts Receivable
5.07      Telecommunications accouuts receivable as of end 1986 vere an
estimated DU 1.6 billion, or 15 months of billing. The private sector
accounted for DH 403 million (5 months of billing). Government's share vas
DH 1,187 million, or 5 years of billing to Government. In the past,
Government has systematically budgeted insufficient funds for
telecomumnications usage; the 1986 budget contained a provision of DH 80
million for this purpose, compared to actual billing of DH 240 million.
However, vith the assistance of ONPT, Governaent implemented in 1986 a
program to reduce excessive and unauthorized long distance calling. These
measures are expected to reduce the rate of growth of future usage and
stabilize expenditures in the next few years. At the same time, the 1987
budget allocation has been increased to DR 240 million, which is expected
to be adequate to cover Government's telecommunications usage in that
year. During negotiations, assurances vere obtained from Government that:
(a) arrears outstanding as of December 31, 1986 will be settled in equal
annual installments over the period 1987-1992; (b) it will provide adequate
annual budget allocations for telecommunications usage; and (c) future'
telecommunications bills will be paid vithin three months of billing [para
7.01(f)].
Future Finances
5.08      Since 1980, telecomminications tariffs vere increased by about 12
percent each in 1982 and in 1985, respectively.  Tariffs were further
increased by 20 percent effective January 1, 1987, by increasing the base
call charge from DH 0.50 to DU 0.60. ONPT has, furthermore, agreed to
increase tariffs during the project implementation period as required to
achieve an adequate self-financing ratio (para 5.12). Since the entity is



- 25 -
exempted from the list of goode and services whose pricing is subject to
strict Goverument control (Regiementation des Prix, 1978), regular
adjustwents in relatively small increments should not present a problem.
Performance monitoring through the Action Plan (para 3.14) vill ensure that
these tariff increases are justified sad not a result of inefficiency or
vaste.
5.09      Forecast financial statements for FY 1986-1994 are in Annex 11.
Financial figures for previous years are included for comparison. Notes
and assumptions are in Annex 12. A saumary of the Sources and Applications
of funds for the project implementation period 1987-1994 is shown in Table
5.3. It assumes that there vill be increases in the base call charge from
DU 0.60 at present to DO 0.80 in 1991, in line vith stated policy (para
5.08). Revenue increases or decreases brought about by tariff
restructuriug (para 6.07) would resuit in sualler or larger iucreases ln
the base call charge.

5.10      During the project period, ONPT would finance 51% of total
applications, or 49% of construction requirements, from net internal cash
generation. This 18 a solid performance, necessitated by the size of its
investment program and the need to keep local borrovings to a minimum (para
5.11). It is all the more remarkable given the very large net transfers
expected to be made to Government (para 6.09). External borrovinge would
consist of a mixture of concessionary loans and suppliers' credits for
items financed under price and terme bidding procedures or under tied
procurement (para 3.08). It is assumed that the average terme of financing
offered through 1989 vill be in compliance with current IMF restrictions on
the length of maturities (12 year minimum). Interest rates for other
external commercial borrowin«- and for local borrovings have been



- 27 -
conservatively estimated at an average of 12.5; no grace periode have
been assumed.
5.11      ON'T will be able to finance most local costs relating to its
investment prQgram, but some local borrowings will be necessary in
individual years for an estimated aggregate amount of Da 700 million over
1988-91. ONPT has obtained permission in principle from Government to
borrow up to DH 300 million per annum locally. However, such large amounts
are not expected to be necessary, given ONPT's expected financial
performance.
5.12      The financial performance of ONPT is expected to be satisfactory
during the project implementation period. Key financial indicators are
summarized in Table 5.4:

The operating ratio would remain fairly stable at below 60%. Although
after tax rate of return is expected to decline from the very high levels
of the initial years, it would still be 13% by 1994, which îs
satisfactory. Debt serviee coverage would remain above 2.0 times. The
operating cost per DEL would decline in real terms, primarly as a result of
reduced staff expenses in relation to network size. Although net internal
cash generation is expected to finance on average 49% of construction
requirements (para 5.10), in individual years this ratio may vary as
contract payments fa1i due. During negotiations, assurances were obtained
that ONPT will achieve a net internal cash generation ratio of at least 45%
in any one year, based on a moving three year average. Also during
negotiations, assurances were obtained that ONPT will present to the Bank,
before September 30 of each year, the corresponding financial statements
for the telecommunications branch [para 7.01 (g)].



- 28 -
5.13      The postal/financial branch of ONPT is expected to break even
during the project implementation period as varlous measures to improve
operating margins are implemented (para 4.07) and tariffs are occasionally
adjusted to offset rising costs.  However, additional funds vill be needed
to finance its investment program. It is expected that these funds vill be
obtained prlmarily through local borrowings or Government subsidies.
During negotiations, assurances vere obtained that ONPT vill not transfer
funds from the telecommunications branch to the postal/financial branch
unless the financial requirements of the former for the current and next
fiscal year have been met first [para 7.01(h)].
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
6.01      The economic analysis pertains to ONPT's 1987-94 investment
program, of which the proposed project is an integral part. Given the
existence of major functional interdependencies and joint costs among the
program's main components (local, long distance, international and rural
telephony), it is not possible to evaluate separately the Bank-financed
component.
Benefits
6.02      Telecommunications services benefit all sectors of Moroccots
economy. Economic activity in the country requires increasing investment
in telecommunications and transport facilities. Compared with alternative
means of communication, telecommunications are more efficient in terms of
capital and energy consumption and user time. Telecommunications are, in
fact, a highly cost effective and preferred substitute for physical
transportation. With adequate telecommunications facilities, the level and
variety of productive communication can be increased considerably, and
activities which would othervise azot be feasible can be realized.
6.03      In terms of the specific constraints on Morocco's economic and
social development, telecommunications can play a significant role in
connection with:
(a) reducing the cost of locating production outaide the main
industrial centers, notably Casablanca and its environs,
thereby helping decentralize econonic activity and
encouraging balance! regional development;
(b) faciiitating development of the economic infrastructure
in new areas being opened up;
(c)  promoting more efficient labor related migration between
and among rural and urban areas;



- 29 -
(d) improving the working of the market mechanism by
expediting and extending accesa to information as needed
to increase productivity,foster competition and develop
trade;
(e) increasing the efficiency of transportation through
coordination of vehicle use and substitution of travel,
resulting in energy savinge and/or greater efficiency of
productive interactions for a given level of energy
consumption;
(f) facilitating the extension of health, education,
government administration and other services to rural
areas, ineluding extension of the reach of scarce
expertise for advice, support and supervision; and
(g) mobilizing domestic savings by transferring part of
ONPT's net income to Government.
Program Size and Composition
6.04      After many years of relative neglect, Government has recognized
the importance of telecommunications and has assigned high priority to
accelerated development. Investments currently programmed for this sector
during the next eight years will be 10 times as large as in the preceeding
five years, and will constitute about 1.0% of GNP on average in each year
during the period through 1994. Given the high economic returns (para
6.10) and the benefits accruinJ to the economy (para 6.03), these increased
investments are considered justified.
6.05      While ONPT's 1987-94 program is large given past sector
investments, it fails short of what is needed to meet new demand forecast
to arise during the period. Despite ONPT's plans for system expansion at
relatively high rates (16% per annum), unmet demand is forecast to reach
about 200,000 lines at the end of the program period; this will actually be
somewhat higher than at its start (169,000). However, in relative terms,
the number of lines in service will have risen from about 60% of total
expressed demand in 1986 to about 80% in 1994.
6.06      By the end of 1994, telephone service will be extended to most of
the seats of municipal government, and to more than 90% of rural
communities. With this, the proportion of people living in localities with
some telephone service will roughly triple. For the country as a whole,
the proportion of people with telephones will increase from about 1% in
1986 to about 3% in 1994. Telex, international telephone service, and
specialized speech and data communications facilities, would be further
developed to keep pace with growing traffic. Switched data transmission
and mobile communications networks would be started in the more developed



- 30 -
areas of the country. The proposed introduction of digital technology will
provide an adequate basis for flexible subsequent network and service
development in response to changing demand. The business comnt"""ity and
Government will remain important users of telecommunications tacilities,
although their share is expected to drop below 50% of the total by 1994
(para 2.05).
Tariff Policy
6.07      Telecommunications tariffs as of etzd 1986 are summarized in Annex
13.  Tariff policy aims primarily at generating an adequate cash flow to
finance a substantial part of investments (para 5.12) and to transfer part
of it to Government (para 6.09). However, examination of the tariff
structure indicates that it needs to be reviewed. The connection fee
(DR 300) ls too low to ration some of the large excess demand. The service
charge (DH 22.50/month), while not including telephone maintenance, still
is low. Call units are charged at DH 0.50 and local calls are not
metered. There is no peak/off peak pricing. Numerous miscellaneous
charges are too small to have any meaningful effect on user behavior (e.g.,
a DH 25 reconnection penalty) and generate more administrative costs than
revenues. Such a tariff policy sends the wrong signals to subscribers,
which may result in sub-optimal utilization of an already inadequate
network. Therefore, ONPT will carry out, as part of the project, a study
of its telephone tariffs focusing on cost of service, the characteristics
of business and residential demand, and forecast supply. Efficient
resource allocation, equity, regional development, and other objectives of
government policy would also be taken into account. The proposed project
will finance technical assistance to help ONPT carry out this study under
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that ONPT will complete a tariff study by June 30, 1988,
review it with the Bank, and implement the ensuing recommendations by
January 1, 1989 [para 7.01 (i)l.
Least Cost Solution
6.08      As is the case in any country with an existing telecommunications
network, the configuration of ONPT's network limits the number of viable
alternative soluticis that can be considered to achieve the targets
proposed for extending and improving service. The timing and dimensioning
of the various items are designed to introduce, where possible, electronic
digital switching and transmission techniques at least cost. This will
also permit the most efficient continued usage of existing network
facilities.  Given existing technology, the program as a whole represents a
least cost solution to provide the quantities and types of equipment which
comply with ONPT's plan targets.



- 31 -
Fiscal Imî,act
6.09      The fiscal impact of the project will be considerable.  Firstly,
since 1984 ONPT collects for Government a 12% surcharge on billings.
During the project period, Government la expected to derive DR 3.4 billion
in revenues from this source. Secondly, ONPT would pay about DU 2.2
billion in miscellaneous taxes, plus customs duties on imported operating
equipment items. Thirdly, ONPT will pay a 48% tax on net income, expected
to generate DH 4.4 billion. Finally, duties on imported investment
equipment items (equivalent to about 44% of the foreign exchange coast) are
expected to provide an additional DH 2.8 billion. Thus, total funds to be
transferred from the telecommunications sector to Government are estimated
to be in the order of DH 12.8 billion ($1.4 billion) during the project
period.
Return on Investment
6.10      The internal financial rate of return on the 1987-1994 investment
program, defined as the discount rate which equalizes the stream of
expected after tax revenues attributable to the program with the stream of
capital and operating costs (at constant 1987 price levels) is 11%
(Annex 14). Excluding duties and taxes and assuming that new subscribers
added over the period would be willing to pay the same tariffs in real
terms as existing subscribers, the estimated economic rate of return of the
program would be t least 26%. This estimate understates total program
benefits, since it does not fully include the consumer surplus which
callers or subscribers receive, and does not account for all external
benefits associated with transport substitution, business opportunity,
administrative efficiency, etc.
Risks
6.11      There are no unusual risks associated with the program.  One
source of risk in that institutional improvements relating to management
and organization may come about more slowly than anticipated. This would
impair ONPT's capacity to proceed with its investment program as scheduled
and could, under a worst-case scenario, result in assets remaining idle for
a prolonged period of time. Such inefficiency would result in higher than
expected tariff increases. However, with the management improvement
program (para 4.02) and continuous performance monitoring under the Action
Plan (para 3.14), this risk is adequately contained. Another risk may
arise out of delayed physical implementation due to delays in the execution
of civil works, receipt of material or equipment, and installation of
equipment and plant. However, telecomminications projecta frequently
comprise a number of lndependent works. A delay in the implementation of
some works does not necessarily prevent partial use of other assets, unless
it createe a severe imbalance in the network, which is the worst case
scenario. When such delays do occur, costs and revenues tend to be
deferred by roughly the same degree, so that the overall impact on the
return on investment is usually not significant.



- 32 -
A sensitivity test on the rate of return (Annex 16) indicates that a 20%
increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses combiued vith a 20%
decrease in operating revenues, which is extremrly unlikely, would reduce
the estimated economic rate of return from 26% to 16%.  A two-year delay in
all benefits vithout postponement of investment costs would reduce tbe
economic rate of return to 17%; this scenarlo vould apply if there la a
serious delay in the subscriber connection program, which is not
anticipated.
Environmental and Realth Aspects
6.12      The project is expected to have no adverse environmental or
health impacts. On the contrary, more efficient use of the transportation
system, due to increased use of telecommunications services, vould reduce
environmental pollution, promote energy conservation and reduce traffic
congestion. In addition, good telecommunîcations services improve the
delivery system for health services for both routine and emergency care.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negot4ations, the following assurances were
obtained:
(a) Goverument vill ensure that acceptable feasibility
studies will be undertaken before making additional
public sector investments in the telecommunications
manufacturing industry, and furnish copies of those
studies and the recommendations based thereon to the Bank
(para 2.07);
(b) ONPT vill: (i) consult with the Bank before introducing
major changes in its investment program, involving more
than 10% of the aggregate amount of investments during
any one year; and (ii) ensure that no such changes will
be introduced unless ONPT and the Bank have agreed that
these changes are justified (para 3.02);
(c) ONPT vill carry out the Action Plan for 1987-1994;
present proposed targets for joint review with the Bank
by October 31 of each year; and report progresas against
the Action Plan by April 30 of each year (para 3.14);
(d) ONPT will introduce a cost accounting system producing
separate financial stateinents for its main branches of
activity by January 1, 1988. Pro forma separated



- 33 -
financial statements for 1986 and 1987 vill be submitted
to the Bank vithin nine and six monthe respectively after
the end of each fie-al year (para 4.14);
(e) ONPT will have annual audits of it8 accounts performed by
qualified external auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
will furn4sh audited financial statements to the Bank
vithin six months after the end of each fiscal year (para
4.16);
(f)  (i) Government arrears outstanding as of December 31,
1986 will be settled in equal annual installments over
the petiod 1987-1992; (Ii) it vill provide adequate
annual budget allocations for telecommunications usage;
and (iii) future telecommunications bills wili be paid
within three months of billing (para 5.07);
(g) (i) ONPT vill achieve a net internal cash generation
ratio of at least 45% in any one year based on a moving
three year average; and (ii) ONPT will present to the
Bank, before September 30, of each year, the
corresponding financial statements for the
telecommunications branch (para 5.12);
(h) ONPT will not transfer funds from the telecommunications
branch to the postal/financial branch unless the
financing requirements of the former for the current and
next fiscal year have been met first (para 5.13); and
(i)  ONPT vill complete a tariff study by June 30, 1988,
review it with the Bank, and implement the ensuing
recommendations by January 1, 1989 (para 6.07).
7.02      The following ate conditions of effectiveness:
(a) ONPT shall have issued invitations to bid on a list of
goods and works agreed wlth the Bank (para 3.09), and
(b) ONPT shall have furnished to the Bank a program
(including action plan and time schedule for
implementation), satisfactory to the Bank, to improve its
overall organization, management and operations (para
4.05).
7.03      Subject to agreement on the above, the propo4.d project is
suitable for a Bank loan of $125 million at the standard variable interest
rate and with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.

OFFICE NATIONAL DES POSTES ET TELECOMMUNICATIONS (ONPT)
FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Proiect Description
General
1.        The project is a self-contained part of ONPT's investment
program. It consiste of most of the new works under the firet phase of
ONPTM' program, to be implemented during 1986-92. This phase includes
ongoing vorks for about 100,000 additional lines of exchange capacity and
nev vorks under the project for about 290,000 lines of awitching capacity
which would thus practically double under the project. Quality and
efficiency of service would be highly improved using modern digital
technology for swltching and transmission systeus throughout the country.
The project, as a whole, aims at rapid expansion, improvement and
modernization of the telecommunications infrastructure in Morocco.
Simultaneously, major emphasis is placed on continuing sector reform and
inatitutional development as the principal means of strengthening
Implementation capacity and improving operation. Details of the various
project components are suimmarized below.
Telephone Exchange Equipment
2.        This includes construction and installation of about 290,000 new
lUnes of local switching and subscriber equipment in 165 exchanges
including replacement of about 34,000 lines of worn-out equipment in 15
existing exchanges. Contracts for procurement of equipment to expand or
replace existing capacity vas arranged in 1985 for about 46,000 lines to be
delivered in 1986 and 1987 in about 25 exchanges. Procurement arrangements
for about 80,000 additional lines of existing type equipment in about 40
exchanges are being made for delivery in 1987-88. Tenders for
international price and terms bidding on 200,000 lines of new types of
digital electronic equipment in about 100 different exchanges vere issued
in 1985. Contract awards expected to take place early 1987 should result
in deliveries and commissioning of the installations from 1989 to 1991.
3.        Automatic trunk switching equipment for the domestic long
distance system between clties will be procured to expand capacity by about
10,300 circuits in four existing transit exchanges (Agadir, Casablanca,
Marrakech and Rabat) and to add about 10,000 circuits in four new national
transit exchanges national to be created in Rabat (second transit center),
Meknes, Oujda and Tetouan. The nationvide subscriber trunk dialling (STD)
system vould thus be sufficient to cope with interurban traffic from about
500,000 expected to be in service by end 1990. Simultaneously, urban

Page 2 of 5
transit swvtching capacity would be expanded by about 11,000 inter-exchange
junctions in the two large urban transit exchanges of the greater
Casablanca and Rabat multi-exchange areas.
Local and Urban Networks
4.        This item includes expansion and rehabilitation of local cable
and overhead line subscriber networks and outside plant in about 200
cities, representing about 360,000 distributed pairs of local network
available for immediate and future connection of subscribers. Switching
equipment is, or will be, available in these localities. The works
comprise construction of ducts and cable systems for the primary and
secondary levels of the local distribution networks and for inter-exchange
junctions. In some cases, overhead subscriber lines will prolong the
underground cable systems. ONPT's planning unit designed the duct system
capacity for about 20 years of expansion, and the cable distribution
systems for about 2.5 times known demand, which is standard practice.
5.        These local lines and junction networks, including the associated
subscriber outside plant, involve the installation of about 1.3 million
kilometer/pairs in cables or overhead Ulnes and the construction of about
8,000 kms of individual cable ducts, including about 1,600 kms of
underground multiduct sections, principally in medium and large cities.
Rehabilitation or replacement of worn-out local lines represents about 8%
of these works.  Bank-financed items include:  (a) local cables and
accessories; (b) PVC ducts; (c) copper vires, poles and overhead lines
accessories; (d) construction materials and civil works for cable ducts,
manholes and access vaults in large cities; and (e) miscellaneous tools,
special transportation and network construction and testing equipment for
ONPT's local networks teams.
The Bank vould finance the foreign cost of these items, estimated at about
DH 580 million ($64.4 million) or about 80% of their estimatet total cost
of DH 729 million ($81.0 million).
Long Distance Transmission Network
6.        This item inclutes the following subprojects:
(a)  construction of four major microwave links (about 950 kms
in total) equipped with PCM/140 Megabits systems with
1,920 channel capacity, and four smaller links (about 600
kms in total) with PCM/34 megabits systems of 480 channel
capacity;
(b) installation of additional multiplexing equîpment with
capacity of 30 to 240 extra PCM channels, on 24 existing
microwave links interconnecting provincial subdivisions
with the main backbone interurban system;

-39-                    ~~~~~ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 5
(c) construction of 18 short distance cable Unks vith
capacity from 14 to 48 pairs (over about 800 kms in
total) to replace old and inadequate intra-regional
overhead lines in about 42 dIstricts;
(d) modernization of the national long distance telex
transmission network by using PCM systems on 18 basic
telex and data transmission link8, and for connection of
distant subscribers; and
The proposed Bank loan vould finance the foreign exchange cost of four
major microwave links and of about ten pair cable links for sub-items (a)
and (c).
Automatization of Regional and Rural Networks
7.        This item includes the construction of about 1,200 kms of medium
capacity intraregional cables, overhead Unes, multiplex transmission and
small capacity digital microwave systems to interconnect 63 communities.
Service will also be first introduced in 26 isolated locations. Together
vith the installation of about 30 line-concentrators, the scheme will
service about 30,000 subscribers in 89 distant rural districts or isolated
areas. The new cable links would principally consist of overhead
self-supporting or underground pair or coaxial cables of saall capacity.
In addition to the Ulne concentrators and installation of public
telephones isolated localities, this will enable access to the national
automatic network in about 80 small rural exchanges. ONPT's staff will
install all equipment. Summary of the equipment to be procured is as
follows:

Telex Service
8.        This item includes construction and installation of about 7,400
new lines of telex exchange equipment and subscriber installations in 13
existing and 7 new exchanges. Simultaneously, the national and
international transit exchanges at Rabat and Casablanca vill be expanded by
2,000 and 3,200 circuits respectively. About 5,000 teleprinters vill be
procured. All equipment vill be of the modern electronic type. Bank
financing estimated at DH 191 million ($21.2) vill cover essentially the
foreign cost of teleprinters and subscriber installations. About 10% of
this equipment is for modernization or replacement of old or obsolete
equipment.

FIRST TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts, 1987-1994
Detailed traffic and operating statistics which are at the basis
of these forecaste are shown on page 3 of this Annex.
I. INCOME STATEMENTS
(A) Operating Revenues
Telephone and Telex - Traffic and rental revenues, the
base call charge is multiplied by the number of pulses
per DEL times the average number of DELs in service.  For
installation fees, it is multiplied by the appropriate
fee times the number of additional lines installed. All
details are given in the table at the end of this Annex.
Telegraph - Zero growth.
Othe_ Revenues - Forecast to increase at 15% per annum,
corresponding to the average increase in DELs in service.
Value added Tax - 12% of operating revenues, billed
separately to users. Corresponding amount is deducted
under operating expenses.
(B) Operating Expenses
Personnel - Average number of employees times average
salary per employee (details in table). Annual salaries
are forecast to lncrease at 20% in 1987 to reflect salary
adjustments as a result of the recent adoption of ONPT's
Personnel Statute, and at 8% per annum thereafter.
Materials, Maintenance, Transport - Calculated on the
basis of average cost per DEL (see table). The cost is
assumed to sharply increase starting in 1987 as a result
of improved maintenance.  Thereafter, coste are expected
to decrease from DR 500 in 1987 to DH 466 In 1994,
reflecting increased operating efficiency.
Depreciation - Initially accelerated depreciation (10% of
average gross fixed assets) to reflect write-off of older
assets, decreasing to 7.5% starting in 1988 and
thereafter.

any attempt at separation arbitrary.  Therefore, the rates of return are
calculated on the basis of ONPT's entire investement program, vith the
exception of those investments that vill not get started until 1992 and the
benefite of which vill not accrue until the mid-1990s. On this basis, part
of the program component contained under the heading 'Phase II' has been
excluded from the rate of return calculation, and all works under the
heading "preinvestments."
2,        The net benefit period runs from 1987 to 2007 when, on average,
facilities provided under the project vill have reached the end of their
useful life. Maintenance and replacements during their life are included
in operating costs. No residual values have been taken into account as
their discounted value would be minimal. Coste exclude depreciation and
interest. Incremental operating revenues and expenses relate to expected
additional telephone and telex subscribers and to additional traffie
brought about by the progam. From 1994 on, operating coste and revenues
related to the program are assumed to remain constant.
3.        A summary of the co0t and benefit streams is given below in DU
million. All revenues and costs have been deflated to bring them to their
comparable 1987 price levels.

4.        The internal rate of return of the above financial streams is
11 (18% before deduction of income taxes). However, this calculation
understates the benefits to be derived from ONPT's Investment program.  It
does not take into account consumer surplus and Indirect and external
benefits received by non users of the telecommunications services. A
portion of the consumer surplus vas estimated by assuming (a) that new
consumera are siailar to the average existing consumer and (b) that
existing and new subscribers vill be willing to pay for telecommunications
services the same prices in real terme as they pay today. Based on these
assumptions, adjusting for duties and taxes (equivalent to about 20% of the
total co0t of the project), the minimum estimate of the economic rate of
retur, fctr the program la 26%.
5.        A sensitivity analysis vas made of the economic rate of return
vith the folloving results:
20% increase in capital expenditures        -     21%
20% increase in operating expenditures    -       25%
20% decrease in operating revenues          -     20%
Combination of above                        -     16%
2 year delay in benefits                    -     17%
