Telecommunications Project is\n            a self contained part of the Office National des Postes et\n            Telecommunications (ONPT) 1987-94 program. It is intended to\n            direct efforts toward expansion, improvement and\n            modernization of the telecommunications network. Major\n            emphasis is placed on institutional development as the\n            principle means of strengthening implementation capacity.\n            Once completed, it will add about 290,000 new lines of\n            exchange capacity and local cable distribution networks for\n            300,000 subscriber connections, including rehabilitation of\n            obsolete local line systems. In addition, long distance\n            systems will be modernized and expanded, thus reducing\n            congestion and improving the overall efficiency of networks."}, "docdt": "1987-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
