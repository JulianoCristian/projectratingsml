Inappropriate farming practices contribute to the\n            degradation of environment, particularly in soils by the\n            accentuation of the phenomena of erosion, loss of fertility,\n            and drainage areas. Potential negative impacts of pesticide\n            use include: Declining fertility, acidification and\n            pollution of the soil; pollution (nitrates, ammonium NH4);\n            changing pH and deforestation; making pests resistant to\n            chemical control; poisoning of humans and even death. In\n            addition, there may be conflicts between herders and farmers\n            with the development of agricultural areas and an increase\n            in waterborne diseases."}, "docdt": "2009-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
