     SUMMARY

1.     This memorandum seeks your approval for a first extension of the original closing
     date of the above mentioned grant by 6 months, to June 15, 2011 to support the
     achievement of the Project Development Objectives. The grant of US $ 9.0 million
     for the project was approved by the Board on October 8, 2008, and became effective
     on October 31, 2008, with an original closing date of December 15, 2010. The
     Recipient, in its letter dated December 10, 2010 (attached) requested a 6-month
     extension.


     PROJECT STATUS

2.     The development objective of the project is to increase domestic production of
     cereals (maize and rice), in order to mitigate the short-term impact of increasing
     prices on households and to expand food crops farmers' access to agricultural inputs
     in the medium- and long term.

3.     The overall implementation progress of the project is currently satisfactory. As of
     December 7, 2010, the project has disbursed US $ 8,318,402 million, about 92.43 %
     of the original amount of grant approved by the Board. The project was to provide
     8,500 tons of fertilizer to about 50,000 rice and maize producers. This is expected to
     generate an additional supply of about 60,000 tons of cereals (6,000 tons of rice and
     54,000 tons of maize). This increase in production will make a significant
     contribution towards (i) reducing the pressure on the country's food import bill; (ii)
     slowing down the rise in domestic prices; (iii) reducing and eventually eliminating the
     negative impact of high food prices on poor households; and (iv) raising income of
     participating farming communities.

4.     As of November 30, 2010, project progress towards achieving development
     objectives can be summarized as followed: (i) Farmers' access to agricultural inputs
     and increase in rice and maize production: During the 2009-2010 campaign, about
     6,944.25 tons of fertilizer were procured and distributed to 26,602 maize and rice
     producers covering a total acreage of 50,458 hectares in the project target zone. This
     led to an additional production of 38, 016 tons of cereals production (28,088 tons of
     maize and 9,928 tons of rice). During the ongoing 2010-2011 campaign, 2,856 tons
     of fertilizer were procured and distributed to 10,941 maize and rice producers
     covering a total acreage of 20,752 hectares in the project target zone. This led to an
     additional production of 15, 636 tons (11,152 tons of maize and 4,484 tons of rice).
     Overall, 9,800 tons of fertilizer were procured and distributed to 37,543 maize and
     rice producers with a total acreage of 71,210 hectares and a production of 53,652 tons

                                             4
     (about 40,425 tons of maize and 13,227 tons of rice). The current recovery rate of
     fertilizer credit is about 68,5 % the total amount recovered is about US $ 2.5 million
     secured in a special account. (ii) Design of innovative agricultural inputs delivery
     institutional mechanisms: The study on new agricultural inputs delivery mechanisms
     was commissioned and the report is available. The next step for the project team is to
     operationnalize the recommendations of the report within the framework of the
     Emergency Support to Enhance Food Security Project currently under
     implementation.

5.     The project has performed satisfactorily as regards compliance with the Bank's
     financial management requirements through the regular and timely submission of
     financial reports and annual audits.


     PROPOSED CHANGES

              · Closing date
6.     The extension of closing date is required to allow the country to complete all
     project activities. This will in particular provide additional time and resources to (i)
     carry out a detailed survey that will be used to monitor progress towards the
     achievement of PDO as well to establish baseline indicators for the Emergency
     Support to Enhance Food Security Project currently under implementation by the
     same project team; (ii) carry out a technical audit to assess the effectiveness of the
     activities planned and carried out under the project in response to food crisis. The
     results of the audit will assess the overall effectiveness of project implementation and
     will provide evidence for improved and best practices; (iii) undertake the audit of
     distribution of agricultural inputs whose objective is to produce a report in which an
     opinion shall be issued on the mechanisms put in place to manage fertilizers and
     pesticides during the past two years. The audit report also identifies the strengths and
     weaknesses identified in the operative management of pesticides and fertilizers, and
     will propose measures to make it truly operational and efficient; (iv) improve the
     inputs storage conditions to ease up the process of management and provision of
     fertilizer.; (v) provide small equipment (GPS) to field agents in order to improve the
     reliability of the estimation of agricultural acreages and yields; (vi) ensure trough
     training the understanding by the implementing entities and various stakeholders of
     the project ESMF;

7.     The Recipient reaffirmed its commitment to the project's objectives and its
     willingness to continue the implementation of activities under the project. From our
     assessments, this will allow the project to achieve its development objectives. In order
     to achieve these objectives, the Recipient requested the Bank to extend the project for
     six months.

8.     Please note that the detailed work plan for the six months period of extension is
     attached to this memorandum (as required by OP/BP 13.30: Extension of the Closing
     Date) as well as the procurement plan for 2010-2011.

9.     A review of these documents suggests that the activities could be completed by the
     requested extension date, thereby ensuring achievement of PDO by June 15, 2011.

                                    Restructuring Paper
1.    The closing date for Benin, Emergency Food Security Support Project, TF 093250
     P113374 will be extended from December 16, 2010 until June 15, 2011.

2. As of November 30, 2010, project progress towards achieving development
   objectives can be summarized as followed: Overall, 9,800 tons of fertilizer were
   procured and distributed to 37,543 maize and rice producers with a total acreage of
   71,210 hectares and a production of 53,652 tons (about 40,425 tons of maize and
   13,227 tons of rice). The current recovery rate of fertilizer credit is about 68,5 % and
   the total amount recovered is about US $ 2.5 million. The report of the study on new
   agricultural inputs delivery mechanisms is available. The next step is to translate the
   recommendations of the report into a concrete action plan. The Recipient reaffirmed
   its commitment to the project's objectives and its willingness to continue the
   implementation of activities under the project. From our assessments, this will allow
   the project to achieve its development objectives. In order to achieve these objectives,
   the Recipient requested the Bank to extend the project for six months.


3.     Please note that the detailed work plan for the six months period of extension is
     attached to this memorandum (as required by OP/BP 13.30: Extension of the Closing
     Date), as well as the procurement plan for 2010-2011. A review of these documents
     indicates that remaining project activities could be completed by the requested
     extended date, thereby ensuring achievement of PDO by June 15, 2011.

4.     The proposed extension is necessary to allow the recipient to complete all project
     activities. This will in particular provide additional time and resources to (i) carry out
     a detailed survey that will be used to monitor progress towards the achievement of
     PDO; (ii) carry out a technical audit to assess the effectiveness of the activities
     planned and carried out under the project; (iii) undertake an audit of the agricultural
     inputs distribution mechanisms in order to suggest measures to make it efficient; (iv)

     improve the reliability in the estimation of agricultural acreages and yields; and (vi)
     ensure trough training the understanding by the implementing entities and various
     stakeholders of the project ESMF.

5.    This will be the first extension of the closing date of the project.
