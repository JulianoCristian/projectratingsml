        Project  for Benin's development objective is to\n            increase domestic production of cereal crops (maize and\n            rice), in order to mitigate the short-term impact of\n            increasing prices on households and to expand food crop\n            farmers' access to agricultural inputs in the medium\n            and long term. The grant will help finance the costs\n            associated with enhancing the production of rice and maize,\n            cereals for which the national food balance is negative. The\n            project will subsidize emergency operations for the\n            provision of fertilizer to 50,000 producers' of rice\n            and maize in 2009. This should result in additional domestic\n            production of about 60,000 tons of cereal (6,000 tons of\n            rice and 54,000 tons of maize) in 2009 (8 percent of the\n            total production in 2007). Moreover, the project will\n            support the design of the innovative market based mechanisms\n            required for the delivery of inputs to food crops producers\n            in the medium and long terms."}, "docdt": "2008-10-08T00:00:00Z"}
