Specifically, these include: 1) stockpile\n            family, community and buffer consumer food products to put\n            on the market during the lean season to alleviate the\n            pressure on prices; 2) produce in the short-term adequate\n            amounts of food in order to stifle or at least mitigate the\n            perverse impact of this crisis on the quality of life of\n            both urban and rural populations; 3) develop more in the\n            long term by having a strategic reserve of food security in\n            particular with respect to rice and corn. Negative\n            biophysical impacts include: Loss of aquatic habitats; Loss\n            of area of terrestrial vegetation and wildlife habitat;\n            Deteriorating quality of water resources (surface and\n            groundwater) due to residue of pesticides and other\n            synthetic chemical pollutants; Decimation of non-target\n            organisms (auxiliary) by pesticides and other harmful\n            explosion of cultures; Degrading of land through\n            salinization, alkalinization and acidification; Poisoning of\n            the food chain through bioaccumulation in particular in\n            areas where irrigation and pesticide use have been combined;\n            Exhaustion of potential groundwater resources by excessive\n            pumping for agriculture; Contamination of crops by\n            agricultural mismanagement of input storage in stores;\n            Pollution of soil and waters by oil spills and chemical\n            inputs to synthesis. Negative health impacts include:\n            Mortality due to acute food poisoning linked to the\n            mismanagement of pesticides packaging or processing of grain\n            by pesticides; Increased prevalence of food-borne diseases\n            related to water ; Contamination of livestock due to\n            degradation of water quality of reservoirs; Increased cases\n            of conflicts between herders and farmers with the\n            development of agricultural areas; Land insecurity."}, "docdt": "2010-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
