     the Government meet the growing demand for engineering\n            technicians in the fields of civil, mechanical and\n            electrical engineering and for accountants. The project\n            would introduce a new system (polytechnics) for training\n            these technicians at diploma level by establishing a\n            Technician Education Development Center and six polytechnics\n            in Java and Sumatera; and improve the quality of accountancy\n            training by establishing four accountancy development\n            centers. In addition, the project would provide technical\n            assistance in instructor training, materials development,\n            education planning and management, manpower analysis,\n            education-related research and project performance montoring."}, "docdt": "1978-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
