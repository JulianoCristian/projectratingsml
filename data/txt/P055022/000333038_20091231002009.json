       Project (IDP) for Armenia were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development moderate, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            also satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the IDP\n            experience with the irrigation and drainage (I&D) sector\n            in Armenia shows that deep reforms work well when there is\n            strong commitment to reform overtime. As was in the case of\n            Mexico, IDP successfully used financing of rehabilitation\n            works as a bargaining tool to promote transfers that were\n            not very economically attractive to users given the\n            dilapidated state of the systems and the chronic lack of\n            funds for operation and maintenance (O&M). Institutional\n            arrangements giving more responsibility and say to farmers,\n            engage the energy of the private sector, and reduce\n            governments role. Emphasis on decentralization, financial\n            viability and accountability of water services providers,\n            empowerment through rights and responsibilities of water\n            users and their organizations, always result in higher\n            impact of I&D rehabilitation investments, sustainable\n            transformations and dynamism. Stakeholders active\n            participation in the I&D investments and sector reform\n            processes, and building capacity (organizational and\n            managerial skills, and databases) in agricultural water\n            projects has demonstrated, once again, that it derives in\n            more satisfactory results. Where market absorption exists,\n            expansion and productivity increases through improvements of\n            agricultural water management can strongly contribute to\n            poverty alleviation in rural areas, were most poor live."}, "docdt": "2009-12-15T00:00:00Z"}
