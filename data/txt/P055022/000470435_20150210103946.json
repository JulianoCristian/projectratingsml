If it is not watered on\n            time - and 10 to 12 times until the autumn harvest - its\n            apples remain small and fall to ground without ever\n            ripening. This is a lesson Armenian farmers learned the hard\n            way when the country\u0092s irrigation system disintegrated under\n            the weight of management chaos and physical neglect\n            following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Erratic water\n            supplies and decrepit canals threatened the livelihoods not\n            only of apple growers but farmers all over the country: 80\n            percent of Armenia\u0092s agricultural output comes from\n            irrigated land. When their orchards died, some farmers in\n            the Ararat valley, the country\u0092s rich-soiled agricultural\n            food basket, were forced to switch to wheat, a less valuable\n            crop which can make do with rain. So today, when orchards\n            are making a come-back, those who revived Armenia\u0092s\n            irrigation system are justifiably proud. Each new sapling is\n            a sign of farmers\u0092 trust that renovated water canals and\n            well-managed water users\u0092 associations will keep the apple\n            business alive."}, "docdt": "2006-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
