The rehabilitation grant scheme\n            under the institutional development component of the\n            irrigation development project (IDP) financed about US$7.2\n            million for rehabilitation of tertiary canals under Water\n            Users Associations (WUAs\u0092) management. Eighty-five percent\n            of this amount was financed with the credit proceeds while\n            15 percent was financed by the WUAs as counterpart funding.\n            Rural communities worth an additional US$9 million could not\n            be funded due to a lack of resources. The additional\n            financing would partially cover this surplus demand with\n            about US$5.4 million for the grant scheme. The additional\n            financing would also support the annual audit of the WUAs\n            (about US$0.3 million) and technical design and some limited\n            training activities for WUAs (US$O. 15 million).The major\n            changes of this project are follows: supported activities\n            and the project development objective (PDO). The additional\n            financing aims at scaling up activities of the institutional\n            development component of the on-going irrigation development\n            project. It would mainly expand support to rehabilitation of\n            the tertiary irrigation system with co-financing from WUAs.\n            This will help to: (i) minimize water losses at the tertiary\n            level, where they are the highest; and (ii) improve\n            institutional capacity at the grassroots level and establish\n            a reliable funding mechanism that will prevent future\n            deterioration of the water conveyance infrastructure."}, "docdt": "2007-07-02T00:00:00Z"}
