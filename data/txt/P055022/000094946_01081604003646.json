Project aims\n            at enhancing the profitability, and sustainability of\n            irrigated agriculture, providing the basis for stabilizing\n            irrigated agriculture as a predominant source of productive\n            employment. The project components will: 1) support the\n            rehabilitation of critical irrigation structures, by\n            upgrading primary canal structures, and sections in\n            deficient state, but critical for the effective operation of\n            major irrigation water conveyance infrastructure systems.\n            Aqueducts, and often siphon structures will undergo\n            rehabilitation works, while specifically, the Armavir\n            irrigation scheme will be improved, by expanding river\n            intake schemes, the main conveyance canal, and secondary\n            canal, and will include construction of sediment control\n            facilities; 2) support the conversion from pump, to gravity\n            irrigation, to reduce the reliance on high-cost\n            energy-intensive irrigation, for those cases where clear\n            technical, and economic viability can de demonstrated; and,\n            3) create conditions for effective operations, and\n            maintenance (O&M) of the irrigation infrastructure\n            through institutional strengthening, by supporting\n            appropriate institutional reforms. In particular, the Water\n            Supply Agency will be responsible for the O&M of\n            facilities supplying water from major sources, and drainage\n            and irrigation management agencies will be constituted as\n            autonomous regional, or scheme-level O&M enterprises.\n            Additionally, independent consultative, assessment, and\n            liaison contributions to system management will be provided\n            by the Technical Consultative Commission on O&M of the\n            irrigation, and drainage system, and the Irrigation Water\n            Group, this last one to serve as the forum to assist\n            stakeholders with information, conflict resolution, or\n            performance issues."}, "docdt": "2001-08-07T00:00:00Z"}
