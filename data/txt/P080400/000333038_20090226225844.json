Immune\n            Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Sexually Transmitted Diseases\n            (STD) Control Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, Bank performance was satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: strategies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS\n            and STD need to be integrated and coordinated, without one\n            overcoming the other, and should fulfill the needs of\n            different groups, especially People Living with HIV (PLHIV)\n            and highly vulnerable groups. The Brazil treatment program\n            clearly has saved lives and money. The cost of Anti\n            Retroviral Drugs (ARV) treatment is lower than estimated\n            hospital costs for patients if they had not received\n            treatment. Treatment does carry the risk of drug resistance,\n            however, so treatment regimens must be closely managed and\n            monitored. Even though Brazil is a sophisticated country and\n            is recognized as a global leader on HIV/AIDS, progress can\n            be hampered by weak institutional capacity in some areas.\n            The limited capacity in procurement within the Ministry of\n            Health (MOH) affected more than procurement of project\n            inputs such as condoms. Critical information such as surveys\n            and research projects were also delayed. Decentralized\n            management of resources is essential in the fight against\n            the epidemic, allowing for differentiated interventions,\n            with appropriate responses to different epidemiological\n            profiles and contexts of vulnerability throughout diverse\n            regions. Strengthening governance is essential for progress\n            in epidemic control, as an integral part of increased\n            management capacity of the federal, state and municipal\n            level of the National Health Service."}, "docdt": "2008-12-18T00:00:00Z"}
