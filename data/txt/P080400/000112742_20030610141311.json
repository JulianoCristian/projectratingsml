will reduce the incidence of STDs and HIV in Brazil and\n            improve the quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS\n            (PLWHA) by strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of\n            the national response and ensuring its sustainability in the\n            medium and long-term.  The first component, improving the\n            quality and coverage of prevention, treatment, and care is\n            comprised of: 1.1 Prevention of STDs and HIV focusing on\n            high risk groups, mother to child transmission, condom\n            promotion, IV drug users (needle exchange programs),\n            voluntary counseling and testing services, and information,\n            education and communication. 1.2 Treatment and care for\n            STDs, opportunistic infections, and HIV/AIDS; home-based\n            social and psychological care; palliative care; and\n            strengthen the laboratory network.  1.3 Financing activities\n            to foster the protection of fundamental rights of PLWHA.\n            1.4 Municipal, state and NGO-managed initiatives in\n            prevention, treatment, care, and institutional development.\n            The second component will strengthen the capacity of\n            research centers, laboratories, and universities to engage\n            in scientific and technological research and development\n            (R&D), and will finance R&D studies and activities\n            to improve the effectiveness of treatment and prevention of\n            HIV/AIDS.  The third component will strengthen the overall\n            management of the program, establish a monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) unit at the national level, and\n            strengthen monitoring capacity at the state and municipal\n            level.  It will also include a system to monitor compliance\n            with plans, to receive federal transfers, and activities to\n            develop a culture of performance-based management, as well\n            as supporting the development of software to improve\n            logistics and management systems."}, "docdt": "2003-06-04T00:00:00Z"}
