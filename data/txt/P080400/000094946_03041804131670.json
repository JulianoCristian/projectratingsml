The final disposition of these\n            wastes might have an impact on surrounding natural\n            resources, which , if they are not handled properly, can\n            have negative effects. In the area of prevention, the only\n            type of medical waste generated is in harm reduction\n            programs for intravenous drug users which include needle\n            exchange components. With regard to treatment and care,\n            potential risk arises from unprotected handling of blood or\n            body fluids of infected individuals (including HIV,\n            Hepatitis B and C, and other STDs), and from wastes\n            emanating from the treatment in health facilities and from\n            laboratory work. In the case of clinical and biomedical\n            research Group A wastes (biological wastes, like cultures\n            and inoculations from clinical and research laboratories;\n            contaminated blood products; surgical and pathological\n            wastes; sharps; and secretions, excretions, and other\n            organic liquids derived from patients and residues\n            contaminated by those materials), may be generated , and\n            possibly some of type B2 (pharmaceutical residue like dated\n            medications, contaminated medications, and unused\n            medications). To reduce potential risk, guidelines are\n            developed for managing syringes in needle exchange programs.\n            Bio-safety precautions will be used in handling blood,\n            secretions and excretions, and in contact with mucus\n            material and loose skin. Guidelines also specify how to\n            dispose of solid healthcare waste, as well as the use of\n            individual protection equipment. Staff will be trained on a\n            regular basis. Specific precautions will be taken when\n            handling and disposing of cutting and perforation implements\n            contaminated by organic material. Proper procedures will be\n            put in place to separate, condition, and identify health\n            facilities waste, and to provide environmentally and\n            sanitary temporary safe storage."}, "docdt": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
