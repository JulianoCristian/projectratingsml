Lessons learned\n            include rethinking private sector participation arrangements\n            and focusing on improving the general business environment\n            through increasing access, affordability and sustainability\n            of a minimum infrastructure platform, and reducing the cost\n            of doing business. Other lessons include taking into account\n            political realities, measuring Government commitment,\n            improving communication with the public and garnering\n            support, aptly matching the technical assistance component\n            to the overall country dialogue and strategy, and providing\n            for redundancies and retraining as an integral part of\n            privatization since it profoundly affects public opinion and\n            government commitment."}, "docdt": "2005-05-25T00:00:00Z"}
