This will involve conversion of the\n            plants' inefficient wet process to a modern dry process\n            which includes precalciner technology. In addition, the\n            project will include small scale rehabilitation and\n            modernization investments at other cement plants; (ii)\n            training programs, curriculum development; and (iii)\n            technical assistance. The project will improve fuel\n            efficiency, increase cement output, enhance environmental\n            control, upgrade operator skills, and promote the policy for\n            complete decontrol of pricing and output."}, "docdt": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
