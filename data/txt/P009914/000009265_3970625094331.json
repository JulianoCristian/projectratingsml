help\n            the cement industry of India to achieve a higher operating\n            efficiency through: (i) modernization of its facilities\n            including conversion of six private sector cement plants and\n            one public sector plant. This will involve conversion of the\n            plants' inefficient wet process to a modern dry process\n            which includes precalciner technology. In addition, the\n            project will include small scale rehabilitation and\n            modernization investments at other cement plants; (ii)\n            training programs, curriculum development; and (iii)\n            technical assistance. The project will improve fuel\n            efficiency, increase cement output, enhance environmental\n            control, upgrade operator skills, and promote the policy for\n            complete decontrol of pricing and output."}, "docdt": "1986-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
