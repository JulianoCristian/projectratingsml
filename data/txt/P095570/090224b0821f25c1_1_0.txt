                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims at improving access of rural households and entrepreneurs to goods, social services and income generating opportunities through reduced transport
                         costs and better rural transport infrastructure and through piloting, in 15 provinces, specific incentives aiming at promoting greater complementarities and bundling of
                         rural infrastructure interventions at the provincial level.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Project has achieved the targets at the closing date. Project design and loan resources were focused primarily on improving the rural transport infrastructure by planning and
                         executing rehabilitation and periodic and routine maintenance through a decentralized management scheme promoted by the executing agency Provias Descentralizado (PVD). To
                         this date, the provincial and local governments, through the creation of 193 Provincial Road Institutes (PRIs), have improved their overall capacity to identify, plan and budget rural

                         formed local road maintenance micro-enterprises.

                         In terms of the outputs, the project has achieved the targets as follows:

                         •         3,272 km of roads have been rehabilitated of the 3,358 target (98% of the end target).
                         •         7,647 km of roads have undergone periodic maintenance, exceeding the end target of 7,506 km (102%).
                         •         2,332 km of non-motorized tracks have been rehabilitated, slightly below the end target of 2,515 (93%).
                         •         One bridge was rehabilitated in Ancash, reaching the end target.
                         •         46 small business private initiatives were implemented with US$8.83 million funded by local governments and 52 business plans were financed with US$1.41 million of local
                         funds; slightly above the end targets of 45 projects and 45 plans, respectively. The investment by the Project through the Local Development Window was of US$3.08 and the
                         mobilized funds were US$10.24 million for a leverage ratio of 3.3.

                         The routine maintenance system, introduced by the Bank, funded Rural Roads Rehabilitation project in 1995, was further expanded and strengthened through this Project. In fact,
                         325 additional micro-enterprises were created under the project, exceeding the original end target of 134. To the date, more than 857 micro-enterprises are in operation, providing
                         quality maintenance in the rural road network. These micro-enterprises generate employment for 5,749 persons (28% women) (one year equivalent permanent unskilled jobs).

                         The Impact Evaluation with detailed reports is well advanced, will be completed in February 2014 and the final results will be incorporated in the final report.
