1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.       In 2004, more than half of Peruvians lived in poverty and 19.2 percent in extremely
poverty, with rural areas being disproportionately affected. Sustained economic growth
improved this situation, decreasing extreme poverty in rural areas by 20 percent from 2000 to
2005. However, much of their underdevelopment could still be attributed to the acute
infrastructure gap present in the country. 1 Rural communities in Peru had less access to
electricity, roads, telephones, and sanitation services than the average for South America or for
other similar developing countries. Poor access to quality infrastructure limited their economic
opportunities, depressing incomes and making it harder for them to escape subsistence
agriculture.2

2.       A decentralization agenda was adopted to promote rural development. To tackle
these issues, the Government of Peru (GoP) began a decentralization process in the late 1990s
with the goal of simplifying and modernizing administrative systems so that more public sector
responsibilities could gradually be transferred to local governments. Decentralization was viewed
as essential to rural development because the Government in Lima could not have a clear
understanding of the wide range of problems affecting isolated areas of the country, let alone
attempt to fix them efficiently. In this context, the GoP implemented two consecutive projects
with the assistance of the World Bank (WB) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),
establishing, for the first time in the country’s history, a system for managing transportation
infrastructure in rural areas in a decentralized manner.

3.       Decentralization reforms have been most successful in the rural roads sector . In
1995, the First Rural Roads Project (FRRP) created an agency initially called Provias Rural (now
Provias Descentralizado), which rehabilitated 4,039 km of rural roads and 3,465 km of non-
motorized transport tracks in twelve of the poorest departments of the country. A network of
microenterprises was formed from the surrounding communities to perform routine maintenance
on these roads. The Second Rural Roads Project (SRRP), introduced in 2001, continued
rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads, but in an increasingly decentralized manner through
the creation of Provincial Road Institutes. These efforts to decentralize the sector were successful,
becoming a trailblazer for the Government’s broader decentralization agenda. The SRRP also
introduced several complementary social initiatives to target extreme poverty, promote
production activities, and encourage women’s participation at all levels of the project.

4.       By the end of the SRRP (Dec. 2006), 32 percent of Peru’s rural road network had been
rehabilitated (as estimated at appraisal) and was receiving adequate maintenance. Routine
maintenance was being performed by 532 microenterprises employing 6,000 people (24 percent
of whom were women).3 An Impact Assessment study conducted that same year revealed that
improved transportation conditions caused positive impacts on: school accessibility, healthcare

accessibility, agricultural productivity, and rural incomes. Annex 2 provides a summary of the
objectives and successes of these first two rural roads projects in Peru.

5.       Immediately afterwards, the Decentralized Rural Transport Project (DRTP) began
implementation to expand the high-impact activities of the previous projects to the entire country
and to continue strengthening the decentralization model. Additionally, based on the experiences
of the previous projects, it became clear that the improvement of transportation conditions could
achieve substantially more benefits if it was complemented by improvements in other types of
basic infrastructure and in the business environment of the nearby communities. Roads alone
might not be enough to quickly catalyze economic activity and reduce poverty; a more
comprehensive territorial development approach was probably needed. Thus, besides the
rehabilitation and maintenance for rural roads, the DTRP: (i) introduced the Rural Infrastructure
Pilot to plan and coordinate investments among infrastructure sectors (water/sanitation, irrigation,
electricity and telecommunications); and (ii) expanded the Local Development Window (LDW)
to complement the investments in road improvements with economic generation opportunities
along the newly rehabilitated roads. The LDW instrument would strengthen both the
municipalities and local stakeholders in defining territorial development strategies and plans, and
identifying potential production activity sponsors. It consisted of economic-production projects
such as agricultural products or eco-tourism. The executing agency of the LDW was selected on a
competitive basis from among private operators or NGOs. The projects were aligned to the
interests and aspirations of the stakeholders and to the potential products in the area. These
projects were operated by consultants or NGOs that worked to organize and support the rural
producers for the implementation thereof.

6.      Rationale for Bank assistance: The DRTP was well-aligned with the first objective of
Peru’s Country Assistance Strategy FY03 – FY06, Competiveness: Economic Management and
Private Sector Development, through the integration of poor rural areas into the transportation
network and the provision of employment opportunities to rural areas with high poverty rates.
The Project also shared the objectives of Peru’s Country Partnership Strategy for the period FY07
– FY11, particularly the first pillar (Economic Growth: Accelerating Growth and Widening the
Base Growth Cluster), by increasing public investments in physical infrastructure, providing
access to infrastructure and improving the quality thereof, and to labor market opportunities for
low-income families. This Project and the previous two rural roads operations were co-financed
by the IDB.4

7.       Moreover, the Project included the broader objectives of decentralization and public
sector reform by supporting regulations to define the role, responsibilities, and authority of the
regional and local governments and the introduction of: (i) performance management; (ii) public
contracting improvements; (iii) integrated financial management; and (iv) participatory planning
that has been extended to regional, provincial, and local governments.




4
  The partnership with the IDB has been very constructive and productive. Project preparation and supervision were
carried-out jointly. Sharing of information and experience of both institutions was key to complement each other and
eventually led to a better supervision of project implementation. The IDB Team was supportive and flexible,
particularly pushing firmly for a more rapid preparation of the new potential project, while financing consultancies
required for its preparation and carrying out close and proactive monitoring of progress.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

8.       The PDO was to contribute to territorial development and to the fight against rural
poverty in the Borrower’s territory by improving access of rural households and entrepreneurs to
goods, social services and income generating opportunities through reduced transport costs and
better rural transport infrastructure.

9.      The key indicators and their targets can be found in the Results Framework Analysis
table presented in Section F. They span outcomes in transportation conditions and access to
public services and outputs in civil works and institutional development.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.      Neither the project development objective nor the outcome indicators were revised
during the life of the project.

11.     The project was restructured on July 23, 2010 to reallocate funds among categories and to
adjust the Performance Indicators targets established in the Loan Agreement, when the project
was 76 percent disbursed. The revisions were made in light of the progress achieved as of the
mid-term review of April 15, 2010.

12.      The reallocation of Loan proceeds was meant to modify funding for the components that
financed road works: a 16 percent increase for Component 1: Improvement of Rural Transport
Infrastructure; and a 36 percent increase for Subcomponent 3.2: Rural Infrastructure Pilot. These
changes were made possible through the reallocation of the contingency funds, a 2 percent
decrease for project management, and increased national counterpart funds by about 20 percent.
Funds allocated to institutional strengthening activities remained roughly unchanged.

13.      The targets were adjusted to accommodate cost increases of 40 percent for road
rehabilitation and 50 percent for periodic maintenance, given that prices for these works had not
been revised since the year 2000, while a construction boom saturated supply markets (materials,
machinery, and qualified labor). The target for road rehabilitation was increased despite the cost
escalation, due to the prioritization of this component by the Government to counter the effects of
the global economic crisis. The targets for periodic maintenance, improvement of non-motorized
transport (NMT)5 tracks, and for bridges were reduced. Only one bridge was to be rehabilitated as
part of the project, while fifteen bridges were to be rehabilitated using national counterpart funds.
The implementation of this subcomponent was affected by the absence of a good quality bridge
inventory. The number of microenterprises was increased to perform routine maintenance on the
additional length of road rehabilitations. The other Performance Indicators remained unchanged
at their original values.

  NMT tracks are the only transportation infrastructure available for the remotest rural areas in Peru. They are narrow
pathways, usually without drainage system, used by pedestrians and work animals. It is calculated that more than
100,000 km of NMT tracks exist in the country. Some NMT tracks are of interest for tourism and were financed under
the DRTP.


                                                          3
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.      The FRRP and SRRP had rehabilitated 15,692 km of rural roads and 7,000 km of NMT
tracks in twelve of the poorest departments of the country. The DRTP sought to rehabilitate an
additional 3,358 km in the 24 departments of the country, meaning that the entire rural road
network would have been rehabilitated and would be receiving continuous routine maintenance
(estimated at appraisal). The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) identified the people living near
these roads as the main beneficiaries of the Project, reducing their social isolation and increasing
the availability of economic opportunities with better access to markets, resources, and jobs. In
addition, the LDW was expected to organize and assist rural producers in poor areas of selected
provinces, and strengthen the ability of local governments to promote rural development. The
participation of women at all levels of the Project would also continue to be promoted.

15.      An ex-post analysis found that the DRTP increased the number of beneficiaries of the
rural roads projects by 3.9 million, which included 1.16 million direct beneficiaries of road
rehabilitation, 283,000 direct beneficiaries of NMT track improvements, and 2.45 million indirect
beneficiaries from the rest of the rural population6, who benefited through: (i) the scaling-up of
sector management countrywide; (ii) the creation and strengthening of Provincial Road Institutes
(PRIs)7; and (iii) increase of road interventions outside of the DRTP. These beneficiaries are in
addition to the 3.5 million people that benefited from the SRRP (Implementation Completion and
Results Report), who continued to benefit in the DRTP from: (i) the periodic maintenance of
roads that were previously rehabilitated; and (ii) continuation of routine maintenance
microenterprises. Together, the rehabilitation of roads and improvement of NMT tracks in the
DRTP directly benefited 19 percent of the country’s rural population.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

16.      Component 1: Improvement of Rural Transport Infrastructure. Scaling-up and
improving the decentralized management of rural roads in the entire Borrower’s territory by: (i)
rehabilitating or improving rural roads prioritized through Participatory Provincial Road Plans
(PPRP)8; (ii) improvement and re-constructing selected connecting bridges; (iii) insuring periodic
maintenance of rural roads; (iv) improving non-motorized transport tracks; (v) improving other
types of rural transport infrastructure (including river-based equipment); and (vi) launching initial
activities for the stabilization of slopes and the protection of rural roads against river-based
erosion.




6
  This was the methodology used to estimate the number of beneficiaries of the SRRP and to establish the target of
beneficiaries for the DRTP: 3.5 million in the PAD.
7
  The Provincial Road Institute is a decentralized unit in the provincial municipalities responsible for rural roads,
managing routine maintenance contracts through microenterprises, the monitors’ schedule, road planning, and technical
studies. Specific capacity building arrangements have been established to provide PRIs with the ability and experience
at the time of transference of fiduciary responsibilities. PRIs are governed by a Provincial Road Board, which includes
the provincial and district mayors; and their operating costs are covered by contributions from Central Government
transfers and municipalities. Currently there are 188 operative PRIs.
8
  Plans were prepared or updated in each Province, with the assistance of the PRIs, to identify tertiary roads and NMT
track needs, ranking rural road projects taking into consideration poverty criteria, stock of road assets, and the financial
capacity of local governments to contribute counterpart funds. In most cases, the plans were prepared with the GIS
inventory of the road network. The plans were approved by Provias for road funding selection.

17.      Component 2: Institutional Development

a. Providing comprehensive institutional strengthening to Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MTC) at the central level in order to improve regulatory capacity by, inter alia:
(i) defining and regulating policies for rural transport; (ii) promoting research and innovation in
rural transport; (iii) launching a fiscal revenues and road development study; and (iv) assisting in
other related activities for MTC agencies involved in decentralized rural policies.

b. Providing comprehensive institutional strengthening to District Municipalities and Provincial
Municipalities in order to empower them to better implement their rural transport policies, by
inter alia: (i) preparing or updating PPRPs; (ii) improving the existing routine maintenance
system with micro-enterprises; (iii) enhancing local capacity to handle social, cultural and
environmental safeguards; (iv) mobilizing municipal financing for rural transport; (v) promoting
private financing for rural transport; (vi) scaling-up the Geographic Information System (GIS)
experience; and (vii) assisting said municipalities as well as selected Provincial Infrastructure
Institutes and selected PRIs in other related capacity-building activities.

18.     Component 3: Transport for Territorial Development. Enhancing impact of improved
transport conditions on rural development by fostering complementarities with other types of
investments and by promoting productive activities through:

a. the Local Development Window aimed at accelerating the emergence of productive activities
in in the areas where transport conditions have been improved, and

b. the Rural Infrastructure Pilot (RIP) 9 aimed at increasing in the Selected Provinces the
efficiency and effectiveness of rural economic infrastructure investments through enhanced
coordination and promotion of greater complementarities between sectors, as well through works
on rural roads segments as prioritized under the RIPs.

19.    Component 4: Project Management. Supporting Provias Descentralizado in its day-to-
day management of the project through:

a. the provision of technical advisory services for monitoring, evaluation and audits, including the
updating or expansion of SIGAT and related training activities, mid-term and final impact
evaluation studies and technical operational, environmental and social auditing activities to be
performed during project implementation; and

b. administrative and operational support.

  The RIP intended to experiment in a sample of 15 provinces, in the context of the decentralization reforms, with the
planning and institutional arrangements of rural infrastructure investments. Local governments would lead the
preparation of the plans for the pilot with the participation of different sectors, for example, electrification, water
sanitation, telecommunications, and transport. About 40 km of road rehabilitations prioritized by the RIP plans were to
be financed.

1.6 Revised Components

20.     The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

21.      The Project closing date was formally extended two (2) times for a total of 21 months.
The first extension was from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013, when the Project was 86 percent
disbursed. The Project had been affected by the regional and national elections that took place in
2010 and 2011, respectively, which resulted in the replacement of a large proportion of provincial
administrators, including the technical staff of the PRIs. Due to the decentralized nature of the
Project, this implied a long learning curve during the transitions and delays in implementation, in
particular for the execution of periodic maintenance works. This was exacerbated by the low
capacity level of newly-appointed technical staff; and the emergency decrees (to increase
expenditures and in turn stimulate the economy) issued by the GoP during 2010-2011.
Furthermore, the Project was affected by some rehabilitation contracts that were subject to
arbitration, slowing the progress of civil construction works. In response, the implementing
agency scaled up training activities to familiarize new provincial staff with the program and
strengthen their capacity for the implementation of Project activities

22.      The second extension was from March 31, 2013 to December 31, 2013, when
disbursements stood at US$49 million (98 percent of the Loan amount), which also included a
reallocation of funds. The extension was justified by an unusually heavy rainy season that
prevented the completion of periodic maintenance and the improvement of tourism-related NMT
tracks; to remove previous backlogs in the institutional development activities; and to issue the
contract for data collection and the impact evaluation analysis at the end of the Project. The
reallocation of Loan proceeds was mostly justified by financial reasons, given the updated
investment costs for rural transport infrastructure.

23.     A reallocation among Loan categories was approved on December 20, 2013, to make
resources available in each category and close the accounts after the final expenditures had been
updated.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.      Soundness of Background Analysis. The Project was designed based on the experiences
accumulated in the successful implementation of the FRRP and SRRP. These projects were an
integral part of the Government’s efforts to promote rural development, decentralization, and
social inclusion, providing many lessons learned from their implementation. Impact Evaluation
studies were conducted in 2000, 2004, and 2006.

25.      A Quality at Entry review rated the Project as Satisfactory due to: the relevance of the
operation to strategic priorities in Peru’s Country Assistance Strategy FY03 – FY06; the excellent
engagement of key stakeholders and beneficiaries; the thorough sector work and impact
evaluations underpinning the operation; the partnership with the IBD; and the innovations being
piloted and mainstreamed under the project.




                                                6
26.     Assessment of Project Design. The design was satisfactory, especially considering the
lessons learned from the previous projects, to continue decentralization reforms, scaling up
project activities to the entire country, including the LDW and promoting the participation of
women. The DRTP expanded the most impactful components of the previous projects and
introduced a RIP to explore ways of amplifying these impacts. However, this Pilot sought
ambitious institutional reforms which proved difficult to implement. Nonetheless, as a Pilot it
demonstrated the usefulness of infrastructure bundling, which was subsequently adopted by the
GoP outside of the DRTP.

27.     Safeguards. The Project was classified as “Category B,” which triggered the following
four safeguards: (i) Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01); (ii) Cultural Property (OPN 11.03,
being revised as OP 4.11); (iii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); and (iv) Indigenous
Peoples (OP/BP 4.10).

28.     Adequacy of Government Commitment. The GoP was supportive of the DRTP, with
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) transferring resources to the Municipal
governments for routine maintenance, and promoting the participation of local governments, who
embraced decentralization more energetically than anticipated. Local leaders and stakeholders
participated in the PPRP and the Road Committees were successful in eliciting the support of the
community for the improvement of the NMT tracks.

29.     Assessment of Risks. The overall risk of the Project was realistically rated as Modest.
The weakening of decentralization reforms was identified as Modest, but this risk turned to be
low, as decentralization became one of the main strengths of the DRTP. Reduced counterpart
funding, insufficient institutional capacity of municipalities, and/or rejection of the
decentralization model were rated Substantial. However, due to appropriate mitigation strategies
and institutional strengthening, these risks did not materialize. The Procurement and Financial
Management risks were assessed as Modest/Substantial and Low, respectively, and a series of
mitigation measures were incorporated, which proved effective for proper procurement and
financial management. On the other hand, the risk that other sectors would resist the RIP was
underestimated as “Modest,” partially because a Memorandum of Understanding had been
signed. This MOU was ultimately not complied with by the parties involved. A more careful
accounting of political realities could have led to the incorporation of more binding coordination
mechanisms, or even to the involvement of higher levels of government.

30.      The PAD also appropriately rated as “Low” the risk that Provias would become
overextended by the scaling-up of the Project to the whole country. However, an important risk
that was not identified in the PAD was the potential for slow implementation due to capacity
constraints. In the later years of the Project, Provias became overloaded with additional
responsibilities unrelated to the banks’ projects, and with internal unresolved issues that affected
its responsiveness. To resolve this issue, the Bank organized a workshop where the role of the
implementing agency was analyzed, the risks that any shortcomings pose to the Project were
evaluated, and a strategy was prepared to mitigate these risks. It was agreed that the mitigation
measures were to be incorporated in the design of the new potential project.

2.2 Implementation

31.     Project implementation, including compliance with Loan covenants, was Satisfactory.
Implementation was also rated Satisfactory in most of the Implementation Status Reports.
However, implementation was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in two consecutive
supervision periods, despite high disbursement rates, based on concerns regarding lack of


                                                 7
sufficient routine maintenance by the microenterprises, and sluggish implementation of
environmental aspects. Overall, the Project was generally implemented smoothly and efficiently
by Provias, who had gained considerable experience in the implementation of the FRRP and
SRRP, including in: promoting collaboration between the central and the local governments;
applying their knowledge of the procedures of the national and the financial institutions (IDB and
WB); utilizing risk management tools to keep the Project on track; and keeping a group of
capable and committed personnel. The Project was relatively complex, with a wide scope, and
required intensive involvement from Provias due to the decentralization. Nonetheless, the Project
was implemented successfully.

32.      At Mid-term Review in February 2010, the Project presented a high level of financial
execution, but had delays in other areas. To overcome these disparities, Provias made strong
efforts to advance institutional and regional aspects, such as: the RIPs; evaluation and monitoring
of the PRIs; the LDW; and the evaluation of impacts. Another specific concern was that only one-
third of the rehabilitated roads had continuous routine maintenance. Provias solved this issue by
reaching an agreement with the MEF that intergovernmental transfers were to finance two-thirds
of the routine maintenance costs and the remaining third was to be financed by the municipalities.
The creation and continuation of routine maintenance microenterprises was also fortified by
Provias.

33.      Provias exhibited leadership in road rehabilitation. By February 2010, the Project had
achieved 72 percent of its road rehabilitation target, primarily because these works were
prioritized by the implementing agency following a broader mandate of the GoP to increase
countercyclical expenditures to stimulate the economy during the 2008 global recession. The
Project’s other civil works initially lagged, but their implementation was accelerated mid-project,
eventually achieving output targets.

34.      Swift action by Provias mitigated the impacts of high staff turnover following local
elections and unusually heavy rains. In the 2010 local elections, 83 percent of local mayors
were ousted, which led to 47 percent of PRI managers being replaced, and left another 24 percent
of PRIs without a manager for at least the following two years. Often, the incoming managers
were political appointees with little experience in rural roads, representing a considerable loss of
capabilities for the PRIs. This delayed the transfer of responsibilities to the PRIs, requiring the
Project closing date to be formally extended from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013. To mitigate
this issue, Provias: (i) on-boarded nominees on rural roads management before elections; (ii)
implemented the oversight of PRIs by a committee of district mayors instead of just the
provincial mayor; (iii) implemented a requirement that managers must be professional engineers
or economists; and (iv) focused on strengthening processes and institutions instead of people.
Unusually heavy rains at the end of the Project required Provias to refocus its efforts in order to
achieve project targets. The closing date was promptly extended from March 31, 2013 to
December 31, 2013 to accommodate these efforts.

35.      The Project adapted rapidly to external cost pressures due to higher-than-expected
economic growth. An unprecedented countrywide economic boom, unexpected at the time of
Appraisal, drove up input costs considerably (e.g., materials, machinery, labor, technical
expertise). A survey taken in 2010 found that rehabilitation and periodic maintenance costs had
increased by 40 and 50 percent, respectively, from the estimates used in the PAD. This not only
led to the 2010 project restructuring that updated project costs and output targets, but it also led
Provias to diffuse bids more widely and change bid requirements to encourage more firms to
compete.



                                                 8
36.      Concerns over the implementation pace of the institutional strengthening, rural
infrastructure pilot, monitoring and evaluation, and gender action plan activities persisted
throughout 2010 and 2011. Also, most of the Provias management team had been replaced,
affecting the working knowledge of the institution. To ensure that Provias continued to contribute
to decentralization, the banks intensified discussions to raise awareness of the value added to
these complementary activities.

37.      Project implementation was facilitated considerably by the success of
decentralization reforms. By 2011, PRIs had been created in 97 percent of provinces, and their
capabilities were strengthened beyond the expectations of the PAD, due to the steady support
received from local governments and the institutional strengthening efforts. Each PRI became
involved in the planning of Project investments and fulfilled important study, performance, and
oversight responsibilities. Recognizing this strength, the MEF transferred resources to the local
level for performing routine maintenance.

38.      Local governments were strong allies of the LDW in the promotion of territorial
development. Because of the successful promotion of rural productive initiatives, the LDW
demonstrated to local governments the value of providing direct support for the rural economy.
As a result, many local governments where the LDW was active created economic development
offices, passed favorable territorial development regulation, and took over the responsibility of
promoting strategic rural producers’ associations. This was observed at the district, provincial,
and regional levels of government, and represented a significant accomplishment in ensuring
project sustainability.

39.      The planning component of the RIP received broad input from stakeholders and
prioritized roads were rehabilitated. The RIPs that identified “infrastructure bundles” were
successfully prepared with support from the PRIs. Roads in these plans were promptly
rehabilitated by Provias in four provinces (122 km). However, the other infrastructure sectors
(water/sanitation, irrigation, electricity, and telecommunications) were slower in adopting these
plans and coordinating investments. In an effort to reinforce this concept, the GoP transferred it to
the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) as the new Fund for the Economic
Inclusion of Rural Zones (FONIE)10, which seeks to incentivize joint infrastructure investments in
poor and vulnerable areas of the country.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation, Design, Implementation and Utilization

40.     The DRTP strengthened the already adequate system that had been built up during the
FRRP and SRRP, providing thorough data and analyses to track project progress in the context of
the results framework and output indicators. The Integrated System for Technical and
Administrative Management was improved and used more broadly by Provias, its zone offices,
and the PRIs to share project information on budgets, contracts, logistics, staffing, and financing,
among other things. The Project also financed the expansion of the GIS inventory of roads and
public services to cover 164 provinces. Using this and other information, Provias prepared
Biannual Progress Reports and Annual Operational Reports for the Bank. Consultancy studies
were contracted to evaluate the LDW and RIP.

   El Fondo para la Inclusión Económica en Zonas Rurales (FONIE) is a financial instrument from the MIDIS created
to provide water and sanitation, rural roads, electricity and telecommunications to the poorest households in rural areas
of Peru. The fund intervenes in the poorest 570 districts of the country or in conflictive or border rural areas.

41.     Three Impact Evaluation studies were performed in 2000, 2004, and 2006 to assess the
impacts of the FRRP and SRRP (the findings of these studies are summarized in Annex 6). In
2006, baseline data was collected to evaluate the use of a difference-in-differences methodology
by the DRTP, comparing households and communities near intervened roads against those near
control roads (NMT tracks were also considered). In 2013, these households and communities
were re-surveyed to estimate the impacts of the Project. On one hand, this Impact Evaluation
study was well-designed in measuring impacts in the outcome indicators of the results
framework, including on transportation conditions and accessibility to public services and
economic opportunities. However, this study faced the following issues: (i) survey attrition was
substantial and likely systematic (there was some evidence that the families that benefited the
most from the interventions were likelier to move to nearby urban centers); (ii) the long
observation time of the study (7 years) exacerbated the confounding effect of unobserved
variables; and (iii) a significant proportion of the “control” roads were intervened outside of the
DRTP. Several steps were taken that successfully corrected for some of these issues, permitting
an honest estimation of project impacts.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.      Environmental Aspects. The management of environmental aspects was Moderately
Satisfactory. The DRTP did not involve major negative environmental impacts because it
rehabilitated and maintained existing infrastructure. An Environmental Management Plan and
Environmental Impact Assessments were prepared for each road rehabilitation subproject.
However, their recommendations were often not fully implemented by the provinces. The DRTP
gradually introduced the environmental management agenda at the provincial level due to the
provinces’ low capacities. However, extensive institutional strengthening in environmental
management at the local level is still needed.

43.      Social Safeguards, Involuntary Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples. These policies
were not triggered because no new roads were being constructed and the existing roads were
rehabilitated and maintained within their right of way.

44.      Procurement Management. The management of procurement processes by Provias was
Satisfactory overall. Six ex-post procurement reviews were performed between 2009 and 2014, as
well as an Independent Procurement Review, conducted in April 2010 by an international expert.
The reports and Supervision Missions provided the following recommendations: (a) better
management of the procurement plan; (b) training of procurement staff; and (c) improvement in
filing and archiving of the procurement documentation. These recommendations were mostly
complied with during project implementation. A situation occurred in the evaluation of proposals
(for post-review processes) after a misinterpretation of the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines by the
staff of the Project. This was due to a provision in the Operations Manual (OM) and the Standard
Bidding Documents for NCB and Shopping, which allowed Provias to reject bids because of
omissions or mistakes that could have been clarified by the bidder. The Bank proceeded to
engage the Provias procurement staff in training events to do away with this practice.

45.     Financial Management. The financial management performed by Provias was
Satisfactory, since it maintained adequate arrangements and applied sound financial management
practices during implementation. These included adequate internal controls and the use of an
information module to track transfers and execution in provincial governments, providing useful
and timely information for monitoring purposes by Provias and the Bank. Provias has been
characterized by maintaining qualified and experienced key operational staff, adequate processes
and procedures, and an information system. Project implementation was standard and submission


                                                10
of interim financial reports and financial audits was done by deadline. However, given that the
Project design involved the provincial governments, and local governments with high staff
turnover, Project implementation demanded extensive work and follow-up to monitor and train
the local staff in order to rapidly insert them in Project operation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

46.     The institutional sustainability of Project activities was strengthened considerably by the
success of decentralization reforms: the creation and strengthening of PRIs and microenterprises
gave local governments and communities ownership over rural roads, management, and a culture
of maintenance. PRIs now procure and manage 90 percent of routine maintenance (with funds
from districts and municipalities), and 28 percent of periodic maintenance (with DRTP funds). A
natural constituency has developed that holds local governments to higher standards on rural
transportation, and resources have been dedicated to continue maintenance.

47.      At the national level, Provias remains strong, with a significant project portfolio aside
from Bank financed activities. It established itself as the agency that manages rural transportation
in the country, and provides technical oversight on the transfer of resources from the MEF to the
local governments for road maintenance. However, Provias still remains a “special temporary
program” of the MTC. This affects a long-term strategic vision, or at least a medium- to long-
term plan; the organizational structure; and career paths and motivation for staff. No national
rural roads laws exist to institutionalize procedures, management arrangements, and financing in
the sector. This is causing challenges in several areas, including: (i) national contracting laws not
recognizing the social impacts of routine maintenance by microenterprises, forcing them to
compete for contracts with private firms; (ii) national contracting prohibiting the explicit
promotion of the employment of women, essentially stopping various components of the Gender
Action Plan; and (iii) restrictions on government financing of pilot projects or promoting rural
production activities with national resources.

48.      The overarching theme of the next phase of the Project (which is currently being defined)
will be to regularize and integrate rural roads management (the systems, methods, and procedures
developed) into the existing policies and programs of the GoP. This has been a challenge in the
past, as evidenced by the lack of a rural transport law; the difficulties faced in the RIP; and the
persistent conflicts with national contracting laws in routine maintenance. The next phase will
work to resolve this by: (i) operating through FONIE to coordinate infrastructure investments
with poverty reduction objectives; (ii) intervene in rural roads that feed “logistics corridors” that
have been prioritized by the GoP with economic objectives; and (iii) work with the state
procurement and women’s affairs sectors to ensure the sustainability of microenterprises and
gender inclusion within the country’s legal framework. This will give the Project key government
allies in achieving its social and economic objectives, making the most out of the complementary
policies and resources available.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High

49.     The development objectives and implementation of the Project contributed to Peru’s
Country Assistance Strategy FY03 – FY06 goal of “strengthening subnational management
capacity” by: (i) successfully promoting decentralization reforms in the sector; (ii) creating and



                                                 11
strengthening more than twice as many PRIs as expected; (iii) getting PRIs to manage and
finance some of the periodic maintenance and routine maintenance; and (v) getting PRIs to
engage in the planning of investments. They are also highly relevant to the priorities of the GoP,
contributing to all four of the Strategic Objectives of Peru’s Country Partnership Strategy FY12 –
FY16. In particular, it contributes to providing “better transport and infrastructure to reduce
inequality” by: (i) improving transportation in the poorest areas of the country; (ii) improving
NMT tracks used by the most isolated and poorest communities; (iii) getting LDWs to help small
rural producers increase competitiveness; and (iv) promoting the employment of women, who
often have few opportunities in rural areas. The DRTP had a strong focus on social issues directly
related to inequality. No other infrastructure sector in Peru has decentralized as successfully, or
emphasized social issues and equity as vigorously. As such, the DRTP helped shape the priorities
of the GoP by pioneering these areas. This resonates with the agenda of the current President,
who was elected largely on the promises of providing poor and disenfranchised Peruvians,
especially in rural areas, with greater access to the growing economy. His creation of the MIDIS
and FONIE complemented the DRTP by implementing the RIP model, and will become a key
partner in follow-up operations in the sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

50.     In order to assess the PDO, it was broken down into the following four objectives: (1)
contributing to territorial development in the Borrower’s territory; (2) contributing to the fight
against rural poverty in the Borrower’s territory; (3) improving access of rural households and
entrepreneurs to goods, social services, and income-generating opportunities; and (4) reducing
transport costs and improving rural transport infrastructure.

51.     The DRTP was Highly Satisfactory in accomplishing these development objectives.
This was validated by an Impact Evaluation study conducted at the end of the Project, which
controlled for a variety of exogenous factors (see Annex 6 for a description of its methodology
and results). The Project accomplished these positive outcomes and impacts by achieving or
exceeding 11 out of its 13 output targets (as detailed in the Results Framework Analysis), with
the remaining two targets reflecting the Government’s decision to implement the model of the
RIP outside the Project.

52.      In most of the Implementation Status Reports, the achievements of the Project toward its
PDO were rated as Satisfactory. This was increased to Highly Satisfactory because the very
positive results of the Impact Evaluation had just become available at the time of preparation of
the last Implementation Status Report.

53.     Objective 1: Contributing to territorial development in the Borrower’s territory.
Highly satisfactory. Hectares of land cultivated increased by 33.8 percent, with a decrease in
fallow time, presumably reflecting the increased productivity of agriculture. 11 Livestock
production also improved, with increased ownership of cattle (27.5 percent), pigs (8.1 percent),
goats (12.1 percent), horses (12.0 percent), chickens (18.1 percent), and guinea pigs (15.9
percent). The travel times to “points of sale” decreased substantially, as shown in Objective 4,
with the reduction being much greater for reaching local consolidation centers, which are farther
away and can potentially offer better prices to farmers as they serve a wider market. This caused


11
   The impacts of the project were estimated relative to a counterfactual scenario that was constructed using a
difference-in-differences methodology with Propensity Score Matching. All results were presented with at least 10%
statistical significance.


                                                       12
an increase of 10.1 percentage points in the proportion of sales to these centers and a reduction of
14.5 percentage points in sales to local markets. The prices of local agricultural products appear
to have increased with the improved transportation conditions (with a couple exceptions), which
is to be expected given the higher proportion of sales to consolidation centers, which provide
access to wider markets. Overall, a significant increase in per capita incomes was not observed,
although the number of hours worked per week increased by 8.5 percent, reflecting the greater
availability of employment opportunities. Higher expenditures were also observed. There was
some evidence of changes in the composition of employment, but they were generally difficult to
interpret.

54.      The Local Development Window component of the Project contributed to the territorial
development of 28 provinces in the following two ways: first, it assisted small associations of
rural producers in developing 52 business plans, helping 46 of them obtain funding from various
sources (mostly local governments) and providing assistance in their implementation; and
secondly, it worked to strengthen the public sector’s involvement in rural development, by (i)
assisting municipalities in the preparation of 30 local development plans; (ii) helping develop and
approve 60 rural development resolutions; (iii) and, most importantly, by convincing local
governments to adopt many of their objectives and strategies. This approach to territorial
development was unique in Peru, since it focused on demonstrating to public institutions the
benefits of supporting rural producers and strengthening them so they can continue and expand
these efforts in the future. Indeed, by the end of the DRTP, several local governments had
adopted this approach.

55.      The planning phase of the RIP, which was part of the territorial development strategy of
the DRTP, successfully prepared 15 rural infrastructure plans for the pilots (100 percent of
target). However, as mentioned before, the Government ultimately decided to implement the pilot
concept outside the Project, under MIDIS/FONIE, which led to two related output targets not
being achieved. Nonetheless, the DRTP rehabilitated 122 km of rural roads prioritized by the
pilot plans, and the other infrastructure sectors have also made similar investments, although not
concertedly. However, Peru invested significantly in rural infrastructure over the course of the
DRTP. A survey of people living near road rehabilitations in 2 of the 15 provinces of this Pilot
showed that the percentage of people with access to at least two basic infrastructure services (in
addition to the road rehabilitation) increased from 35.8 percent in 2006 to 95.4 percent in 2013
(these services included: water, sanitation, and electrification) (300 percent of output target based
on an incomplete sample).

56.      Objective 2: Contributing to the fight against rural poverty in the Borrower’s
territory. Highly satisfactory. The Impact Evaluation study found that the rehabilitation and
maintenance of roads had a large and robust impact on decreasing extreme poverty by 13.8
percentage points (1 percent statistical significance), if calculated through expenditures. The
Evaluation found that the expenditures log increased by 3.7 percent on average (5 percent
statistical significance), although no change in total poverty was observed, suggesting that most
of this benefit accrued among the poorest population. On the other hand, when measuring poverty
through the degree of Unmet Basic Needs (UBN), an improvement of 7.5 percentage points was
observed (5 percent statistical significance).

57.    Objective 3: Improving access of rural households and entrepreneurs to goods,
social services, and income-generating opportunities. Highly satisfactory. The major
improvements in transportation conditions by road were seen to increase the accessibility of rural
households to social services. The sharp reduction in travel times to schools (see Objective 4),
along with reductions in closures, caused school enrollment to increase by 19.2 percent in


                                                 13
children ages 12 to 18 registered in school, as compared to the counterfactual (384 percent of
outcome target). Despite the Impact Evaluation study finding no significant travel time reductions
to health centers, the number of health consultations (given illness) increased by 17.8 percent
(178 percent of outcome target), probably reflecting improvements in road closures and travel
accessibility. Road interventions also caused the times students need to reach secondary school to
decrease by 24.2 percent (121 percent of outcome target), with those travelling by vehicle
benefiting the most. However, reductions in travel times were not observed for reaching health
centers or workplaces, which may suggest that students are more sensitive to road condition.
Accessibility to income-generating opportunities increased by reducing travel times needed to sell
agricultural products by 26.2 percent (131 percent of outcome target). A decrease in bus fares was
observed, although the estimated magnitude of this effect was difficult to interpret.

58.      The improvement of NMT tracks was observed to have an even larger effect of health
consultations, increasing them by 70.0 percent, probably because of the higher level of isolation
of these communities. However, no change in school enrollment was observed after these works.
While improving NMT tracks was observed to reduce travel times to most destinations, few
impacts were observed on incomes, employment, or rural productivity. This might be an
indication that the control groups selected were not adequate, and required a similar matching
procedure as with rural roads. Nonetheless, a noticeable improvement was observed in terms of
the number of commercial establishments, private institutions, radio stations, and TV channels.
With regard to agriculture, there appeared to be a similar shift occurring as with rural roads,
where fallow land is increasingly farmed.

59.      Objective 4: Reduced transportation costs and better rural transport infrastructure.
Highly satisfactory. The rehabilitation of 3,277 km of rural roads (98 percent of target) had a
direct and immediate impact on transportation conditions. Most of these roads were in states of
critical disrepair, as they had not been intervened in decades. After the rehabilitation, these roads
received continuous routine maintenance to ensure their transitability by 325 newly created
microenterprises (270 percent of target) formed by 3,250 community members (230 percent of
target). The DRTP also financed 7,806 km of periodic maintenance (104 percent of target) on
roads that had been rehabilitated by the FRRP/SRRP or early in the DRTP.

60.      The outcome of this comprehensive intervention strategy was to considerably improve
the transportation conditions of the communities living near the intervened roads. The Impact
Evaluation study found that road closures decreased by 55.6 percent relative to the counterfactual
(278 percent of outcome target), likely reflecting: (i) the increased capacity of local governments
to perform emergency roadwork; (ii) the availability of microenterprises to resolve small
blockages; and (iii) the improved stability of the roadway and adjacent slopes. No changes in
freight transport costs were observed. These improvements in transportation conditions had a
mixed effect on traffic volumes, with auto traffic increasing by 18.0 vehicles per week, while no
significant change was observed in bus, truck, or motorcycle traffic. This could suggest a
transition into higher cost transportation modes.

61.     The DRTP also indirectly contributed toward improving transportation conditions in
areas outside its intervention scope by: (i) increasing the expectations of rural communities; (ii)
lobbying local government on the importance of adequate road management; and (iii) developing
standards and policies available countrywide. A random survey of roads that have not been
intervened by the DRTP found that by the end of the Project, eight (8) had been improved (higher
standard than rehabilitation); ten (10) had been rehabilitated; three (3) had minor interventions;
and twenty-one (21) had not been intervened at all. While it is likely that many of these
interventions do not meet the high standards of the DRTP, including that of continuous adequate


                                                 14
maintenance, this represents a clear change in the priorities of local governments, who rarely
made these investments before the DRTP.

62.     There is also strong evidence that the improvement of NMT tracks had a similarly strong
positive outcome on the transportation conditions of the communities that depend on them. The
DRTP improved 2,444 km of NMT tracks (97 percent of target) by contracting experienced
NGOs to work with local communities to prioritize and execute the improvement works. Relative
to the counterfactual12, it reduced travel times to district capitals (38 percent), provincial capitals
(20 percent), workplaces (35 percent), and health centers (71 percent). An increase in travel times
to schools was also found. It is important to note that NMT tracks may take many hours, and even
days, to traverse, making these reductions very significant in absolute terms. Also, the
improvement to these tracks likely had major positive impacts on the safety of the people and
their pack animals, which were not quantified by the Impact Evaluation study, although this
impact is likely.

63.      Strengthening decentralization of local institution for better transport infrastructure
management. One of the main successes of the DRTP was the strengthening of local
institutions and the subsequent decentralization of responsibilities to them. The most
important of these was the PRI, which had been introduced in selected provinces as a pilot in the
SRRP. Their objective was to increasingly take over responsibilities from Provias, who would
transition into an oversight and assistance agency. The DRTP created twice as many PRIs as
expected at appraisal, encompassing 97 percent of the country’s provinces. PRIs were
strengthened considerably by Provias through workshops, training sessions, and the streamlining
of processes, especially through the expanded use of the Integrated System for Technical and
Administrative Management. Learning-by-doing was encouraged and targeted assistance was
provided when needed.

64.      These efforts led to the following outcomes: the number of PRIs at capacity levels IV and
III (the strongest, with best financial safeguards) increased from 20 in 2008 to 94 in 201313. This
allowed for the contracting and overseeing of routine maintenance activities to be transferred
from Provias to the PRIs starting in 2008. In response, the MEF increased its financing share of
routine maintenance from 60 percent to 100 percent, representing over US$250 million in
transfers to municipalities for maintenance in the last five years (330 percent of outcome target).
By the end of the DRTP, 90 percent of routine maintenance was being contracted and managed
by PRIs with MEF funds. This success in decentralization led Provias to begin transferring the
contracting and managing of periodic maintenance to the PRIs, which were larger and more
complex contracts. At the end of the Project, 28 percent of periodic maintenance km had been
overseen by the PRIs, with no major challenges and comparable to the rest in terms of quality.

65.      PRIs were also strengthened in terms of investment planning. Every PRI worked with
consultants to develop or update their PPRPs (125 percent of target), prioritizing road
rehabilitations through a multi-criteria analysis with significant community/stakeholder input.
Fifteen selected PRIs worked with consultants to develop RIPs (100 percent of target) in order to
prioritize infrastructure bundles that could catalyze rural development. Both of these planning
efforts were facilitated by over 87 percent of PRIs developing GIS inventories of their road
networks (some used contractors), which also included information about public services


12
   In order to evaluate the impacts of NMT track improvements, a difference-in-differences methodology was used with
fixed effects at the village level.

   Despite the significant loss of capabilities following the 2010 local elections.

available and demographics. Aside from conducting pre-investment studies, more capable PRIs
conducted geotechnical studies and environmental impact studies, for example.

3.3 Efficiency

66.        Economic Analysis Framework. An ex-ante economic evaluation of four representative
intervention types was conducted in the PAD. These interventions were defined as: the
rehabilitation and maintenance of roads with Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) less than 15,
with AADT between 15 and 50, with AADT higher than 50, and the improvement of NMT
tracks 14 . A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was performed using the Road Economic Decision
(RED) model for these representative interventions, with the exception of roads with AADT<15
which were analyzed with a Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA). This was done to allow for the
consideration of roads interventions for primarily social objectives. An ex-post economic
evaluation was conducted that consisted of: (i) redoing the representative CBA and CEA ex-ante
evaluations with actual data on project costs and benefits, considering the results of the latest
Impact Evaluation study; and (ii) reviewing the CBA and CEA performed on a sample of pre-
investment feasibility studies prepared during project implementation.

67.      Ex-Ante and Ex-Post Economic Evaluations. The CBA evaluations of higher volume
rural roads and NMT tracks were performed using the RED model, which weighs the benefits
accrued in the reduction of travel times, costs, and accidents against the investment costs of the
project. Benefits were considered for both passenger and freight transportation. For a detailed
discussion of the evaluation methodology, see Annex 4. The ex-ante evaluation estimated that the
Project would produce a Net Present Value (NPV) of US$13.91 million at an interest rate of 14
percent, and would have an External Rate of Return (ERR) of 29.2 percent. The ex-post
evaluation found that the project produced a NPV of US$108.3 million at an interest rate of 14
percent, and had an ERR of 54.6 percent. With regards to the CEA for low-volume roads, the ex-
post analysis found an average of US$30.17/person, which is reasonable.

68.      The ERRs estimated in the ex-post analysis were considerably higher than those
estimated in the ex-ante analysis, given that: (i) countrywide transportation costs were much
higher than originally estimated; and (ii) the value of time for passenger travel was almost twice
as high. Both of these were affected by the strong growth of the Peruvian economy during the
project implementation period, which raised living standards and drove up the prices of resources.
This led the improvements in transportation costs and speeds predicted by the RED model to have
higher benefits than expected—basic transportation infrastructure was valued more. This effect
was notable enough that it more than compensated for the increase in the investment costs of the
civil works. Therefore, Project investments were found to have had a high economic efficiency,
making the costs incurred in achieving its objectives reasonable.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

69.     The high and efficient achievement of the PDO indicators leads the Project outcome to be
rated as Highly Satisfactory. It achieved (and substantially exceeded, in some cases) 11 out of



14
   These interventions were expected to account for 94 percent of the civil works investments of the project. The
rehabilitation of bridges was not analyzed because the parameters of these interventions had not been defined by that
point.




                                                         16
the 13 output indicators, with the remaining two reflecting the Government’s decision to
implement the RIP outside of the project. The Results Framework Analysis demonstrated that the
Project impacted positive transportation conditions and the decentralized management of the
sector, which caused improvements in accessibility to healthcare centers and schools (social
services), and promoted territorial development. In selected provinces, the LDW also contributed
to territorial development and strengthened public institutions. Ultimately, robust evidence
indicated that the Project had a substantial impact on reducing extreme poverty and increasing
expenditures. These benefits are highly relevant to the strategic objectives of the GoP and the
WB, and the efficiency analysis in the previous section demonstrated that they were achieved
with reasonable costs.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

70.     Poverty. As mentioned previously, the improvement of transportation conditions was
observed to have had a major positive impact on reducing poverty and increasing expenditures.
These benefits occurred as rural poverty in the country decreased substantially, as seen in Figure
1. The Project also tackled poverty through road maintenance microenterprise employment;
temporary employment in road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance works; and the promotion
of small rural production activities through the LDW. The rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance of rural roads is estimated to have created 3,698 and 9,992 jobs, respectively,
providing income opportunities and training in poor rural areas (one year equivalent skilled and
unskilled jobs).

71.      Gender Inclusion. Women in rural Peru have restricted access to social and economic
opportunities, limiting them to household responsibilities. The SRRP implemented a Gender Unit
within Provias and introduced a Gender Action Plan to promote the participation of women at all
levels of the Project. This included: (i) the participation of at least 10 percent of women in the
staff of the routine maintenance microenterprises; (ii) the identification and implementation of
income-generating activities that directly benefit women in the context of the LDW; (iii) the
inclusion of at least 20 percent of women in the Road Committees; and (iii) the development of a
pilot training module for program staff, mayors, and community leaders to mainstream gender in
the Project cycle.

72.      The Gender Action Plan was streamlined in the Provias field offices and the PRIs in the
DRTP. The activities proved to be very successful (see Annex 8 for more gender aspects of the
project). The DRTP increased the participation of women in routine maintenance


                                                       17
microenterprises from 24 percent for those created before 2006 (SRRP) to 29.5 percent of those
created since. Between 2008 and 2012, 24 percent of managerial positions in the production
initiatives of the LDW were held by women. In Provias, 29 percent of managers are women, 80
percent of zonal offices attended gender awareness workshops, and 20 percent of attendees to
institutional strengthening trainings and workshops were women. This success could be
threatened in the future by Peru’s laws, which do not allow for positive gender-based
discrimination. This is particularly worrisome for microenterprises, since their contracting and
management was transferred to local governments. Currently, there is an ongoing dialogue
between the relevant governmental sectors on how to fairly promote gender inclusion within the
country’s legal system.

73.     Social Development. The SRRP introduced the LDW in 12 provinces as a way of
helping rural producers organize associations around specific income-generating activities (for
example, agricultural niches, fish farming, and eco-tourism), and provided technical and business
assistance, including facilitation in the securing of funding. Organizing rural producers also
eliminated middlemen, who often exacted high premiums for getting rural goods to local markets.
A key feature of the LDW was that it operated in areas that had benefited from the rural road
projects, therefore maximizing the impacts thereof.

74.      The DRTP expanded the LDW to 28 provinces and competitively contracted out the
operation thereof to 15 NGOs. The LDW assisted and financed the preparation of 52 business
plans for rural producers’ associations (including 15 dairy, 8 livestock, 6 irrigation, 6 quinoa, 5
cacao, and 5 coffee projects, among many others). Associations were also trained in technical
aspects and the commercialization of their products. Of these projects, 46 were funded through
various sources and were successfully implemented. Initiatives often leveraged different funding
sources.

75.      In the DRTP, the LDW was given the additional responsibility of working with local
governments to promote territorial development strategies and serve as advocates for rural
populations. By the end of the Project, LDWs had helped municipalities develop and approve 30
local economic development plans, 41 local ordinances, 13 resolutions, and 6 municipal
covenants. Many of these were aimed at strengthening municipalities so they could become more
actively involved in promoting rural development. The LDW gave many presentations to
municipal governments, emphasizing the importance of having territorial development policies
and partnering with production sectors in rural areas. These lobbying efforts led to the creation of
municipal offices in 12 provinces dedicated to promoting local economic development (most
municipalities did not have these offices at the time). This engagement with local governments
sets the LDW apart from other programs that have been implemented in the country to promote
rural development (such as ALIADOS and AGROIDEAS), and it helped the production
initiatives to often receive support from their local government after the contracts of the LDW
had ended.

76.     Road Maintenance Microenterprises. The FRRP and SRRP grew a system of
community-formed microenterprises for the performance of routine maintenance on rehabilitated
roads. The micro-entrepreneurs were essentially tasked with using manual labor to fill potholes,
clear vegetation, clean drainage, remove small obstacles, and do general emergency work
(especially during the rainy season). These organizations were also required to maintain proper
legal status by paying taxes, having bank accounts, filing financial statements, developing
internal operating procedures, and becoming registered. Provias and the PRIs assisted the
microenterprises in each of these steps, providing detailed manuals for their work.



                                                18
77.      This approach to routine maintenance provided income and training opportunities for the
poorest people, while creating community incentives for the work to be performed with good
quality. It greatly benefited the communities surrounding the rehabilitated roads, and proved to be
a cost-effective way of keeping the roads in good condition. It also created a natural constituency
for routine maintenance work to continue. The DRTP created 325 microenterprises, bringing the
total number operating throughout the country to 857.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening

78.      The Project strengthened the institutional capabilities of the government at the central and
local levels, as part of the ongoing decentralization reforms (second component of the Project). At
the local and central level, the Project accomplished:

79.     Strengthening of Decentralized Planning: The Provincial Road Management Pilot
introduced in the SRRP had established 121 PRIs in 12 departments of the country, of which 36
attained full implementation capacity. The DRTP grew and strengthened this institutional model
to encompass 188 PRIs, around 100 of them with full capacity.

80.      One of the main responsibilities of PRIs was to plan rural road investments in their
jurisdictions through PPRPs. PRIs worked with consultants to develop a consensus on the
demand for transportation based on participatory workshops with local stakeholders and an
analysis of socioeconomic data. On the one hand, this demand was estimated both for
marginalized populations (the poorest and most isolated) and for economically-productive
populations, emphasizing the potential for natural resource extraction. On the other hand, the
existing supply of transportation was determined by surveying the road network (including its
condition) using GIS. By crossing infrastructure supply with demand, potential projects could be
ranked using multi-criteria analysis of relevant factors. This final prioritization was then validated
with a technical working group and the results were presented in the PPRPs. The DRTP assisted
provinces throughout this process.

81.     Strengthening of the microenterprise routine maintenance system: By the end of the
SRRP, there were 532 of these microenterprises maintaining 14,750 km of roads. The contracting
of these activities had been transferred to the PRIs and municipalities were increasingly
participating in their co-financing. The DRTP successfully expanded this system and fully
decentralized its management to the PRIs. At the beginning of the Project, it transferred financing
to the municipalities and district governments (who received some funds through
FONCODES15). By the end of the DRTP, there were 857 microenterprises maintaining 16,867
km of roads in 143 provinces. This represented a creation of 325 new microenterprises and added
3,250 one-year equivalent permanent unskilled jobs.

82.      Mobilizing municipal financing for rural transport and promotion of private financing of
rural transport: In promoting decentralization, the DRTP helped increase the resources transferred


15
  FONCODES (Fondo de Cooperación para el Desarrollo) is a national program run by the MIDIS that works to
generate greater sustainable opportunities for households in rural areas living in extreme poverty, facilitating
coordination between the private actors from both the demand and the supply side of goods and services required to
empower and strengthen the business ventures of these households, thus contributing to the reduction of exclusion that
prevents these households from incorporating themselves into the market.




                                                          19
by the MEF to the municipalities for transportation projects (mostly for routine maintenance). In
2007, this figure was US$140 million, and in 2011 it was $109 million. Through these transfers,
the MEF has been the largest funder of rural transportation. However PRIs have proven adept at
complementing these transfers from a variety of other sources. It is often the case that district
governments contribute from their small budgets for road maintenance (resources they receive
from FONCODES). In certain areas of the country, royalties from natural resource exploitation
have been used to fund roadwork. And, to a lesser extent, PRIs currently receive funds in
relatively small amounts from over 30 international and national aid funds.

83.      Strengthening local capacity to handle fiduciary and safeguard aspects: The
comprehensive institutional strengthening package provided to the PRIs included the
implementation of financial management, procurement, and environmental safeguards. For funds
to be transferred to them for contracting routine and periodic maintenance, the MEF implemented
a rigorous set of rules to ensure the protection of these funds.

84.      Scaling up the GIS Road Inventory: The SRRP introduced a pilot where two PRIs were
trained in GIS technologies and given assistance so they could develop an inventory of their rural
road network. This pilot demonstrated that this technology could be used relatively cheaply to
enhance the planning process. The DRTP expanded the use of GIS to 164 PRIs, improving
coordination and information-sharing. These inventories also contained information about
demographics, the location of schools, hospitals, and information about the types of road
interventions performed in the past. Inventories were designed to fit together and be incorporated
for the tertiary network in the existing inventory of primary and secondary roads developed by
the MTC.

85.      Regulation and definition of policies for rural transport: The DRTP sought to begin work
on sector policies in an effort to institutionalize the progresses achieved in decentralization and
rural road management. However, little progress was actually made in this area. It proved to be
difficult for Provias to achieve this engagement because it required operating outside their
operational level functions. The follow-up project will attempt to address this at higher levels of
government to resolve broad policy issues that are currently threatening the sustainability of the
Project, such as: the contracting of routine maintenance microenterprises; the promotion of
gender inclusion, decentralization reforms, etc.

86.      Promotion of research and innovation in rural transport: The DRTP started several
initiatives for exploring ways of innovating on technical aspects, focusing on tailoring
interventions to different parts of the country, especially for regions that have frequent rains. This
included the pilot for stabilization of slopes and the testing of a chemical additive in the Madre de
Dios region to better stabilize soils. More research work is planned to be included in the follow-
up project, including a pilot for using low-cost pavements.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

87.      An Impact Evaluation study was conducted at the end of the Project to estimate its
impacts on various transportation, economic, and social indicators. It used a difference-in-
differences methodology, where households in “control” and “intervened” areas that had been
first surveyed in 2004 and 2006 where resurveyed again in 2013 to measure how they differed as
a result of the interventions. Two distinct types of interventions were considered: the
rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads; and the improvement of NMT tracks. A detailed


                                                 20
description of the results can be found in Annex 6. This Annex also contains a description of the
three previous Impact Evaluation studies conducted in 2000, 2004, and 2006.

88.     Based on this evidence, it is clear that the rehabilitation of rural roads caused:
         An improvement in transportation conditions, similar to the 2006 Impact Evaluation
           study.
         No increase in bus and truck traffic, similar to the 2006 Impact Evaluation study.
         A large increase in school enrollment (similar to the 2006 Impact Evaluation study)
           associated with a decrease in travel times to schools, and a smaller improvement in
           health accessibility (the 2006 Impact Evaluation study found no impact in the short-
           run).
         A large decrease in travel times to consolidation centers was found, with farmers
           increasingly selling their products at these locations, commanding higher prices due
           to their access to wider markets.
         A large increase in cultivated land area (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation study) and
           livestock holdings.
         A mixed impact on employment (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation study).
         A large impact in reducing extreme poverty (-13.8%) and structural poverty UBN (-
           7.5%), and increasing per capita expenditures (7.3%). These are the types of long-
           term impacts have rarely been captured in Impact Evaluation studies.

89.     On the other hand, the improvement of NMT tracks was observed to have caused:
         A large reduction in travel times (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation study).
         A large increase in accessibility to healthcare centers, with no improvement in
            accessibility to schools (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation study).
         A large increase in the availability of private and public services, including
            commercial establishments.
         A shift of land use from fallow to cultivation, similar to that observed in rural roads
            interventions.
         No impact on incomes, poverty, rural production, and employment (unlike the 2006
            Impact Evaluation study, which found improvements in these, including poverty).

90.      The Impact Evaluation study suffered from two limitations that probably biased its results
negatively, leading to a conservative estimation of impacts and outcomes. First, the results do not
include the benefits accrued to households that could not be found in the follow-up survey, which
may have been caused by the migration of households that benefited the most, in terms of human
and physical capital, to nearby cities. This would reduce the observed impacts of the Project
considerably, because over 40 percent of households surveyed in 2004/2006 could not be found at
a later date. And secondly, over half of the controls were eliminated from the sample because
they had been intervened outside of the DRTP, which increased the estimate errors. This
prevented many indicators that appeared to have interpretable signs from being designated as
significant.

91.     A Stakeholder Workshop on lessons learned and risk analysis was conducted in order to
obtain their impressions of: (i) lessons learned, based on the performance of projects recently
closed and under implementation; and (ii) risk analysis on future bank operations, including an
analysis of Provias becoming institutionally sustainable in the medium and long term. Key high
level Provias staff (more than 20), IDB’s Task Team Leader, and the Bank Team participated in
the workshop. The outcomes of the workshop helped convey the lessons learned and risk
analysis, together with a mitigation action plan, which would improve Provias’ institutional
structure and functionality for a follow-up project on rural road and NMT track investments. The


                                                21
main findings of the Workshop are presented in Annex 7, and some of the lessons learned are
reflected in this ICR. The methodology and PowerPoint presentations at the Workshop for both
themes are available in the project files.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

92.     By the end of the DRTP, the rural road projects had been operating in Peru for 18 years,
benefiting the public sector substantially and increasing the expectations of rural communities
with regard to the quality of their transportation system. The decentralization of responsibilities to
the PRIs led local governments to take ownership over road management. The co-financing of
routine maintenance by the MEF and the local governments increased the stability of funding,
brought more stakeholders to the table, and demonstrated a culture of maintenance that had been
promoted by the DRTP. However, to address the rural roads asset management, Provias needs to
study and report the maintenance requirements of the network as a whole, in a systematic manner.

93.      The main risks to development outcomes stem from the lack of a statutory legal
framework that solidifies and delineates the institutional arrangements and responsibilities created
by the DRTP and the previous projects. The government currently views the procedures and
policies created as “temporary,” which could be undone or changed without the input of the rural
communities affected. In addition to leaving open the possibility for the program to be reduced or
eliminated, the lack of a legal framework has caused issues in operations that could worsen over
time. For one, national contracting laws conflict with several social initiatives of the Project, such
as the direct contracting of microenterprises to perform routine maintenance and the promotion of
women’s employment. Also, NMT tracks are currently not fully recognized as an important
component of the rural transportation system, and PRIs are not permanent autonomous units of
the provincial institutional structure. The lack of a rural transport law that outlines a vision for the
decentralization of the sector and carves out exceptions for social initiatives poses an unlikely but
potentially critical risk to the continuation of important parts of the DRTP in the future. The MTC
could take on the preparation of the rural transport law, which includes the creation of a
permanent body with a nationwide scope, regulatory functions for planning and investments, and
advisory services to the subnational governments for effective and sustainable rural road
transport.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

94.      The Bank swiftly responded to the GoP request for support for a third rural road project,
given its strong strategic relevance to the continuity of the decentralization of rural road
management. The Bank team, in partnership with the IDB, closely assisted with Project
preparation work carried out by Provias staff and consultants. The Project PAD covered sector
issues adequately and incorporated the lessons learned from previous projects; in particular,
addressing a broad range of issues in an integrated framework and introducing complementary
social initiatives to target extreme poverty and promote productive enterprises. Nonetheless, the
Project was somewhat ambitious in going nationwide and including a broad range of actions at




                                                  22
the same time, e.g., exploring the design of additional incentives for greater coordination to
manage rural infrastructure interventions.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

95.      The Bank conducted two full supervision missions per year, jointly with the IDB.
Sufficient resources were allocated to supervision for the constant monitoring of the Project and
for a junior intern at the office in Lima. The supervision team’s engagement with the client
highlighted key project issues and focused on project development effectiveness, as well as the
monitoring of output and outcomes. Problems were quickly identified and the supervision team,
working together with Provias staff, was able to implement appropriate solutions. The Bank
office in Lima played an active role in supervising procurement, environmental safeguards, and
financial management. The midterm review strengthened implementation by putting measures
into effect to improve performance and assess the situation for project restructuring in 2010.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

96.     The Project was designed with a clear results framework, viable institutional
arrangements, and grounded technical aspects. The Bank team closely supervised the Project and
emphasized problem-solving and quick decision-making on remedial measures for improvement.
The team carefully focused on the monitoring of Project outputs and outcomes at all stages of
implementation, providing salient support for the Impact Evaluation study and Economic
Evaluation of the investments. The continuity of the staff (there were only two task managers
throughout project preparation and supervision) was another critical factor for the provision of
focused and consistent support to the Borrower.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

97.      During preparation, the Borrower’s contribution was significant and consistent with
Project objectives. The GoP, MTC, and Provias were fully committed to supporting the
decentralization model of rural roads management and expanding it through the DRTP. The
Government consistently honored its counterpart fund obligations and, at the end of the Project,
exceeded its contribution by US$6 million. The Borrower was also committed to and solidified
the transfers of resources to local governments for rural road maintenance.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

98.     Provias was focused on providing better road transport conditions, the involvement of
local governments and communities in project implementation, and strengthening provincial
governments so they could provide inputs to local development window recipients. Provias
assumed its responsibilities of evaluating needs and channeling resources through the PRIs for the
creation, operation, and supervision of routine maintenance microenterprises. Provias
successfully supported the rural infrastructure decentralization process for rural transport
functions by empowering local governments to contract out the periodic maintenance and
executing routine maintenance through local microenterprises on their rural road networks. The



                                               23
RIPs, prepared by Provias with the support of the local governments, have provided the basis for
the national strategy for expansion of rural infrastructure in Peru. Fiduciary performance was
adequate under Bank supervision and guidance.

99.     However, implementation progress was affected in two central instances. At the
beginning of the Project, too much emphasis was placed on advancing road rehabilitation
contracts at the expense of the institutional strengthening and territorial development components.
Later on, the slow delivery of periodic maintenance, NMT track improvements, the Impact
Evaluation study, and the economic evaluation study required unusual Bank support and an
extension of the Project’s closing date.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

100.   The Borrower has exhibited a strong commitment to insuring the sustainability of the
program, with the continuation of fourth project that will continue to support the institutional
development of the provincial and local municipalities through the decentralization model.

6. Lessons Learned
101.    Rehabilitating rural roads can be an effective mechanism for increasing access to
education and health, as well as reducing extreme poverty. The Impact Evacuation study
found that from 2004/2006 to 2013, the Project caused substantial improvements in travel times,
accessibility to education and health centers, availability of private and public services, and a 19.7
percent decrease in the proportion of persons living in extreme poverty.

102.     Road transport policies should explicitly include non-motorized transport tracks or
community roads in their strategic planning and as part of the road network. Non-motorized
transport tracks are an important part of rural transportation; many communities depend on them
to access schools, hospitals, and markets, and they have considerably benefited rural
communities, especially in ensuring the safety of people and porter animals. The maintenance of
these tracks is best performed through community service, but support for planning and technical
advice should come from the local government.

103.    Using local expertise and knowledge is effective in understanding development
problems, especially in isolated rural communities. The decentralized execution of road access
improvements, using participatory planning methods and involving local populations in road
works, including gender balance, assisted in the creation of employment and local income-
generating entrepreneurship. Complementarities in rural infrastructure investments gave
communities the tools and resources to accelerate the emergence of production activities.

104.    The Local Development Window is a good complement to rural roads projects in
catalyzing production activities that are possible because of improved transportation
conditions. Having adequate roads is necessary for a variety of production activities to be
possible, but this is often not the only factor limiting rural communities from taking full
advantage of better road transport. The Local Development Window assisted local governments
in reducing barriers to organizing, training, and financing rural producers. It also promoted a
culture of entrepreneurship that will likely have long-term impacts.

105.   Incorporating pilots, research initiatives, and building in adequate flexibility helped
achieve the development objectives. Some experimentation is required to tackle complex


                                                 24
social/economic issues in challenging environments. Throughout the rural roads program, several
pilots have been successfully tested. The Provincial Road Institutes model has expanded
significantly quicker than anticipated, emboldening decentralization reforms in the broader
government context. The same can be said for the Gender Action Plan, focused on gender
considerations and inclusion. The unsuccessful implementation of the Rural Infrastructure Pilot
was useful to the government in shaping its replacement: FONIE.

106.     To ensure the sustainability of routine maintenance of the tertiary road network,
institutional and financial arrangements should be made within the countr y’s legal
framework, in concordance with sector policies. Institutional capacity for rural road
decentralization is provided at the central level by Provias, at the Provincial level by the
Provincial Road Institutes, and at the road site by the road maintenance microenterprises.
However, neither Provias nor PRIs is a permanent part of the government, and the micro-
enterprises are subjected to the national contracting Law. To build capacities and reduce the
negative effects of recurring staff turnover, it is necessary for the MTC to pursue the
incorporation of tangible commitments and goals in road transport policies and promote the rural
roads law to normalize those institutions developed to respond to the needs of better roads for the
rural population.

107.      A properly designed Impact Evaluation study can be a powerful tool in identifying
the successes and shortcomings of development projects and better understanding how to
tailor them to local conditions. Incorporating Propensity Score Matching in the difference-in-
differences framework appears to control for many of the most important biases that commonly
afflict these studies. Having an observation time window of several years after the interventions is
necessary to estimate long-term impact development indicators, such as poverty. Issues of survey
attrition, stability of controls, and impact heterogeneity should be considered and dealt with
before ex-ante data is collected.

                           History of the Peru Rural Roads Projects
1.       Peruvian law has always stated that municipalities are the entities responsible for
managing rural roads.16 However, before 1995, they were not given any technical or financial
support to fulfill this obligation, which forced most of them to abandon their rural road networks,
leaving them to decay into states of critical disrepair. No systematic and formal way of managing
the rural road sector existed in Peru at that time. The few investments that were made to
rehabilitate rural roads were determined ad-hoc, following inconsistent standards, and usually
only after emergencies or particularly bad weather. Also, no mechanism existed for maintaining
these rehabilitated roads, leading them to deteriorate rather quickly—significantly reducing the
value of those original investments. Overall, the transportation needs of rural communities were
not being met by the central government or municipal governments. Instead, the priority was on
improving primary and secondary roads that connect large and medium-sized urban centers,
which was justifiable to an extent, since these roads were also in poor conditions.

2.       The First Rural Roads Project (FRRP), implemented from 1995 to 2000, had the
overarching objective of improving the access of rural communities to a greater range of
economic opportunities and public services by developing a sustainable system for rehabilitating
and maintaining the transportation infrastructure of these areas. The project sought to accomplish
this objective in 12 of the poorest departments in Peru (10 in the highlands and 2 in the jungle)17
by:

         Improving transportation costs, travel times, and reliability;
         Connecting physically isolated zones to regional centers;
         Improving transportation within villages;
         Generating local employment and economic activity through road rehabilitation and
          maintenance works; and
         Building capacities in this sector of the national government, the private sector, and
          local communities.

3.       The project cost $264 million, and was co-financed by the GoP, the IDB, and the WB. In
spite of the severe underdevelopment of Peru’s rural roads sector at the beginning of the project,
the following was accomplished:

         Rehabilitation of 8,900 km of rural roads;
         Rehabilitation of 2,370 km of primary and secondary roads that connect to the
          rehabilitated rural roads, many of which had gone without maintenance for years and
          were in deplorable conditions;
         Rehabilitation and upgrading of 174 km of village streets;
         Establishment of a system where 10,900 km of rural roads received routine maintenance
          by 410 community-formed microenterprises;

   On the other hand, primary roads are managed by the MTC and Provias Nacional, while secondary roads are
managed by the regional governments.

                                                       27
        Introduction of a pilot program wherein Road Committees improved the quality and
         safety of tracks and footpaths used for Non-Motorized Transport (NMT), which ended
         up improving 3,000 km of these tracks; and
        Implementation of various initiatives to strengthen the technical capabilities of the
         national government in this sector.

4.       To achieve the above outcomes, the FRRP created a special agency under the MTC
called Provias Rural to oversee and manage rural transportation in the country. Its main tasks
were the planning and contracting of rehabilitation works, and the establishment of a system of
MEMVs—cooperatives formed from the local populations—to perform routine maintenance on
the rehabilitated roads using labor-intensive methods. Microenterprises received substantial
technical and business assistance from Provias in order to successfully meet their yearly
contracts. This system became one of the most important components of the FRRP because: (i) it
proved to be a cost-effective approach; (ii) it significantly enhanced the sustainability of the
project; (iii) it provided training, jobs, and income to some of the poorest people in poverty-
stricken rural areas; and (iv) the capital and entrepreneurship gained was often put to use in other
types of production ventures.

5.       Another successful component was the introduction of a pilot program that uses a
network of Road Committees to prioritize and execute improvements of NMT tracks in the most
isolated parts of the country. NGOs were contracted to establish the Road Committees and to help
them execute the improvement works.

6.      In the 1990s, there was much talk in Peru about decentralization. This created high
expectations in the FRRP for crafting a vision for decentralization in the sector and taking actions
to pursue this goal. However, little of this was accomplished. The FRRP was run entirely by
Provias in Lima, and the municipal governments were not formally involved.

7.       The focus during the FRRP was to first build expertise in the rural roads sector, so that
the national government could support decentralization in the future. The FRRP was particularly
successful at building the technical and managerial capacities of all the institutions in the sector.
With the help of the WB and IDB, Provias very quickly developed the capability to implement
this multifaceted project in difficult environments. The private sector became involved in road
rehabilitation and maintenance projects in higher rates than anticipated, quickly building
capacities and new skills. This led to significantly lower rehabilitation costs than expected.

8.      The Second Rural Roads Project (SRRP), implemented from 2001 to 2006, continued
with the general objectives of the FRRP in the same 12 Peruvian departments (adding 7 new
provinces)18, while specifically emphasizing the:

        Gradual decentralization of the management and financing of rural transportation
         infrastructure to the provincial level;
        Strengthening of institutional capacities at the provincial level;
        Focus on poverty reduction by prioritizing works in the poorest areas and promoting
         community-based production initiatives that benefit from transportation improvements;
         and
        Promotion of gender inclusion at all levels of the project.

9.       At a cost of $136.43 million, the project accomplished the following:

        Rehabilitation of an additional 4,039 km of rural roads;
        Rehabilitation of an additional 653 km of primary and secondary roads;
        Expansion, strengthening, and decentralization of the system of microenterprises,
         widening its coverage to 14,750 km of rural roads;
        Performance of periodic maintenance on 8,598 km of rural roads that had been previously
         rehabilitated;
        Improvement of an additional 3,465 km of NMT tracks and footpaths;
        Introduction of a pilot program to test the ability of a system of Provincial Road
         Institutes (PRIs) to assume the gradual decentralization of responsibilities in the sector,
         including the prioritization of investments through Participatory Provincial Road
         Plans;
        Introduction of the Local Development Window (LDW) to encourage, assist, and help
         find financing for 72 production initiatives in 85 rural districts;
        Introduction of a pilot in two provinces to develop PVPPs using Geographic
         Information System (GIS) technologies,
        Introduction of the River Transport Improvement Pilot to explore ways of improving
         transportation in the jungle region, although many challenges were encountered; and
        Continuation of institutional strengthening at the national level (policy formulation,
         monitoring, and training) and at the municipal level (technical and planning capacities).

10.      One of the most successful components of this project was the pilot that established PRIs
for the management of rural roads at the provincial level. Municipalities already had offices
dedicated to managing primary and secondary roads, but they had none for rural roads. PRIs were
tasked with developing sufficient institutional capacities to successfully take over responsibilities
from Provias, and become the decentralized units in this sector. Over the five years of the SRRP,
108 PRIs were created, of which 36 reached full operational capabilities, significantly exceeding
the original expectations of the project. The typical responsibilities of a fully operational PRI
included: assisting in the preparation of Road Plans to systematically prioritize projects (71 were
prepared in total); conducting studies of many types; and co-financing and supporting routine
maintenance microenterprises. Overall, the rapid and successful adoption of the PRI model
demonstrated the ability and desire of local governments to manage their own infrastructure
assets, and in the process, it made the SRRP a trailblazer in the national decentralization agenda.

11.      The SRRP introduced several new complementary initiatives to further promote social
issues. LDWs were established in 85 districts to help catalyze community-led production
activities by helping them develop business plans and find financing. The SRRP also increased
the number of projects in the most isolated and poor areas of the country, increasing the number
of Road Committees and introducing a pilot program for improving waterborne transportation in
the jungle region. However, this pilot faced many challenges while operating in that remote area
of the country and was eventually discarded. The SRRP also included a Gender Action Plan that
promoted the involvement of women in all project activities. These efforts were quite successful.
By the end of the project, women accounted for 23% of microenterprises’ workforce and 24% of
Road Committee members.

Component 1: Improvement of Rural Transport Infrastructure.

1.      Road Rehabilitation: At closing, the program had rehabilitated 3,277 km of rural roads,
representing most of the revised target of 3,358 km. Most of these investments were prioritized at
the local level with participatory planning. These roads were generally in very poor condition
before the rehabilitation, requiring the surface to be reestablished, drainage systems constructed,
and slopes stabilized. Contracts were awarded competitively to private firms, and appropriate
supervision and safeguards were implemented. Rehabilitations were financed entirely with
Project resources, and were contracted and managed directly by Provias, since the Provincial
Road Institutes (PRIs) were assessed at that time as lacking the adequate capability to execute
these responsibilities. Future rural roads projects will have the objective of transferring these
responsibilities to PRIs as appropriate.




                          Figure 3-1: Rural Road Intervention Model

2.      Bridge Rehabilitation: The revised target was met with the rehabilitation of a 44-meter
bridge in the Department of Ancash.

Periodic Maintenance: The program performed periodic maintenance on 7,806 km of roads,
surpassing the revised target of 7,506 km. All of these roads had been rehabilitated in either the
First Rural Road Project (FRRP) or the Second Rural Road Project (SRRP). Periodic maintenance
consisted of reestablishing the gravel surface and adding appropriate quarried material as needed.
This work was contracted out competitively to small firms in the private sector, helping them
grow and bid on larger contracts in related fields. Originally, periodic maintenance was scheduled
to be performed every five years. However, recent experiences have demonstrated that in some
areas of the country—especially in the jungle region—it is necessary to perform this work more
frequently, even twice as much, due to heavy rains.

3.      Over the course of the Decentralized Rural Transport Project (DRTP), the management
and contracting of periodic maintenance was transferred to the PRIs as their capabilities grew. By
the end, 28 percent of all periodic maintenance kilometers had been managed by the PRIs with



                                                30
Project funds. After an initial learning curve, the quality of these activities and the performance of
their contracts were comparable to those managed centrally by Provias. This validated the ability
and interest of local governments in executing complex infrastructure works, and added fuel to
further decentralization reforms.

4.      Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) Track Improvement: As part of the Project,
2,444km of NMT tracks were improved, almost reaching the revised end target of 2,515 km.
Achieving this required a significant effort toward the end of the Project, since these activities
faced many delays caused by heavier-than-usual rainy seasons and higher costs. NMT tracks were
improved by contracting NGOs with local experience to work with these isolated communities on
the creation of Road Committees that would prioritize and execute these works. This often
involved widening platform, removing obstacles, improving drainage systems, building small
bridges, and building places for people to stay on multi-day trips.

5.       Improvements of Other Types of Rural Infrastructure in the Jungle Region: The
SRRP introduced a pilot with the goal of building docks to improve river transportation in the
jungle region of the country, which turned out to be unsuccessful due to the many difficulties
encountered in operations in these areas (challenging terrains, unfamiliar cultures, heavy rainy
seasons, etc.). Nonetheless, the DTRP sought to continue working in the jungle region through
regular planning and implementation channels. The Provincial Participatory Road Plans (PPRPs)
developed for provinces in this area identified particular transportation needs around the key river
and air channels that connect them to the rest of the country, and the potential for railroads to
significantly improve travel times and costs. These and other consultancy studies emphasized the


                                                             31
need for adapting to local conditions and building additional contingencies into the planning.
However, these ideas were received tepidly by Provias, given the earlier problems encountered
while working in this area, including issues with two road rehabilitation contracts that ended in
arbitrage in 2009.

6.      Moving forward, the Ministry of Transport and Communications’ policies in recent years
have increased the resources and strength of its Waterborne Transportation Office in order to
improve the navigability of large rivers in the country (most of them in the jungle region),
including the improvement of several ports. Most of the projects that originated from these efforts
are currently in the study and design stages. However, it is clear that the sector has prioritized
projects that connect large urban centers in the jungle and not afforded much attention to its rural
communities, which was one of the general goals of the DRTP. This remains an area where more
work could be done in the future.

7.      Pilot for Stabilization of Slopes and Protection against Erosion: In 2013, a local
university (Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina) performed an onsite study for Provias to
evaluate bioengineered solutions for stabilizing slopes along the Llapay-Laraos-Lima road.
Towards the end of the DTRP, the university submitted a proposal for the implementation of its
recommendations, which is currently being evaluated by Provias.

8.       The DRTP did not have routine maintenance as a subcomponent, since its financing was
transferred to the GoP (co-financed between municipalities/PRIs and district governments). This
was a gradual process that started during the SRRP. However, the DRTP did have the objective of
continuing to promote and strengthen the use of microenterprises and ensuring the high quality of
these microenterprises’ work.

9.      The Project was estimated to have created the jobs shown in Table 3-2.

Component 2: Institutional Development

The Project strengthened the institutional capabilities of the government at the central and local
levels in the context of the ongoing decentralization reforms. At the local and central levels, the
Project achieved:

10.      Strengthening Decentralized Planning: The Provincial Road Management Pilot,
introduced as part of the SRRP, had established 121 PRIs in 12 departments of the country, where
36 of them attained full implementation capacity. The DRTP grew and strengthened this
institutional model to encompass 188 PRIs, around 100 of them with full capacity.




                                                32
11.      One of the main responsibilities of PRIs was to plan rural road investments in their
jurisdictions through PPRPs. PRIs worked with consultants to develop a consensus on the
demand for transportation based on participatory workshops with local stakeholders and an
analysis of socioeconomic data. On the one hand, this demand was estimated both for
marginalized populations (the poorest and most isolated) and for economically productive
populations, emphasizing the potential for natural resource extraction. On the other hand, the
existing supply of transportation was determined by surveying the road network (including its
condition) using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). By crossing infrastructure supply with
demand, potential projects could be ranked using multi-criteria analyses of relevant factors. This
final prioritization was then validated with a technical working group and the results were
presented in the PPRPs. The DRTP assisted provinces throughout this process.

12.      Strengthening of the routine maintenance system with microenterprises : By the end
of the SRRP, there were 532 of these microenterprises maintaining 14,750 km of roads. The
contracting of these activities had been transferred to the PRIs and municipalities were
increasingly participating in their co-financing. The micro-entrepreneurs were essentially tasked
with using manual labor to fill potholes, clear vegetation, clean drainages, remove small
obstacles, and do general emergency work (especially during the rainy season). These
organizations were also required to maintain proper legal status by paying taxes, having bank
accounts, filing financial statements, developing internal operating procedures, and becoming
registered. Provias and the PRIs assisted the microenterprises in each of these steps, providing
detailed manuals for their work.

13.      The DRTP successfully expanded this system and fully decentralized its management to
the PRIs. At the beginning of the Project, it transferred their financing to the municipalities and
district governments (who received some funds through FONCODES). By the end of the DRTP,
there were 857 microenterprises maintaining 16,867 km of roads in 143 provinces. This
represented a creation of 325 new microenterprises, adding 3,250 one-year equivalent permanent
unskilled jobs.

14.     Mobilizing municipal financing for rural transport and the promotion of private
financing of rural transport: In promoting decentralization, the DRTP helped increase the
resources transferred by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to the municipalities for
transportation projects (mostly for routine maintenance). In 2007, this figure was US$140
million, and in 2011, it was $109 million. Through these transfers, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance has been the largest funder of rural transportation. However, the PRIs have been adept at
complementing these transfers with a variety of other sources. It is often the case that district
governments contribute from their small budgets for road maintenance (resources they receive
from FONCODES). In certain areas of the country, royalties from natural resource exploitation
have been used to fund roadwork. To a lesser extent, PRIs currently receive funds in relatively
small amounts from over 30 international and national aid funds.

15.      Strengthening local capacity to handle fiduciary and safeguard aspects: The
comprehensive institutional strengthening package provided to the PRIs included the
implementation of financial management, procurement, and environmental safeguards. For funds
to be transferred to them for the purpose of contracting out routine and periodic maintenance, the
Ministry of Economy and Finance implemented a rigorous set of rules to ensure the protection of
these funds.

16.      Scaling up the GIS Road Inventory: The SRRP introduced a pilot where two PRIs were
trained in GIS technologies and given assistance so they could develop an inventory of their rural


                                                33
road network. The pilot demonstrated that this technology could be used relatively cheaply to
enhance the planning process. The DRTP expanded the use of GIS to 164 PRIs, improving
coordination and information-sharing. These inventories also contained information about
demographics, the location of schools, hospitals, and information about the types of road
interventions performed in the past. Inventories were designed to fit together and be incorporated
for the tertiary network in the existing inventory of primary and secondary roads developed by
the MTC.

17.     Regulation and definition of policies for rural transport: The DRTP sought to begin
work on sector policies to institutionalize the progresses achieved in decentralization and rural
road management. However, little progress materialized in this area. It proved to be difficult for
Provias to achieve this engagement, since it required operating outside their operational level
functions. The follow-up project will attempt to address this at higher levels of government to
resolve broad policy issues that are currently threatening the sustainability of the project, such as
the contracting of routine maintenance microenterprises, the promotion of gender inclusion,
decentralization reforms, etc.

18.      Promotion of research and innovation in rural transport: The DRTP started several
initiatives for exploring ways to innovate in technical aspects, focusing on tailoring interventions
to different parts of the country, especially for regions that have frequent rainfall. This included
the Pilot for stabilization of slopes and the testing of a chemical additive in the Madre de Dios
region to better stabilize soils. More research is planned to be included in the follow-up project,
including a pilot for using low-cost pavements.

19.     By the end of these institutional reforms, the rural road sector in the country could be
represented by Figure 3-2.

Subcomponent 3.1: Local Development Window

20.       The SRRP introduced the LDW in 12 provinces as a way of helping rural producers
organize associations around specific income-generating activities (for example, agricultural
niches, fish farming, and eco-tourism), and provided technical and business assistance, including
facilitation in the securing of funding. Organizing rural producers also eliminated middlemen,
who often exacted high premiums for getting rural goods to local markets. A key feature of the
LDW was that it operated in areas that had benefited from the rural road projects, therefore
maximizing the impacts thereof.

21.      The DRTP expanded the LDW to 28 provinces and contracted out their operation
competitively to 15 NGOs. The LDW assisted and financed the preparation of 52 business plans
for rural producers’ associations (including 15 dairy, 8 livestock, 6 irrigation, 6 quinoa, 5 cacao,
and 5 coffee projects, among many others). Associations were also trained in technical aspects
and the commercialization of their products. Of these projects, 46 were funded through various
sources and were successfully implemented. Initiatives often leveraged different funding sources.

22.     In the DRTP, the LDW was given the additional responsibility of working with local
governments to promote territorial development strategies and serve as advocates for rural
populations. By the end of the Project, LDWs had helped municipalities prepare and approve 30
local economic development plans, 41 local ordinances, 13 resolutions, and 6 municipal
covenants. Many of these aimed at strengthening municipalities to become more actively
involved in promoting rural development. The LDW gave many presentations to municipal
governments, emphasizing the importance of having territorial development policies and
partnering with production sectors in rural areas. These lobbying efforts led to the creation of
municipal offices in 12 provinces dedicated to promoting local economic development (most
municipalities did not have these offices at the time). This engagement with local governments
sets the LDW apart from other programs implemented in the country to promote rural
development (such as ALIADOS and AGROIDEAS), and it helped the production initiatives to
often receive support from their local government after the contracts of the LDW had ended.

Subcomponent 3.2: Rural Infrastructure Pilot (RIP)

23.      The planning component of the RIP was relatively successful, but the implementation of
these plans in coordination with the other sectors proved to be quite challenging. By the end of
the DRTP, 15 Rural Infrastructure Plans (RIPs) had been prepared, meeting 100 percent of the
appraisal target. These plans combined a multi-criteria analysis with stakeholder input to
prioritize infrastructure investments across several sectors (roads, electrification, water,
telecommunications, irrigation, etc.) according to social, political, and economic factors
(emphasizing the latter). Despite signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the other sectors
(and the municipalities of the 15 provinces) and attempting to reach out on numerous occasions,
Provias was ultimately unsuccessful in achieving the level of cross-sectorial cooperation needed
to implement the RIPs concertedly. The other sectors desired additional funds from the Ministry
of Finance. In 2010, the role of facilitating coordination was transferred to the Presidencia del
Consejo de Ministros (PCM), although they were equally unsuccessful.

24.      Eventually, Provias executed 19 of the road projects prioritized by the RIPs (totaling
122 km) on its own. The other sectors also executed some of these projects, including 6 water
projects under the Agua para Todos program, 3 of the irrigation projects, several smaller
telecommunications projects, and various pre-investment studies. Peru invested significantly in
rural infrastructure over the course of the DRTP. A survey of people living near road


                                                35
rehabilitations in 2 of the 15 provinces of this Pilot (Vilcashuaman and Huacaybamba) showed
that the percentage of people with access to at least two basic infrastructure services (in addition
to the road rehabilitation) increased from 35.8% in 2006 to 95.4% in 2013 19 (these services
included: water, sanitation, and electrification) (300% of output target based on unbiased
information).

25.      Even though the RIPs were not implemented as expected, the principles and model of this
Pilot were used by the Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion to create a similar initiative
in 2013 called FONIE (Fondo Para La Inclusion Economica de Zonas Rurales in Spanish).
FONIE differs from the RIPs mainly in that it seeks to focus investments on 570 of the poorest
districts in the country, although both share the modality of pursuing enhanced benefits through
the bundling of infrastructure projects. Furthermore, laws have recently been passed to expedite
coordination between infrastructure sectors, such as Supreme Decree 004-2013-PCM.

26.     In balance, the RIP was successful at exploring the capability of various sectors of the
government for planning and coordinating across infrastructure sectors, socializing lessons
learned, and leading to the creation of a new governmental program.

                                  Economic and Financial Analysis
1.      An ex-ante economic evaluation of four representative intervention types from the
Decentralized Rural Transport Project (DRTP) was conducted in the Project Appraisal Document
PAD. These interventions were defined as: the rehabilitation and maintenance of roads with less
than 15 Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), with AADT between 15 and 50, with AADT
higher than 50, and the improvement of Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) tracks 20 . A Cost
Benefit Analysis (CBA) was performed using the Road Economic Decision (RED) model on
these representative interventions, with the exception of roads with AADT higher than15 which
were analyzed using a Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA). This was done to allow for the
consideration of roads interventions with primarily social objectives. An ex-post economic
evaluation was conducted that consisted of: (i) reviewing the CBA and CEA performed on a
sample of pre-investment feasibility studies prepared during project implementation, and (ii)
redoing the representative ex-ante CBA and CEA evaluations using actual data on project costs
and benefits, including the results of the latest Impact Evaluation study.

Ex-Ante Economic Evaluation

2.       The economic evaluations were stratified by level of development to allow for social
considerations. Rehabilitating high-traffic roads is likely to accrue more economic benefits than
low-traffic roads, especially in productivity gains. However, low-traffic roads might serve a
critical role in reducing the isolation of some communities and providing them access to basic
services. For roads with less than 15 AADT, a CEA indicator was estimated as the costs of these
interventions per beneficiary population, which included anyone living within 2.5 km to either
side of the road. Costs were estimated based on the present value of investments, supervision,
environmental mitigation, and maintenance over a 10-year horizon.

3.      For roads with more than 15 AADT and NMT tracks, a CBA was performed using the
RED model developed by the World Bank for evaluating investment alternatives for rural roads.
This model uses a “consumer surplus” approach to calculate project benefits from user savings
(vehicle operating costs, passenger time costs, and accident costs), following vehicle speed and
cost relationships from the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4). The
characteristics of the roads and other contextual factors were also inputs. The evaluation assumed
a 10-year horizon and considered a discount rate of 14 percent.

4.       The results of the ex-ante evaluation found in Table 4-1 indicate that, for each road class,
the Project was expected to have a satisfactory Economic Rate of Return (ERR). To estimate the
ERR for the whole Project, it was necessary to approximate the proportion of investments in each
road class. This was done through an analysis of how the planning methodology of the Project
was likely to be implemented, considering several evaluation criteria and their valuations. Using
these, it was estimated that the Project would have an ERR of 29.2 percent with a Net Present
Value (NPV) of US$13.91 million. A sensitivity analysis involving increased costs by 20 percent
and decreased benefits by 20 percent yielded an ERR of 16.2 percent, which is still satisfactory



20
   These interventions were expected to account for 94 percent of the civil works investments of the project. The
rehabilitation of bridges was not analyzed because the parameters of these interventions had not been defined by that
point.

evaluation, see the tables in the following sections and the PAD.

Feasibility Report Economic Evaluations

5.       During the implementation of the Project, economic evaluations were performed for most
of the road rehabilitations and NMT track improvements. A survey was conducted of around 30
percent of these to compare them to the ex-ante analysis and provide some information on the
variability of the economic efficiency of subprojects. Figure 4-1 shows that rehabilitation costs
were skewed upwardly by a small amount of expensive projects, often in the jungle parts of the
country, where road work was affected by heavy rains and other complications.

        Figure 4-1: Distribution of Rehabilitation Costs (Sample of Pre-Investment Studies)

6.      For rural roads with more than 15 AADT, the feasibility reports calculated an EER. As
can be seen in Figure 4-2a, most of these calculations were favorable (higher than the discount
rate, which was assumed to be 14 percent in the PAD), although to a lesser extent than estimated
in the PAD. This reflects the higher-than-expected intervention costs of the Project. For roads
with less than 15 AADT, the reports estimated the costs per beneficiary, which were also
favorable.

7.      For the improvement of NMT tracks, the feasibility reports estimated the costs per
beneficiary. From the figure below, it may be observed that these were more favorable than for
road rehabilitations, as expected. Most of the costs of these improvements remained in the range
of US$2,000-3,000/km, but the average was biased upwardly by a few very expensive projects.
This was also the case with road rehabilitations, which suggests that more careful project
selection could reduce costs significantly.

Ex-Post Economic Evaluation

8.      An ex-post economic evaluation of the Project was conducted (by a local consultant) to
determine the economic efficiency of its investments. This analysis followed the methodology of
the ex-ante evaluation, but with actual data on costs and impacts. The cost data summarized in
Table 4-2 was obtained by analyzing final contracted costs for different types of civil works.
These figures differ slightly from the average costs reported elsewhere because they include
overruns and other issues not financed by the Project. It is clear from this table that actual costs
were substantially higher than anticipated in the PAD, which was partially accounted for in the
2010 project restructuring.

 9.      Road user costs were estimated for the five motorized vehicle types indicated in Table 4-
 3. This table shows that most of the unit costs increased considerably over the years based on a
 variety of data sources (if specific evidence was not available, cost parameters were inflated using
 aggregate indices). On the other hand, there is little evidence that the utilization and loading
 parameters changed decisively one way or the other. The value of time for car passengers was
 estimated at US$2.67 per hour, based on an average income of 1,638 soles per month, 176
 working hours per month, 70 percent work-related trips, and non-work time being valued at 25
 percent of work time. For bus and truck passengers, the monthly income was assumed to be 750
 soles with the same assumptions as for car passengers. For pedestrians on NMT tracks or rural
 roads, the value of time was estimated at US$0.73 per hour based on an average income of 25
 soles per day, 176 working hours per month, 50 percent of trips being work-related, and non-
 working time being valued at zero. The average cost of accidents is assumed to remain the same
 as in the ex-ante evaluation, at US$100,000 per death, US$5,000 per injury, and US$500 for
 material damages only.

 10.     The economic evaluation also incorporated the results of an Impact Evaluation study
 conducted in 2013, which surveyed thousands of households within the area of influence of
 selected project roads and other control roads with similar characteristics (a similar analysis was
 also done for NMT tracks). This study found that road rehabilitations increased automobile traffic
 by 58 percent, changing the composition of vehicles on the roads. However, this was not
 considered in the economic evaluation, since its effect would likely be marginal, and was already
 captured to some extent in the assumptions specified for induced demand. It was assumed that
 automobile travel has a price elasticity of 2.0 and truck and bus travel have a price elasticity of
 0.5. These were the same assumptions used in the ex-ante evaluation.

 11.      The Impact Evaluation study also found other benefits that were not explicitly
 incorporated into the economic analysis for various reasons. It found that the number of days with
 road closure decreased by 55.6 percent, but it was unclear how this could be translated into the
 traditional benefits summed up by the RED model. A road closure could imply that certain types
 of vehicles would be affected more than others, or that alternative routes are being used instead.
 Translating this into reductions in costs or travel times was impossible, given the information
 available. Additionally, the Impact Evaluation study also found that the Project had large positive
 impacts on production, such as an 8.5 percent increase in hours worked; a 33.8 percent increase in
 land cultivation; and a 15 to 20 percent increase in livestock holdings. However, because the
 consumer surplus approach was used to account for benefits and costs, these secondary benefits
 were not considered in the analysis. They are added implicitly in the value of time parameters
 specified for passenger and cargo transport.

 12.     For the medium- and high-volume roads and NMT tracks, the CBA assumed a planning
 horizon of 10 years. The results are shown in Table 4-5. The rehabilitation of medium-volume
 roads had an ERR of 47 percent; rehabilitation of high-volume roads had an ERR of 61 percent;

and the improvement of NMT tracks had an ERR of 67 percent. The NPV was also calculated
assuming a 14 percent interest rate to compare with the values obtained in the ex-ante analysis.

13.      The ex-post ERRs were considerably higher than those estimated in the ex-ante analysis
shown in Table 4-1. This was caused by: (i) transportation costs being much higher than
anticipated; and (ii) the value of time for passenger travel being almost twice as high as expected.
Both of these resulted from the strong growth of the Peruvian economy over the last decade,
which raised living standards and increased the prices of resources. This gave the improvements
in transportation costs and speeds predicted by the RED model higher benefits than expected:
basic transportation infrastructure was valued more. This effect was strong enough that it more
than compensated for the increase in the investment costs of the interventions. In other words, the
reasons that led the Project to cost more in fact also caused its benefits to society to be valued
more.

14.      For the low-volume roads, the CEA also assumed a planning horizon of 10 years. It
considered the net present value of costs relating to: road rehabilitations; periodic maintenance;
and routine maintenance. The number of beneficiaries was also estimated from pre-investment
studies. The cost effectiveness was calculated at US$30.20/person.

15.    Table 4-6 shows a sensitivity analysis on project costs and benefits. For the most
unfavorable scenario, the Project would still have a satisfactory ERR.

1.      A study was conducted in 2013 to evaluate the impacts of the Decentralized Rural
Transport Project (DRTP). Previously, three similar studies were conducted to assess the First
Rural Roads Project (FRRP) and the Second Rural Roads Project (SRRP). This section discusses
the results of the 2013 study in the context of these earlier findings. It also provides a brief
overview of the research literature on the impacts of rural road interventions throughout the
world. Details of this impact evaluation are found in the Final Report “Elaboración de la
Evaluación de Impacto y Ampliación de la Línea Base del Programa de Transporte Rural
Descentralizado – Informe Final”, prepared in 2014 by Macroconsult-Cuanto.

Literature Review

2.       Impact on Transportation Conditions. Road improvement programs have the most
direct impacts on transportation conditions: travel costs, travel times, safety, and reliability. These
direct impacts represent the main channels through which higher levels of social and economic
objectives can be achieved, leading their thorough estimation to be fundamental to the correct
interpretation of the results. Indeed, there is vast evidence that transportation conditions improve
after the rehabilitation or improvement of rural roads (Lucas, Davis and Rikard, 1996; Guimares
and Uhl, 1997; Bakht, 2000; Levy, 2004; Khandker et al, 2011). However, their impact on safety
is inconclusive, as few studies have considered this variable, and there is the potential for
increases in speed-related accidents to offset the benefits of having more predictable roadways.
To better understand this, more research is needed in this area.

3.       Impact on Access to Public Services. There is also substantial evidence that
improvements to the transportation conditions of rural communities increase their accessibility to
public services. This effect has been observed to be significant for access to education centers in a
variety of circumstances. Levy (2004) found increases in school attendance and improvements in
the quality of education in rural Morocco, especially for girls. This finding was echoed by
Khandker et al (2006) for the paving of rural roads in Bangladesh, although in this case, older
girls benefited more. Similarly, Mu and Van de Walle (2007) observed increases in graduation
rates in Vietnam, and Bell and Van Dillen (2012) observed reductions in school absences in
eastern India.

4.       Improving rural roads has also been observed to increase health accessibility in: Ghana
(Porter, 2002), Georgia (Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005), Malaysia (Windle and Cramb, 1996), and
other Asian countries (Hettige, 2006). However, just as in schooling, there is evidence that
benefits accrue differently across gender (Bravo, 2002).

5.      Another dimension where road improvement projects have had positive impacts has been
the improvement of public service quality, especially in attracting better teachers and doctors to
work in rural areas (Levy 2004).

6.       Impact on Production Activities. Both the improvement of transportation conditions
and the increased access to public services should affect rural productivity positively. For one,
there is strong evidence (Liu, 2000; Escobal, 2000; Iguíñiz and Francke, 2006) that improving
transportation conditions reduces the bargaining power of the intermediaries who commercialize
the products of small rural farmers, decreasing the share of the se intermediaries’ revenues, to the

benefit of the farmers. Also, farmed area where agriculture may be profitable was observed to
increase (Van de Walle, 2008). Devres Inc. (1980) and Gannon and Liu (1997) found that
improving roads also incentivized the industrialization of agriculture, which resonates with
Binswanger et al (1993), who found that the improved profitability of agriculture, including from
the reduction of post-harvest losses in transportation, leads to greater use of modern technologies
and processes. Despite this positive evidence for some of the factors of rural productivity,
estimates of the impact of road rehabilitations on aggregate productivity have been relatively
weak, with many studies showing no improvements at all, or mixed results at best.

7.       Impact on Employment. Road improvement projects have a small but important direct
effect on rural employment (Howe, 2005; COWIS, 2008), and can have a broader indirect effect
by increasing labor supply, through improved education and health care; and labor demand,
through improved productivity (Jacoby, 2000; Smith et al, 2001; Lanjouw et al, 2001; Quizón and
Sparrow, 2001; de Janvry and Sadoulet, 2001). There is also evidence of employment
diversification toward more skilled jobs (Hine and Riverson, 1982; Rand, 2011).

8.        Impact on Income and Expenditures. The empirical evidence on the effect of rural road
interventions on incomes, expenditures, and poverty is largely inconclusive. One hypothesis for
this is that it is likely necessary to also make complementary territorial development investments
in order to achieve significant impacts on these key indicators (Escobal and Torero, 2005).
Having an adequate transportation system might be required for meaningful rural development,
but this alone may not be enough—there are other constraints holding back the improvement of
incomes and expenditures (Hettige, 2006). A second explanation could be that these fundamental
impacts occur over time horizons that are long and that the econometric methodologies
commonly used to estimate them are inadequate. There are simply too many confounding
variables that change over time, obfuscating any potential structural improvement in income and
expenditures. The data requirements for the proper estimation of these impacts are probably
unrealistically high, or alternatively, the assumptions required to interpret the results are too
optimistic.

9.      The estimation of impacts on incomes and expenditures is further complicated by the
great heterogeneity of such impacts observed in some studies (Ahmed and Hossain, 1990; Jacoby,
2000; COWIS, 2008; Khander and Koolwal, 2011). Different segments of rural populations have
been affected very differently, especially across different levels of human and physical capital.
This requires the estimation to be more detailed, and makes results more difficult to interpret.
Even if these impacts are accurately measured, there would still be significant distributional
considerations that would be hard to assess and translate into policy recommendations.

10.      Evaluation Methodologies. Most these studies have used the difference-in-differences
methodology for estimating impacts of interest (unless the lack of panel data only permitted a
simple cross-sectional comparison instead). In brief, this involves comparing how an impact
variable changed after a road improvement in a treated group to how it changed in a control
group. The adequacy of this methodology depends critically on how well the control group
represents the counter-factual changes that would have taken place in the treated group without
the road improvement. Recently, there have been several studies (Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005;
Rand 2011; Mu and Van de Walle, 2011) that have used matching techniques to statistically
select the best controls based on their observable characteristics. This approach has generally led
to a more robust estimation of impacts. Instrumental variables estimators have been used less
frequently because of the inherent difficulties in finding adequate exogenous instruments in these
circumstances (Dercon, 2009).

Evaluation of Peru Rural Roads Projects

11.      The Peru Rural Roads Projects have dedicated considerable resources and effort to
evaluating their progress toward their development objectives. As shown in Table 6-1, about
6,000 households have been surveyed since the year 2000, asking them a variety of questions
about how their living conditions and opinions have changed over time. These surveys followed
the difference-in-differences methodology, where half were conducted near areas intervened by
the projects and the rest in control areas that had no scheduled interventions (except for the first
Impact Evaluation study conducted in 2000 because of the lack of ex-ante data). These controls
were selected based on qualitative criteria that sought an adequate counter-factual for the
intervened areas. Households were asked about their transportation habits, employment, assets,
expenses, quality of life, and access to public services (schools and healthcare institutions),
among other information. Both households near rural roads and Non-Motorized Transport (NMT)
tracks were surveyed.

12.     Based on the review of the literature above, these studies attempted to quantify the
various mechanisms through which road improvements potentially lead to successively higher-
level impacts. The direct improvements in transportation conditions expected in the short term
would serve as the main channels for improving the accessibility of rural communities to public
services and economic opportunities in the medium term. This could be represented in terms of
health consultations, school attendance, and employment. Finally, these improvements would be
expected to have long-term impacts on incomes and poverty. The objective of the studies was to
estimate this progressive chain of impacts, as illustrated in Error! Reference source not found.
6-2.

13.       The first Impact Evaluation study was conducted in 2000 using a cross-sectional
methodology that only compared households near control roads and treated roads after the
interventions, because ex-ante data had not been collected (Instituto Cuánto 2000). While keeping
in mind the potential biases that could result in this type of study, it was found that transportation
conditions had indeed improved considerably after the FRRP (travel times, costs, safety,
reliability, etc.), and that this had likely led to improvements in the accessibility of healthcare and
education. An opinion poll that was also conducted reinforced these findings. The households
surveyed in 2000 were surveyed again in 2004 in an attempt to quantify longer-term effects of the
FRRP. These results generally echoed the findings of the earlier Impact Evaluation, and it was
not possible to observe changes in income or poverty, perhaps due to the relatively short
observation window. One main limitation of these two early studies was that they did not report
the standard errors of the parameter estimates, which made it impossible to determine the

statistical significance of these findings. For this reason, the results of these two studies are not
discussed further.

Summary of 2006 Impact Evaluation Study

14.      The Impact Evaluation study performed in 2006 by GRADE (2007) had the following
two objectives: (i) use new ex-ante household data collected in 2004 and ex-post data collected in
2006 to evaluate the short-term impacts of the SRRP; and (ii) resurvey the households that took
part in the 2004 Impact Evaluation study of the FRRP (households first surveyed in 2000) to
assess the sustainability of these earlier results. This summary focuses on the results of the former
analysis, because it represents a clean evaluation of a road intervention program; the latter
analysis is difficult to interpret without delving into the results of the 2004 Impact Evaluation
study, which are inconclusive in any case due to the lack of estimation of standard errors.

15.      A difference-in-differences methodology was used in the evaluation of the SRRP, and in
this case the statistical significance of the results was reported. Of the households surveyed in
2004, 82 percent were successfully found in 2006. The results of this analysis primarily showed
that there is a wide heterogeneity in the accrual of benefits, depending on the characteristics of
particular interventions and the different population segments affected. Keeping this in mind, a
couple of common threads in the results indicated that the SRRP had the following short-term
impacts:

  (i)   A large improvement in transportation conditions, especially for NMT tracks;
  (ii)  An improvement in school enrollment and attendance where rural roads where
        intervened, with important gender-specific responses;
  (iii) A large improvement in health access where NMT tracks were improved, also with
        important gender-specific responses;
  (iv) An increase in unpaid family-related work (in agriculture and forestry) where NMT
        tracks were improved, and a general transition from informal employment to formal
        employment where rural roads were improved;
  (v) Mixed impacts on agricultural productivity (cultivated area, livestock production,
        mechanization, and access to credit services);



                                                 48
  (vi)  A significant increase in income where NMT tracks were improved, with a sharp
        diversification of income sources, but little improvement in income where rural roads
        were intervened; and
  (vii) A significant reduction in poverty where NMT tracks were improved, but no reduction in
        poverty where rural roads were intervened.

16.    In addition to these specific findings, there were three broad key conclusions that could
be drawn from these results:

        Improving NMT tracks can have substantial short-terms impacts on the communities that
         depend on them, including on their income and poverty levels. On the other hand, the
         rehabilitation of rural roads might not be enough to fully catalyze rural development,
         requiring complementary investments under a broader territorial development program to
         achieve these higher-level impacts. However, it is also possible that the observation
         window of this study (from 2004 to 2006) was too short to capture these types of impacts.
        There is significant heterogeneity in the incidence of benefits from rural roads projects,
         which has important policy implications. For example, women/girls and men/boys
         benefited differently in access to healthcare and education, households transitioned
         between different income and employment sources, and fares and freight tariffs
         responded differently for different vehicle types. Observing impacts at the aggregate level
         would miss important details about the mechanisms and incidence of benefit accrual.
        It is important to establish a clear outcome chain that differentiates between short-term
         and long-term impacts to adequately interpret the results. Additionally, it is likely that
         longer observation windows are needed to quantify the entirety of this outcome chain.

Methodology of the 2013 Impact Evaluation Study

17.      At the end of the DRTP in 2013, another Impact Evaluation study was conducted by
Macroconsult-Cuanto (2014). It consisted of resurveying households that had originally been
surveyed in 2004 and 2006 (and collecting village-level data), and seeing how control groups
differed in various socioeconomic indicators from groups that lived near road rehabilitations. The
households in the 2004 survey were intervened by the SRRP (from 2004 to 2006), while those in
the 2006 survey were intervened in the DRTP (from 2006 onward). However, the intervention
strategy was essentially the same for these two projects, so the impact results are presented jointly
in this summary (this helped deal with the loss of data from certain inadequate controls). The
original evaluation design involved using a simple difference-in-differences estimator to compare
changes in control groups to those in intervened groups, similarly to what had been done in the
2006 Impact Evaluation study. However, this approach faced the following methodological
issues:

        Household Attrition: One of the main strengths of this study was that it had an
         observation window of 8-10 years, which was much longer than for the 2006 Impact
         Evaluation study (or other similar studies elsewhere). This promised to allow the
         estimation of long-term effects on key development indicators. However, this long
         observation window significantly increased the proportion of households from the
         baseline years that could not be found in the 2013 survey. Around 47 percent and 40
         percent of the households from the 2004 and 2006 surveys were not found, respectively.
         If the causes of this attrition are similar between control groups and intervened groups,
         then the difference-in-differences methodology would control for this. However, there
         was some compelling evidence that a significant proportion of this attrition was
         systematic, in that those households that benefited the most from the rural roads projects


                                                 49
            had a higher tendency to move, negatively biasing the results. Also, if either the control
            group or treated group had a higher initial concentration of people that were more likely
            to move, biased results would also be obtained.

           Confounding Variables: Rural Peru has undergone an unprecedented transformation in
            the last decade, with large government investments in public services and infrastructure
            contributing to rapid improvements in income and poverty. Since the observation window
            of this study was relatively long, it was likely that these exogenous time-dependent
            variations would bias the results. Future projects should weigh the benefits of using long-
            term studies to capture impacts on key development metrics with the downside of having
            to control for more and more factors and potentially not find robust impacts at all.

           Inadequate Controls: The most critical step in the difference-in-differences analysis is
            selecting control groups that properly represent the counterfactual of the intervened
            groups. The roads corresponding to the control and treated groups were selected when the
            surveys were first conducted in 2004 and 2006, using a subjective comparison of several
            characteristics that were thought to be important, such as: length, having no intersecting
            roads, being in the same region, etc. This approach led to the following two problems.
            First, it assumed that control roads were not going to be intervened outside of the
            program, which ended up being a poor assumption. An engineering survey of half of the
            “control roads” found that 8 had been improved (better than rehabilitation), 10 had been
            rehabilitated, 3 had other lesser interventions, and only 21 had not been intervened at all.
            Therefore, using all of these roads as controls in the difference-in-differences analysis
            would have led to odd results—with considerable uncertainty—that would have been
            hard to interpret. A second issue with this approach was that the simple subjective
            analysis used to select control groups was likely missing important characteristics
            correlated with the impact results.

18.      Initial difference-in-differences estimates indeed indicated that these three issues were
negatively impacting the results. To mitigate the inadequate controls issue, which was arguably
the most critical, it was decided to drop control groups that had been intervened outside of the
program (21) or that had not been part of the engineering survey (42). This left 21 control
groups/roads that had not been intervened. These were used to represent the counterfactual
scenario in the analysis. In order to make the most out of the remaining information, and correct
for biases in the assignment of controls, a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) methodology was
used to find the most adequate controls in the difference-in-differences framework. Similar
approaches have been used by recent studies (Lokshin and Yemtsov, 2005; Rand, 2011; Mu and
Van de Walle, 2011) that have obtained better results than earlier studies that just used difference-
in-differences. Briefly, this approach consisted of assigning each observation (control and treated)
with a probability of having been intervened that is modeled based on observable characteristics
(the propensity score), and weighting the control group using these probabilities following Hirano
et al (2003).21 The end result is that the analysis assigned a greater weight to those controls that
are the most similar to the treated group (higher propensity score), and forced those in the control
or treated groups with very high or very low probabilities of treatment to be dropped from the
dataset (keeping only those with “common support”). In the end, 18 roads were identified to
control for 79 roads that were treated.



21
     This approach is described in the Impact Evaluation Handbook of the World Bank (Khandker et al, 2010).




                                                          50
       19.      The propensity score was modeled using a logit formulation and included explanatory
       variables that described the characteristics of the households, public expenditures per district, and
       climate factors, among others. Using this to weight the difference-in-differences greatly improved
       the quality of the results, with most of the impacts being significant and having interpretable
       signs. However, there were a few impact variables that showed interpretable changes, but were
       still insignificant because of the relatively small size of the sample that remained after
       inappropriate control groups were removed.

       20.      One source of bias that was not directly corrected by PSM was the systematic attrition of
       households. PSM helps control for this to the extent that attrition is correlated with observable
       factors in the baseline year. By matching households along income and other factors, PSM
       ensures that the baseline causes of migration are similar across treated and control groups.
       However, PSM does not correct for those causes of attrition that might be correlated with the
       treatment. The predominant hypothesis is that those households that benefited the most in
       accumulating human and physical capital from the road interventions are the ones that are most
       likely to move in search of better opportunities, because they will be better able to participate in
       labor and goods markets. To the extent that this hypothesis represents reality—which cannot be
       tested because of the inability to have data from the households that moved —it will bias impact
       results negatively. The households that stayed in intervened groups would be poorer and worse
       off in many aspects. Therefore, while the evaluation methodology does not correct for this
       potentially important source of bias, its effect would only be to decrease the positive impacts
       found. This, combined with the truncation of the dataset, implies that the results obtained
       represent conservative estimates of the impacts, which would likely be even greater and more
       significant if a more robust evaluation had been performed.

      22.      The impact on transportation conditions of rehabilitating and maintaining roads can be
      found in Table 6-3. Foremost, travel times were observed to decrease consistently, although for
      some trip purposes the magnitude of these changes was not statistically significant. Travel times
      decreased for students to reach schools and for farmers to reach points of sale for their products,
      especially for selling at consolidation centers. Little to no change was observed for travel to
      workplaces or health centers, which could reflect people accessing better jobs or health centers
      farther away, potentially in nearby urban centers. These travel time estimates were obtained using
      household surveys. Travel time data was also collected at the village level, but it was not
      statistically useful (contained a lot of unexplained variation). The number of days of road closures
      was observed to decrease. No impact was found on transportation prices for passenger or freight,
      with the exception of a large decrease in bus fares. Even though it is plausible to have reductions
      greater than 100 percent because the comparisons are relative to a counterfactual scenario, in this
      case the change in bus fares is too large to be interpretable. However, these estimations also came
      from data collected at the village level, which had been proven unreliable in the travel time
      estimations. No changes in accident rates were found. Finally, these improvements in
      transportation conditions induced a significant increase only in automobile traffic.

   23.      The improvement of transportation conditions to schools was found to have caused an
   increase in school enrollment for boys and girls between 12 and 18 years of age. The impact on
   the schooling of younger children was not estimated because its initial proportion was very high
   and did not have much variation—it is the older students who are at a greater risk of dropping out
   or being pulled out by their parents. The 2006 Impact Evaluation also found that children ages 12
   to 18 benefited the most from road rehabilitations in terms of school attendance, with boys
   benefiting noticeably more. The improvement in transportation conditions also seemed to have
   increased the number of health consultations given illness, although not in as statistically
   significant a way as for school enrollment. The 2006 Impact Evaluation did not find any changes
   in health outcomes.

   24.      The impact of road rehabilitations on employment was generally difficult to assess. There
   was a decrease in households with someone employed (by someone else), but this was not
   matched by increases in self-employment or unpaid family work. Similarly, a reduction in service
   sector employment was observed but without corresponding increases in employment in other
   sectors. An increase in the number of hours worked per week was found, but without a
   corresponding increase in incomes. The methodologies for estimating these types of impacts
   should be reexamined given these mixed results. The 2006 Impact evaluation did find a transition
   of employment from informal to formal sectors, but this was not sustained in the results of the
   latest Impact Evaluation.

   25.       Even though large changes in rural employment were not observed, the structure of the
   rural economy was observed to have changed significantly, as may be seen in Table 6-5. Large
   increases in the land used for cultivation and forestry were matched by large decreases in the land
   left fallow. This likely resulted from farmers increasing yields in the short-term to benefit from
   higher product prices seen in Table 6-7. The higher prices may have been caused by farmers
   increasing their sales to consolidation centers, which have access to wider markets and can
   command more favorable prices. One factor contributing to this was the significant decrease in
   travel times to consolidation centers observed in Table 6-3. Additionally, a large and consistent
   increase in livestock holdings was observed in intervened groups, which reflects increased
   investing.

   26.      Table 6-7 shows that road interventions had a major positive impact on reducing extreme
   poverty and increasing expenditures. They were also observed to cause reductions in structural
   poverty (UBN), which is a measure of the proportion of the population that has basic needs met.
   These results are encouraging, since few past studies have found robust impacts on poverty, even
   using the same difference-in-differences methodology with PSM. One of the advantages of this
   study is that it had an observation window of 10 to 8 years, which allowed for the estimation of
   long-term impacts. The previous Impact Evaluation study did not find any of these impacts, since
   it had only had an observation window of 2 years.

  Results of 2013 Impact Evaluation: NMT Track Improvement

  27.      The 2013 Impact Evaluation also surveyed control and intervened households to estimate
  the impacts of improving NMT tracks. Unlike in the analysis of rural roads, where a high
  proportion of controls had been intervened outside the program, the controls in this analysis were
  judged to be adequate because local governments do not currently improve NMT tracks on their
  own. As such, it was decided that a simple difference-in-differences methodology would be
  sufficient to estimate the corresponding impacts—the PSM technique was not needed in this case.
  Only a fixed effects parameter was added at the village level to capture the average differences
  between households associated with different villages. Overall, this analytical methodology did
  not prove to be as successful as that used for analyzing rural road interventions. Most of the
  estimates were weak or uninterpretable, especially for higher-level impacts. In hindsight,
  applying PSM would have likely improved these results considerably by controlling for
  differences in observable characteristics between control and intervened groups. Nonetheless,
  there are a couple of conclusions that may be drawn from this analysis. Note that indicators not
  included in the following tables do not show statistically significant impacts.

  28.      The improvement of NMT tracks did indeed cause reductions in travel times to most
  destinations for the data collected at the village level and the household level (the 2006 Impact
  Evaluation did not find significant reductions in travel times). The largest reductions were found
  in travel times to reach district and provincial capitals, saving over an hour for communities that
  use these tracks. The percent changes in this indicator are comparable to those found for rural
  roads, but because travel on these tracks is much slower, it represents much larger savings of time
  in absolute terms. This analysis also found that travel times to schools increased, perhaps because
  students are increasingly accessing better school in nearby towns.

  29.      The significant reduction in travel times to healthcare centers likely contributed to the
  sharp increase in health consultations observed in Table 6-9 (similar to the 2006 Impact
  Evaluation). Another factor that probably contributed to this was the increasing availability of
  health centers in these rural villages. Overall, men tended to benefit more than women in health
  access. On the other hand, no improvement in school enrollment was observed, also similar to the
  2006 Impact Evaluation. In terms of access to private services, these communities benefited from
  greater availability of local radio stations and TV channels, and from a greater number of
  commercial establishments. This last benefit may have been caused by the improvement of NMT
  tracks, expanding the markets that local commercial establishments could reach and leading them
  to become more profitable.

  30.      The 2006 Impact Evaluation found significant increases in incomes and reductions in
  poverty from NMT track improvements. However, this was not the case in the latest Impact
  Evaluation. In fact, this evaluation found no substantive changes in any economic indicator,
  including agricultural productivity and employment. This may have been caused by deficiencies
  in the control group, similar to what initially occurred in the analysis of rural roads. This strongly
  suggests that future Impact Evaluations should combine the difference-in-differences
  methodology with PSM to mitigate these types of issues and provide better results. Another factor
  that could have caused these results is that NMT tracks have not received adequate maintenance
  following their improvement, which was originally a point of emphasis in the DRTP but was




                                                                 57
  dropped because it proved very difficult to achieve. This inevitably left most tracks to degrade
  quickly, such that by 2013, their conditions resembled those of control tracks.

  Conclusions of Impact Evaluation Study

  31.     The rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads had the following impacts relative to
  the counterfactual scenario:

    (i)     A reduction in travel times to some reference points, but not all. Household-level data
            was considerably more reliable than village-level data. The 2006 Impact Evaluation
            observed a larger and more consistent reduction in travel times, probably because these
            surveys were conducted just 1-2 years after road rehabilitations.
    (ii)    No increase in bus and truck traffic (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation), both for data
            collected from vehicle counts and from surveys of village leaders. This could be the
            result of the demand for these modes being relatively inelastic. However, a large increase
            in automobile traffic was observed.
    (iii) A large increase in school enrollment for boys and girls between 12 and 18 years of age
          (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation). This was associated with decreases in travel times to
          schools for this group.
    (iv)    Some improvement in health accessibility in the long-term (the 2006 Impact Evaluation
            found no impact in the short-term), although less noticeable than for schools.
    (v)     A large decrease in travel times to consolidation centers led farmers to increasingly sell
            their products at these locations, since they can command higher prices through access to
            wider markets.
    (vi)    A large increase in cultivated land area (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation) and livestock
            holdings.
    (vii) A mixed impact on employment (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation).
    (viii) A large impact on reducing extreme poverty and structural poverty (UBN), and
           increasing per capita expenditures. These are the types of long-term impacts that could
           not have been captured by the earlier Impact Evaluations.

  32.     The improvement of NMT tracks had the following impacts relative to the counterfactual
  scenario:




                                                                 58
(i)    A large reduction in travel times, especially in absolute terms, for reaching most
       destinations, with the exception of schools. The 2006 Impact Evaluation did not observe
       these impacts.
(ii)   A large increase in accessibility to healthcare centers, with no improvement in
       accessibility to schools (similar to 2006 Impact Evaluation).
(iii) A large increase in the availability of private and public services, including commercial
      establishments.
(iv)   A shift of land used from fallow to cultivation, similar to the effect witnessed in rural
       road interventions.
(v)    No impact on incomes, poverty, rural productivity, and employment (unlike the 2006
       Impact Evaluation, which found improvements in these, including poverty).

                    Stakeholders Workshop on Institutional Lessons


1.      Background. On May 23, a Workshop on Institutional Lessons from the Rural Roads
Projects was carried out as part of a WB and IDB supervision mission, and attended by key
members of the Executive Director’s Office and other management units of Provias
Descentralizado and the banks’ team.

2.      Objective. The objective of the workshop was to: (i) draw lessons learned from the
implementation of the Decentralized Rural Transport Project - P095570 (DTRP), and Regional
Transport Decentralization Project - P078813 (RTDP); (ii) identify institutional risks in the
operation and management of Provias in order to provide sustainability to rural roads programs in
the medium and long term; (iii) propose mitigation measures to reduce, prevent, monitor, and
address potential risks during the design, implementation, operation, and supervision of potential
projects with decentralized implementation funded by the Government of Peru.

3.      Methodology. The workshop’s methodology was to divide it into two parts, the first for
the identification of the lessons learned and the second for the identification of risks and
mitigation measures applicable to future operations. The participants were requested to perform
hands-on work. A summary of the methodologies are briefly explained below.

4.      First Part: Lessons Learned. As a first step toward identifying and organizing the
lessons learned, the following areas of analysis were established for the three basic stages of a
project’s life: design, implementation, and operation.
    Design Stage: (i) decentralized project implementation arrangements; (ii) road network
      management and planning model; (iii) governance; and (iv) institutional strengthening of
      subnational governments.
    Implementation Stage: (i) performance management, systems, and processes; (ii) financial
      resources; (iii) institutional strengthening at national, regional, and provincial levels; (iv)
      evaluation of the Provincial Road Institutes (PRIs); (v) maintenance with microenterprises;
      (vi) monitoring and accountability; (vii) fiduciary aspects; and (viii) social, environmental,
      and gender areas.
    Operating Stage: (i) the relationship between the Ministry of Transports and
      Communications (MTC) and Provias; (ii) impact evaluation; (iii) financing for routine
      maintenance – microenterprises; (iv) laws on rural microenterprises; (iv) duties of the zonal
      offices; and (v) the role and sustainability of PRIs.

5.      Second Part: Risk Identification and Mitigation Measures. The second part of the
workshop consisted of the identification of risks and mitigation measures. This part was divided
into the following three modules: (i) identification of risks applicable to future operations or
investment projects, based on previously identified lessons; (ii) assessment and prioritization of
risks; and (iii) identification of mitigation proposals for those risks with greater impact and
probability.

6.      Results. Lessons Learned. The main lessons from the DRTP and RTDP projects, as
perceived by the participants, were as follows:

Areas in the design phase:



                                                 60
7.      Decentralized project implementation arrangements (regional and local
governments). Lesson learned: Develop appropriate management tools for the preparation of
terms of reference, preliminary and final studies, training in bidding processes, and hiring under
national law and Bank rules. This knowledge should be transferred through training sessions and
manuals.

8.      Road network management and planning model. Lesson learned: Develop a
decentralized management model, incorporating: (i) new management indicators such as logistic
corridors, border development; and (ii) transfer of knowledge to regional and local governments
to eventually allow them to handle the entire management process, from the preparation and
updating of their own road plans in the short and medium term, to outsourcing the performance of
works and maintenance.

9.     Governance. Lesson learned: Strengthen Provias’ strategic vision, develop a marketing
campaign, and promote institutional image (results, accomplishments).

10.     Institutional strengthening of subnational governments. Lesson learned: (i) design a
new institutional strengthening model articulated with the outsourced management model; (ii)
assess the real technical capacity of the municipal and regional governments; and (iv) propose
technical assistance programs in relation to the level of development or performance of regional
and local governments.

Areas in the implementation stage:

11.      Financial resources (centralized or decentralized). Lesson learned: (i) maintain the
initial objective of decentralization: budget execution by regional and municipal governments
with the oversight of Provias; and (ii) establish and institutionalize a decentralized road
management model.

12.     Institutional strengthening (national, regional, and provincial). Lesson learned:
Discourage staff turnover in PRIs and seek new ways to retain trained and experienced technical
staff. Review and evaluate how to improve implementation of the agreements signed between
Provias and municipal governments.

13.     Performance an evaluation of the PRIs. Lesson learned: (i) development of a legal
framework to establish PRIs as a permanent institution sustainable over time; (ii) greater
dissemination of the decentralized road management model through PRIs; and (iii) development
of a communication strategy with the strategic vision and active participation of the governing
entity (MTC).

Areas in the sustainability stage:

14.      Relationship between MTC and Provias (future vision of Provias). Lesson learned: (i)
strengthen coordination among institutions at the national level (MTC and Provias) and
decentralized level (Provias and local governments) to define the management model and the
institutionalization of Provias; and (ii) develop a communication strategy and disseminate results
achieved during the last few years.




                                               61
15.     Impact evaluation. Lessons learned: (i) carry out studies on road conditions
(serviceability of rural roads rehabilitated since 1995) and geo-reference the roads; and (ii)
evaluate the impact methodology compared to control roads.

16.     Financing of routine maintenance with microenterprises. Lesson learned: (i)
encourage routine maintenance through rural microenterprises; and (ii) change the Procurement
Law to include the community-based nature of rural microenterprises for road maintenance.

17.     Law on rural microenterprises. Lesson learned: Continue with the policy of conditional
and programmatic transfers (Provias must approve the Provincial Plan and make sure the PRI is
involved in supervising the works and expenditures) for maintenance of rural roads, developing a
new law that would authorize the creation and contracting of routine maintenance through
microenterprises.

18.      Role and sustainability of PRIs. Lesson learned: (i) regulate the PRI functions and
develop manuals for procurement, operations, and processes (creation of systems); (ii) enhance
collaboration for a concerted effort among the PRIs, local governments and Provias; and (iii)
institutional restructuring of Provias is required.

Probable Risks in Future Operations Co-Financed by the Banks

19.     The Risks Workshop concluded that the risks with the greatest impact and probability of
occurrence in future operations, along with their respective mitigation measures, are as follows:

Recommendations for Provias

20.       Based on the analysis of the results conducted in the workshop, we may infer the
following key lessons learned, as well as actions to be taken by Provias:
    (i)      Continue, expand or improve and/or adjust the decentralized road management model
             in order to continue supporting the subnational and local governments, through the
             PRIs, and allow for the sustainability of the rural transport system at a national level;
    (ii)     Maintain the supervisory role of Provias and the executing role of PRIs and routine
             maintenance microenterprises;
    (iii)    Continue with the transfer of knowledge on rural transport to regional and local
             governments, especially in terms of developing provincial road plans, works
             execution, maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation through training programs
             and development of policy instruments, protocols;




                                                               63
    (iv)    Provide technical assistance on the preparation of terms of reference and definitive
            studies for both works and periodic maintenance;
    (v)     Continue with the mechanism for the conditional transfers of routine maintenance of
            rural roads through rural microenterprises;
    (vi)    Develop a communication strategy and disseminate the results achieved, both
            internally and externally, to strengthen the role of Provias as a catalyst for the
            development of the rural transport sector.

21.       From the analysis of risks and mitigation measures proposed by the Provias team at the
workshop, a process of institutional strengthening and change should be implemented in order
to tackle the challenges of decentralization at the district and provincial levels, within a
framework of competitiveness and logistic corridors. Among the aspects that arose during the
workshop and which should be developed by Provias, the following are the most relevant actions:
    (i)      Develop a vision, mission, and a strategic plan for the medium and long term, aligned
             with the current or improved decentralized road management model, including an
             institutional reorganization in accordance with the model.
    (ii)     Draft a ministerial decree that establishes Provias as a permanent institution, giving it
             sustainability over time and changing it from a project execution unit to a
             decentralized public organization, providing greater stability to its staff, maintaining
             its human resources, and providing social benefits;
    (iii)    Develop a communication plan, both internal and external, in accordance with the
             proposed strategic long-term vision;
    (iv)     Develop a law for conditional transfers for routine maintenance of rural roads
             through community rural microenterprises, changing this activity from annual
             budgets to multiannual budgets for a more permanent flow of resources;
    (v)      Develop a law that permits the direct contracting of the community microenterprises
             in charge of the routine maintenance of rural roads;
    (vi)     Prepare and implement training programs for provincial and local governments,
             including standard civil works bidding documents, manuals, and protocols that will
             foster and improve technical capacities in local governments and provide
             sustainability to the decentralized road management model.

Impacts of Including Women in Income-Generating Activities

1.       Women living in rural areas of Peru have more limited access to economic and decision-
making opportunities than their male counterparts. This is often caused by their lower education
levels, but also by a conservative vision of gender roles in rural areas, where women are confined
to reproduction and keeping up with household work. In addition to these responsibilities, most
women also work on their family farms, although this work is generally invisible and not
remunerated, creating total dependence on their spouses. The Decentralized Rural Transport
Project (DRTP), like the Second Rural Road Project (SRRP), developed a Gender Action Plan
with the objective of reducing these gender gaps by enhancing the participation of women in
income-generating activities in the areas of influence of the Project.

2.      The Gender Action Plan included a 10 percent gender quota in the routine maintenance
microenterprises, measures to promote women’s participation in the Local Development Window
(LDW), and training sessions and workshops for the women and men benefiting from these two
programs in order to facilitate women’s inclusion and ensure the respectful interaction between
genders. The support and commitment of Provias, the Provincial Road Institutes (PRIs), the
municipal and district governments, and contractors was extremely important to ensure the
effectiveness of the aforementioned activities. Employees at these agencies participated in several
gender awareness and mainstreaming workshops.

3.      Economic Independence. As mentioned previously, rural women in Peru generally work
on their family farms without receiving remuneration for such work. For most of the 1,587
women who participated in the 857 microenterprises distributed across the country (28 percent of
all members), this was the first time they had received a salary and were able to make a decision
on how to use these earnings. As for the women who participated in the LDW, this program
enabled them to turn their small businesses into bigger ones, allowing them to expand their
production and income.

4.       Several studies have shown that women spend a greater proportion of their earnings than
men on their children’s nutrition and education. In fact, when female members of
microenterprises were interviewed, several stated that thanks to these earnings, they were able to
send their children to secondary school and to university in other areas of the country. Others said
that this additional income was invested in materials for their farms and to buy more livestock.
Additionally, supplemental income can help households save money that they can later invest in
small businesses, home improvements (helping reduce diseases and vulnerability to natural
catastrophes), or use it as a guarantee to gain access to formal financial services such as
microcredits. Through economic empowerment, women can ensure a better quality of life for
themselves and their families, which translates into poverty reduction and shared prosperity.

5.      Increased Knowledge and Skills. Before the Project, most women had never received
any kind of training that would allow them to learn new skills, expand their knowledge, and build
their capacities. The training provided to women in the microenterprises strengthened their
planning, project management, and monitoring capabilities. For the first time, women were
implementing and monitoring civil works. The training provided to women members of LDW



                                                65
strengthened their planning and management skills, and also taught them how to develop more
sustainable business plans that helped them expand production.

6.       Self-Esteem and Empowerment. Women’s self-perception and lack of confidence is
often their biggest constraint when seeking out economic opportunities and participating in
decision-making processes. Women members of the microenterprises and LDW have increased
their self-esteem and are more empowered. During interviews, they said they feel confident
working next to men, and realize that they are capable of learning new skills and carrying out
difficult activities. Moreover, thanks to these experiences, women gain a voice and are more
involved in decision-making processes in their communities. The impact on agency and
empowerment will be further analyzed through the study “Advancing Gender Agency in LAC:
Experiences from the Transport Sector.”22

7.       Increased Male Awareness of the Importance of Gender Inclusion. In rural areas,
men are generally not used to working alongside women who are not part of their families, and
husbands are reluctant to allow their wives to work outside the home because men are
traditionally the breadwinners. According to social norms, it is not appropriate for women to
carry out such activities alongside men who are not part of their family. Moreover, road work is
considered to be a male job, since it requires physical strength. In this respect, the project made
sure that both women and men participated in workshops that would help them overcome these
cultural barriers and facilitate women’s inclusion in order to ensure the success of the project.

8.      After the workshops, men understood the importance of including women in the
workplace, and even appreciated having them around. In fact, men declared that women are more
organized at work than men, and since women are more careful and detail-oriented, the quality of
the work was higher. Additionally, by working with women, men become more open-minded
about the idea of allowing—and even encouraging—their wives to work outside the home.

9.       Negative Effects. While including women in microenterprises and LDW had several
positive impacts, some aspects were negative. In fact, with women working all day outside their
homes, the responsibility of taking care of younger children and house chores fell to the eldest
daughters or grandmothers, which had repercussions on school attendance for daughters and
health issues for the elderly. To avoid these issues, work schedules at the microenterprises were
generally flexible, but it is still recommended to set up free kindergartens for younger children
near the workplace or in the communities so that women can work without leaving their
daughters or other women in charge of their children.

  The study is being finance by the Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality and is expected to be completed by
September 2014.

           Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
Objetivo

10.      El objetivo general del PTRD fue contribuir al desarrollo rural y a la superación de la
pobreza rural del país, a través de la mejora del acceso a bienes, servicios y oportunidades
generadoras de ingresos, la integración de la población rural y reducción de los costos de
transporte, dado por la mejora de la dotación y calidad de la provisión pública descentralizada de
la infraestructura de transporte rural.

Descripción de la Intervención

11.    Para el logro se sus objetivos, el PTRD contempló la ejecución de actividades
enmarcadas en 8 componentes:

       Infraestructura de transporte rural.
       Desarrollo de capacidades locales.
       Desarrollo de políticas, regulación e institucionalidad.
       Transporte y desarrollo rural.
       Monitoreo, seguimiento y evaluación de impacto.
       Gestión y administración del Programa.
       Auditoría financiera y operativa.
       Imprevistos.

12.      La propuesta del PTRD pretendió beneficiar a la población del ámbito rural actuando en
varios: (i) consolidar y expandir la propuesta técnica, financiera e institucional y el modelo de
gestión vial descentralizado de los caminos rurales; (ii) desarrollar el encuentro de la
infraestructura de transporte con otros tipo de infraestructuras económicas y el desarrollo de
iniciativas productivas en el medio rural; (iii) regular el uso de la infraestructura y el transporte
rural; (iv) actuar de ventanilla financiera, canalizando recursos a través del Programa hacia los
gobiernos locales para el desarrollo fundamentalmente de la infraestructura del transporte rural y
el fortalecimiento de la gestión local en materia de infraestructura de transporte rural, no sólo del
BID y el Banco Mundial, sino también de la cooperación internacional, del sector privado y del
propio gobierno nacional; (iv) asesorar y fortalecer la capacidades de gestión de los gobiernos
locales fundamentalmente en materia de infraestructura de transporte rural, no sólo para que
capten mayores recursos financieros, sino de manera importante a usar mejor sus recursos.

13.      Los gobiernos locales tanto provinciales como los distritales, en el PRTD, tuvieron un rol
protagónico. Las municipalidades de la provincia: (i) conformaron el Instituto Vial Provincial
(IVP) como órgano de gestión especializado de las municipalidades en materia de infraestructura
transporte rural y sus representantes, los alcaldes distritales forman parte del Comité Directivo del
IVP, presididos por el Alcalde Provincial; (ii) participaron directamente en la gestión de la
infraestructura de transporte rural a través del IVP; (iii) determinaron las prioridades de inversión
a través de la formulación de los Planes Viales Provinciales Participativos; y, (iv) financiaran el
costo de mantenimiento de los caminos vecinales rehabilitados por el Programa.

14.     El PTRD, se sumó al Proceso de Descentralización impulsado por el Gobierno,
desarrollando una estrategia que consistió en: i) Desarrollar y crear una institucionalidad
especializada en el seno de cada municipalidad provincial que se encargue de la gestión vial de



                                                 67
los caminos rurales: el Instituto Vial Provincial (IVP); ii) la gestión descentralizada pasa por
planificar el desarrollo de la infraestructura vial rural a nivel provincial, a través de la
formulación de los Planes Viales Provinciales (PVP); iii) Desarrollar mecanismos de
financiamiento descentralizados que garanticen la sostenibilidad de la inversión realizada en
infraestructura vial rural en el medio local; iv) Gradualidad de la descentralización de la gestión
vial de los caminos rurales, sobre todo por la heterogeneidad en las capacidades institucionales y
técnicas de los gobiernos locales y regionales; ello significa pasar del piloto de gestión
descentralizada de algunos componentes, a la expansión gradual tanto en términos de cobertura
como de componentes, v) Tercerización de los servicios en el espacio local y regional; ello
implica que las unidades de gestión y las municipalidades asumen la gestión vial de los caminos
vecinales ejecutando con terceros, como una manera de apoyar el desarrollo de los mercados
locales de contratistas y consultores, y vi) promover la complementariedad e integración con otro
tipo de infraestructuras tanto económicas, sociales y productivas para aumentar la eficiencia de

Intervención en Caminos Rurales

19.      Originalmente, el diseño del Programa consideraba que a través de este componente se
realicen acciones que comprendían las siguientes inversiones en infraestructura vial:
mejoramiento, rehabilitación, mantenimiento periódico y mantenimiento de emergencia de los
caminos vecinales; mejoramiento y mantenimiento de los caminos de herradura; rehabilitación y
mantenimiento de puentes y pontones, y otras infraestructuras de transporte rural (embarcaderos,
rehabilitación de puntos críticos, etc.); todas ellas orientadas fundamentalmente a ampliar,
mejorar y consolidar la dotación de la infraestructura vial en el medio rural. Sin embargo,
finalmente de acuerdo a la reestructuración y reasignaciones del Programa se determinó que las
intervenciones a realizar quedarían como siguen:

   Rehabilitación de caminos vecinales (3,310 km)
   Mantenimiento Periódico (7,608 km)
   Mejoramiento y construcción de puentes (1 Puente)
   Mejoramiento de caminos de herradura (2,365 km)
   Mejoramiento de caminos de herradura Turístico (161 km)

           (*) En acuerdo con los Bancos, se ha venido contabilizando el avance físico valorizado de contratos de obras inconclusas,
           las mismos que hasta la fecha se encuentran paralizadas o en arbitraje por diversos motivos.
           (**) Las obras culminadas consideran actividades de mantenimiento sobre 14 tramos (232.70 Km) que recibieron la
           segunda intervención de mantenimiento periódico.

20.    Considerando las cifras del cuadro anterior, se tiene que a través del Programa se logró el
buen estado de transitabilidad de 10,457 Km de caminos de la Red Vial Vecinal y 2,344 Km
caminos de herradura.

21.     Cabe precisar que el PTRD inició la ejecución descentralizada del mantenimiento
periódico en aquellas provincias con IVPs categorizados como de nivel IV y de nivel II, logrando
culminar trabajos de mantenimiento periódico para 2,228 Km de caminos vecinales, lo que hace
29% del total de trabajos culminados.

Fortalecimiento y Desarrollo de Capacidades

22.     Inventarios Viales Georeferenciados: como insumo principal de los planes viales, a
través del subcomponente se logró la elaboración de los Inventarios Viales Georeferenciados de
nivel básico para los caminos vecinales de 192 provincias; es decir, se logró inventariar al 99% de
la Red Vial Vecinal encontrándose una longitud total de 107,233 Km (incluyendo caminos en
condición de trocha). Dicha información ha venido siendo coordinada con la Dirección General
de Caminos y Ferrocarriles del MTC, para su incorporación formal en el Sistema Nacional de
Carreteras (SINAC).

23.     Planes Viales Provinciales Participativos: a través del subcomponente se logró el
financiamiento y elaboración de 115 PVPP y 01 Plan Vial Multidistrital en el ámbito del Valle de
los Ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (VRAEM). Asimismo, los gobiernos locales con la asistencia
técnica de PVD, se encargaron de financiar la elaboración de 06 PVPP.

24.    Si agregamos los planes elaborados durante el PTRD a los Planes elaborados durante el
PCR, se tiene que actualmente 192 provincias cuentan con PVPP.

25.     Desarrollo y fortalecimiento de capacidades locales: la última evaluación de
capacidades del PTRD, fue realizada durante el mes de junio de 2013, en la que de los 188 IVPs
creados, solo 174 respondieron con la información requerida para la evaluación semestral. De los
IVPS evaluados, se pueden estimar algunas métricas:

   94 IVPs (50%) han logrado alcanzar el nivel III y IV, lo que demuestra una adecuada
    capacidad de gestión, mostrando principalmente que poseen capacidad para gestionar
    financiamiento; formular perfiles y expedientes técnicos; ejecutar obras de infraestructura
    vial y actividades de mantenimiento. Existiendo IVPS en los que incluso llegan a desarrollar
    acciones en materia de transporte y tránsito rural. Además, estos IVPs se caracterizan por
    tener un equipo técnico dedicado y estable.
   128 IVPs (68%), contaron con recursos de sus gobiernos locales para el financiamiento del
    mantenimiento vial rutinario de caminos vecinales distintos a los que PVD rehabilitó, con lo
    que se muestra la internalización de la cultura del mantenimiento en los gobiernos locales.
   53 IVPs (28%) han avanzado en la simplificación administrativa, consolidando su
    institucionalización al tener acceso directo a Sistema Integrado de Administración Financiera
    (SIAF) y contar con cuentas corrientes.
   99 IVPs (53%) reciben transferencias directas del MEF para dar mantenimiento rutinario a
    caminos vecinales rehabilitados anteriormente. Ello demuestra que el MEF reconoce al IVP
    como ente especializado en gestión vial a nivel local.
   131 IVPs (70%) ejecutaron obras viales de construcción y/o rehabilitación con
    financiamiento de fuentes diferentes a PVD.
   144 IVPs (77%), lograron financiamiento de proyectos viales del PVPP en el presupuesto
    participativo.

26.     Por otro lado el diseño del Programa consideró fomentar los vínculos horizontales entre
todos los IVP, dado que las externalidades positivas que se puedan ganar de ello son mayores. En
ese sentido, como parte de las acciones de fortalecimiento institucional, se promovió y apoyó la
formación de la Red Nacional de IVPs como espacio de intercambio de experiencias y de buenas
prácticas.

27.     Equipamiento de los IVP: al término del PTRD, se logró equipar a 150 IVPs, cada uno
con 02 computadoras, 01 motocicleta, 01 Impresora, 01 escáner y 01 GPS tipo I. Asimismo, se
equipó a otros 03 IVP, cada uno con 01 motocicleta y 01 GPS, lo que finalmente hace un total de
153 IVPs beneficiados con equipamiento.

28.     Microempresas de Mantenimiento Vial Rutinario: a través del PTRD se logró
promover la creación de 185 MEMV, para el mantenimiento rutinario de un total de 3,595 Km,
favoreciendo la generación de 1,398 puestos de trabajo en el ámbito rural, de los que se observa
que alrededor del 31% corresponde a la participación de las mujeres.

29.     Ventana de Desarrollo Local (VDL): los principales resultados obtenidos a través de
este subcomponente son:

   Apalancamiento de fondos con un ratio de 3.3%. En VDL se invirtió S/. 7,984,809 y se
    consiguió movilizar fondos por S/. 26,618,533, para el fomento de proyectos productivos en
    zonas rurales, principalmente provenientes de los fondos de los mismos gobiernos locales y
    regionales.
   30 proyectos financiados por los Gobiernos locales por un monto total de S/. 22,946,719, para

Evaluación Económica del Programa

33.     Los resultados de la evaluación Ex Post muestran que, a pesar del incremento de los
costos de inversión, y más aún del aumento de los costos unitarios por kilómetro, las inversiones
del PTRD fueron más rentables que los previstos en la evaluación Ex Ante. Así, en la evaluación
Ex Post, se reporta un Valor Actual de US$ 108.3 millones muy superior US$ 13.9 millones
estimados al inicio de del PTRD; igualmente la Tasa Interna de Retorno de 54.6% es bastante
más alta de la tasa de descuentos del 14% y de los resultados de la evaluación ex ante estimado
en 29.2%.

Evaluación de Impactos del Programa

34.      A partir de la evaluación de Impacto del Programa, se puede llegar a la conclusión que la
rehabilitación de caminos rurales mejoró el acceso a servicios de educación y salud y dinamizó el
mercado laboral gracias a una mejora en la producción pecuaria. Por ende, aumento el gasto
familiar y se redujo la pobreza extrema. Entre los mayores impactos encontramos los siguientes:



                                                                       76
   Una reducción en los tiempos de viaje a las escuelas (-5.6 minutos) y a los puntos de venta de
    productos agropecuarios (-26.3 minutos)
   Un incremento (en torno al 14%) en la tasa de acceso a la escuela para la población de entre
    12 y 18 años.
   Un incremento (10%) del uso de los servicios de salud.
   Un mayor impacto en la reducción de la pobreza extrema (-13.8%) y de la pobreza estructural
    NBI (-7.5%), y un incremento del gasto per capita (7.3%). Dichos impactos a largo plazo no
    se podrían haber capturado en evaluaciones de impacto anteriores.

Evaluación del Desempeño de los Organismos Prestatarios

35.     Como en las etapas anteriores del PCR, la participación del Banco Interamericano de
Desarrollo (BID) y el Banco Internacional de Reconstrucción y Fortalecimiento (BIRF) en el
PTRD, resultó ser un factor de éxito para el Programa. Esto no solo por el financiamiento
obtenido a través de los contratos de préstamo, sino además por la participación permanente de
los funcionarios de los Bancos en el Programa, permitiendo el acompañamiento durante cada
etapa del Programa (preparación, ejecución y cierre). Gracias a su continuo asesoramiento,
evaluación y supervisión se logró que el Programa cumpla de las metas de cada componente.

En asegurar la calidad al inicio

36.     Ambos Bancos, participaron en el diseño del Programa a través de reuniones de trabajo.
Estas reuniones y coordinaciones permitieron contar su asesoramiento durante la fase de
preparación del Programa hasta la suscripción de los contratos de préstamo.

37.     En el asesoramiento recibido, se destaca el intercambio de opiniones y experiencias de
otros programas e incluyendo los ejecutados en otros países, en las que viene evolucionando la
gestión vial en el ámbito rural. Este asesoramiento, incluyó también recomendaciones que
enriquecieron el diseño del Programa en materias que los Bancos impulsan a nivel internacional,
como lo son impacto socioambiental, género, desarrollo rural, entre otros.

38.     Asimismo, los funcionarios de los Bancos prestaron especial acompañamiento al
cumplimiento de las normas, procedimientos y condiciones de los contratos de préstamo,
asegurando que estas se vean reflejadas en los instrumentos de gestión del Programa como lo son
el Manual de Operaciones, Planes Operativos y los Informes de Progreso. Adicionalmente, desde
el inicio y posteriormente durante la ejecución del Programa, los funcionarios mostraron
preocupación por fortalecer las capacidades del personal de PVD para que se asegure el
cumplimiento de los procedimientos y normativas de los Bancos.

39.     Una vez iniciada la operación del Programa, el asesoramiento de los Bancos apoyó en la
toma de decisiones y la gestión del Programa. Además, desde el inicio de Programa los
desembolsos fueron gestionados oportunamente, lo que permitió afrontar los pagos con los
recursos provenientes del endeudamiento sin que se produzcan inconvenientes.

Calidad de la supervisión

40.      La supervisión realizada por los equipos de trabajo de los Bancos, se realizó mostrando
un alto nivel profesional; así como, un trato cordial y cercano, lo que permitió una comunicación
frontal, abierta y honesta de los problemas que se fueron presentando durante la ejecución del
Programa. Esta relación de confianza, permitió a PVD, obtener por parte de los Bancos, su
comprensión, colaboración y flexibilidad en la solución de los problemas. Al respecto, nos



                                               77
atrevemos a indicar que los funcionarios participantes se mostraron identificados con el
Programa, sin que esto colisione con su representación excepcional de los organismos
prestatarios.

41.     El permanente asesoramiento se vio reflejado en las continuas visitas de las misiones a la
Sede Central, Oficinas de Coordinación Zonal e intervenciones del Programa (caminos
intervenidos). De esta manera, desde nuestro punto de vista, las misiones de supervisión
permitieron comunicar nuestros avances en los indicadores del Programa y constatar in situ la
calidad técnica de nuestra intervención; así como, el cumplimiento de los procedimientos y
normas. Asimismo, la misiones sirvieron para establecer medidas correctivas para las de
desviaciones identificadas en la ejecución del Programa; así como para establecer, de manera
concordada, metas e hitos que sirvieron para el monitoreo del Programa.

42.     Asimismo las respuestas de los Bancos a solicitudes de no objeción han sido oportunas lo
que ha permitido un normal desenvolvimiento de las actividades del Programa. Cabe precisar que
una gran cantidad (número) de los aportes y recomendaciones, por parte de los Bancos,
provinieron de las evaluaciones a estas solicitudes.

43.     Por último, se debe resaltar que los Bancos han apoyado y promovido la propia
supervisión y la mejora de esta, a través de las coordinaciones y las capacitaciones que realizaron
en esta materia.

           Comments by Co-Financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
Comments on Draft ICR by the Inter-American Development Bank, Project Co-Financer

1.      La evaluación realizada por el BID al Programa fue altamente satisfactoria, considerando
que logró alcanzar sus objetivos de desarrollo. Ello fue validado por la Evaluación de Impacto
realizada recientemente luego de culminado el proyecto.

2.      Evaluación del proyecto. En términos generales, la implementación del proyecto se
considera satisfactoria, más aun considerando la complejidad del proyecto: en el Programa se
llevaron a cabo 1,600 procesos de contratación, entre consultores individuales, firma consultores
y contratistas. De las evaluaciones periódicas que se realizaban no se identificaron temas críticos
de implementación. Adicionalmente debe indicarse que el programa se implementó en un
cambio de contexto económico, pero su flexibilidad permitió adecuarse a este nuevo contexto.

3.      En cuanto a la evaluación de productos y resultados, el programa logró alcanzar sus
objetivos, lo cual fue validado con la evaluación de impacto realizada.

4.       Desempeño del ejecutor. El Banco considera que la agencia ejecutora ha efectuado una
labor muy satisfactoria durante la implementación del proyecto. Durante la ejecución del
proyecto adoptó medidas correctivas cuando se presentaron problemas y tuvo la capacidad de
adaptar adecuadamente el programa a los cambios de contexto. Los procesos de adquisiciones y
contrataciones con recursos de los Bancos fueron llevados a cabo cumpliendo con las políticas de
los Bancos, y supervisando y monitoreando el proyecto, a fin que los productos del proyecto sean
de calidad. Cabe destacar la complejidad del proyecto, en términos de cantidad de obras de
rehabilitación, estudios y consultorías realizadas. A pesar de dicha complejidad, y a pesar que el
proyecto tuvo ampliaciones de plazo, éstas no superaron los 24 meses, lo cual resulta bastante
adecuado para la complejidad del programa. No obstante, el ejecutor tiene un gran reto por
delante puesto que Provias Descentralizado viene recibiendo funciones que escapan a su rol de
Unidad Ejecutora. Los encargos que viene recibiendo están vinculados a la supervisión técnica de
las transferencias financieras que realizan entidades como el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas
o el Fondo para la Inclusión Económica en Zonas Rurales (FONIE) hacia los gobiernos locales
para la mejora o mantenimiento de caminos rurales. En este marco, Provias requerirá revisar su
organización, no sólo por las funciones adicionales, sino además incorporando su visión a futuro
respecto al tratamiento de la vialidad terciaria, es decir, si se mantiene como una organización
que brindará financiamiento y asistencia técnica para la mejora de la red terciaria, o si su visión
será la de convertirse en un ente supervisor de toda la vialidad terciaria, generando políticas que
permita la mejora del transporte rural.

5.      Desempeño del Banco Mundial. En opinión del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo
9BID), el trabajo conjunto y armonizado entre el Banco Mundial y del BID ha sido positivo y ha
generado valor agregado para un adecuado monitoreo y supervisión de la implementación del
proyecto. Ambos Bancos han identificado las ventajas de cada uno en determinados aspectos del
monitoreo, y en diversas etapas del proyecto para poder realizar un monitoreo integral del
Programa. Asimismo, el diálogo técnico entre ambos Bancos que incluye el compartir
información, identificar debilidades u oportunidades de mejora del programa, ha sido muy
fluido, y ha permitido proponer al ejecutor mejoras en la implementación del programa, y
monitorear adecuadamente el Programa.
