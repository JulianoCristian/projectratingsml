Project for Peru aims at improving access of rural\n            households and entrepreneurs to goods, social services and\n            income generating opportunities through reduced transport\n            costs and better rural transport infrastructure and through\n            piloting, in 15 provinces, specific incentives aiming at\n            promoting greater complementarities and bundling of rural\n            infrastructure interventions at the provincial level. The\n            closing date for the project will be extended from March 31,\n            2012 until March 31, 2013. The project has been implemented\n            at a relatively accelerated pace and has currently disbursed\n            US$42.8million (86 percent of the Loan amount of US$50\n            million). Civil works, in particular for the rehabilitation\n            component, have been implemented at 93 percent of completion\n            rate while institutional strengthening activities have been\n            slower at 62 percent for the development of the local\n            capacity and 23 percent in policy and regulation. The\n            project has been impacted in recent years due to the\n            regional and national elections that took place (in 2010 and\n            2011) resulting in a significant number of changes in\n            provincial administrations, including changes in technical\n            staff of the Provincial Road Institutes. The extension is\n            necessary to allow for the project activities to be\n            completed and achieve its objectives during the proposed\n            extended implementation period. The Borrower has in place an\n            action plan to monitor project progress and complete the\n            project by March 31, 2013. This will be the first extension\n            of the project."}, "docdt": "2012-03-15T00:00:00Z"}
