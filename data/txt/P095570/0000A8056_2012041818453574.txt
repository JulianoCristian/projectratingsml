                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project aims at improving access of rural households and entrepreneurs to goods, social services and income generating opportunities through reduced transport
                         costs and better rural transport infrastructure and through piloting, in 15 provinces, specific incentives aiming at promoting greater complementarities and bundling of
                         rural infrastructure interventions at the provincial level.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
