was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included:  rehabilitating rural roads can be an\n            effective mechanism for increasing access to education and\n            health, as well as reducing extreme poverty. The Impact\n            Evacuation study found that from 2004-2006 to 2013, the\n            project caused substantial improvements in travel times,\n            accessibility to education and health centers, availability\n            of private and public services, and a 19.7 percent decrease\n            in the proportion of persons living in extreme poverty. Road\n            transport policies should explicitly include non-motorized\n            transport tracks or community roads in their strategic\n            planning and as part of the road network. Using local\n            expertise and knowledge is effective in understanding\n            development problems, especially in isolated rural\n            communities. To ensure the sustainability of routine\n            maintenance of the tertiary road network, institutional and\n            financial arrangements should be made within the country\u0092s\n            legal framework, in concordance with sector policies. A\n            properly designed Impact Evaluation study can be a powerful\n            tool in identifying the successes and shortcomings of\n            development projects and better understanding how to tailor\n            them to local conditions."}, "docdt": "2014-02-27T00:00:00Z"}
