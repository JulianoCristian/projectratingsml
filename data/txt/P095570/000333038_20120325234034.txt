1. The closing date for the Peru Decentralized Rural Transport Project, [Loan 7423-
   PE], P095570 will be extended from March 31, 2012 until March 31, 2013.

2.      The project has been implemented at a relatively accelerated pace and has
currently disbursed US$42.8million (86 percent of the Loan amount of US$50 million).
Civil works, in particular for the rehabilitation component, have been implemented at 93
percent of completion rate while institutional strengthening activities have been slower at
62 percent for the development of the local capacity and 23 percent in policy and
regulation. The project has been impacted in recent years due to the regional and national
elections that took place (in 2010 and 2011) resulting in a significant number of changes
in provincial administrations, including changes in technical staff of the Provincial Road
Institutes. Due to the decentralized nature of the program, the high turnovers implied a
long learning curve during the transitions and delays in implementation, in particular for
the execution of periodic maintenance works. In response, the implementing agency
scaled up training activities to familiarize new provincial staff with the program and
strengthen their capacity to implement project activities. The project is currently on track
to achieve the physical as well as the large majority of the institutional and territorial
development targets. Overall, the project continues to enjoy a satisfactory rating, and is
scheduled to achieve its objectives.

3.      The proposed extension is necessary to allow for the project activities to be
completed and achieve its objectives during the proposed extended implementation
period. The Borrower has in place an action plan to monitor project progress and
complete the project by March 31, 2013.

4.     This will be the first extension of the project.
