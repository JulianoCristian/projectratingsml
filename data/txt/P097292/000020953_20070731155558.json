of\n            Malawi had the following ratings: outcomes were highly\n            satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            borrower performance was highly satisfactory. The lessons\n            learned included: 1) The Bank should consider whether direct\n            disbursement, as is now carried out for development policy\n            assistance, can be permitted for emergency assistance in\n            certain circumstances - for example, where the adverse\n            impact of macroeconomic disruption is likely to be severe\n            but reversible within the existing policy framework; and 2)\n            The Government and its partners should consider whether the\n            macroeconomic effects of a future such emergency could be\n            better provided for, either by targeting a larger build up\n            of foreign exchange reserves, or by the development of\n            better insurance instruments, like call options."}, "docdt": "2007-06-12T00:00:00Z"}
