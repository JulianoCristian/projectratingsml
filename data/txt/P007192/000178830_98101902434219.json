GUATEL's development program. It\n            provides for a balanced and integrated development of local,\n            long distance national and international services in urban\n            and rural areas. The first subproject concerns: (a) the\n            extension of rural telecommunications and provides about\n            8,000 exchange lines in rural areas and primary\n            telecommunications facilities to rural communities. The\n            second element involves: (b) the extension of the Central\n            American international network and provision of a new\n            international exchange in Guatemala City. Finally, there is\n            a third subproject comprised of: (c) urban\n            telecommunications and technical assistance. This subproject\n            involves: (i) the installation of: a total of 109,600\n            additional lines of local exchange equipment in urban areas\n            with associated cables to make about 100,000 additional\n            connections and provide about 3,500 public call office\n            telephones; eighteen microwave and radio systems with about\n            400 additional long distance circuits; a national long\n            distance exchange in Guatemala City; a computer; and\n            training equipment; (ii) building construction; and (iii)\n            retention of foreign experts to assist GUATEL in\n            administration, planning, finance and management."}, "docdt": "1984-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
