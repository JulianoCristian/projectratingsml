EMPREA GUATEMALTECA DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (GUATEL)
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
I. TRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      The telecommunications sector is under the responsibility of the
Ministry of Communlcations and mainly comprises the Empresa Guatemalteca de
Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL), the Direccion General de Correos y Telegrafos
(DGCT) and the Direccion General de Radiodifusion y Television (DGRT).
1.02      GUATEL is a state-owned, autonomous, commercially-oriented
enterprise responsíble for all public telecommunications services in
Guatemala, except domestic telegraph. GUATEL was established in 19711 and
currently provides local, long distance and international telephone
services (which account for over 95 percent of its traffic and 85 percent
of its revenue), telex service, international telegraph service, and point
to point leased circuits for networking of radio and television programs
and other uses. According to its charter, GUATEL has full authority to
determine its own development policy, tariffs, investment program, annual
budget, borrowings, organization and staffing. However, in practice it is
required to seek the opinion of the Secretaria General del Consejo Nacional
de Planificacion Economica (CONAPLAN) on any proposed tariff change and on
proposed four-year investment programs. Likewise, the concurrence of the
Ministry of Finance is required for its annual investment program and for
foreign borrowings.
1.03      Domestic public telegraph service and the postal service are
operated by DGCT, a government department in the Ministry of
Communications. DGCT operates an outdated network of manual (Morse)
telegraphs, magneto telephones (which are also used for a limited form of
public telephone service), and open wire lines interconnecting 542
telegraph/postal offices throughout the country. DGCT can obtain
considerable cost reductions by leasing circuits from GUATEL where these
are available. As GUATEL extends its rural telephone service, it will be
able to book and transmit telegrams over the telephone to DGCT's main
telegraph centers; delivery of incoming telegrams could be entrusted to
local agents or contractors. DGCT could then gradually phase out its morse
telegraphs and concentrate on the transmission of telegrams among main

Telecomunicaciones GUATEL. Published in Diario Oficial El Guatemalteco

- 2 -
centers using teleprinters. During the next few years, government and
GUATEL intend to appoint an interagency committee to look into the future
development of the telegraph and telephone networks, and draw up plans for
phasing out the manual telegraph network.
1.04      The Ministry of Communications regulates the use of radio
frequencies, and licenses their use by public and private entities. At
present, there are about 2,900 licensed private radio links and networks
(mostly VHF) operated by public utilities, industries, farms, and others.
Licenses are granted for two years and renewed only where GUATEL services
are not available. Given the relatively high investment and operating
costs of good quality private links, and the fees levied by the Ministry of
Communications on the use of radio frequencies, license renewals should
drop as GUATEL expands its services. This is desirable in terms of overall
cost efficiency and frequency spectrum economy.
1.05      There are about 110 radio broadcasting stations (of which 10 are
state owned) and five television networks (one state owned), which cover
the capital city and provinces to varying degrees. They are regulated by
the Ministry of Communications' DGRT. GUATEL leases circuits for
transmission of domestic and international programs.
1.06      Manufacturing of telecommunications materials in Guatemala is
limited to posts (concrete, metal) and PVC ducts, of which GUATEL currently
buys about Q 1.0 million worth per year. Telephone cables of up to
800-pair capacity are manufactured in Costa Rica and El Salvador, where
posts, ducts and hardware are also produced. Local private contractors are
used for civil works and the installation of ducts, cables and rural
telephone systems (Annex 1).
Access to Service
1.07      As of end 1983, Guatemala had an average main telephone
líne density of about 1.4 lines in service per 100 inhabitants. This is
below the average for all other Central American countries except Honduras
(0.8), and compares unfavorably with the averages for Central America
(about 2 lines/100 inhabitants) and Latin America as a whole (about 4
lines/100 inhabitants). Data for several countries are given in Annex 2.
1.08      Telephone service is available in the capital city and in each of
the 22 provinces (departamentos) into which the country is divided for
purposes of government administration. However, greater metropolitan
Guatemala City, with about 12 percent of the country's population, has 85
percent of all telephone línes in service. Nonetheless, with a density of
about 9.7 lines per 100 inhabitants, Guatemala City ranks well below some
other Latin American capitals (e.g., San Jose 16, Montevideo 13).
Furthermore, only 51 of the country's 304 seats of local government
(cabeceras municipales) have telephone service of any type; of these 51
places, 15 have only long distance public call office telephones, and four
other small places are also only served by public call office telephones.



- 3 -
There are in the country about 1060 public call office or coinbox
telephones, or one for every 7,500 inhabitants; 77 percent of these public
telephones are in the capital city, averaging one per every 1,200 persons
as against one per about 28,600 persons in the provinces. Overall, on the
basis of the number of inhabítants in settlements with telephone service,
it is estimated that only about 25 percent of the country's population has
local access to telephone servíce.
Usage of Service
1.09      In 1982, about 65 percent of the country's telephone lines were
connected to residential subscribers and the remaining 35 percent to
businesses, government offices and others. This relatively high proportion
of telephones categorized as residential partly reflects the fact that
nonresidential telephones are charged higher monthly rental and call
charges than telephones classified as residential. Therefore there is an
incentive to have telephones officially classified as residential rather
than nonresidential. During 1983, however, GUATEL took steps to ensure
that subscribers are properly classified. In Guatemala City, about 80
percent of the nonresidential lines were connected to subscribers engaged
in communications-intensive tertiary sectors of the economy, mainly
services (professional, education, health, finance, communication and
transport) and commerce (wholesale and retail trade) (Annex 3).
1.10      In 1983, the average telephone líne generated about 2,400 local
calls, 20 domestic long distance calls, and 20 outgoing international
calls. Business and government subscribers are particularly intensive
users of long distance and international services; for instance, for a
sample of 4,398 lines in Guatemala City in July 1983, business and
government lines averaged 2.3 times as many long distance calls and 3.2
times as many outgoing international calls as did residential lines--while
making on average only 1.4 times as many local calls. Countrywide, the
average gross revenue per telephone line in 1983 was about US$450
equivalent; business and government lines accounted for over 60 percent of
revenues. These figures, however, underestimate the extent to which
telephone usage relates directly to the production and distribution of
goods and services. Particularly in the provinces, a considerable
proportion of telephones classified as residential serve locations and
users which combine business and personal functions.
1.11      GUATEL classified a sample of 2,361 residential subscribers in
Guatemala City into low, middle and high income categories according to a
field survey in which the quality of housing of telephone subscribers was
judged by external visual inspection. On this basis, it is estimated that
about 13 percent of current residential telephone subscribers in the
capital live in housing which would be typical of relatively low income
inhabitants, 49 percent middle income, and 38 percent high income. On
average, the telephone calling rates for local, long distance and
international service all increase considerably with income level; only the
relatively high income residences generate more calls than the number of



- 4 -
free local calls (400 pulses per month) included in the telephone line
rental. High income residences averaged a bill almost three times that of
middle income homes and four times that of subscribers living in the
housing judged to reflect relatively lower income occupants.
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
1.12      GUATEL's telephone and telex facilities as of end 1982 are
summarized in Annex 4. Annex 5 gives basic statistics on the development
of facilities over the period 1974-83. Despite a large unmet demand
(paragraph 1.14), only about 60 percent of telephone exchange capacity is
presently used; however, this figure will increase to about 70 percent when
the ITT-North procured exchanges, which experienced technical problems, are
fully operational (paragraph 1.23). In the provinces the exchange
utilization is only 50 percent, which is the result of delays in developing
the cable network concurrently with expanding exchange capacity or
installing new exchanges. In Guatemala City, where exchange utilization is
65 percent, there was delay in developing the cable network in the central
business district (where there is a spare exchange capacity of 11,500 lines
and an estimated outstanding demand for about 25,000 lines), as well as
the protracted technical difficulties in fully commissioning a new type of
electronic exchange referred to above.
1.13       Given the substantial shortage of telephone lines relative to
demand, local service in the main cities is congested, made worse by repeat
call attempts. Long distance and international facilities are still
adequate, but congestion at the local level is also reflected in these
services and results in a high proportion of incompleted call attempts.
GUATEL does not, however, carry out systematic measurements of quality of
service, as necessary to specifically quantify these problems and adjust
operating and maintenance practices and staffing. As part of the project,
GUATEL will establish service quality standards and monitor performance
against those standards (paragraphs 4.03 and 4.04).
Demand for Service
1.14       The table below summarizes actual demand for telephone
connections for recent years, and GUATEL's forecast for the years 1984-87.

1.15      The demand figures are based on block by block estimates obtained
in 1976 in Guatemala City and 60 other cities and towns including all 22
seats of provincial government. Projections for 1996 were obtained on the
basis of actual and expected future land use patterns and assumptions on
average demand per dwelling and business in various categories.
Interpolation was used to obtain the above year-by-year forecasts through
1987.
1.16      The forecasts prepared in 1976 have not, however, been checked
against subsequent observations of actual demand, as needed to validate the
initial assumptions. Thus, the 1984-87 forecasts are subject to
significant uncertainties. GUATEL has assumed that demand growth will
rapidly flatten out beyond 1985, which is likely to be inconsistent with
the small present size of the system. As part of the project, technical
assistance will be provided to assist GUATEL in developing an improved
system of demand forecasting (paragraphs 3.06 and 4.04).
Sector Goals
1.17      In the 1978-82 national development plan, the Government set out
long term objectives for the telecommunications sector: meet all demand,
modernize existing services and introduce new ones, and keep operations
profitable and capable of generating the funds needed for investment.
Specific goals for the period 1978-82 included completion of ongoing works,
rationalization of use of the radio frequencies spectrum, and preparation
of a master plan for the development of the sector. A financial sector
objective is set out in the law that established GUATEL and which requires
that 45 percent of its adjusted net income be paid to government.



-6-
1.18      With ITU assistance, GUATEL prepared a master plan for the
development of telecommunications in Guatemala over the period 1981-2000 in
four five-year stages. The number of telephone lines in service would
increase from about 173,200 in 1980 to 349,200 in 1985 and to 483,000 in
1990. However, the goals for the first phase (1981-1985) are overly
optimistic. The actual number of telephone lines in service at end 1982
was only 97,500, far below the master plan's forecast starting point of
173,200. The proposed addition of 96,500 lines in 1984-87 would require
connecting an average of 24,125 new lines per year--against an average of
7,100 lines per year in 1975-82 and a maximum of 11,300 achieved in any
single year (1977). Taking into account the present constraints on
GUATEL's implementation capacity (paragraph 1.20), GUATEL agreed to a
reduced first stage program as summarized below.
1975-1982    1984-1987
Average annual investment (US$ million)                15,130        50,000
Average number of new subscriber lines
connected annually                                    7,100        24,125
Average lines growth rate (%)                               10            17
1.19      The 1984-87 program implies raising the number of telephone lines
added per year from about 7,100 in the period 1975-82 to about 17,000 in
1984, 25,000 in 1985 and 1986, and 30,000 in 1987. Total exchange capacity
will increase from 146,800 in 1982 to about 290,000 in 1987, and connected
línes will increase from 97,500 to about 205,000, as set out in Annex 6.
Selected parameters reflecting expected changes in system size and access

Sector Constraints
1.20      The main constraint on the rate at which telecommunications
services can be expanded towards meeting demand lies in GUATEL's capacity
to undertake this large investment program (including development of the
cable network) and to efficiently operate and maintain the new facilities.
GUATEL's implementation capacity is being augmented by resorting
increasingly to private contractors for the construction of cable plant and
to suppliers for installation of equipment as well as its maintenance for
one year; GUATEL might also give consideration to have house wiring done by
private contractors (see Annex 1).
1.21      In order for GUATEL to effectively carry out the 1984-87 program,
it will also need to: (a) streamline the commercial, administrative and
technical functions involved in processing new lines from application
through installation, (b) strengthen project coordination and supervision
as the size, number and dispersion of works increases and more suppliers
and contractors are involved, (c) revise GUATEL's organization and staffing
to reflect a greater use of private contractors for construction of plant,
and to enable GUATEL to maintain greatly expanded and dispersed facilities,
and (d) establish standards for subscriber owned terminal equipment, to
ensure systemwide technical compatibility ánd adequate maintenance (Annex
1). These changes and a strengthening of GUATEL's investment planning and
policy making capability constitute the core of a package of institutional
development assistance for which provision has been made under the project
(para. 4.04).



The Bank's Role
1.22      In the past, GUATEL has received two Bank loans.  The first loan
(792-GU of 1972) of US$16.0 million equivalent, financed the provision and
extension of local, long distance and international telecommunications
facilities. The project was satisfactorily completed in December 1978 (PCR
of May 17, 1979) despite a 22 percent cost overrun and substantial
implementation delays; the latter were caused partly by the need to revise
the investment progran following a major earthquake in 1976. An important
aspect of this initial Bank involvement in the sector was a major
reorganization of the telecommunications sector which resulted in the
merger of two existing entities, the establishment of GUATEL's first major
capital works program and its first experience with the Bank's loan and
procurement procedures. The Bank also provided much needed financial
assistance, which permitted higher levels of investment than would
otherwise have been made by GUATEL.
1.23      The second loan (1104-GU of 1975) of US$26 million equivalent,
co-financed with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration
(CABEI), was for further improvement and expansion of telecommunications
services, estimated to cost US$89.9 million. This project has experienced
five years of slippage mainly due to technical problems of a supplier in
commissioning several large telephone exchanges. However, the project is
expected to be completed around February 1984. As a result of these
supplier-related problems in Guatemala and in other countries, the Bank now
requires that bid specifications include a requirement that equipment
offered must be field-proven. The Bank's participation has enabled
Guatemala to (a) establish a modern long distance telecommunications
network with the associated long distance exchange in Guatemala City to
link the principal areas of the country, and to initiate the provision of a
national subscriber dialing network covering a number of larger exchanges
in the country; (b) expand local telephone service in Guatemala City and in
a number of provincial towns; and (c) create a financial base for further
development of telecommunications facilities.
1.24      The Bank's involvement through a third loan in GUATEL's 1984-87
investment program is justified in terms of:
(a)  helping design and ímplement a comprehensive package of
organization and management improvements which would
enable GUATEL to increase the pace of expansion and
double its services over the project period, and to
efficiently maintain and operate a greatly expanded
telecommunications system;
(b)  strengthening the participation of private enterpreneurs
in the sector, while ensuring overall system
compatibility and performance;



- 9 -
(c)  promoting the continuation of substantial net transfers
from GUATEL to government, to be used in other sectors
less capable of mobilizing domestic resources;
(d) strengthening GUATEL's capacity to plan future
investments and establishing tariffs leading to more
efficient use of plant and allocation of new resources;
(e)  promoting in GUATEL adequate consideration of technical
alternatives, in pursuit of low costs and system
simplicity; and
(f) helping finance GUATEL's 1984-87 program, together with
suppliers, the Inter-American Development Bank and the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration.
II. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      GUATEL's four-year (1984-87) telecommunications development
program aims at increasing the number of main lines in Guatemala from about
108,500 as of the end of 1983 to about 205,000 in service by the end of
1987--an annual growth rate of about 17 percent, compared to about 10
percent during the previous seven-year period (paragraph 1.18). In addition
to expansion of local services in rural and urban areas, the program
provides for the installation of about 3,500 additional public call office
telephones. The program, excluding preinvestments for the next five-year
investment program, consists of:
(a) ongoing works for installation of exchange equipment and
associated cables and construction of equipment
buildings; and
(b) the proposed project, which is to be co-financed by the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI),
suppliers' credits and the IBRD (paragraph 2.04)
2.02      Annex 4 sets out the basic facilities as existing on December 31,
1982 and projections through 1987. The map sets out the telecommunications
network.



- 10 -
2.03      The estimated direct costs of the program are about Q 199.5
million (US$199.5 million equivalent) including a foreign exchange cost of
USS146.3 million equivalent. Annual investments are set out in Annex 7.
The Project
2.04      The proposed  project is a high priority self-contained part of
GUATEL's 1984-87 investment program which provides for a balanced and
integrated development of local, long distance national and international
services, and is scheduled for execution between 1984 and 1987. The
project consists of the following subprojects:
(a)  extension of rural services by the installation of about
8,000 exchange lines, and providing primary
telecommunications facilities to communities currently
without such services--this subproject is to be financed
by a USS18.0 million loan from IDB;
(b)  extension of the Central American international network,
and provision of a new international exchange in
Guatemala City--this subproject is to be financed by a
US$26.0 million loan from CABEI; and
(c)  the subproject proposed to be financed by the Bank, and
suppliers' credits (see paragraph 2.05).
2.05      The Bank's subproject comprises the following items:
(a)  the installation of:
(i)  a total of about 109,600 additional lines of local
exchange equipment (79,000 lines in Guatemala City,
5,000 lines in Quetzaltenango and a total of 25,600
lines in 23 provincial towns), with associated
cables to make about 100,000 additional connections
and provide about 3,500 public call office
telephones;
(ii) eleven microwave and seven UHF/VHF systems ;with
about 400 additional long distance circuits;
(iii) a national long distance exchange in Guatemala City;
(iv)  computer equipment to enhance GUATEL's data
processing capacity;
(v)  training equipment;
(b)  the construction of buildings to house equipment; and



- 11 -
(c) retention of foreign experts (7 manyears) to assist
GUATEL in improving administration, planning, finance and
management and to conduct a tariff study
(paragraph 4.04).
Project Cost
2.06       The total direct cost of the project is estimated at about
Q 174.7 million (US$174.7 million) including a foreign exchange component
of US$132.3 million equivalent.  The project costs set out in Annex 7 are
summarized as follows:

2.07      The project costs reflect:  a) for the switching/PCM equipment
for which bids have already been received (but evaluation not yet
completed), the median price of the bids received; b) for the other
components, estimated end December 1982 prices based on GUATEL's experience
with contracts relating to ongoing works and those signed for goods under
Loan 1104-GU, and on experience in other countri,es, with inflation
adjustments to bring them up to end 1983 level. The switching/PCM
equipment is expected to be financed through suppliers' credits. The
project cost estimates are reasonable.  GUATEL is exempt from payment of
customs duties on imported goods and pays no local taxes on goods and
services.
Contingencies
2.08      Price contingencies for the Bank subproject costs amount to 15.8
percent of total base and physical contingency costs. They result from the
year-by-year estimates of local cost increases of 12 percent annually from
1984 through 1987 and foreign cost increases of 7.5 percent in 1984, 7.0
percent in 1985, and 6.0 percent in 1986 and 1987. The foreign cost
increases are applied to the contract date since all contracts in this
sector are made on a fixed price basis and are líkely to be signed by end
1984, and most of the equipment would be delivered by 1985. The foreign
and local cost increases are in line with the Bank's guidelines.
2.09      Except for variations in quantities which could occur in civil
works and for which a physical contingency amounting to 5 percent of local
costs has been provided, no other physical contingencies for the Bank
subproject are considered necessary. Provision of local and long distance
exchange lines, telephones and transmission equipment proposed to be
procured and installed are based on detailed forecasts of equipment
quantities and detailed engineering. In view of this, the proposed
quantities of equipment are not expected to change significantly. Based on
experience, any unexpected increases of transmission equipment on some
routes will be compensated by corresponding unexpected decreases on other
routes. In case of cable networks, the dispersion of these networks
throughout the country permits flexibility and adjustments which make
provision of physical contingencies unnecessary.
Items and Sources of Financing
2.10      Of the project's direct and indirect foreign cost of about
US$132.7 million (including US$0.4 million as front end fee), the proposed
Bank loan would provide about US$30.0 million (US$28.6 million for goods
procurement, US$1.0 million for technical assistance and US$0.4 million as
front end fee). The balance of US$102.7 million would be provided by (a)
IDB - US$18.0 million; (b) CABEI - US$26.0 million; (c) supplier's credits
- US$40.8 million; and GUATEL's internal cash generation - US$17.9
million. In addition, GUATEL would finance all the local costs amounting
to US$42.4 million equivalent. The items for Bank financing in US$
millions are as follows:



- 13 -
Goods                                               28.6
Cables                                  7.7

Technical assistance                                 1.0
Front end fee                                        0.4
Total                                         30.0
Procurement
2.11      Equipment totaling US$28.1 million including contingencies have
been grouped in appropriate bidding packages to be procured by ICB in
accordance with Bank guidelines. None of the goods proposed for Bank
financing are currently manufactured in Guiatemala but cables estimated to
cost US$7.7 million are manufactured in some Central American countries,
which are members of the Central American common market.  Qualified
manufacturers fromn Central American countries would receive, in accordance
with current Bank policies, a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or
the import duty, whichever is lower. Switching equipment for the extension
of lines in two small exchanges procured through ICB under Bank guidelines
under Bank Loan 1104-GU, and estimated to cost about US$0.5 million
(including contingencies), would be obtained through negotiations with
existing suppliers and will be financed from loan funds. This is justified
for purposes of standardization, to fully utilize the floor space planned
for such extensions in existing buildings, and to obtain economies
resulting from the use of existing common equipment. The Bank will check
whether the prices are reasonable before approving disbursements.
2.12      For the switching package (paragraph 2.07) to be financed by
suppliers' and government subsidized export credits, bids for the supply
contracts and credit offers have been received. Bid evaluation is expected
to be completed by end June, 1984 and would be based on an assessment of
the comnbined features of technical responsiveness, cost and credit terms.
The award would be made to the lowest evaluated bid on the basis of
discounted cash flow techniques. In order to ensure that GUATEL's choice
of supplier is technically sound and that acceptable quality standards are
observed, the Bank has reviewed the bid documents and would also review
GUATEL's bid award recommendations. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from GUATEL that such a review would be acceptable and that the
Bank would be furnished access to the relevant switching facilities and
construction sites, and to information reasonably needed for the
execution of the various project components. Extensions to existing



- 14 -
equipment for a total amount of US$5.3 million  t:o be financed from
GUATEL's own resources would be obtained by negotiations with existing
suppliers. Procurement through negotiations is the most practical way to
extend such equipment. Goods such as cable ductsi and some external plant
which are manufactured locally and which would be financed by GUATEL's own
resources would be obtaíned through local competitive bids. The local
procurement system permits competition and is satisfactory.
2.13       All Bank-financed bidding packages (five in total) for goods
estimated to cost over US$1.0 million equivalent would be subject to the
Bank's prior review of procurement documentation resulting in a coverage of
100 percent of the total estimated value of goods contracts.
Project Implermentation
2.14       The proposed subproject execution schedule as set out in Annexes
8 and 9 is realistic. GUATEL has prepared engineering designs, bid
documents and technical specifications for procurement of all Bank financed
goods using its own staff. GUATEL expects to contract for the switching
package (see paragraph 2.07) on a turnkey basis. GUATEL would employ
contractors to lay, joint and terminate all cables, and would supervise the
work of these contractors. GUATEL would second its staff on the switching
package installations, and would carry out the acceptance testing of all
equipment installed by contractors.  GUATEL's management has the experience
required for the execution of the project. The project is expected to be
completed by Decernber 31, 1987.
Disbursements
2.15      The estimated schedule of Bank loan disbursements is set out in
Annex 10 which also sets out the Bank's disbursement profile based on
historical data of all IBRD operations in the sector over the period
FY70-80. The Bank's disbursement profíle for Guatemala's telecommunications
sector has been modified primarily because a) the procurement procedure has
been initiated and bids for all major equipment components have been
received and those for the remainder are expected by end June 1984 and b)
the disbursements under the second Bank Loan 1104-GU were seriously
distorted as the switching contractor who had to complete installation by
end June 1978 now expects to do so only by end February   1984 due to
protracted technical problems heyond the control of GUATEL (paragraph
1.23).  GUATEL has received bids for all major components of Bank-financed
goods and expects to contract for such goods by enid July, 1984.  Contracts
for the other components of Bank-financed goods are expected to be signed
by end December 1984. Loan disbursements have been based roughly on the
above schedule of procurement. In view of the fact that contracts for
public call offices and consultants are expected to be signed in March
1984, there would be a need for retroactive financing of about US$350,000
or 1.2 percent of the total loan amount for expenditures incurred after
January 1, 1984.



- 15 -
2.16     Disbursements would be made for 100 percent of foreign
expenditures for all goods to be procured under the loan, and for 100
percent of foreign expenditures for consultants to be hired in accordance
with Bank guidelines (para 4.04).   Where necessary, disbursements would
include the foreign costs of installation of goods. All disbursements
would be fully documented. The closing date of the loan would be June 30,
1988.
Performance Indicators
2.17      Indicators which will assist in monitoring project
implementation and GUATEL's operational and financial performance are set
out in Annex 11. These indicators were discussed with GUATEL staff during
loan negotiations. GUATEL will include these indicators in the quarterly
project progress reports to be sent to the Bank.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
3.01      The economic analysis refers to GUATEL's 1984-87 investment
program, of which the proposed project is an integral part. Given the
existence of major functional interdependencies and joínt costs among the
ongoing works and the project's three main components (local and long
distance telephony, proposed for Bank financing; telex and international
telephony, proposed for CABEI financing; and extension to small rural
communities, IDB financing), it is not possible to evaluate separately the
Bank financed component.
Telecommunications and Economic Development
3.02      Telecommunications services benefit all sectors of Guatemala's
economy. Compared with alternative means of communication,
telecommunications are often more efficient in terms of capital and energy
consumption and user time. With adequate telecommunications facilities,
the level and variety of productive communication can be increased
considerably, and activities which would otherwise not be feasible can be
realized. In terms of the specific constraints on Guatemala's economic and
social development, telecommunications can be expected to play a
significant role especially in connection with:
(a)  reducing the cost of locating production outside
Guatemala City and its environs, thereby helping
decentralize economic activity in general;
(b)  facilitating the development of other economic
infrastructure in new areas being opened up, particularly
the Franja Transversal and El Peten, and a planned
industrial and free trade zone;



- 16 -
(e) improving the working of the market mechanism by
expediting and extending access to information as needed
to foster competition and developing trade;
(d) increasing the efficiency of transportation through
coordination of vehicle use and some substitution of
travel, resulting in energy savings and/or greater
efficiency of productive interactions for a given level
of energy consumption;
(e)  facilitating the extension of health, education,
government administration and other services to
relatively lower income rural areas, including extension
of the reach of scarce expertise for advice, support and
supervision; and
(f) mobilizing domestic savings by transfering part of
GUATEL's net income from telecommunications operations to
government (paragraph 5.05).
3.03      By the end of 1987, about 69 percent of forecast demand for
telephone connections outside of Guatemala City will be met. Telephone
service would be extended to most of the 304 seats of municipal government,
about 60 other places, and more than 500 agricultural cooperatives. With
this, the proportion of people outside Guatemala City living in localities
with some telephone service will roughly double, and for the country as a
whole it will inerease from about 25 percent in 1983 to about 35 percent in
1987. In Guatemala City, although by 1987 only about 46 percent of
forecast demand would be met, expansion would have taken place at a fast
pace (about 13 percent per annum). Telex and international telephone
services, accounting for over one-half of GUATEL's operating revenues,
would be developed to keep current with growing traffic, and data
transmission would be started on a small scale. The proposed introduction
of digital technology will provide an adequate basis for flexible
subsequent network development in response to changing demands.
Program Size and Composition
3.04      GUATEL's 1984-87 program is large given what the entity has been
able to achieve in the past (paragraph 1.18). However, it falls short of
what is needed to meet currently outstanding demand and satisfy new demand
forecast to arise in the period (paragraph 1.14). Despite GUATEL's plans
for expansion at record high rates, unmet demand is forecast to reach about
207,000 lines at the end of the program; this will actually be somewhat
higher than at its start (186,500). However, in relative terms, the number
of lines in service will have risen from about 35 percent of demand in 1983
to about 50 percent in 1987 for the country as a whole, and from about



- 17 -
29 percent to 69 percent in the provinces. Achieving this will stress
GUATEL's organization and management (paragraph 4.04) and is as fast a
development pace as can be attempted.
3.05      Within these limitations, the 1984-87 program comprises a
reasonable mix of investments designed to improve and expand service across
the country in response to forecast demand, broad regional development
priorities expressed by national policy, and sound engineering practice.
Provincial telephone exchanges will be expanded up to their present final
capacities. Expansion in Guatemala City is concentrated in those exchanges
where building space is available, in order to reduce the risk of delays.
3.06      Investment planning in the future will need to be strengthened.
Actions to this end will be undertaken during the project, in four partly
interrelated areas. First, there is uncertainty associated with the demand
forecasts (paragraph 1.16). Although the risk of overinvestment on that
account under this proposed project is negligible, more reliable
forecasting will be needed.2/ During the project GUATEL will improve its
demand forecasting, in particular to include: (a) essentially independent
forecasts based on market surveys and other sources at various levels of
aggregation, as a means to bring attention to major forecasting
uncertainties and the need for reconciling discrepancies; (b) periodic
updating of block by block surveys, so that every few years the data base
is renewed, and (c) ways for regularly comparing consolidated demand
forecasts with empirical evidence, as a means to validate and update
assumptions and forecasts. Second, the reliability of local traffic data
needs to be improved. This will be facilitated by the introduction of
digital exchanges with built-in measurement capabilities. Third, pricing
needs to be rationalized (paragraph 3.11-3.12). During the project, GUATEL
will carry out a tariff study focused on identifying users of services,
cost of service, and demand characteristics. And fourth, GUATEL needs to
consolidate its long term planning functions, including separating them
from day-to-day operational pressures, and to build up in-house economic
expertise. A provision has been included in this project to finance
experts and training to help GUATEL in carrying out these tasks under terms
of reference satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 4.04).
2/ Since the projected gap between supply and demand at the end of the
project period is large, and since there is scope for reallocating
expansion among exchanges along the way, the risk of overinvestment is
negligible. Existing demand forecasts are overall plausible but fail
to take account of the frequently observed phenomenon of accelerating
demand as the network expands and improves.

Least Cost Solution
3.07       As is the case in any country with an existing telecommunications
network, the configuration of GUATEL's present rietwork limits the number of
viable alternative solutions that could be consf'dered to achieve the
targets proposed for extending and improving service during the 1984-87
period. The tíming and dimensioning of the var-Lous work items proposed in
the program, of which this project is an integral part, are based on
engineering studies designed to introduce, where intended, electronic
digital switching techniques at the least cost. Given existing
telecommunications technology, the program as a whole represents a least
cost solution to provide the quantities and types of equipment which could
comply with GUATEL's plan targets.
Distribution of Benefits
3.08        The increased access to telecommunications in rural areas and in
smaller communities in the provinces (paragraph 3.03), together with a
potential financial cross-subsidy from urban subscribers to rural public
call offices or connections, which in the short run may not generate
sufficient revenues to cover costs, will ensure a more equitable
distribution of the benefits of telephone service in Guatemala.
3.09       Guatemala City accounts for about 76 percent of all new lines to
be connected in 1984-87. GUATEL estimates that about 70 percent of the new
lines will be connected to subscribers who would be eligible for the lower
residential tariffs (paragraph 3.12), up from about 65 percent of current
subscribers. On the basis of a sample of 1,800 outstanding residential
applications, relative to the distríbution of current subscribers there
would be an increased proportion of subscribers living in dwellings which
are typical of relatively lower income residences (26 percent versus 13
percent), and a correspondingly reduced proportion of higher income homes,
with no change in the middle income range.
3.10       GUATEL will transfer to government 45 percent of its adjusted net
income (paragraph 5.05) over the period 1984-87. This would amount to
about Q 82 million. Annual payments in following years would gradually
increase, as capacity installed under the 1984-87 program becomes more
fully utilized.
Tariffs
3.11       GUATEL's telephone tariffs are summarized in Annex 12.  They
comprise mainly a Q 400 non reimbursable connection charge (Q 300 in the
rural areas), a monthly line rental of Q 4 -Q 12 including 400 pulses of
local traffic, a charge of Q 0.02- Q 0.04 per additional pulse of local
traffíc, and a charge of between Q 0.04 and Q 0.15 per minute of domestic



- 19 -
long distance call, depending on distance and time. These charges do not
include the subscriber's telephone instruments which are purchased from
GUATEL (at Q 35.00- Q 150.00 depending on type) or from other suppliers;
likewise, the monthly service charge does not include maintenance of the
telephone instrument. A service charge increase of about 40 percent on
average took place effective May 1978. Slight adjustments in the method of
charging for long distance calls took place in 1978 and 1980; these changes
are not believed to have had significant effects on operating revenues.
3.12      Examination of the tariff structure suggests that it needs to be
reviewed. For example, the service charge for residential subscribers
(Q 4.00/month), while not including telephone maintenance, still appears
low given that it includes a free allowance for 400 local call pulses.
Call units in excess of the allowance are charged to residences at a low
Q 0.02, and at Q 0.04 to business and government subscribers, a
differentiation which bears no relation to cost. There are also numerous
miscellaneous charges too small to have any meaningful effect on user
behavior (e.g., a Q 1.00 reconnection penalty) and which probably generate
more administrative costs than revenues. The connection fee reflects an
attempt to use price to at least partly ration some of the large excess
demand. Also, as GUATEL further develops its services, expands in
provincial and rural areas, and introduces new technology, whatever
relationship its tariffs initially may have had to costs will begin to
change. Therefore, GUATEL will carry out, as part of the project, a study
of its telephone tariffs focusing on cost of service, the characteristics
of business and residential demand, forecast supply, the free call
allowance provision, and the business-residential dichotomy, while also
taking into account the goals of efficient resource allocation, equity,
regional development, and other objectives of government policy. Provision
has been made under the proposed project to finance technical assistance to
help GUATEL carry out this study under terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that GUATEL will
complete a tariff study by June 30, 1984 and furnish a plan of action to
implement its recommendations by September 30, 1984 after consultation with
the Bank.
Return on Investment
3.13      The internal financial rate of return on the 1984 - 1987
investment program, defined as the discount rate which equalizes the stream
of expected revenues attributable to the program with the stream of capital
and operating costs (at constant end 1983 price levels) is 20 percent
(Annex 13). Excluding participation payments to Government and assuming
that new subscribers added over the period will be willing to pay the same
tariffs in real terms as existing subscribers, the estimated minimum
economic rate of return of the program would be at least 35 percent.
3.14      The foregoing estimate of benefits understates total program
benefits, since it does not fully include the consumer surplus which
callers or subscribers receive, and does not fully account for all external



- 20 -
benefits associated with transport substitution, business opportunity,
administrative efficiency, etc.
Risk
3.15      There are no unusual risks associated with the program.  A
possible risk may arise out of delayed physical implementation due to
unforeseen circumstances such as delays in the execution of civil works,
receipt of material or equipment, installation of equipment and plant, and
execution of the connection program.  However, the previous project was
implemented roughly according to schedule (with the exception of the
switching equipment which was delayed due to technical problems beyond
GUATEL's control, paragraph 1.23). Moreover, in telecommunications
projects, which comprise a number of independent works, a delay in the
implementation of a few works does not generally prevent the use of other
newly-created assets. When such delays do occur, costs and revenues tend
to be deferred by roughly the same degree, so that the overall impact on
the return on investment is usually not significant. A sensitivity
analysis on the internal financial rate of return (Annex 13) indicates that
a 10 percent increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses and a
10 percent decrease in operating revenues would result in a rate of return
of about 13 percent.
IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization
4.01      GUATEL, the proposed borrower and implementing agency, is
administered by a five member Board of Directors consisting of the Minister
of Communications, who serves as chairman (ex officio), the Ministers of
External Affairs and of the Interior (ex officio) and two other directors
appointed by the President of the Republic. The general manager and the
deputy general manager, who are appointed by the Board,attend the Board's
meetings but have no voting rights. The Board and the management are
vested with adequate autonomy to carry out their duties effectively.
GUATEL's day to day business is administered by the general manager and the
deputy general manager. GUATEL's organization chart is shown in Annex 14.
GUATEL's organization is similar to that existing in other autonomous
telecommunications organizations.
4.02      GUATEL's headquarters' organization comprises five divisions, one
each dealing with administration, finance and accounting, planning and
design, operation and maintenance, and construction and supervision. Each
division is headed by a director who reports to the general manager on some
matters, and to the deputy general manager on others. Heads of some units
such as project coordination, human resources, organization and methods,
and data processing report directly to the general manager. Field
activities are directly controlled from headquarters in Guatemala City.



- 21 -
4.03      While the current organizational setup has functioned fairly
satisfactorily at the present level of GUATEL's operations, the 1984-87
period is expected to be one with a greatly expanded level of operations
(paragraph 1.19) and technical assistance will be necessary to enable
GUATEL to handle this. Though the responsibilities of each of the
divisions and units reporting directly to the general manager have been
broadly defined, detailed job descriptions for staff within the divisions
and units need to be prepared. Further, service standards and norms for
staff sanction need to be prescribed. Manpower planning (and the
subsequent recruitment and training) is done on an ad hoc basis. Hence,
major upgrading and streamlining of administration, irnprovements in work
coordination and supervision, laying down norms for operations, and
determining staff strength needed to achieve the required level of service,
are some of the items which need urgent attention to ensure good execution
of the expanded investment program.
4.04      GUATEL does not have the in-house expertise to attend to these
items and has therefore proposed to retain foreign experts to assist in:
(a) reviewing GUATEL's current organization and management to identify
major weaknesses and define any necessary changes in organization
structure; (b) strengthening the coordination and supervision of project
works, initially focusing special attention on streamlining the process of
connecting new subscribers; (c) working out general staff standards, job
descriptions and salary structures, and developing a manpower plan,
including recruitment and additional training programs (paragraphs 4.06 and
4.08); (d) improving investment planning and policy functions, including
upgrading of demand forecasting and carrying out a tariff study; (e)
reviewing and, when necessary, modifying, the operation and maintenance
procedures and (f) strengthening the accounting and financial systems
(paragraph 4.10). In total about seven man years of experts would be
required at an average cost of about US$12,000 per man month, including
travel and subsistence. It is expected that this technical assistance
component will enable GUATEL to be self sufficient in the above mentioned
areas by the end of the project implementation period. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that GUATEL will retain such experts
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
Staffing
4.05      As of December 31, 1983, GUATEL's staff totaled about 3,500.
On that date, GUATEL operated about 108,500 main línes and the staff ratio
works out to 32 per 1,000 main lines. Staff size is acceptable considering
that GUATEL maintains long distance overhead line facilities to remote
areas and a fairly large operator staff. However, after many of the
overhead lines have been replaced by radio systems and most of the long
distance traffic has been fully automated, staff productivity at the end of
the project in 1987 will have improved. Over the project period, the ratio
of staff per 1,000 lines should gradually fall from the current 32 to 25



- 22 -
per 1,000 lines in 1987 when GUATEL will be operating about 205,000 main
lines. This has been discussed during negotiations and agreed upon as one
of the performance indicators to be reviewed periodically (paragraph 2.17).
4.06      Annex 15 sets out details of the number of employees by type of
function from 1983 through 1987, the staff pay groups as of December 31,
1983, and a brief summary of service conditions. Beginning salary levels
are generally on par or, as in the case of engineers, slightly higher than
those for similar jobs in other organizations in the country. GUATEL has,
therefore, been able to recruit engineers of a good requisite quality.
However, there are no regular scales of salary and staff are normally not
given regular salary increments (except cost of living adjustments) unless
they move into a higher paid vacancy which, for most staff, is not an
available option. Hence, as staff gain experience and become more valuable
to GUATEL, they are not appropriately rewarded. Many of the older
employees, therefore, hold additional jobs. This lowers morale and
productivity, as such staff do not pay full-time attention to GUATEL's
servíce requirements. There is, therefore, a ne,ed to establish a staffing
plan with specific recruitment targets for all levels and types of staff,
together with a salary structure which would make it possible to retain
older and more experienced staff on a full time basis. The experts who
would be retained to assist in improving the organization (see paragraph
4.04) would also recommend an appropriate salary structure.
4.07      GUATEL's senior management is qualified and the entity has the
staff with the necessary potential. Given improvements in organization and
conditions of employment, GUATEL should be able to manage efficiently the
greatly expanded operations resulting from the project.
Training
4.08      The ITU has assisted GUATEL in setting up and operating a
training center which offers training in the tec]nical and administrative
fields. The technical training covers all of the specialist areas required
by the organization. In addition to training newly recruited personnel,
the center gives refresher training for existing personnel and conducts
symposia and seminars for higher management. GUATEL also makes use of
training facilities provided by other national institutions and by the
regional telecommunications training center in El Salvador. Some
specialized telecommunications training has been provided by equipment
suppliers. During 1983, GUATEL trained a total of about 1,000 staff in a
total of 108 courses, and has plans during the project period to expand the
training facilities. The technical and administrative training
arrangements are satisfactory, but training needs to be provided for the
staff of the finance department (paragraph 4.10).
Accounting
4.09      GUATEL's accounting system and procedures continue to have some
deficiencies, particularly with regard to the treatment of items such as



- 23 -
work in progress, capitalization of interest, and cash and banks. Frequent
changes in accounting procedures and the lack of adequate external audits
until 1980 (paragraph 4.13) complicated comparison of annual financial
statements. In connection with the preparation of the proposed project,
GUATEL introduced several changes recommended by the Bank which have
improved the quality of financial reporting. However, further improvements
are necessary to ensure that accounting practices followed by GUATEL are
acceptable and consistently applied.
4.10      The principal constraints in the finance department are a
shortage of qualified accounting staff (there is no in-house training
program for accounting staff) and inadequate use of modern data processing
techniques. Under the proposed project, about 24 manmonths of technical
assistance (paragraph 4.04) would be provided to the finance department as
follows: (a) preparation and initial implementation of a staff training
program (six manmonths); (b) assistance in improving and implementing
accrual accounting systems and procedures (twelve manmonths); and (c)
computer programming to meet the specific needs of the finance department,
unless adequate assistance in this area can be made available by the
supplier of the computer hardware.
4.11      At present, the only application of electronic data processing in
the finance department is for billing (paragraph 4.14). All other
accounting data are processed manually, which has created an excessive
burden on the accounting staff. GUATEL's 1984-87 investment program
includes a provision of Q 3.4 million for the purchase of a new computer
system plus peripheral equipment, including terminals for the finance
department and general programming assistance. These measures are expected
to result in a satisfactory application of data processing throughout the
finance department as well as in other departments.
4.12      By Decree of November 7, 1980, the Government instructed all
public enterprises to introduce a cash accounting system similar to its
own. Following negotiations, government confirmed that this would not be
required for enterprises with a commercial character such as GUATEL.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that GUATEL will continue to
maintain an accrual accounting system.
External Auditing Arrangements
4.13      GUATEL's accounts are subject to an internal audit and to
control-of-payments audits by the Contraloria de Cuentas, a government
auditing body. At the outset of the second project, GUATEL's accounts were
also audited by a firm of independent external auditors (Lizarralde y
Ayestas). To reduce the amount of staff time spent on dealing with the
different auditors, GUATEL experimented for several years with having the
Contraloria de Cuentas perform the external audit. This experiment was
neither satisfactory to GUATEL nor to the Bank and, effective 1980, GUATEL
engaged again the firm of Lizarralde y Ayestas (associated with Arthur
Young) for the external audit. The current arrangements are satisfactory.



- 24 -
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that GUATEL will continue to
engage external auditors satisfactory to the Bank and that it will transmit
the auditor's report to the Bank within four moonths from the end of each
fiscal year.
Billing and Collections
4.14      GUATEL has a monthly billing cycle.  Computerized bills are
prepared by the data processing department and mailed by the current
accounts division of the finance department. The bills indicate the amount
due and arrears, if any. Payment is due within one month after the date of
issuance of the bíll and can be made at local GUATEL offices or banks. If
payment is not made within two months, a notice appears on the bill
informing the customer that service is about to be cut off. Disconnection
procedures are enforced and the accounts receivable situation is
satisfactory (paragraph 5.06).
Insurance
4.15      GUATEL has a fixed assets and liability insurance policy with the
Credito Hypotecario Nacional for the period 1980 through 1985, after which
time the insurance arrangements will be reviewed. The Credito Hypotecario
is a state owned insurance company and has reinsurance arrangements with
other large insurance companies abroad. The current arrangements are
satisfactory.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Financial Performance
5.01      GUATEL's financial performance during the period 1975-82 has been
satisfactory. Under the provisions of the second project (loan 1104-GU)
GUATEL was required to meet a two-phase revenue covenant as follows: (a)
net internal cash generation should be equivalent to rates of return on net
plant in service and work in progress at the end of each year of 6 percent
in 1975, 10 percent in 1976 and 1977, and 8 percent in 1978; and (b)
operating income should yield a rate of return on revalued average net
fixed assets in service of 11 percent in 1979 and thereafter. GUATEL has
generally met these revenue covenants except in 1977, and telephone service
charges were subsequently increased by about 40 percent in May 1978. The
rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in service was about
15 percent in 1979, 17 percent in 1980 and 11 percent in 1981. Although
the rate of return fell slightly below 10 percent in 1982 and 1983
(estimated), cash flow remained satisfactory (para. 5.03).

5.02      GUATEL's financial statements for the period 1979-1982 are
presented in Annexes 16 through 18. A summary of the key indicators of the
financial performance in recent years follows:

* On revalued average net fixed assets in service.
^* As a percentage of total applications
5.03      The operating ratio increased from 65 in 1979 to 71 in 1983.  The
rates of return on the current value of average net fixed assets in service
decreased from 14.9 to 9.8; this was primarily due to a large increase in
the asset base, notably the exchanges financed under the ITT North contract
(paragraph 1.23) which, due to supplier related technical problems, had
until recently few subscribers. Net internal cash generation averaged
about 63 percent, which is satisfactory. Debt service coverage was also
satisfactory at about 2.6 on average.
Present Financial Position
5.04      A summary of GUATEL's financial position as of December 31, 1982,
is given below:

Current liabilities             25,179
Total Liabilities            179,603
Current ratio                        1.3
Debt/equity ratio                 33/67
The current ratio of 1.3 is adequate. The debt/equity ratio of 33/67 is
satisfactory and indicates that there is substantial capacity for future
borrowing. Equity has been strengthened since 1979 by Government capital
contributions equal in amount to the statutory annual payments owed by
GUATEL to the Government (paragraph 5.05).
5.05      As a Government-owned entity, GUATEL's statutes require it to pay
Government each year 45 percent of its adjusted annual net income, i.e.,
after deduction of all debt service expenses for the year, including
amortization. This de facto 45 percent incorne tax was a financial burden
on GUATEL in view of the fact that the entity was expected to finance a
large and growing share of its own construction requirements from net
internal cash generation. Consequently, GUATEL made the last such
(partial) payment to Government in 1976 on its 1975 income. For the period
1976 - 1978 no payments were made, but an amount payable of US$11.4 million
was accrued and shown on the books as a long term debt to Government, to be
repaid in equal annual installments over the period 1984-1989. This
arrangement was formalized in an Agreement between the Government and
GUATEL dated April 9, 1979. The Agreement furthermore stipulated that
Government would refund as equity contribution up to 100 percent of
GUATEL's annual payments during the period 1979 - 1983, in order to enable
GUATEL to finance as large a share as possible of its investment program



- 27 -
from net internal cash generation. Following negotiations, Government
abrogated the 1979 agreement effective retroactively to 1982. Thus, as of
1982, GUATEL has in fact resumed full payment of the 45 percent tax to
government and also made an early down payment of Q 2 million on its
1976-78 debt of Q 11.4 million.
Accounts Receivable
5.06      As of September 30, 1983, accounts receivable stood at Q 12.1
million, which is equivalent to two and a half months of billing. This
is satisfactory. Previous problems with Government arrears were resolved
during the second project's implementation period.
Asset Valuation
5.07      In connection with the preparation of the proposed project,
GUATEL engaged the services of Arevalo Perez y Asociados (partners of
Arthur Andersen) to review its fixed assets register, revalue the fixed
assets and propose asset revaluation procedures for the future. This work
has been completed.  Assets were revalued reflecting the situation as of
December 31, 1980 and have been updated in subsequent years. For the
revaluation, specific telephone equipment price indices prepared by Hardy
Witman were used; this method is acceptable.
Financing Plan
5.08      The forecast funds flow statements for the period 1984-1990 are
shown in Annex 17. They assume that GUATEL will take tariff measures
sufficient to produce a 40 percent increase in domestic call revenue,
equivalent to a 15 percent average tariff increase, effective early 1984.
This could be achieved by reducing the number of free pulses for local
calls from 400 to 200 per month (para. 3.12). A summary of the sources and
applications of funds during the project implementation period (1984-1987)

5.09      The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million (including the
front-end fee of US$0.4 million) would be at the standard variable Bank
interest rate and would have a total maturity of 15 years, including a 5
year grace period. The recently approved IDB loan of US$18.0 million
(financing the rural component of the project, paragraph 2.04) has a
maturity of 40 years, including a 10 year grace period; interest is at
1 percent per annum during the grace period and 2 percent thereafter. The
proposed CABEI loan of US$26.0 million (international network,
paragraph 2.04) would be at 12 percent and have a 15 year maturity,
including 3 years of grace. Suppliers' credits in the estimated amount of
US$40.8 million (switching equipment package, paragraph 2.07) are assumed
to have an average interest rate of 10.7 percent and a final maturity of 10
years, including a two-year grace

period.3 During the project implementation period GUATEL would finance an
average of 52 percent of total applications from net internal cash
generation, which is satisfactory. Such a contribution would cover all
local costs plus part of the equivalent of the foreign exchange required
for execution of the project. During negotiations assurances were obtained
from Government that any funds necessary for timely project completion,
including the IDB and CABEI subprojects, will be promptly made available to
GUATEL.
5.10      About 81 percent of the investments during the project
implementation period would be for the proposed project. The remainder
would be essentially for ongoing works (12 percent), including completion
of the Bank's second project (Loan 1104-GU) and for preinvestments
(7 percent) for the next five-year construction program starting in 1988.
These future construction requirements will be identified in greater detail
during the implementation period of the proposed project.
5.11      The IBRD/suppliers' project component can be executed
independently of the IDB and the CABEI project components; the latter would
finance rural and international network expansion respectively. The
implementation of the CABEI component would enhance GUATEL's revenues
starting at the earliest in 1987; therefore, a minor delay would not
adversely affect GUATEL's overall financial position during the project
implementation period.
Future Financial Performance
5.12      The forecast income statements and balance sheets of GUATEL for
the period 1984-1990 are shown in Annexes 16 and 18. Notes and assumptions
on the financial forecasts are provided in Annex 19.   A summary of the key
financial indicators for the period 1984-1987 follows:

5.13      As can be seen from the above, the financial performance of
GUATEL is expected to be satisfactory. The operating ratio would be
strong, decreasing from 69 in 1984 to 66 in 1987. Net internal cash
generation would finance on average 52 percent of applications or 60
percent of construction requirements. Debt service coverage (including
repayment of the accrued 1976-1978 deferred payments to Government, see
paragraph 5.05) would be satisfactory at about 3.0 throughout the project
period. The current ratio and the debt/equity ratio would be satisfactory,
the latter indicating ample room for future borrowing if necessary. The
rate of return on the current value of average net fixed assets in
service would range from about 13 percent in 1984 to 17 percent in 1987.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GUATEL that it will
achieve a rate of return on revalued average net fixed assets in service of
at least 12 percent in 1984 and at least 13 percent starting in 1985 and in
the years thereafter.
5.14      The investment limitation covenant of the previous Bank loan
was modified during negotiations in the sense that the amount of additional
capital expenditures subject to prior Bank approval of a financing plan
was increased from Q 1 million to Q 3 million, to reflect price increases
and the size of the proposed investment program.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GUATEL that it
will:
(a) retain experts with terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank (paragraph 4.04);
(b)  complete a tariff study by June 30, 1984 and finish a
plan of action to implement it by September 30, 1984
(paragraph 3.12);



- 31 -
(c)  continue to maintain an accrual accounting system
(paragraph 4.12);
(d)  engage external auditors satisfactory to the Bank and
submit the auditor's report to the Bank within four
months from the end of each fiscal year (paragraph 4.13);
(e)  achieve a rate of return on revalued average net fixed
assets in service of 12 percent starting in 1984 and
13 percent starting in 1985 and thereafter
(paragraph 5.13); and
(f)  not incur any additional capital expenditures in excess
of Q 3 million per annum during the project
implementation period unless a financing plan has been
approved by the Bank (paragraph 5.14).
6.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that it will promptly make available to GUATEL any funds necessary for
project completion (paragraph 5.09).
6.03      GUATEL has confirmed that all bids for the major components of
the proposed Bank subproject have been received (paragraph 2.15).
6.04      Subject to the above agreements, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$30 million for a period of 15 years, including a 5 year
period of grace and at the standard variable Bank interest rate.

ANNEX 1
GUATEMALA
EMPRESA GUATEMALTECA DE TELECOMUNICACIONES (GUATEL)
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Role of Private Enterprise in the Telecommunications Sector
1.        Domestic and foreign private entrepreneurs play an important role
in the services operated by GUATEL. As in many similar organizations in
other developing countries, most equipment and cables are procured through
international competitive bidding and construction of buildings and other
civil works are carried out by local firmns. Foreign suppliers undertake
with GUATEL support the installation of all major new types of equipment.
Local contractors have recently been used in some areas for the
construction of major cable plant (ducts, cable laying) with satisfactory
results. Contractors are also constructing open wire lines to provide
rural telephone service. In the proposed thírd project, GUATEL intends to
farm out to contractors all cable plant construction. GUATEL also intends
to ask suppliers of new type equipment to undertake its maintenance for one
year.
2.        Subscriber terminal equipment (mainly telephones, teleprinters
and PABXs) are purchased by the subscribers directly from various
suppliers, some of whom offer maintenance service (telephones can also be
bought from GIJATEL).   GUATEL intends to continue this practice during the
project period. However, in order to ensure overall equipment
compatibility and systemwide performance needed to safeguard good service
to users as well as revenue generation for GUATEL, the provision of
subscriber terminals should be subject to GUATEL specifications. GUATEL
has established these only for teleprinters. During the project period
GUATEL would set up a procedure for type approval generally applicable to
telephones, PABXs and any other terminal equipment which subscribers may
wish to connect to GUATEL lines.
3.        The current areas of private enterprise are likely to grow in
volume as GUATEL expands. Additionally, private contractors have expressed
interest in undertaking house wiring. Also, establishment of a potentially
profitable countrywide mobile telephone service interconnected with
GUATEL's regular telephone facilities could well be entrusted to local
private entrepreneurs with supplier credits or other private financing.
During supervision of the proposed third project, the Bank will encourage
GUATEL to continue to utilize and develop new opportunities for private
initiative, competition among contractors leading to lower costs, and
establishment of the necessary related regulation and quality of
supervision.

THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Rate of Return on Investments
1.        GUATEL's investment program for the period 1984-1987, of which the
project is an integral part, also includes ongcing and other works. The
close relationship between project and non project investments makes any
attempt at separation arbitrary. Therefore, thie rate of return calculation
is made on the basis of GUATEL's entire 1984-1987 telecommunications
investment program, excluding preinvestments for its 1987-1991 program.
2.        The net benefit period extends from 1984 to 2003 when, on average,
equipment provided under the program will have finished its useful life.
3.        As from 1988 on, operating costs and revenues related to the
program are assumed to remain constant. Incremental revenues are based on
expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and traffic brought about
by the program. Operating costs are based on additional costs generated by
the increases in costs and traffic; they are net of depreciation, interest,
taxes and duties. No residual values of fixed assets have been taken into
account as the discounted real value of these would be minimal.
4.        A summary of the cost and benefit stream is given below in Q
million. All revenues and costs have been deflated by the expected average
annual inflation rate of 10 percent to bring them to their comparable end
1983 price levels.
Capital       Incremental Operating      Net
Year         Expenditures    Costs        Revenues    Benefits
1984            34,475               0           0    (34,475)
1985           68,257            5,321      15,654    (57,924)
1986            53,570           7,948     28,179    (33,339)
1987            18,865          12,300     41,723      10,558
1988 - 2003       0             17,480      52,948     35,468
The net benefit stream above results in a financial rate of return of 20%.

5.         A sensitivity analysis was performed with the following results:
10%  increase in capital expenditures:            17%
10%  increase in operating expenses:             18%
10%  decrease in operating revenues:             16%
Combination of all of the above factors:          13%
6.         Excluding participation payments to Governnent and assuming that
new subscribers are willing to pay the same tariffs in real terms as existing
subscribers were in 1983, the rate of return for the program is 35%.
