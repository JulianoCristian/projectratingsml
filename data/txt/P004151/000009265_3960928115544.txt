MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A SECOND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Korea for US$31.6 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The proposed Loan would be repayable in 15 years including 5 years of grace at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance a technology
advancement project.
2.       Background.  In the 1980s, technology development in Korea has been
moving from a stage characterized by the local assimilation of imported
technology to one which is emphasizing increasingly the pursuit of indigenous
technological innovation. In the previous two decades of assimilating
imported technology, Korea concentrated on mastering productior, technologies
and the need for technological innovation was modest. However, if Korea is to
continue its industrial development towards technologically sophisticated,
higher value-added output and remain competitive in export markets, a strong
commitment must be made to ensuring that the country's R&D system can respond
to the increasing demand for more advanced technological development. This
system consists of three major parts: the ten national research institutes
which focus on basic and applied research, the universities which are oriented
towards basic research and the private sector research institutes which focus
on applied and developmental research. Reinforcing the need to pursue
advanced technology is the growing reluctance of the leading industrial
countries to continue exporting advanced technology to Korea, which has become
an increasingly successful competitor.
3.       The Government aims to achieve, by around 2000, a level of technology
comparable to the present level of the advanced countries. A long term
technology development plan sets out the major goals to be achieved and the
key technological fields to be developed in order to meet these goals. The
plan has two major objectives.  First, to expand the supply of high-level R&D
personnel from the level of 13 per 10,000 population in 1986 to 30 per 10,000
by 2001. To achieve this goal, Korea would need to employ about 150,000
scientists and engineers by 2001 compared with 52,000 in employment in 1986.
In response to this need, a rapid expansion of enrollments in science and
engineering programs has been undertaken in recent years. Within the
universities even greater emphasis has been placed on graduate programs and
the results are now being seen in the rapid growth of outputs with graduate
degrees in science and engineering--almost 2.4 times between 1982 and 1988.
Given this rate of expansion, it is certain that the overall objective for the
employment of R&D personnel will be achieved by 2001. Second, R&D investment
is planned to increase from 2Z of GNP in 1986 to 51 by 2001 with the private
sector being responsible for the major R&D effort. A massive increase in
overall R&D expenditure has been achieved (nearly nine-fold in 1980-87)
largely driven by the private sector's response to generous tax and other
financial incentives to invest in R&D. Consequently, the private sector now
accounts for nearly 8O of total R&D expenditure.



4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has been assisting the
development of technology in Korea over the past decade in a series of
operations. The Bank has provided support to the small and medium industry
(SMI) sector and substantial assistance in financing R&D projects through
various financial intermediaries; strengthening the institutional capacity of
these intermediaries has also been pursued. Major assistance has been
provided for the development of technical and scientific education.
Underlying these operations has been a continuous dialogue between the Bank
and Government which has had an important influence on the country's
industrial development. The Bank's operations have been consistent with the
Government's priorities and evaluation reports indicate that their objectives
have generally been met successfully.
5.       The policy environment in which the proposed project is being
designed is generally sound, having developed over the last decade with the
Bank's assistance under two sector loans which supported improvements in the
policy framework governing education and research in science and technology.
At this stage in Korea's development, the Bank is again pursuing project
lending as a means of assisting the Government in filling gaps in the
investment program required to upgrade the research capacity of the national
institutes and in selected centers of excellence in science and ergineering
education. The First Technology Advancement Project, approved in April 1989,
is assisting two national R&D institutions to improve their capacity to
provide advice and technical services to SMIs through strengthening basic R&D
activities and quality testing for their products. It is also assisting in
improving the quality of science and engineering education at the Korea
Institute of Technology. The proposed project would continue to address the
needs of similar institutions which the Government has identified as requiring
additional quality-improving investments and which the Bank is well-qualified
to provide. The project would continue the opportunity for the Bank to learn
lessons from Korea's experience in technology development which could be
utilized elsewhere.
6.       Project Oujectives.  The broad objective of the project is to
reinforce the Government's priority for technology-intensive industrial
development by strengthening basic R&D capacity and enhancing the application
of industrial standards to raise the quality of products. The project aims
to: (a) improve the quality of research programs and the graduate education
in science and engineering associated with them at the Korea Advanced
Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST); (b) enhance the R&D capacity of
the Genetic Engineering Center (GEC) and the quality of its support to the
bio-technology industry; (c) improve the ability of the Korea Institute of
Energy and Resources (KIER) to undertake basic R&D in support of industry in
the energy and resources fields and strengthen its energy survey capacity; and
(d) enhance the development of national standards to ensure the quality of
industrial products especially in the export sectors through strengthening the
R&D capacity of the Korea Standards Research Institute (KSRI).
7.       Project Description.  The major component of the project would be
equipment to be financed by the Bank amounting to about 69Z of total project
costs. The Government would finance complementary inputs namely civil works
to house some of the equipment (6Z); and installation costs, O&M and



- 3 -
consumables related to the equipment (1OZ); and all contingencies (15Z). The
proposed Bank loan, to be disbursed over a period of four years, would finance
items of advanced equipment (baseline cost, US$31.6 million) for four national
institutions which play important roles in Korea's industrial/technological
development. The loan would finance about 83X of the estimated foreign
exchange cost of the project or about 69Z of total project costs. Project
implementation would be tne responsibility of each project institution with
the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) playing an overall coordinating
role. Equipment procurement would be undertaken by the Office of Supply,
Republic of Korea (OSROK) in conjunction uith the project institutions. About
85Z of the value of equipment would be procured under ICB. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the dishursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8204-KO dated April 23,
1990, is being distributed separately.
8.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that semi-annual progress
reports from each project institution would be submitted to the Bank around
March and September and status reports provided to visiting missions.
9.       Benefits.  The project would strengthen industrial R&D and raise the
quality of training of high-level R&D personnel. It would also improve the
quality of the Government's advice and techni'.al services to the energy and
resources industries, thereby contributing to a more effective exploitation of
energy and natural resources. The project would result in the application of
more rigorous standards to the quality of industrial products thereby making
them more competitive in domestic and export markets.
10.      Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the proposed
project.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
