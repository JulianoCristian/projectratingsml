viability of income generation activities in the buffer zones of Protected Areas, and to 
prepare subprojects (including Revenue Generation Subprojects) to apply any such 
mechanisms or activities.   
3. 
Implementation of Revenue Generation Subprojects in  Protected Areas and the 
buffer zones thereto. 
Part D

(a) 
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Recipient shall furnish

shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the Recipient. Such 
Page  39

further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall have 
been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the 
date of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures. 
6. 
(a) 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any payment out of the 
Special Account: (i) was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to 
paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence furnished to the 
Bank, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide such 
additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or,

otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall be made 
until the Recipient has provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the 
case may be. 
(b) 
If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any amount 
outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover further payments for 
eligible expenditures, the Recipient shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
