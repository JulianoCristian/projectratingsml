"Final", "abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Amazon Region Protected\n            Areas Project (ARPA) for Brazil were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: like all project locales, the Amazon is a\n            unique region that presents a highly challenging environment\n            to work in, particularly in the conservation of biodiversity\n            where many of the candidate sites are in the more\n            inaccessible areas. Add to this a low and sparsely\n            distributed population with few service providers and\n            difficulties in launching any effort that requires extensive\n            public participation, preparation of management plans,\n            purchase of equipment, construction of infrastructure and\n            the associated communications, processes and procedures that\n            accompany these activities are bound to occur. It is almost\n            always more cost-efficient to factor in local\n            characteristics in project design even at additional cost in\n            time and resources, than attempt mid-course corrections as\n            they develop in implementation. Preparation of second ARPA\n            incorporates this lesson in project design. Of particular\n            relevance is to ensure to factor in 'premiums' in\n            terms of costs and time over similar operations elsewhere in\n            the country to better gauge project costs and calendars to\n            reduce risk of overestimating the achievement of outcomes\n            and outputs during project implementation. ARPA trust fund\n            was the first of its kind to be established in Brazil. The\n            fund was designed to address financial shortfalls from the\n            public purse to cover the recurrent costs of Protected Areas\n            (PAs). However, ARPA successful efforts to create so many\n            new PAs, particularly 'sustainable use' PAs, was\n            not anticipated in the initial trust fund design. But only\n            now, after almost six years of implementation, solid\n            financial records are available with data that can serve as\n            a basis for projecting expending needs for PAs, thus\n            allowing more regular updates of the need based on the\n            number of PAs entering the ARPA system and benefiting from\n            the trust fund revenues."}, "docdt": "2009-06-22T00:00:00Z"}
