F. Results Framework Analysis
Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators(as approved)
The overall objective of the Amazon Region Protected Areas Project (ARPA or the
Project) is to expand and consolidate the protected areas (PAs) system in the Amazon
region of Brazil. The proposed Project would be the first phase (Phase 1) of a 10-year
ARPA program. The Project's objective will be achieved by:
  Creating 18 million hectares in new protected areas (9 million hectares of strict
protection PAs and 9 million hectares of sustainable use. The 11 Sustainable use
protected areas have the goal of conserving biodiversity as well as supporting the
communities living in them. These protected areas are regulated by management plans
that include various use zones, some of which protect key environmental values of these
areas, including, in particular, a strict protection zone. ARPA will support only
surveillance and enforcement activities in the sustainable use protected areas to ensure
ecological integrity and biodiversity conservation.

  Other objectives include:
  - Consolidating the management of 7 million hectares of existing strict protection PAs
in addition to 9 million hectares of the newly created strict protection PAs
  -    Establishing and operating an endowment fund to meet the recurrent costs of
protected areas
  -   Establishing and operating a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system at the
protected area and regional levels

  The key performance indicators for Phase I are:
  - 23 ecoregions in the Brazilian Amazon analyzed for identification of new PAs
  -   18 million hectares of new PAs (9 million hectares of strict protection PAs and 9
million hectares of sustainable use PAs) created
  -   7 million hectares of existing strict protection PAs and 3 million hectares of new
strict protection PAs consolidated and managed
  -    An endowment fund for financial sustainability of existing strict protection PAs
established and capitalized with a minimum of US$14.5 million
  - Demonstration projects for financial sustainability of PAs implemented
  -      An environmental monitoring methodology for specific PAs defined and
implemented
  -   Program Committee, Conflict Mediation Committee, and two project coordination
units (one in the Ministry of Environment (MMA) and one in the Brazilian Biodiversity
Fund (FUNBIO) created and operational

The Amazon Region Protected Areas Project (ARPA) is a three phased, 10 year program
designed to conserve biodiversity of global importance in Brazil's Amazon Region. The
Program represents an innovative initiative in promoting a public-private partnership and
participatory approach at a scale that has never been attempted before in the country. It
also provides the framework to bring different levels of government, civil society and
financing partners together in a coordinated and collaborative effort to address and
achieve project goals and objectives.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

a. Country and Sector Background: Brazil's Legal Amazon1 Region occupies about 5
million km2 of land, but is occupied (at the time of the project appraisal) by only an
estimated 25 million people, the majority who live in urban areas. The region represents
the largest area of remaining tropical rain forest in the world (approximately 30 percent)
and is estimated to contain carbon stores of around 120 billion tons. Because the area is
still relatively intact, it is thought to exert a significant influence on regional and global
climate. The Region has been classified into 23 ecoregions and supports biodiversity of
global significance. Despite the Region's global importance it is threatened by
deforestation associated with economic development dominated by agriculture expansion,
ranching, logging, mining and settlement policies. Poorly planned and managed
economic development in the area has contributed to increasing loss of tropical forest,
degradation of watersheds and overexploitation of wildlife and fisheries. Any long-term
and sustainable approach to the issue will require a reduction in poverty, provision of
viable and environmentally sustainable economic alternatives and strengthening of the
protection of priority ecosystems. At the time of preparation, the Brazilian government's
investment in the Amazon's protected areas (PA) was limited, estimated to be less than
US $3.5 million per year distributed over 30 areas.

b. Institutional Framework: The management of protected areas in the Brazilian
Amazon is the responsibility of two federal institutions: the Ministry of Environment
(MMA) and MMA's autonomous Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable
Natural Resources (IBAMA). In 2007, a new agency, Instituto Chico Mendes de
Conservação de Biodiversidade (ICMBio) was spun out from IBAMA and made solely
responsible for the administration of federal PAs. State and municipal governments also
have responsibilities for the creation and administration of PAs that fall within their
respective mandates. At the State level this typically is the responsibility of an
environmental line agency.



1Legal Amazon is a political designation for an area covering all northern states (Amazonas, Pará, Acre,
Amapá, Tocantins, Roraima, and Rondônia) plus the state of Mato Grosso, and part of the Maranhão state,
totaling approximately 5.1 million km2, which include Amazon forest and transitional vegetation. The
Brazilian Amazon biome designates the area covered exclusively by the Amazon biome within the country,
totaling approximately 4.1 million km2.




                                                     7

c. Biodiversity Conservation and Natural Resources Management: The legal context
for the country's protected areas is based on Brazil's National System of Conservation
Units (SNUC) law passed in July 2000. This law declared the objective of the system to
be the maintenance of biological diversity and genetic resources to be achieved through
the establishment of a uniform legal basis, concept and methodology for the many
government agencies at all levels of government to consolidate their respective PAs.
This directly led to the creation of a National System of Protected Areas designed to
maintain biological diversity and genetic resources. Specifically, the new system defined
the responsibility and categorization of protected areas, established rules for their
management and provided for property ownership. It also recognized two broad
categories of protected areas: (a) "strict protection" PAs (e.g., national parks, biological
reserves and ecological stations), which are those areas created primarily for conservation
objectives and prohibit the exploitation of natural resources and other productive
activities; and (b) "sustainable use" PAs (e.g., extractive reserves and sustainable use
reserves) that allow for the direct use and exploitation of natural resources following
norms stipulated in their respective management plan.

d. Indigenous Legal Framework: In the Brazilian Amazon, the indigenous population is
estimated to be 326,000. Indigenous lands cover some 946,450 km2 which corresponds to
22 percent of the area of the Legal Amazon. The country's 1988 Constitution provides
the legal framework for the recognition of indigenous people's rights to their traditional
territories. The aforementioned SNUC Law established the legal framework for
"traditional peoples" to participate in the establishment and management of protected
areas. This includes local populations' participation (including indigenous peoples) in the
creation, implementation and management of PAs and in the establishment of PA
management councils.

e. The Project in the CAS: The relevant CAS at the time of appraisal focused on policies
that contributed to the reduction of poverty and/or were compatible with promoting
renewed economic growth but stressed the need that environmental management become
an integral part of Brazil's overall development strategy. The CAS specifically
recognized the significance of continued deforestation in the Amazon region and outlined
a strategy that addressed the issue. It further noted that the complexity of the issue as
well as identified the associated underlying factors that would need to be addressed to
have any impact in arresting the loss of forest and associated biodiversity. A key element
in the strategy was the identification and protection of priority ecosystems.

f. Consistency with GEF Strategic Priorities: ARPA supported GEF's Global
Operational Strategy by supporting the Biodiversity Focal Area through contributing to
the long-term protection of Brazil's globally important ecosystems. Specifically, the
Program was in conformity with GEF's Operational Program (OP) # 3 (Forest
Ecosystems) and OP # 2 (Freshwater Ecosystems) and targeted the following GEF
priorities: (a) in situ conservation of globally unique biodiversity, (b) sustainable use of
biodiversity and (c) local participation in the benefits of conservation activities.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Project Development Objective (PDO) was "to expand and consolidate the protected
areas (PAs) system in the Amazon region of Brazil." The proposed Project (the Project)
would be the Phase 1 of a 10-year ARPA Program (the Program). The PDO would be
achieved by:

     Creating 18 million hectares (ha) in new protected areas (9 million ha of "strict
     protection" PAs and 9 million ha of "sustainable use" PAs);
     Consolidating the management 7 million ha of existing "strict protection" PAs in
     addition to 9 million ha of the newly created "strict protection" PAs;
     Establishing and operating an endowment fund to meet the recurrent costs of
     protected areas; and
     Establishing and operating a biodiversity monitoring and evaluation system at the
     protected area and regional levels.

The key performance indicators for Phase 1 were:

     23 ecoregions in the Brazilian Amazon analyzed for identification of new PAs;
     18 million ha of new PAs (9 million ha of "strict protection" PAs and 9 million has
     of "sustainable use" PAs) created;
     7 million ha of existing "strict protection" PAs and 3 million ha of new "strict
     protection" PAs consolidated and managed;
     An endowment fund for financial sustainability of existing strict protection PAs
     established and capitalized with a minimum of US$14.5 million;
     Demonstration projects for financial sustainability of PAs implemented;
     An environmental monitoring methodology for specific PAs defined and
     implemented; and a
     Program Committee, Conflict Mediation Committee, and two project coordination
     units (one in the Ministry of Environment (MMA) and one in the Brazilian
     Biodiversity Fund (FUNBIO) created and operational.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main beneficiaries identified in the PAD were those local populations that would
benefit from improvements in the quality and management of biodiversity and natural
resources in the Amazon region at the federal, state, municipal and local levels. The
country and government were also identified as beneficiaries of national and regional
benefits. Under the Project's first component, ARPA would support an on-going process
to prioritize ecosystems in the Amazon region subsequent to which the Project would
support the creation of PAs to conserve representative samples. The identification and


                                            9

implementation of sustainable use and revenue generating sub-projects would follow
through a participatory process. As a result, no quantification of beneficiaries was
attempted at the time of project appraisal.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Creation of New Protected Areas (US$ 2.2 million, corresponding to
7.3 % of GEF grant).

The main objective of the component was the identification and legal creation of new
PAs in Brazil's Amazon region. It was justified on the basis that the region still has large
expanses of remote and under populated areas characterized by rich biodiversity.
Moreover, many of these areas are unclaimed governmental lands. This facilitates the
legal creation of PAs but represents a risk to encroachment in the absence of legal
designation. Combined with public awareness such an approach was thought to provide
for an economically efficient means to conserve biodiversity. The approach to the
component was sequential, entailing: (a) the completion of an analysis of 23 ecoregions
in the Region as a precursor to the identification of priority candidate sites and the
creation of new protected areas, (b) the legal creation of new PAs and (c) provision of
minimal support for their establishment (i.e., demarcation, land regularization, minimal
infrastructure etc.). This component contained the following sub-components:

1.1. On-going Process of Prioritization
1.2. Identification of New Areas
1.3. Establishment of New Areas

Component 2: Consolidation of Protected Areas (US$ 4.6 million, corresponding to
15.3 % of GEF grant).

The objective of this component was to provide the necessary follow-up to newly created
PAs supported under Component 1 as well as existing "strict protection" PA resulting in
their consolidation and long-term sustainability. Specifically, this component was
designed to promote the implementation of existing and recently created PAs and their
buffer zones in the Amazon region. In contrast to Component 1, a number of activities
under this component were designed to be implemented in parallel, providing support to
demarcate existing "strict protection" areas bringing them up to the standards of newly
created PAs (demarcation), while initiating basic protection in existing and new PAs
(basic protection) while the management plans were being prepared (management
planning). These activities were to be supported by promoting community participation
and training of different stakeholders in PA management topics, systems, and programs
as well as community development sub-projects. This component contained the following
sub-components:

2.1. Demarcation of Existing Areas
2.2. Basic Protection (for both existing and newly created PAs)
2.3. Management Planning
2.4. Community Participation


                                             10

2.5. Training

Component 3: Long-term Sustainability of Protected Areas (US$ 17.3 million,
corresponding to 57.7 % of GEF grant).

The objective of the component was to support the creation and implementation of
financial management and cost recovery mechanisms required to ensure the long-term
management and financial sustainability of both existing and newly created Amazon PAs.
This component was based on the assumption that the government would not have
sufficient resources to support the long term needs of the PAs created and consolidated
under ARPA. This would be achieved primarily through the establishment of an
endowment fund (FAP) for the protected areas system in the Amazon region. The
component would also support a series of studies and sub-projects developed to define
and test appropriate revenue-generating mechanisms in support of PA sustainability. This
component contained the following sub-components:

3.1. Protected Areas Endowment Fund (FAP)
3.2. Studies and Sub-projects in Buffer Zones

Component 4: Protected Area Monitoring (US$ 2.4 million, corresponding to 8.0 % of
GEF grant).

Under this component, ARPA was to establish an environment and evaluation system of
PAs. Specifically, the component was to support the creation of a biodiversity monitoring
and analysis system for new and existing PAs designed to contribute to improved
decision-making and planning and programming through making available more accurate
and reliable information and promote increased management effectiveness in project
supported PAs. In addition to technical monitoring, the system would also monitor and
measure the fulfillment of project objectives. This component had the following sub-
components:

4.1. Biodiversity Monitoring System
4.2. Training

Component 5: Project Coordination and Management (US$ 3.5 million,
corresponding to 11.7% of GEF grant).

The objective of the component was to support the overall coordination of ARPA's other
components in MMA, IBAMA and FUNBIO. The component would support the set up,
staffing and operational costs of the ARPA's Project Coordination Unit (PCU) housed in
MMA. The component was also to finance the set up, staffing and operational costs of
PROARPA (the Program coordinating unit created within FUNBIO) that was to be
responsible for procurement, disbursement and financial execution, creation and
operation of the FAP and the execution of several studies and sub-projects under
Components 2 and 3. There were no sub-components.

1.6 Revised Components

Components were not revised during execution.

1.7 Other significant changes

Amendments to the Grant Agreement. There were two amendments processed to the
grant agreement (TF-051240) with FUNBIO.

a. Change in Denomination of the GEF Trust Fund. The first amendment was signed
on October 29, 2003 consisting of: (a) a proposed adjustment to the Grant Agreement in
response to the recent approval taken by the Executive Directors of the Bank to re-
denominate the GEF Grants in Special Drawing Rights to United States Dollars; and (b) a
simplification in the audit reporting requirements of the Bank. The changes were relevant
to Section 1.01 (b), Section 2.01. 4.01 (a), (b), (c) and Schedule 1 of the Grant Agreement.

b. Changes to Increase Efficiency in Project Implementation. A second amendment
was signed on September 10, 2004 in response to a request from FUNBIO to: (a) change
the title of the Grant recipient (Section 7.01); (b) amend Schedule 1 of the Grant
Agreement to (i) redefine incremental costs to include shipment costs and salaries of the
Recipient's staff employed for purposes of working in project coordination and
management activities (table set forth in paragraph 1); (ii) modify the requirement to
submit "draft" management plans to the Bank for approval prior to a withdrawal under
Sustainable Use Subproject and Revenue Generation subcomponent by eliminating the
word draft (paragraph 3 (b) (i)); (c) amend Schedule 3 by making changes in use of
individual consultants (Schedule 3, Part C.3 of Section II); and (d) amend Schedule 6,
paragraph 1(e).

Extension of Project Closing Date. The extension of closing date was signed on June 4,
2007 in response to a request from FUNBIO, changing the closing date of June 30, 2007
to December 31, 2008 (Section 2.03). This was required to disburse all GEF grant funds
and achieve the global objectives and was approved by the Country Director. The project
was also granted a grace period until April 30, 2009.

Planning for Budget Shortfalls. In preparing the final Annual Operating Plan (POA) for
the project (an 18 month budget to cover the period to July 2009) the PCU together with
FUNBIO confirmed that available funds were insufficient to cover all the activities
proposed in the initial 2008 draft POA. As a result a rationalization and prioritization of
resources for the remaining period was required and adjustments were made in the POA.
In addition, residual GEF resources originally destined to support IBAMA's Sistema de
Monitoramento Ambiental para Unidades de Conservação (SIMBIO) under Component
4 - Monitoring, were reallocated to cover projected short falls in recurrent costs that were
the main instrument for PA implementation, due to the flexibility of ARPA's independent
financial mechanism, which gave PA staff the ability to respond in "real time" to the
challenges posed by the magnitude and isolation of the Amazon Region.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Program's origins can be traced back to Brazil President Cardoso's April 1998
announcement to conserve at least 10 percent of all of the country's forest types as a
national priority. This provided the basis to conceptualize ARPA and prepare a request
for funding to support project preparation provided through a GEF Block B grant which
became available in April 1999. An Advisory Committee to oversee project preparation
was established. The Committee comprised the World Bank and principal government
ministry and NGO project sponsors, including MMA/IBAMA and the WWF. To
elaborate the proposal, the Committee, in turn, created a task force composed of MMA,
IBAMA, WWF, the World Bank, and environmental specialists. Local groups, NGOs,
and aid agencies consulted during this initial organizing phase included FUNATURA,
USAID, ISPN, the Nature Conservancy (TNC), the British Council, Grupo de Trabalho
da Amazonia (GTA), Rede Brasil de Bancos Multilaterais, GTZ, UNDP, and Instituto
Socio Ambiental (ISA).

In addition, the proposal was submitted for comments to social organizations in the
Amazon (GTA, CNS, CONTAG, COIAB, and ASMUBIP) and to FUNBIO's Board
which has a broad NGO representation. Two workshops were organized, one in Rondônia
and one in Roraima, financed by the WWF/WB Alliance, to create a set of new areas and
develop a methodology for public consultation during project implementation. These
workshops were carried out in October and November 2000. Though no official
evaluation of quality of entry was done at the time of effectiveness, preparation
documents and project design were considered satisfactory.

a. Consistency. At the time of appraisal the Project was fully consistent with the
priorities of the country with respect to both its main objective of biodiversity
conservation and its geographical focus in the Amazon. It was also fully consistent with
both GEF priorities and the Bank's CAS.

b. Soundness of the Background Analysis. The technical analysis on which the Project
was designed was sound. Much of this analysis built on a number of earlier participatory
activities some of which started long before the approval of the GEF preparatory grant.
These included the 1990 workshop in Manaus followed by a number of priority setting
exercises supported under PROBIO, a GEF supported project launched in 1996 under the
auspices of MMA. These in turn provided the basis for the Macapá priority setting
workshop in September 1999 that engaged representatives from civil society, NGOs,
indigenous peoples and public and private sector to identify proposed candidate PAs to
be supported under ARPA. After that the Macapá workshop consultations with a number
of additional regional organizations that included all 9 Amazon states were also
completed.

Detailed guidance provided in the PAD reflected the depth of this analysis particularly
with respect to the process and criteria guiding the evolution of PAs and the role of public



                                             13

consultation in this process. The analysis of institutional and operational issues was less
robust than the technical analysis, but the unique conditions characteristic of the Amazon,
were taken into account during project implementation. These conditions included: (a)
the cost "premium" for the provision of "goods and services" including their transport,
(b) the lack of supply of locally based providers of same "goods and services" including
contractors to build infrastructure and its significance to meeting Bank procurement
requirements, (c) the low capacity at both the project and PA levels and (d) the low
relevance of revenue generating sub-projects to ARPA supported PAs in the Amazon.
Finally, despite FUNBIO's successful record in implementing an earlier GEF project, the
"learning curve" was underestimated for the procurement of goods and services.

c. Adequacy of Project Design. The Project had a long and at times difficult preparation
reflecting the complexity of issues and underlying factors associated with conservation of
biodiversity in the Amazon. These issues revolved around: (a) defining the respective
roles of government and the private sector particularly with respect to Finance and
Treasury; an issue that was further complicated with a change of government; (b) criteria
(and associated government commitments) required to be met before PAs pass between
phases of creation and consolidation; and (c) turnover in project preparation coordinator
(5 coordinators in life of project preparation). However, these initial difficulties were
eventually overcome. The initial problems in defining the roles of MMA and FUNBIO
were solved, and their partnership was the underlying driver of much of ARPA project
success. The consolidation criteria were defined with a strong methodology in the initial
stages of implementation and the Coordination Unit experienced personnel stability
through most of the implementation phase.

In light of the nature, scale and complexity of issues associated with supporting any
significant effort to conserve large stands of Amazon, the multi-phase program approach
using well-defined "triggers" to determine the passage between phases was a sound
model. In addition to the logistical constraints faced in working in the Region other
factors that should have been given fuller consideration in determining the Project's
scope, scale and calendar of activities included the novelty of the project's public-private
sector approach, lack of experience and local knowledge of working in the Amazon
among some of the institutional stakeholders and the number and layers of institutions
participating in the Project. Though the 4 year project duration was a Government
requirement for externally funded projects, project design should have been adapted to
accommodate this requirement.

At the component level, project design was logical and relatively easy to discern
consisting of support for the on-going process of prioritization of PAs sites followed by
their creation (component 1), consolidation and institutional strengthening to ensure their
long­term technical sustainability (component 2), creating a financial management
mechanism that would ensure their long term financial sustainability (component 3),
monitoring and evaluation of the results of on-the-ground efforts to conserve biodiversity
and overall project progress (component 4) and project management (component 5). The
sequencing of project components while sound assumes all project outcomes and outputs
derived from preceding activities would be achieved according to plan. This rarely



                                             14

happens in practice and delays associated with establishment of the teams in the
executing agencies, change in government and low procurement capacity immediately
began to affect progress in other activities across several components located further
"downstream" in the process. Related to this issue of sequencing was confusion in
attempting to discern discrete phases (i.e., end points) of what is in effect a continuum in
process of creation and consolidation of a PA.

The inclusion of "sustainable use" PAs later in project preparation contributed to a
number of changes in project design (e.g., new Bank safeguard policies were triggered
and adjustments in project budget), which added delays in the project preparation
schedule. However, the inclusion of "sustainable use" PAs was fundamental for
ownership by project stakeholders.

d. Assessment of Risks. Risk identification and severity assessment was comprehensive
and generally accurate. Risks that were identified that later manifested themselves during
project implementation were: (a) degree of government support following elections, (b)
counterpart financing, (c) instability of financial markets, (d) complexity of
environmental and project monitoring, and (e) institutional complexity contributing to
delays in implementation. The mitigation measures proposed in the PAD varied in their
relevance and effectiveness as described below.

e. Lessons Learned From other Projects. Project design reflected a number of
experiences derived from previous projects supported by the Bank and other donors in
Brazil. Critical inputs incorporated into ARPA design derived from these projects
included: (a) the approach to strengthening PAs in Brazil, (b) the importance and means
to encourage public participation in project design and implementation, and (c) a number
of "lessons learned" derived from the creation of the financial mechanism associated with
the earlier GEF supported FUNBIO project and for the protected areas fund established
under the Mexico protected areas project (SINAP). ARPA design benefitted from an
international workshop held in the Galapagos Islands in June, 2000.             A Brazilian
delegation comprised by government, civil society and academic sector representatives
joined a group of 40 international professionals from Latin America to discuss the
establishment of and endowment fund for protected areas within the design of ARPA.
Among the experts, were the directors of two of the most successful protected areas
endowment funds in the world (FMCN, Mecio and Profonanpe, Peru).

2.2 Implementation

The Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program has been considered by many
international organizations as the world's largest tropical forest conservation program.
ARPA was set as an ambitious 12-year effort to ensure comprehensive protection of the
Brazilian Amazon. To accomplish this goal, the Brazilian government partners with
international financing organizations to create a system of well-managed strict
preservation areas and sustainable use reserves.

The first phase of ARPA began in 2003 and ended in 2008. ARPA has doubled the
amount of the Brazilian Amazon under strict protection ­ from the 3.2% (12 million ha)


                                             15

at the start of the project2 to over 25 million ha today. The addition of another 10 million
ha in sustainable use areas meets two societal needs in Brazil ­ conserving biodiversity
and providing improved livelihoods for traditional forest dwellers.

The ARPA project has successfully engaged 5 state governments (Mato Grosso, Acre,
Tocantins, Rondônia and Amazonas) in creating and managing their own state PAs and
strengthening their state environmental infrastructure. Other states all worked with the
federal government (at different levels of commitment) to create new federal protected
areas and sustainable use PAs. ARPA's efforts to institutionalize the political will and
increase support for conservation goals as part of the mandate for state governance is an
important contribution to state capacity in the Amazon.

ARPA managed to work during its first phase implementation in an high profile national
and global setting, often facing very difficult political and social conditions. As such it
has tackled some of the most formidable concerns in ecosystem protection today:
enforcement of environmental laws in remote areas; the needs and aspirations of rural
people for improved livelihoods; and the valuing and funding of conservation activities
against a wider backdrop of ongoing resource exploitation. ARPA in its first phase has
built the capacity of key partner organizations to address these issues through their work
implementing this complex project in numerous protected areas across the Amazon.

Project implementation can be divided into three stages defined by the following
characteristics: (a) a two year start up stage that was largely focused on staffing up and
training in the executing agencies (PCU and FUNBIO), establishing project agreements
with State and other line government agencies, executing institutions learning how to
work together, and a change of government (2003/2005); (b) a two year period where
procurement, disbursement and institutional arrangements began to come together when
ARPA reached its operational peak, reaching significant results in the field, especially in
the creation of new areas (2005/2006); (c) the creation of ICMBio and a 4-month strike
that slowed previous implementation pace. ICMBio's role was consolidated and the
project returns to its previous implementation mode. But close to the end of the year,
financial shortfalls forced a prioritization of project supported activities. (2008/2009).

In order to overcome some of the administrative challenges, ARPA developed several
innovative internet-based systems to track protected area management status (SisARPA)
and allow partners to track procurement requests and other financial transactions
("Cerebro"). Joining these innovations is the much praised "conta vinculada" or
"conjoined account" that allows a direct flow of resources from FUNBIO to protected
area managers. This system avoids the problems often inherent in a government
bureaucracy while providing ready accountability through an efficient receipt and
documentation system. Given that numerous other Amazonian environmental projects
managed by government agencies have been unable to successfully expend funds in a
regular and sustained way on site, the conta vinculada is an essential contribution to

ARPA success.         In contrast to so many other programs, 95% of GEF funds were
expended ­ in large part thanks to this administrative innovation.

Government Turnover and Reorganization. At an institutional level, over the 6 year
implementation period the Project experienced two election cycles and the associated
delays involving changes in personnel and processes. This was particularly significant
with the first changeover in government bringing in a new party that had no previous
involvement with ARPA's preparation. Despite the creation of a transition team to
facilitate turnover of the project between the two governments, the loss of personnel in
the final days of the Cardoso government contributed to the absence of critical decision-
making and appears to have been a major factor in contributing to the delay in reaching
effectiveness. Reorganization of government also affected project implementation. This
consisted first of a restructuring of MMA in 2004 and the shift of the PCU to a new
institutional home followed by the establishment of ICMBio in 2007. The latter had a
much more significant impact on the Project due to a strike that effectively stopped
public sector operations for a period of 4 months. At the level of personnel, the project
suffered near continuous turnover in MMA/IBAMA (later ICMBio), the PCU and in
project supported PAs. In the latter case, this was due primarily to poor selection criteria,
lack of a human resources policy in ICMBio and the often difficult field conditions
characteristic of Amazon PAs. Finally, there was a change in project coordinators late in
project implementation coming at a critical time when additional effort was required to
meet Project output and outcome indicators.

Government Staffing. Successive supervision missions continued to express concerns
over the lack of permanent ARPA counterparts in MMA and the initial level of staffing in
the PCU and the State executing agencies (OEMAS).                      Similar concerns were also
expressed with respect to the low levels of staffing in project supported PAs. Very few if
any of the newly created PAs met the 5 person minimum required by the project to pass
to the "consolidated" stage and qualify for FAP funding. In fairness to the government,
two public concursos3 were held in 2002 and 2008 respectively to hire staff for the
national system of federal areas; in the latter case 2008 80 % of 210 environmental
analysts are projected to go to Amazon PAs. At the time of the Mid-Term Review
(MTR), the mission called for a staffing plan in support of future allocation of staff but
this apparently was never forthcoming. In part, lack of sufficient human resources on
government side reflected GOB fiscal constraints particularly in 2005 and 2008.

Procurement.       Bank procurement requirements and their relevance to the unique
conditions characteristic of the Amazon was of continual concern particularly at the field
level. In addition to contributing to delays in some cases reportedly taking up to two
years, a number of cases were cited as evidence for the provision of "goods and services"
required to be sourced from elsewhere in Brazil due to the low number of service
providers in the Region, which resulted on occasion in equipment purchased that proved

to be inappropriate for local needs. In response, much credit should be given to FUNBIO,
the Bank and other donors in developing the conta vinculada which provided an efficient
mechanism to cover local operating costs which are particularly problematic in the
Amazon (e.g., purchase of fuel and materials, covering costs of meetings, etc.) and
provided a significant incentive by empowering local personnel. FUNBIO's low capacity
at the beginning of the project, to support the levels of procurement called for by the
project following Bank guidelines (and those of other donors that were often in variance
with each other) in a challenging environment contributed to delays in the initial years of
project implementation.

Institutional Coordination. Failure to achieve effective and fluid arrangements among
all the institutional partners was a major constraint identified in the MTR that affected
initial project implementation. This had been flagged as a substantial risk at the time of
the appraisal and was largely borne out. Mitigation measures to reduce risk identified at
the time were to specify respective institutional responsibilities in the respective
implementation agreements, prepare POAs early to provide for adequate inter-
institutional consultation, and close monitoring by the Bank and other donors. These
were futher sthengthened by a number of adjustments in part based on recommendations
stemming from the MTR. These included the establishment of ARPA focal points, the
creation of thematic, inter-institutional working groups, monthly coordination meetings
involving all the institutional stakeholders and development of an internal
communications      strategy.    The    executing  agencies    adopted    many    of   these
recommendations which appeared to result in increased communication and coordination
particularly in the project's later years.

Financial Shortfalls and Uncertainty in FAP. FAP's assets were affected by the
October 2008 world wide fall in equity markets. Nevertheless, the German government
committed an additional EUR10 million donation to FAP, currently awaiting Brazilian
government approval, which will raise achievement rate of the capitalization goal to
115%. A number of actions are in place to address the issue of low FAP capitalization;
these include implementation of the Prioritization and Investment Strategy for investment
in Amazon PAs. This was a significant output and was formally adopted by ICMBIO to
be used as a tool to guide future MMA investment in Amazon PAs. A second measure
entailed a study to explore the potential for the capture of additional resources (outside of
FAP) to support ARPA in future phases. This would complement sub-component 3.2
that supported the testing of other sustainable financing mechanism at the level of the PA.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

a. M&E design. ARPA's Phase 1 Project treated M&E through the inclusion of a
dedicated component (Component 4: Protected Area Monitoring). The objective of the
component was to support the establishment of a biodiversity monitoring system and
analysis for new and existing PAs that would be used to improve the decision-making
process and planning and programming by making available more accurate and reliable
information on management effectiveness of the PAs. It was designed to monitor both
"core" biodiversity variables and "selected" related but indirect variables (e.g., soil
erosion, urban growth, road construction, etc.). Monitoring indicators of social

development outcomes would also be part of the activities included in this Component.
Moreover, the project's PCU also realized that a system to track ongoing operational
activities and financial expenditures would be essential for project successful
implementation. Operational monitoring and environmental monitoring reached different
levels of success during implementation. While operational monitoring had remarkable
achievements, environmental monitoring achieved intermediate results.

b. Operational Monitoring: Two systems were developed for operational monitoring:
SisARPA and CEREBRO. SisARPA, developed by the PCU, evolved from WWF's
tracking tool to capture key information on PA management activities. Thanks to the
SisARPA system, the UCP generates annual reports with data sets per PA on benchmarks
such as equipment availability, infrastructure, level of development and implementation
of Management Plans, level of formation of the Local Councils, level of Basic Protection
Plans for newly formed PAs, level of signage and status of land tenure studies and
resolution of PA boundaries. The SisARPA process is ultimately a somewhat subjective
one as the percentage of completion of each benchmark is an estimate provided by the
PA managers. At the same time, they are trained in the system, have guidance for
determining comparable levels, and many managers are there for a number of years,
providing more fine tuning for the system and the PA "score".

The CEREBRO system was developed by FUNBIO to provide transparency among all
the partners. It allows everyone to review the status of procurement requests, see when
items were shipped, and understand how requested "goods" are being grouped for
purchase. CEREBRO has expedited high levels of program expenditure in Phase 1 and
deserves very high marks for also being clear on what next steps need to be done ­ and
by who ­ and report quickly on the ongoing use of the conta vinculada per PA.
CEREBRO's weakness in Phase 1 was the inability to produce a variety of quick reports
that allow comparison of expenditure pattern across PAs etc. The UCP, FUNBIO, and
other partners have now delineated what types of reports are needed and a CEREBRO 2.0
is expected to be released with much improved reporting capacity in mid 2009.

c. Environmental Monitoring: In an effort to ensure greater objectivity and build MMA
capacity the PAD requested that a separate technical M&E unit be established
independent of the Project Coordination Unit. Originally, in IBAMA, this unit became
part of ICMBio in 2007. Their mandate was to "establish a biodiversity monitoring and
evaluation system at the protected area and regional levels."

ICMBio chose 5 "strict protection" ARPA PAs for developing monitoring pilots, with the
later addition of a sustainable use PA (Reserva Extrativista Lago Capanã Grande, from
Amazonas). In 2005 a set of biodiversity indicators were selected for on-the-ground
studies. From 2006 to 2008 a number of inventories, ecological studies and surveys were
done. Many of the results reported are population census data of key species. Other
research was done on water quality/turbidity/temperature etc, and automatic weather
stations measuring precipitation, etc. were installed in two PAs.




                                             19

To assemble the research teams and data, the monitoring and evaluation program has
focused on partnerships (e.g., with the Agência Nacional de Águas and the Program for
Biodiversity Research within the Ministry of Science and Technology). The team's
effective use of partnerships and outside researchers is one of the highlights of ICMBio's
effort.

While the above has value, the actual application of the protocols has proven too
expensive and time consuming to be considered a replicable methodology across PAs or
even for ongoing monitoring in the same PA. Thus, the field applications to develop a
prototype of an effective monitoring and evaluation methodology have not proven
effective in Phase 1.

While a system-wide M&E approach for biodiversity monitoring was not effectively
developed by ICMBio, there are many effective field examples being undertaken at the
PA level. Many PA managers have taken it upon themselves to use satellite updates from
the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) to monitor hot spots and other
deforestation activity within their PAs. Providing training for all ARPA PA managers to
take advantage of this INPE resource is a potential cost-effective monitoring approach for
the PA level. Using INPE data in all PAs, and coordinating that data analysis on system
wide basis is an opportunity for Phase 2.

As a whole the operating systems for monitoring and evaluating are meeting the needs of
the ARPA partners. The bigger issue of adequately monitoring biological conservation is
a conundrum for most large projects. While a large system-wide effort has not produced
a cost-effective methodology to date, there are a number of efforts happening at the local
scale that provide real promise for more effective biodiversity monitoring and evaluation
in Phase 2.

d. M&E utilization. SisARPA and CEREBRO provide invaluable information for project
management and planning. They are used by project partners almost on a daily basis and
are key elements of project implementation and coordination. Biodiversity monitoring
was not as widely used during Phase 1, but in the areas where it is being carried out, it is
an important tool for PA planning and decision making.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project complied with World Bank safeguard policies as identified in the PAD: (i)
OD 4.01 Environmental Assessment, (ii) OP 4.36 Forestry, (iii) OD 4.20 Indigenous
Peoples and (iv) OP 4.1230 Involuntary Resettlement.

a. Environmental Safeguards. No significant adverse environmental issues were
identified in ARPA's first phase. Under OP 4.01, in the project's environmental analysis
it was noted that no adverse impacts on the environment would occur under Components
1, 4 and 5. Under Component 2 however it was noted that the consolidation of parks and
reserves and the management of the buffer areas around the parks and reserves would
likely result in a limited number of sustainable-use activities for the concerned
communities. Similarly under component 3, two activities were identified as having


                                            20

possible adverse environmental impacts, albeit minimal. These were pilot sub-projects to
test income generating activities for PAs and recurrent activities supported under the
endowment fund created under the project.

Most community development and revenue generating sub-projects were contracted late
in the Project and are still on-going. Many of these were capacity building activities and
did not entail any impact in the field. Where there were field activities, the Project's
mitigation measures proved effective. Those included in project design were: (a) a priori
approval of management plans by the Bank; (b) capacity building; (c) screening
procedures to ensure that activities did not violate Bank safeguard policies; (d)
specification of eligibility criteria in the project's Operational Manuals that excluded
certain activities (e.g., roads); and (e) sustainable use activities that would have to be
approved by the PC.

Since the only PA met the qualifying criteria to enable it to "graduate" to FAP funding
for recurrent costs did so very late in the project, this was not a factor in Phase 1.

The inclusion of "sustainable use" PAs flagged application of OP 4.36 Forestry policy.
However, there was no forest management activities conducted during project
implementation, therefore making mitigation measures unnecessary.

b. Social Safeguards. No significant adverse social impacts occurred under the Project.
Under OD 4.20 Indigenous Peoples, the basic principle that was adopted in project design
and implementation was no support would be given to PAs that overlap with existing
Indigenous Lands or any other types of indigenous areas not yet fully identified or
demarcated. Components 1 and 2 of the Project were thought to be most relevant to OD
4.20. To ensure that the aforementioned principle was applied during the creation and
consolidation of PAs, an extensive consultation and public participation process leading
to the development of an Indigenous Peoples' Strategy was supported in project
preparation and continued in its implementation.

Under OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement to address those possible cases where human
presence might be incompatible with conservation objectives of a possible project
supported PA a Process Framework was developed that would provide the necessary
guidance for the preparation of resettlement plans when and if they became necessary.

At the time of the MTR, the mission noted that the previously cited frameworks were in
place and operating. Nevertheless, with the participation of new stakeholders in the
Project (e.g., new incoming staff in MMA/ICMBio and staff from State OEMAS that had
recently signed project agreements) additional training was provided in the use of the
framework.

Finally, a permanent Conflict Mediation Committee (CMC) was established as a
condition of effectiveness for the purpose of aiding the Project in negotiating and
proposing potential solutions to social issues related to the creation and implementation
of PAs and acting as forum for the discussion and resolution of issues related to tradition



                                              21

populations existing inside "strict protection" PAs. The CMC was never convened,
arguably an indicator that no significant social issues were encountered in this phase 1 of
the Project.

c. Fiduciary Compliance

Financial Management
Except for presenting FMRs with delays, FUNBIO complied with all other financial
conditions stated on article IV, section 4 of the said Grant Agreement. During project
execution FM arrangements have improved, as detailed below and currently are
considered Satisfactory. The risk associated to the project was kept as Moderate.

Procurement
FUNBIO experienced initial difficulties in following procurement procedures, due to its
inexperience in dealing with Bank's rules and the inherent difficulties of projects in the
Amazon. However, FUNBIO's procurement performance improved remarkably during
implementation, due to a larger and better qualified procurement staff and to the growing
institutional experience on Bank's and Brazilian Government's procurement rules. Ex-
post reviews were conducted by the LC5 procurement team for all project Fiscal Years
and confirmed that procurement in the Project was being handled in accordance with the
agreed procedures. The project had only one minor case of misprocurement. Procument
was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The ARPA Project is the first phase of a 3 phase, 10 year program. The first phase was
scheduled to be completed in 4 years but was extended by 18 months. Specific triggers
were incorporated into program design that had to be met prior to proceeding to the
project's second phase. These were the: (a) creation of a minimum of 9 million hectares
of new PAs, (b) consolidation of 4 millions hectares of existing "strict protection" PAs
and (c) the establishment of an endowment fund, capitalized and meeting performance
benchmarks, as described in the indicators matrix. All triggers were met and (a) and (b)
were greatly surpassed

Planning for the preparation of ARPA's second phase began in mid 2007. It was agreed
at that time that the ARPA's goal, objectives and approach as described in the PAD
remained relevant to the project's next phase, with improvements to the M&E and
production subprojects components. It was agreed at the time a study was warranted to
evaluate the financial implications of supporting newly created "sustainable use" PAs on
FAP. Other studies to support preparation of the ARPA's 2nd phase were identified and a
timetable prepared. In anticipation of soliciting additional GEF funds a Project
Identification Form (PIF) was prepared in early February working on a nominal figure of
US$ 20 ­ 30 million of GEF grant funds. These activities were followed up most
recently in a multi-stakeholder workshop held in Brasilia in March 2009. By the time of
the workshop, the environment had changed significantly from the situation at the
initiation of discussions. New factors that needed to be considered included: (a) the
effects of the financial crisis on both the FAP and GEF and their respective resource


                                            22

base; (b) the relevance of GEF's RAF policy on resource availability in GEF V; (c) the
likely shortfall in project resources to bridge the period between the two phases; (d)
government counterpart; and (e) the coming elections and their impact on changes in
personnel. Project partners are currently meeting regularly to discuss aspects of the
preparation of Phase 2. These meetings are attended by MMA, FUNBIO, donors, states
and civil society representatives.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

During President Lula's second term there have been a number significant decisions
taken that were supportive of (and in some cases influenced by) ARPA that demonstrated
the relevance of the project's objectives to the country and have contributed to creating a
sound, enabling environment for the Program's 2nd phase. These include: (a) the 2003
approval by the President and all governors of the North Region of the Sustainable
Amazon Plan (PAS) that identifies the improvement of Amazonia's provision of global
environmental services as one of its 6 objectives4; (b) a December 2006 CONABIO
resolution establishing national biodiversity goals, objectives and targets to be achieved
by 2010, including the protection of 30% of the Amazon biome; (c) the 2007 creation of
the ICMBio which will provide an increased public profile for and focus on the
management of federal protected areas; and most recently (d) ICMBio's 2008 public
concurso to hire an additional 140 administrative and 210 technical staff of which some
80 % of the latter are projected to go to the Amazon Region as environmental analysts; a
large portion to the PAs, given the significant increase in their number as a result of
ARPA. This will represent a major input to reaching ARPA's minimum personnel
criterion for PAs to receive funding by FAP. Finally, as another excellent example of the
relevance and harmony of the project's objectives and implementation with the country's
priorities, ARPA was a major contributor to and will benefit from the development and
adoption of the Amazon Biodiversity Conservation and Investment Strategy and Map5 by
MMA which will provide a critical tool in prioritizing candidate PAs under the second
phase.

The Bank's 2008-2011 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Brazil is fully supportive
of a subsequent ARPA phase 2. The CPS includes the Amazon Partnership Framework
which outlines a full-service partnership. The Framework identifies four main themes that
included working in the management of large protected and indigenous areas. In addition



4The other five objectives are: (i) reduction of rural poverty and increase in social protection; (ii) continued
reduction in the structural deforestation rate; (iii) improvement of basic services, especially in rural
communities; (iv) designing major infrastructure projects which address social and environmental aspects
while supporting regional and national growth; (v) supporting indigenous and traditional communities'
ways of life.

to calling for the continuation of ARPA, the Framework also identified the expansion
and/or consolidation of state protected areas as an indicative example of possible
activities that could be supported as a component of sector wide state loans during the
CPS period. The mobilization of grant funds (including GEF) will continue to be a major
tool in the implementation of the CPS.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

Rated: Satisfactory.

The stated PDO was "to expand and consolidate the protected areas (PAs) system in the
Amazon region of Brazil." The PDO was fully realized. This was assessed through
evaluation of the four phase 1 objectives and associated results presented in the PAD's
Logframe.

Expansion of PAs. The Project made a significant contribution to an increase in the
number and area of PAs in Amazon. Specifically, 13 "strict protection" PAs totaling 13.2
million ha and 30 "sustainable use" PAs totaling 10.8 million ha were created under
ARPA's 1st phase. This far surpassed the expected results estimated in the PAD of 18
million ha of new PAs (9 million ha of "strict protection" PAs and 9 million ha of
"sustainable use" PAs) created (see table 1 for list of PAs created under ARPA).

Consolidation of PAs. With respect to the "consolidation" of PAs, the expected results
at the end of project were to be 7 million hectare of existing "strict protected" PAs and 3
million hectares of new "strict protection" PAs. Only one existing "strict protection" PA
(Reserva Biológia do Uatuma) covering some 938,000 ha in area had been classified as
"consolidated" by the PCU as of February 2009. Nevertheless, an additional existing 7
PAs are currently in an advanced stage of consolidation together with an additional 3
existing PAs,. represent in the aggregate 6,900,000 hectares.

The Project had little problem in the "creation" of PAs. In fact, the expected results were
obtained well before the end of the project (see Table 1 above). The difficulty in
reaching consolidation status was based on meeting the number and thresholds of criteria
established in the PAD to qualify for reclassification as "consolidated". This was in
particular due to: (a) an underestimation of the time and cost associated with the
preparation of (or updating of existing) management plans (up to 2 years and costs of
US$ 300 ­ 400,000); (b) delays in procurement of equipment and services particularly
with respect to infrastructure; and (c) difficulties in meeting minimum staffing
requirements (a minimum of 5 staff in "strict protection" PAs), a criterion dependent of
government counterpart contributions.

Establishment and Capitalization of an Endowment Fund. By the end of the Project
an endowment fund was to be established and the development of the necessary financial
mechanisms. In addition to its creation the fund was to be capitalized at a minimum of
US$ 29 million. FAP was created and despite sharp changes in currency exchange rates
and the collapse of global equity markets in late 2008, reached a capitalization of US$ 18
million prior to October. This is expected to be substantially increased as soon as the
GOB approves a KfW contribution of Euro 10 million resulting in almost double the
projected results. In addition to GEF and KfW, the other major contributor to FAP was
WWF/Brazil (US$ 7.8 million).


M & E Methodology of Environmental Monitoring. The final objective in support of
the PDO was the developing and testing of an environmental monitoring and evaluation
protocol to improve the quality and reliability of information in PAs. The expected result
by the end of project was a methodology for environmental monitoring defined and
implemented in specific PAs. While a system-wide M&E approach for biodiversity
monitoring was not effectively developed by ICMBio to date, there are a number of
efforts happening at the local scale that provide real promise for more effective
biodiversity monitoring and evaluation in Phase 2. There were in fact a number of
protocols developed for standardizing data collection across PAs. Some field work was
completed in 6 PAs (an additional PA was included beyond those identified in the PAD)
and monitoring stations for automatic data collection installed, partially achieving the
expected result. As a whole, the operating systems for monitoring and evaluating are
meeting the needs of the ARPA partners.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Not Rated

At the time of appraisal there were no requirements to include calculations of economic
and financial rates of returns. However, in line with GEF requirements, an Incremental
Cost Analysis was prepared. Moreover, any economic analysis would be constrained due
to lack of economic data from the sustainable development (sub-component 2.4) and
revenue generating (sub-component 3.2) sub-projects. In the former case these were
initiated late in the Project and mostly entailed training and capacity building activities.
In the case of the latter, these were postponed until the next phase. Thus, no benchmark
or baseline figures were established and these rates cannot be calculated precisely as of
the date of the ICR.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory.

Considering that the projected achieved and even surpassed virtually all of its
development objectives,(as noted in detail above) the "Overall Outcome" was rated
"Satisfactory". The ARPA project is the most innovative and successful project currently
strengthening the Brazilian protected area system (SNUC) in the Amazon. ARPA has
doubled the amount of the Brazilian Amazon under strict protection ­ from the 3.2% (12
million hectares) at the start of the project to over 25 million hectares today. The addition
of another 10 million hectares in sustainable use areas meets two societal needs in Brazil:
conserving biodiversity and providing improved livelihoods for traditional forest dwellers.

For years there has been a sense that protected areas in the Amazon cannot be effectively
managed given their size, extensive logistical complications, and the numerous threats in
the area. The ARPA project has proven effective protected area creation and management
can have a real impact in reducing deforestation and protecting biodiversity as well as the
rights of local peoples. This project also showcases that private-public partnerships can
break through long-standing bureaucratic and administrative bottlenecks creating the
operational capacity to effectively support field staff.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

a. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development. The Project's main
activities that would have had potentially positive impacts on social development were
the sustainable development sub-projects (sub-component 2.4) and revenue generating
sub-projects (sub-component 3.2). In the former case these were initiated only late in the
Project but several of this will be carried over into the Project's next phase. In the case of
the latter the studies are just being completed and will go forward in the next phase.
Moreover, the public consultation process required for PA creation and support under
ARPA helps strengthening local associations and other civil society groups, as well as
building ownership for environmental policies in the Amazon. ARPA's support for


                                               27

sustainable use PAs assures long term protection of vulnerable forest communities to
potential threats brought by the expansion of the economic frontier.

b. Institutional Change/Strengthening.
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

Under ARPA's sub-component 2.4, a "capacity building" working group was established
in 2006 to develop a training plan to support the building of capacity among PA
managers. With assistance from GTZ, the plan was completed and implementation
initiated. A number of courses were supported and included introductory courses in PA
management (with WWF/Brazil and Ipe) and management of participatory processes.
These courses were critical because many of the PA managers posted to Amazon PAs
were biologists by training and not equipped to manage PAs and all that entails (e.g.,
community participation). Finally, these courses may have played a contributory role
leading to the reduction of rates of attrition of PA staff recruited for Amazon PAs.
Despite these successes, many of the projected activities to be supported under this sub-
component were postponed until the next phase due to financial short-falls.

In addition to the above, in 2007, the PCU together with GTZ, developed a training
program in 7 PAs with the objective of promoting a results-based management model
based on Brazil's National Program of Excellence in Public Management and
Streamlining (Desburocratizacao) coordinated by the Ministry of Planning (MOP).
Major themes of the program included leadership, strategies and plans, civil society,
information and knowledge, human resources management and results based
management. Based on the initial results the program will be expanded to include an
additional 9 PAs. The "mainstreaming" of MOP "best practices" in ARPA PAs will
likely contribute to the long-term sustainability of project supported PAs as long as staff
can be maintained and attrition reduced in these PAs.

FUNBIO was also significantly strengthend through the Project. At the onset of the
Project, FUNBIO did not have any in-depth expertise to manage large scale procurement,
certainly not in terms of the magnitude and scope of ARPA nor in working in the
Amazon. Today, there is no other services provider that can provide the unique set of
services in support of biodiversity conservation in the Region. They will be critical to the
continued success of ARPA in the subsequent phases.

Finally, there is evidence that ARPA did have a significant positive influence on PA
management elsewhere in SNUC through contributing to improvements in: (a) quality of
POAs in MMA/PAs, (b) PA monitoring and (c) the quality of and process leading to the
preparation of management plans. Arguably these achievements have laid the
groundwork for the future formulation of new government policies.

c. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts.

Three unintended impacts were identified in ARPA's 1st phase. These were:




                                               28

Perverse Incentives.                    An unexpected impact identified in the independent project
evaluation was the existence of a possible perverse incentive in project design affecting
the intent and rate of PAs to "graduate" to ARPA's consolidation phase. Specifically,
under ARPA, PAs received a substantial level of support in the "creation" phase that
covered investments in infrastructure and equipment. However, once meeting minimal
threshold criteria project design calls for the reclassification of these PAs to a
"consolidated" status under which they would then qualify for funding from FAP.
However, FAP funding only covers recurrent costs, signifying a substantial reduction in
resources available to the PA. Arguably this provided a disincentive to the best prepared
PAs to "graduate" and rewards the less efficient PAs. The preparation of ARPA's Phase
2 is exploring possible positive incentives to PA "graduation".

Conta Vinculada. Delays in procurement continued to hamper ARPA particularly in the
early years of project implementation. . Funbio and The Bank, together with the other
project partners, taking into account the unique characteristics of the Region and the
needs of local PA managers, identified a series of alternative procurement procedures
designed to facilitate acquisition of local "goods and services" in remote areas (conta
vinculada). The procedures included the preparation of an acquisition plan by PA teams,
technical specifications and approval rules and decentralized purchasing for lower valued
items through the creation of sub-acccounts directly managed by PA managers. This was
unanticipated in project design and an unexpected development during the course of
project implementation but proved to have substantial impact at the level of the PAs
contributing to increased efficiency and improved morale.

ARPA and Climate Change. As the world looks to protect the Amazon as a globally
essential carbon sink, ARPA has been an important showcase of the types of mechanisms
needed to be successful. A recent study on the Amazon indicated that "the model showed
that by 2050, expansion of protected areas during 2003-07 reduced 272,000 km² (27.2
million ha) in deforestation, thereby avoiding 3.3±1.1 gigatons of carbon (GT C)
emissions, of which 0.4 GT C was attributable to 13 protected areas established with
ARPA's support. Including an additional 127,000 km² (12.7 million ha) of new ARPA
protected areas throughout 2008, the ARPA program would reduce a total of 1.4 GT C
(or 5.1 GT CO2) in emissions by 2050."                                6


Related research looks at "unintended" carbon emissions from the Amazon due to climate
change affecting the ecology. Models indicate reduced rainfall, increased forest fires,
and "savannahization" of certain areas of the Amazon. In these models the preservation
of large blocks of forest is considered an important part of preserving ongoing rainfall
patterns as water will recycle more effectively in large block areas. The ARPA projects
and efforts to create large PAs are seen as a critical investment in limiting "unintended"
carbon emissions and maintaining high levels of ecosystem functionality.7

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Despite the fact that no official stakeholder workshop was required to specifically
evaluate the findings reported in this ICR, a series of working groups met to discuss
outcomes achieved and the preparation of Phase 2. These working groups have been
formed with participation of representatives from the federal and state government, and
environmental and social NGOs. The fact that the country incorporated the ARPA project
as a federal program of high visibility and with a lot of state and municipal support is the
best assurance that the lessons learned from implementation and the project's outcomes
will be fully incorporated by the government.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate.

The risk to the Development Outcome is rated Moderate. This is due to a weighing of a
number of factors. Factors contributing to moderate risk are:

Multiple Phase Program. The Project is the first phase of a three phase program with
explicit triggers required to be met prior to passing to the next phase. Thus it is highly
likely that PDO would be maintained with little risk during the remaining course of the
ARPA Program. Moreover, there exists a substantial amount of time remaining in the
Program to consolidate the achievements to date, adsorb the "lessons learned" and make
any required adjustments in program design to reduce future risk to the PDO.

Continued Support of Donors. Past and future expressions of support by ARPA's main
donors most recently reconfirmed in the Discussao de Propostas para o GEF ARPA 2
workshop in Brazilia on the 12 and 13th of March demonstrates a belief in both the need
for ARPA and that past and future achievements will likely be maintain after the Program
ends.

Institutional Support. MMA continues to show its support for the maintenance of
existing and the creation of future PAs as evidenced by its support for relevant policy
tools such as the Map of Priority Areas for the Conservation, Sustainable Utilization and
Sharing of Benefits of Brazilian Biodiversity established by Presidential Decree in May
2004 and the Biodiversity Conservation and Investment Strategy.               Nevertheless,
difficulties experienced by MMA in the Program's first phase in providing agreed on
counterpart financing and staffing of Amazon PAs underline the importance of the
establishment of FAP and continuing to seek its capitalization and in parallel, seek
alternative sources of financing.

Climate Change. Given the growth in international interest to support efforts to
mitigate the effects of climate change and the unique global role that Brazil's Amazon
plays in maintaining regional and global CC processes, there will likely be a continued



                                                30

and diversified interest in maintaining and building on ARPA's achievements. The
government created the Amazon Fund at the end of 2008 as its alternative to receive
compensation for reducing CO2 from deforestation without having to rely on market-
based mechanisms. The Amazon Fund will support the prevention, monitoring and
combating of deforestation, and the promotion of conservation and sustainable use of
natural resources in the Amazon. The Fund will operate through grants, focusing on the
following activities: (i) forest management in public lands; (ii) management of protected
areas; (iii) monitoring and enforcement of environmental laws; (iv) sustainable use of
forest resources; (v) zoning and land regularization; (vi) biodiversity conservation and
sustainable use; and (vii) rehabilitation of degraded areas. In this context, ARPA shall
play a very important synergic role as one of the viable and consistent projects for
Amazon Fund implementation, helping not only the disbursement pace of financial
resources but also its conservation targets.

Despite these factors there are nevertheless challenges to be met that might extend
beyond the Program's life that could affect the long-term sustainability of the PDO.
These are:

FAP Assets. As documented in a recent consultant's report, FAP's assets are legally
owned by FUNBIO. However, ARPA's Program Committee (PC) has sole authority
over their use subject to "no objection" from the Program's main donors. Post-program
institutional arrangements to manage FAP's investment will take into consideration a
transitional period where FAP initial management shall be managed by PC while a
detailed Operational Manual is concluded, tested and finally approved.

Changes in Financial Markets and Rates of Exchange. As amply demonstrated
during ARPA's first phase, sustainable financing can be subject to substantial risk to the
fluctuation of currency and global equity markets. It is a prudent strategy to embark on
seeking other sources of parallel financing outside but complementary to the ARPA's
endowment fund to reduce risk. This is further supported by the results of one project
consultant that estimated that US$ 300 million with 5% net annual income would be
required to support the long term management of ARPA "strict protection" PAs.
Currently, Brazilian legislation does not allow for direct financial contributions from
federal and/or state governmental budgets. However, studies carried out under the
Project indicated the possibility of using environmental compensation funds as potential
sources of contribution to FAP. This possibility is being explored by preparation of
Phase 2.

MMA Personnel Policy. The lack of a supportive personnel policy and its contribution
to contracting of poorly qualified candidates, high attrition rates and low employee
morale will continue to pose a risk to long-term sustainability of PAs created in the
Amazon. A human resource policy to reduce turnover and value human resources is
urgently required. It is encouraging to see that MMA/ICMBio have recently began to
support a number of additional measures in response to address this issue (e.g., concursos
and internal consultations).




                                             31

Permanency of ARPA Personnel.           A final concern is the critical mass of highly
qualified people that now exist in key institutions FUNBIO, PCU and ICMBio that are at
risk of being lost to the Program's second phase; in the case of the former due to
projected gap in funding and in the case of the latter two, change in government, which
may result in personnel turnover.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank


a. Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during identification, preparation and appraisal of the
project was moderately satisfactory. Preparation was characterized by a long but
comprehensive participative consultation process.       Similarly, a close and productive
relationship was established with MMA, FUNBIO and the other donors. This was to
prove valuable in mobilizing and maintaining the necessary support needed to achieve
many of the phase 1 project's outputs. The preparation team carried out missions during
this period that included visits to all Amazon states to gauge level of interest and
commitment to ARPA; a key factor in reaching a high level of participation on the part of
the states during project implementation.       During this long and at times difficult
preparation process the Bank team showed great sensitivity and sound negotiation skills.
Key issues that were satisfactorily resolved during this period included reaching
agreement on the role of the private sector in contributing to the creation and
implementation of protected areas in the Amazon and accommodating requests for
further inclusion of civil society in ARPA relatively late in project preparation.
Preparation took into account fully the priorities of the CAS and relevant GEF focal area
and operational program. The team also took into account previous operations in Brazil,
particularly the GEF-supported FUNBIO project which was to prove crucial in the design
of ARPA. The selection of a multi-phase program approach in such a large and complex
area was also critical.

Nevertheless, given that government policy limiting the project's 1st phase to four years,
project design should have been adjusted accordingly to reflect a less ambitious approach.
An institutional analysis would also have been highly useful in identifying both the
challenges that were waiting in the procuring of "goods and services" in the Amazon and
FUNBIO's limited capacity at the time to be able to respond to these challenges. This
might have been useful in supporting capacity building activities early in the project to
reduce the delays experienced during the first two years of implementation. The design
team did an excellent job in identifying risks to the project but many of the proposed
mitigation measures were either not relevant and/or proved to be ineffective. Monitoring
and evaluation of biodiversity was one of the project's weak points. A good deal of
thought went into technical monitoring of biodiversity but the component objective and
design was overly ambitious and arguably could have justified a separate project in its


                                             32

own right. In contrast to the detail provided on technical monitoring, there was little
evidence and guidance in provided in project design with respect to the establishment of a
project level M&E system. While M&E systems were eventually developed by FUNBIO
and the PCU respectively, additional preparatory work might have resulted in an
integrated system that would have contributed to increased institutional cohesiveness.

b. Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The Bank's overall performance during supervision was satisfactory. There was
considerable evidence that the Bank's reputation and credibility in Brazil was a major
factor in achieving strong inter-donor participation and collaboration in the Program; a
not inconsiderable task given the number of donors and respective funding priorities in
such a large and ambitious program. The fact that all donors are continuing to support
operations in the Program's 2nd phase is evidence of the success achieved during the 1st
phase Project.

The continued involvement of one TTL throughout the Program's first phase was a
significant positive factor contributing to project consistency and achievements. The
Bank conducted a total of 14 supervision missions over the 6 year of life of project. As
the Project began to meet the reality of supporting field operations and disbursement
began to lag, to the Bank's credit the number of supervision missions increased in
frequency. Joint supervision missions including the executing agencies, state
governments and the donors began early in implementation and provided a highly useful
vehicle for team-building and resolving of issues as they occurred. However for the most
part, supervision missions were confined to Brasilia. Integrating a site visit into each
mission might have provided better opportunities to assess the challenges faced in
implementation of the Project in the field. ISRs could have been improved in providing
additional detail on project progress and difficulties. Finally, the supervision missions
could have been more resolute in ensuring that previous recommendations were enacted
on by the executing agencies (e.g., meeting government commitments on staffing PAs
and several of the recommendations from the MTR).

With respect to the issue of institutional cohesiveness flagged in the MTR, the Bank
together with other donors, requested a number of adjustments that led over time to
increased communication and coordination. The team was also proactive in supporting a
grant amendment to extend the Project at an appropriate time when it became likely this
would be required. Similarly, preparations for the project's second phase began
sufficiently early to provide for adequate consultation and discussion.

The Bank's environmental safeguard policies and accompanying frameworks were fully
satisfied accompanied by periodic evaluation for compliance and supported with training
of local teams. There was no need to turn to the Project's Conflict Mediation Committee
(CMC) which arguably could be attributable to the high degree of public consultation in
during the preparation process and reduction of risk of conflicts.



                                            33

Finally, there were considerable difficulties with respect to meeting the Bank's
procurement requirements particularly due to the lack of suppliers in the Amazon region
and the associated delays and occasional purchase of equipment that proved not to be
suitable Amazon conditions (e.g., the purchase of Mercury vs. Yamaha outboard engines).
This was not unique to ARPA and was cited in other relevant projects in Brazil (e.g.,
PROBIO ICR). However to the credit of the Bank team, the Bank did show flexibility in
agreeing to the adoption of the conta vinculada; an innovative approach that provided
local PA managers increased flexibility in meeting local recurrent costs (e.g., purchase of
fuel) without being subjected to lengthy procurement requirements.

c. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

In consideration of the ratings for preparation and supervision (above), the overall rating
is considered moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

a. Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Brazil's Ministry of Environment (MMA) through the General Coordination entity
composed of the Secretariates of Coordination of the Amazon Region and Biodiversity
and IBAMA was responsible for the Project's overall government institutional
coordination and articulation with environmental policies and projects. During the course
of the project, MMA experienced significant personnel changes associated with two
national elections, a re-organization and a new counterpart partner at the operational level
with the creation of ICMBio in 2007. Two of these events warrant further description.
After ARPA's long preparatory period with MMA staff from the Cardoso government,
the change in government (and party) at the onset of project implementation contributed
to significant delays (more than 8 months) in the Project's first year due to the change of
interlocutors. Competing interests between the Ministry's two participating Secretariats
(Secretariat for Amazon Coordination, and Biodiversity and Forests Secretariat) appeared
to be an additional factor in contributing to these delays during the first two years.
However, by the project's second year these issues were largely resolved and rate of
implementation began to increase. However, in 2007 the creation of ICMBio resulted in
considerable disruption of personnel and unrest among employees culminating in a 4
month strike that contributed to another round of delays. Despite these institutional
changes and at times associated turmoil, MMA proved to be a substantial partner. MMA
played a key role in negotiating lands with other relevant agencies to be declared for PA
designation. Moreover, they contributed significantly to the resolution of a number of
issues. This included supporting two public concursos to hire personnel in support of
SNUC and the ARPA-supported PA in the Amazon, establishment of focal points in the
Ministry and participating and adopting new policy tools in which ARPA had made a
significant contribution.


                                              34

Nevertheless, there were also a number of areas in which MMA could have played a
more effective role in supporting ARPA. These included: (a) difficulties in meeting
counterpart co-financing requirements in 2005 and again in 2008/09; (b) closely related
to (a) were the difficulties in staffing ARPA PAs with adequate numbers of personnel
needed to meet criteria to qualify for FAP funding; (c) failure to establish an adequate
system to track counterpart co-financing and provide the accompanying documentation
(despite repeated requests from the donors since the onset of the Project); (d) reluctance
to establish fulltime focal points in the relevant Ministry's Secretariats that would have
contributed to increased project impact both in terms of advancing field activities as well
as "mainstreaming" project innovations and "lessons learned;" and (e) not using the
Project's committees and panels, particularly the Program Committee and Scientific
Advisory Panel, to greater effect.

b. Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

PCU. The PCU had an executive function and provided a critical link between the PC
and ARPAs'executing agencies. Among its many functions were supporting, monitoring
and in some cases executing Project activities and ensuring that the technical
administrative and financial procedures of the Bank were followed.          In addition, it
reviewed PA-specific POAs and prepared the consolidated POA and was also to provide
the secretariat for the Project's various committees and panels. Once staffed, the PCU
worked effectively though, together with MMA/ICMBio and FUNBIO, could have
developed a more cohesive inter-institutional working relationship. This was despite the
shifts in institutional "homes," experiencing high turnover of staff and undergoing a
change in coordinators in 2008 at a critical time in bring the Project to a successful
closure.

FUNBIO. At the start of project implementation, FUNBIO was staffed by a highly
qualified team of professionals, managed conservation trust funds and had a strong Board.
It did not have in-depth (or backroom) expertise to manage large scale procurement,
certainly not in terms of the magnitude and scope of ARPA nor in working in the
Amazon. ARPA represented a major challenge, one that required contracting and training
a large team and time was required to "climb the learning curve." As a resulted the
Project suffered substantial delays in procurement particularly in the project's early years
until a trained team was in place. Moreover, it created a major division on FUNBIO's
highly esteemed Board of Directors that eventually resulted in a reorganization of
FUNBIO at the behest of the donors that contributed to further delays. To some extent
these delays were inherent to the Project, particularly with respect to following the Bank
procedures as well as those of other donors and the unique conditions faced when
working in the Amazon. Today, there is no other services provider that could provide the
unique set of services in support of biodiversity conservation in the Amazon. They will
be critical to the continued success of ARPA in the subsequent phases.

In term of creating and managing FAP, in face of the magnitude and rapidity of the
global crash in markets there seems little that FUNBIO could have done to mitigate the


                                             35

risk after its occurrence. To FUNBIO's credit, by their own initiative in 2007 they had
already initiated activities directed at developing a strategy to identify and capture other
sources of financing outside of FAP in support of ARPA PAs.

Not all of the sustainable development sub-projects supported under sub-component 2.4
were completed by the date of the ICR. Results and "lessons-learned" from those that
were completed apparently are not available and have not been shared with ARPA's
other institutional partners. FUNBIO's did not complete any of the revenue generating
sub-projects included under sub-component 3.2; an activity that started late in the Project
and was suspended as the life of project came to closure.

OEMAS. The OEMAS varied in their degree of participation and support for ARPA. In
some cases, States were quite active demonstrated through progress on the ground in their
support for candidacy of state PAs to be included in ARPA including their management
and strengthening of infrastructure and provision of equipment. In other cases support
was lacking. Typical constraints included lack of available counterpart financing, weak
institutions, antiquated institutional structure and processes and in some cases overt
political pressure.

c. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is considered "Satisfactory" given the level of
government commitment during the project's tenure to provide the funding for execution,
satisfactory performance of the line agencies in spite of the extensive institutional
changes and managerial turn over experienced in the period, and including the high levels
of results obtained and the high sustainability of impacts generated. There were no cases
of corruption, or safeguards violations during the project's tenure.

6. Lessons Learned

Wide General Application

Lesson 1: The validation of participatory concepts and processes during
preparation is fundamental to support implementation of a complex project.
ARPA's extensive participative consultation during project preparation contributed to the
development of an extensive experiential data base that provided the basis to develop a
detailed methodology that was included in the project design documents. This proved to
be highly useful to guide participative activities in support of PA creation during the
Project's implementation. These "win-win" situations where activities and processes
supported during design can actually provide, following their refinement, detailed
guidance in implementation should be used more often in the future and expanded to
include other critical processes and procedures that will be faced by executing bodies
(e.g., environmental assessment, preparation of operational manuals etc.). Nevertheless,




                                              36

ARPA could have further benefited from an earlier engagement of CSOs in project
preparation.

Lesson 2: Never underestimate the logistical challenges of working in remote
regions. Like all project locales, the Amazon is a unique region that presents a highly
challenging environment to work in, particularly in the conservation of biodiversity
where many of the candidate sites are in the more inaccessible areas. Add to this a low
and sparsely distributed population with few service providers and difficulties in
launching any effort that requires extensive public participation, preparation of
management plans, purchase of equipment, construction of infrastructure            and the
associated communications, processes and procedures that accompany these activities are
bound to occur. It is almost always more cost-efficient to factor in local characteristics in
project design even at additional cost in time and resources, than attempt mid-course
corrections as they develop in implementation. Preparation of ARPA 2 incorporates this
lesson in project design. Of particular relevance is to ensure to factor in "premiums" in
terms of costs and time over similar operations elsewhere in the country to better gauge
project costs and calendars to reduce risk of overestimating the achievement of outcomes
and outputs during project implementation.

Project Specific

Lesson 3: Although biodiversity conservation problems are complex, project design
can be simplified to fit local capacities and pace of implementation. While ARPA's
program design was the right approach to address the magnitude and complexity of issues
and underlying factors needed to create PAs in the Amazon, it was overly-ambitious in its
expectations for the first phase of the Project.      Multiple institutions and layers of
government and sectors ranging from biodiversity conservation, social development to
funds management and comprehensive monitoring, while arguably justified for a
Program with this PDO, are rarely successful at least when attempted simultaneously
particularly when constrained by time limitations. Add to this the reality of working in
the Amazon and a government imposed requirement to complete the 1st phase Project in
four years and the situation is ripe to experience one or more setbacks. In this case these
were the partial achievement of stated project outcomes and outputs, an extension of
project closure and postponement of some project activities into the next phase.
Fortunately, none of these changes threatened the long term outcome of the multi-phase
program (though it is likely that the end of program will have to be extended as well).

Lesson 4: Environmental funds' capitalization plans need regular updates. ARPA's
trustfund was the first of its kind to be established in Brazil. The fund was designed to
address financial shortfalls from the public purse to cover the recurrent costs of PAs.
However, ARPA's successful efforts to create so many new PAs, particularly
"sustainable use" PAs, was not anticipated in the initial trustfund design. But only now,
after almost six years of implementation, solid financial records are available with data
that can serve as a basis for projecting expending needs for PAs, thus allowing more
regular updates of the need based on the number of PAs entering the ARPA system and
benefiting from the trustfund revenues.



                                             37

Lesson 5: Adaptive and innovation management can determine the degree of success.
The adaptation of ARPA project design has proven to be fundamental for a project at
such large scale, which prevented the usual problems with large bureaucratic
implementation efforts. ARPA's innovative aspects such as the public-private
institutional arrangements and the conta vinculada have been extraordinarily effective in
dramatically accelerating implementation in the field, with increased agility in creating
new PAs, staffing new PAs, and moving funds to the PA managers for on-the-ground
work.     The conta vinculada was a breakthrough at least in the environmental
management in Brazil and not only resolved "real world" issues faced everyday by PA
managers but provided an important incentive and degree of empowerment that served to
increase morale. This concept came out of thorough analysis and discussion among
ARPA's partners and impact justified the time investment to reach the right solution.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

    a. Borrower/implementing agencies

Comments Received from Ministry of Environment (MMA)

The ARPA Program is considered one of the most important component of the Brazilian
effort to combat deforestation and to conserve biological diversity and ecological process
in the Amazon.

Created in 2002 ARPA is coordinated by the Brazilian Ministry of Enviroment and
implemented by the Chico Mendes Biodiversity Conservation Institut (ICMBio), the
Amazon States and the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio).

ARPA is the largest existent program for the conservation of protected areas and has
the challenge of protecting 50 million ha of the Amazon tropical forest in 10 years.

With financial resources coming from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), World
Bank, WWF.Brasil, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) and the German Agency
for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), ARPA has completed the execution of the first phase
of the program (2003-2008) with a strong track record of success and innovations.

The innovative management arrangements and the adequated synchronization established
between policies and donated resources, as well as the decentralized execution were the
elements that contributed to reach the goals of the program's first phase

It is important to highlight that part of these innovations were pushed by the need to
adopt the rules and apply the recommendations made by the donors, in special by the
WB. Innovations which effectively contributed to the establishment of conservation units
supported by the program.

Nowadays ARPA reaches approximately 32 million ha on conservation unit in the
Amazon distributed in 62 conservation units (federal and states), and new goals were


                                              38

establish for the second phase of the program: the total area to be protected through the
program will increase from 50million ha to 60million ha.

The continuation of WB support to the Arpa Program is fundamental to the continuity of
this program.

Comments received from FUNBIO:

Funbio participation on the Arpa Project was a major institutional task. After 5 years of
ARPA implementation Funbio has improved and changed in many different aspects, it
gave Funbio the opportunity to master a complete new expertise with large scale
procurement in remote areas and was Funbio's first project with strict conservation.
Funbio also learned how to manage large scale projects with complex institutional
arrangement including different donors, and government agencies from federal, states and
civil society organizations.

One of the most important aspects of ARPA was the cooperative work achieved by such
different institutions, that was the strength that made possible overcome the huge
challenges ARPA faced on its design and initial phase. There were not few problems in
the lifetime of ARPA, some external to our will and others created by the complexities of
such a project, however, all obstacles were addressed and most of them solved, the ones
that persist are still subject to debate and we hope to solve them with creative approaches
in the next phase. The overall results of ARPA were much more than we expected with a
considerable impact on the worldwide creation of new protected areas since 2003. Many
lessons were learned and applied on its first phase and a lot will be done in the next one,
management innovations are already being implemented in other projects, like in the
Atlantic Forest Conservation Fund, Probio II and GEF Pollinators. Although ARPA has
had a great deal of success, all partners seek continuous improvement in management
and technical aspects. Concerning the World Bank role we acknowledge the importance
of the flexibility given on the Conta Vinculada mechanism but we could have more
improvements on procurement flexibility, especially with regional processes instead of
national due to Amazon logistical constraints and lack of a well established economy to
provide goods and services in the way defined by the Bank. Also a faster consultant
selecting/hiring processes could be of some importance. Finally, we would like to thank
all Bank staff involved in ARPA, we know we asked a lot of difficult questions and
brought a lot of "solutions" different from the business as usual and that required a lot of
work to this staff to react and reply, but not many projects like ARPA were made before
and that requires creativity and, in some cases, boldness. For that and for believing in
Funbio's capacity to learn and surpass its own limitations we are thankful and hopeful the
second phase will be as rich, as challenging and as successful as this first one.

We would like to thank the World Bank for inviting us to share our views on the ARPA
Program as a contribution to this Implementation Completion Report.

On behalf of the German government, KfW Development Bank has been co-financing
the first phase of ARPA through a grant of EUR 22.6 million. A further EUR 10.0
million grant has been made to Funbio for the Protected Areas Fund (FAP). Technical
Cooperation to the ARPA program is delivered by GTZ through its Tropical Forest
Program on behalf of the German Government with focus on institutional strengthening
and instruments for monitoring and management of the program.

The ARPA Program is a highly ambitious undertaking by the Brazilian government and
the Brazilian states in the Amazon region, with strong support from civil society
organizations and international partners. It has significantly contributed to the expansion
and consolidation of the Protected Areas (PAs) network in the Amazon region, by
supporting the creation and implementation of more than 60 PAs, protecting more than
34 million hectares of tropical rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon ­ almost the size of
Germany. With 24 Million hectares created, the ARPA program has effectively created
one third of all new protected areas worldwide since 2003. Thus, the Program has
contributed significantly to the CBD's goal to expand PAs as an effective mean to the
conservation of biodiversity.

The impacts of ARPA are significant: As studies demonstrate, PA play an important role
in containing deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, thus reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and protecting natural habitat and ecosystems. Apart from its effective results
on the ground, ARPA has induced changes and innovations in effective protected areas
management and in the way biodiversity conservation is perceived locally in several
regions of the Brazilian Amazon.

We consider the following factors key to the Program's success:

    -   Strong political commitment to the Program's objectives from the federal and the
        state governments;
    -   Its participatory approach to planning, implementation and monitoring of Program
        activities, involving governmental institutions, civil society and local
        communities;
    -   Strong support from national and international partners, including World Bank,
        WWF Brazil and German Development Cooperation (KfW and GTZ);
    -   Its innovative and efficient implementation structure, envolving the Brazilian
        NGO Funbio as the implementation agent of the Program;
    -   Clear, quantitative objectives that are directly linked to effective biodiversity
        conservation and emission reductions.

ARPA has been particularly successful in supporting the creation of new PAs, as well as
in establishing the Protected Areas Fund FAP as a long-term financing mechanism. In
addition, major progress has been made in strengthening the management of PAs,
through the creation of local PA councils, the development of management plans,



                                              40

capacity building and the implementation of new tools for PA management. Also, the
establishment of an efficient implementation mechanism via Funbio can be considered a
major achievement and a best practice example regarding implementation of huge scale
projects in the Brazilian Amazon.

However, other components have not been reaching its expected results: The
implementation of a biodiversity monitoring is still at an initial stage, and only a limited
number of income-generating projects for local communities has effectively been
implemented. While the FAP has been successful in meeting its capitalization targets, he
still lacks a more solid institutional structure as well as adequate operational procedures
for funding of PAs.

One of the huge challenges in the future will be the consolidation of the new PAs and to
ensure a basic support for the PA network in the Amazon. Specific attention should be
paid to enhance the cooperation between different categories of PAs (like state and
federal PAs, indigenous lands and PAs, strict protection and sustainable use PAs). Also,
the governance structure and the operational procedures of the FAP need to be revised
and improved.

A second phase of ARPA is under preparation. Germany has already committed
additional funds and reaffirmed its commitment to support PAs in the Amazon as an
important contribution to the conservation of biological diversity and to the mitigation of
climate change.

Comments received from WWF-Brasil

The WWF Network was pleased to contribute both technically and financially to the
implementation of the ARPA project in its first phase. We highlight the following:

Strengths

     The joint effort of all institutions involved (IBAMA/ICMbio, MMA, World Bank,
         GEF, KfW, WWF, GTZ, states participating in ARPA, Funbio);
     Funbio performed especially well in developing and executing a procurement and
         operational logistics system to meet program needs, particularly in creating
         designated accounts;
     Solid results were obtained in creating protected areas;
     Solid results were obtained in consolidating protected areas and the important
         positive impacts associated with maintaining forest cover in protected areas;
     Solid results were obtained in raising funds for the ARPA endowment fund;




                                               41

    Great steps forward in protected area management (management tools, human
       resources training in UC management and protected area management
       monitoring);
    Significant "ownership" by the Brazilian Government;

Weaknesses

    The management arrangement fails to adequately cover fundraising either for the
       FAP or the consolidation of protected areas
    Though worthy, the so-called community projects (component 2.3) have not been
       adequately internalized by UC managers or program decision-makers;
    The expenses-monitoring system (Cérebro) was unable to present adequate
       management reports on program execution and this became an obstacle to
       monitoring progress and preparing the second phase of the program;
    The lack of personnel in some protected areas was a determining factor in the
       unsatisfactory level of execution, especially in the first years of implementation;
    The monitoring component has failed to produce the satisfactory results which
       would allow the assessment of biodiversity conservation in the system of
       protected areas supported by the ARPA Program;

Overall Assessment

The ARPA Program may be considered a great success not only for meeting most of its
goals for the first phase, but especially for its relevant contribution to forming a mosaic of
protected areas in the Amazon to guarantee biodiversity conservation in situ, through the
implementation of innovative management systems and mechanisms and also for its
important contribution to the planet's climate.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Assessment of outputs was constrained in some sub-components due to an absence of
quantifiable indicators.

Component 1: Creation of New Protected Areas

One of the critical objectives of ARPA was to identify and prioritize candidate PAs to be
created and supported under the Project. A key tool to facilitate that process was the Map
of Priority Areas for the Conservation, Sustainable Utilization and Distribution of
Benefits of Brazilian Biodiversity adopted by MMA in 2007. A second strategic
instrument was the production of a Conservation and Investment Strategy to identify
existing and future financing needs and compare with available resources to facilitate
prioritization of PAs. ARPA played a fundamental role in development of both these
tools which will be critical for the Program's next phase. The legal creation (i.e.,
identification) of PAs was highly successful if compared to end of program indicators
and in fact had achieved substantial progress from the very onset of project
implementation. However following the creation of the PAs, progress slowed
significantly as the Project encountered all the challenges of establishment presence in
the field in remote areas of the Amazon. Using FAUC (a monitoring tool modified from
the WB/WWF Tracking Tool) which tracked percentage of change against indicators
demonstrated that no PA "created" under sub-component 1.2 had met all the criteria and
their respective minimal percentage requirements to be considered "established" by the
ICR.

Achieved outputs by subcomponent

1.1 Ongoing Process of Prioritization

Extensive and participatory priority setting of ecoregions undertaken for identification of
new PAs. Led to Map on Priority Areas to the Conservation, Sustainable Use and
Sharing of Benefits from the Brazilian Biodiversity.

1.2 Identification of New Areas

13 "strict protection" new PAs totaling 13.2 million ha created and 30 "sustainable use"
new PAs totaling 10.8 million ha created. All 24 million ha of new PAs created by
decrees approved and published in the official gazette.

1.3 Establishment of New Areas

24 million ha of new PAs have been decreed and demarcated with minimal infrastructure
established. New PAs created and demarcated, but there are pending land regularization
in a few areas.




                                            44

Component 2: Consolidation of Protected Areas

Only one PA (REBIO Uatumã) met all the criteria and threshold limits specified by the
project to considered "consolidated." 11 additional PAs were considered to be either in an
advance stage of consolidation and/or were targeted as priorities representing in
aggregate 6,900,000 ha in area. The preparation and approval of management plans was a
significant output of this component. A second key output was the establishment of
consultative councils (or its equivalent) in 33 PAs supported by ARPA.

Achieved outputs by subcomponent

2.1 Demarcation of Existing Areas,

All areas have been demarcated.

2.2 Basic Protection

Basic protection activities in place in all areas.

2.3 Management Planning

15 management plans prepared and being implemented. 33 PA Councils established.

2.4 Community Participation

Partnership and/or concession agreements with civil society being implemented in 4 PAs.
Community development plans and projects prepared and implemented in two
sustainable use PAs and Protection Plans prepared for 6 PAs.

Component 3: Long-term Sustainability of Protected Areas

This component achieved its main output consisting of the establishment and
capitalization of the Endowment Fund despite suffering the effects of a number of
external factors outside the control of the project including significant fluctuations in
currency rates of exchange and the global financial crisis of late 2008. In 2007, the
studies and sub-projects in buffer zones activity underwent a shift in focus that included
an increase in scope to the system level. This entailed examining other options as
possible sources of financing for the system of PAs including Brazil's compensation fund,
the green lottery and carbon sequestration. The initiation of on-site income generating
studies in support of sub-projects started late in the first phase and many are still on-
going. No sub-project was contracted under this component by the end of the Project.

Achieved outputs by subcomponent

3.1 Protected Areas Endowment Fund (FAP)




                                              45

Endowment fund created and capitalized to USD 23.4 million (plus EUR 10 million
committed but not deposited yet). No demonstration project launched. Three financial
market studies were carried out and a proposal for a large environmental compensation
fund to benefit the PAs has been put forward.

Component 4: Protected Areas Monitoring

In project design this component consisted of both technical (i.e., biodiversity) and
project monitoring. Under the former, this component only partially achieved its
projected outputs. The creation and application of FAUC proved to be an effective
monitoring tool in PCU. Similarly, the FUNBIO's M&E tool for financial management
and procurement (CEREBRO) also was effective for the objectives of which it was
designed.

Achieved outputs by subcomponent

4.1 Biodiversity monitoring system

Biodiversity monitoring indicators identified and under implementation on a pilot basis in
selected PAs. An integrated set of Monitoring, Evaluation and Planning systems
(SisARPA, CEREBRO) developed as part of the project's technical and financial
planning and programming.

Component 5: Project Coordination and Management

The PCU was established and despite initial challenges involving re-organization in
MMA entailing institutional displacement and periodic loss of staff, proved effective in
implementation of the Project. Moreover, there were obstacles to cohesion in the
Project's early years among the many institutional partners, which were later overcame.
All Committees and Panels were established. The CMC was established, but the project
did not receive any request that required mediation. Six State Executing Agencies
participated in the Project. The Project never established formal agreements or activities
at the municipal level.

Achieved outputs

Committees and coordination units fully functional. Institutional structures established
and functioning at all levels.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

During project preparation, according to the requirements of the GEF, an incremental
cost analysis was prepared. Over project implementation, a few studies were done to
identify income generation mecanisms and studies on the cost of implementing protected
areas in the Amazon. These were used to support the strategies for the recently created
institute for protected areas in Brazil (ICMBio). No further economic and financial
analysis was done.
