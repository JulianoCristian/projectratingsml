     area. The project will not support any activities that could\n            seriously harm the environment. Under the first component,\n            the identification and creation of new protected areas will\n            not have any impact on the environment. Under the second\n            component, the management of the buffer areas around the\n            parks and reserves will support some of sustainable use\n            reserve activities for the communities living around the\n            parks. These activities will be screened for environmental\n            impacts. Under the third component, two major activities\n            will be implemented: pilot projects to test\n            income-generating activities for the protected areas, and\n            endowment fund to support the recurrent activities of the\n            protected areas. Screening procedures will be conducted to\n            ensure that the recurrent activities and pilot sub-projects\n            do not violate any of the Bank safeguard policies. No\n            environmental impact is expected to result from these activities."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
