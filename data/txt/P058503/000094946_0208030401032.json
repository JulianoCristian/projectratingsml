Project (ARPA) is to expand and\n            consolidate the protected areas (PAs) system in the Amazon\n            Region of Brazil. The project is the first phase of a\n            10-year ARPA program. There are five project components. The\n            first component finances the creation of 18 million hectares\n            of PAs. Activities include collecting biological, social,\n            and economic data on the Amazon region; preparing studies,\n            consultations, and proposals; and establishment of the PAs.\n            The second component consolidates the new PAs by demarcation\n            and land regularizations, basic protection activities, and\n            preparation and implementation of management plans. The\n            third component establishes an endowment fund for long-term\n            sustainability of PAs. the fourth component establishes a\n            biodiversity monitoring system and supports analysis of new\n            and existing protected areas. This component supports\n            training for PA staff. The fifth component supports the\n            overall coordination of the various components in the\n            Ministry of Environment, the the Brazilian Institute for the\n            Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, and the\n            Brazilian Biodiversity Fund, and ensures implementation of\n            such management activities as preparation of supervisory\n            reports or any requests for information by donors,\n            preparation of annual operating plans, monitoring and\n            evaluation of project activities, procurement and financial\n            management, and communication and dissemination activities."}, "docdt": "2002-07-18T00:00:00Z"}
