   OED Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
      The Operations Evaluation Departmentassesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two
 purposes:first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank's self-evaluationprocessand to verify that the Bank's work is
 producingthe expected results,and second, to help develop improveddirections,policies,and proceduresthrough
the disseminationof lessons drawnfrom experience. As part of this work, OED annually assesses about 25 percentof
the Bank's lending operations. In selecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are
 innovative,large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcomingstudies or country evaluations;those for which
 ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank management have requested assessments;and thosethat are likely to generate
 importantlessons.The projects,topics, and analyticalapproachesselectedfor assessment support larger evaluation
studies,
      A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion
 Report (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department)and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare
PPARs, OED staff examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit
the borrowingcountry for onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to
validate and augment the information provided in the ICR, as well as examine issues of special interest to broader
OED studies.
      Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED management approval. Once cleared internally,the
PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then
sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the OED Rating System
      The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work.
The methodsoffer both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or
sectoral approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is
the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (more information is available on the OED website:
http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
      Relevance of Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's
current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
OperationalPolicies). Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
account their relative importance. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Efficiency: The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
Modest, Negligible. This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
      Susfainabilify: The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
      lnstitutional Development Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or region
to make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resources through: (a)
better definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b)
better alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these
institutionalarrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a
project. Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
      Outcome: The extentto which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and
supported implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibilityto ensure
quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the
achievementof development objectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,
Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) covers two projects inthe
Russian Federation. The HousingProject was approved on March 7, 1995, for a loan o f
US$400 million equivalent. Bythe closing date o f June 30,2003, US$210 millionof the
loanhadbeen disbursed;US$190 million had been cancelled. The Enterprise Housing
Divestiture Project was approved on May 7, 1995, for a loan of US$300 million
equivalent. By the closing date o f December 31,2003, US$lOS million o fthe loanhad
been disbursedand US$195 million hadbeen cancelled.

        This report i s based on the ImplementationCompletionReports for the projects,
legal documents and project files, and discussions with Bank staff involved inthe
projects. OED fielded a missionto the RussianFederation inOctober 2004 to review
project results. The mission met with Federation, Oblast, and Municipal officials of
government departments and agencies responsible for the projects, visited project sites in
Bamaul, Moscow, Novgorod, St. Petersburg,Tver, Vladimir, andVolkhov, andmet with
beneficiaries o f the projects inthose cities. The mission appreciates the courtesies and,
attention given by these interlocutors and the support providedby the Bank's country
office inMoscow.

        Following standard OED procedures, copies o f the PPAR were sent to relevant
government officials and agencies for their review and comments. No comments were
received.

 Summary
          In 1991, after the dissolution ofthe USSR, Russiainheritedtheworld's largesturban
 system andhousing stock formed outside the parametersand framework o fa market economy.
 This meant, from amarket point o f view, housing that was often poorly located, with unsure
 tenure and unsustainably low rents. While reformers were active inRussia's macro-economy;
 the housing sector was not part o f the "big bang" price liberalization designedto kick-start its
 own markets.

          Ofother housingreform issues on the agenda, the Bank focused primarily upon
transforming the supply side o fRussia's housing markets. Inthis context, the Housing
Project's main objective of facilitating the development o f Russia's housingmarket was and
remains substantially relevant. To support this aim, the Housing Project was a large package
o f house buildinginvestments through construction finance, urban land development and            '

technical assistance insix cities selected for their commitment to reform. Itwas under the
control of GOR departments responsible for construction and housing. By contrast, the
Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project's (EHDP) objective o faccelerating the sustainable
divestiture o f enterprise housing was most untimely:it aimed for a result already achieved
before the project itselfhadbegun.Most o fthe investmento fthe EHDP was for
municipalities in six cities-different from the Housing Project's and chosen for their
commitment to enterprise housing divestiture-to       retrofit former enterprise apartment
buildings with improved heating systems.TheEHDP also provided technical assistance and
housing allowances to the cities, ostensibly to hrther local housingreform. EHDP was under
the control o f the inter-ministerial Foundation o fEnterprise Restructuring (FER), to whom
the Ministryo f Economy haddelegated responsible for project implementation.

         The Housing Project hadmixedresults. Itpartially achieved some objectives by
helping Russia take modest steps toward transforming and developinghousing markets,
although less efficiently and on a smaller scale than intended.Through commercial banks, it
financed 3,232 new dwellingunits byprivate developers that sold for US$200 million.
Beneficiaries were mostly highincome. Inaddition, private developers acquired municipal
land through public auctions sponsored by the project and developed private housing on the
lots purchased, but on a much smaller scale than planned. Project housing deliveredthrough
the private sector inthis way was attractive insofar as it was mostly filly occupiedbut it was
more costly and less efficient than expected. There were also some positive results in
stimulating regulatory reforms, especially regardingproperty title registration. Onthe
negative side, the project did not succeed inbreaking upthe govemmeqt monopoly on the
supplyo furbanland, as hadbeenintended.Theproject also failed to help establish amodem
buildingmaterialsindustry,partlybecause it overlookedthe role that imports o fsuch
materials would play.

         The EHDP's results were altogether poor and only very little was achieved. Most
divestiture o f enterprise housingoccurred (throughout the Russian Federation) before the
project, to which it owed nothing. Inany case, the project design provided no instruments to
assist divestiture. Infact, the rhythm o f divestiture inthe six participating cities was slower
duringproject implementationthan it hadbeenbefore. Another important failure was the .
inabilityto contain the expansion o fpublic housing, as intended, since the project didnot
follow through with privatization. Privatizationwas a key aim and essential design element
o f the project that was not supported bythe executing agency, FER.Also, far from making
divestiture affordable to municipalities, the project imposed heavy financial burdens upon

participating cities both by increasing their debt-with a high-risk foreign exchange
element-and     the extra costs o fmaintaining a larger housingstock. Another shortcoming
was that energy efficiency gains through heating improvements were not on the scale
expected, and did not yield significant benefits to the municipalities. There were some minor
development benefits o fthe project, however, through broadening private sector coverage of
housing maintenance inthe project cities, albeit with little competition among providers.

         OEDrates the overall outcome ofthe Housing Project as moderately
unsatisfactory, for only partially achieving its objectives, with major shortcomings.
Sustainability i s ratedunlikely on balance, although the resilience across differentbenefit
streams varies considerably. Institutional developmentimpact, on a far smaller scale than
hoped, i s ratedas modest.Bankperformance i s rated unsatisfactory given the conflict over
project design, mixedsignals to the borrower, and the very costly preparation effort.
Borrower performance is rated satisfactory, but only marginally so, given its costliness and
inadequate attention to the accountability o fproject funds.

         The overall outcome o fthe Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project, for its pursuit of
anuntimely objective that hadalready beenachieved i s ratedby OED as unsatisfactory,
although the PPARmission found some minor development benefits inthe form o fprivate
sector provisiono fhousing maintenance services. Sustainability i s rated highly unlikely, as
the project generatedno resilientbenefit streams o fany significance. Institutional development
impact is rated as negligiblesince the project ledto no significant changes to the way housing
sector businesswas done inRussia that could help sector resourcesto be usedmore efficiently.
Bankperformance israted as highly unsatisfactoryprimarilybecause o fthe flawedproject
design, while Borrowerperformance i s also ratedhighly unsatisfactory,principally for the
failure to pursue the keyprivatization dimension o fthe project's objective.

         Experience with these projects highlights the following OED lessons:

    Having demonstrated that housingmarkets can work inRussia, reformers needto move
    on quickly to find sustainable solutions for the poor, who have drawn no benefit from    I

    project results thus far.
    For more public landto become available for private urban development inRussia's
    cities, the concerns o fmunicipalities (reluctant to part with their source o fpower and
    influence) and private developers (unsure o ftheir security o ftenure and that
    infrastructure will beprovided) needto be addressed.
    To help improve city level performance (of any kind),project design should incorporate
    performance-related criteria to determine the allocation o fresources across cities.
    When Borrowers find themselves indisagreement with project objectives, the Bank
    should helpthemrecognize the need to formally restructure or cancel an operation.

 1.        Housing Reform Needed on an Unprecedented Scale

RUSSIA'S       LARGE IMPORTANTHOUSING
                          AND                              SECTOR

 1.1        A t the time of the USSR's dissolution in 1991, 73 percent o fRussia's population
was urban. With 109 million people living incities at that time, Russia hadthe fifth largest
urbanpopulation inthe world in 1991after China (324 million); India (223 million); Unit-
ed States (190 million); and Brazil (111million). Mass housingconstruction programs
during1956-1970o flarge-scale industrializedpanel apartment buildings on the peripheries
o fbigcities helped bequeath to Russia the largesthousing stock inthe world developed
entirely outside a market economy. These conditions posed unprecedented challenges for
housing reform: poor and distant locations; constraints uponurbanland ownership;
continuing state responsibilityfor multi-familybuildings; andunreformedrents. All this i s
incities whose spatial structuresinvert the typical density curves ofmarket-drivencities
that have high-value high-densitycores surrounded by lower-value lower-density
peripheries (Bertaud 1995).

1.2          Housingwas not includedinthe "big bang" price liberalization that kick-started
Russia's market economy in 1992, under reforming Prime Minister Gaidar. Housing
rents, for instance, remainedfixed at their 1928 levels with little cost recoverythrough
them (Lodahl2001 p.197). Households typically paid only 3.1 percent o ftheir income on
housing and utilities in 1990-rking               to 7 percent by 2000, but still well below the 20-25
percent norm o fwestern market economies (ibid.). Still, 1992 provided an opportunity
for reformers and others to develop and exploit a market system for housing. But it was
an opportunitytempered by extraordinary macro-economic and political stress, in
particular declining incomes, rising unemployment and hyperinflation (Table 1.1).

 Social housing     Housing for the poor was not considereda priority as most Russianshad shelter
                    of some kind. Reformersconsideredmost USSR housing programsto have helped

 Maintenanceof      Lack of maintenancewas already a problemin Soviettimes, but itwas not felt to

2.1        Fromthis broadmenu, the Bank and the new Government o fthe Russian
Federation(GOR) decided that Bank assistance would focus upon the supply of new
housing. Restartinghousebuildingwas naturally welcomed bythe Bank's chief
interlocutor, the Ministry o f Construction(Minstroi, later Gosstroi) host to key sector
reformers. Bank economic and sector work (ESW) on housing--conducted inRussia
during 1991-92, but only disseminated three years later-also                   encouraged support for     I
new construction, among many other things (World Bank 1995)'

 2.2       For reforming the maintenance and operation o f Russia's existing 55 million
 dwellings, GOR sought assistance mostly from USAID's large ongoingprogram. The
Bank's own interest inexisting housing came modestly and indirectly through its support
 for the divestiture (i,e., transfer) o f enterprise housing to municipalities. Enterprise
housing for workers, typical o f most Soviet firms, was reckoned to undermine their
productionefficiency (Commander et al. 1996; Struyk 1997 p. 95). Other housingissues,
 such as privatizationo furban land, multi-family buildings, utility services and
developing the legal framework, featured inthe projects reviewed here. Housing finance,
on the other hand, was felt to bepremature inRussia's unstable monetary environment.
 Special GOR housing programs and decentralization also didnot attract Bank interest.

2.3       A keyhousingreform issue not addressedwas socialhousingfor low income
 and poor families. Neither GOR nor the Bank considered it apriority at the time. At the
Boardpresentation of the HousingProject, for instance, Bank staff announced that:
"There i s an abundanceo f social housing inRussia, and a shortage o f slightly better
housing that would provide exit opportunities for inhabitants o f the existing housing
stock.''

BANKRESPONSETHROUGHTHE TWO HOUSING                              PROJECTS

2.4       Housing Project (Ln3850): Withvery large financing needs inmid-1992, GOR,
through Minstroi, requesteda Bankloano f US$600-800 million for a housingconstruction
project.The Bank's country department, focused on structural adjustment, didnot share the
operating division's keenness for such a large investment project. Disputesinitially over
project designbetween individual staff o fthe Bank's operations andpolicy departments
disrupted project preparation (as well as related ESWwork) and ledto mixed signals fiom
the Bankto the Borrower about the Bank's commitment to this as apriority project. Such
lack ofteam work underminedthe quality o fBank service to the Borrower-through                            the
lack of synergybetween ESW andproject work, for instance-and prevented Bank sector
knowledge beingfully and effectivelybrought to bear uponthe project. Most Bankstaff
interviewed by OED confirmedthat project preparation hadbeen contentious andthat
project ideaswere extremely volatile untilsettlinguponthe finally approved package,
namelyhousing construction investments andtechnical assistanceinsix cities to be
financed by a Bank loan o fUS$400million. For that package, USAID offeredgrant money
o fUS$10 millionto assistprojectpreparation.

2.5       Enterprise HousingDivestiture Project EHDP (Ln4012): A different ministry,
                                                               -
GOR's MinistryofEconomy, wantedmore Bank assistancewith enterprise restructuring.
TheBank introduced housingpolicy and district heating to this dialogue. To an already
eclectic design mix, elements o fmunicipal development were added, since cities were to
execute the project locally. Far from blending smoothly, all these disparate elements left
the project without apurpose anddirection necessary to build support andconsensus.

focus may help explain the only passing reference to the ESW by the Housing Project and none at all by the
EHDP   .

 2.6      There was little Bank coordinationacross the two projects intheir preparation.
 The later EHDP project documentation makes no reference to the Housing Project. The
 earlier project simply mentioned the EHDP coming on line. With Minstroi (later Gosstroi
 o f the Ministryo f Industry) incharge o f the HousingProject, and the Ministryof Econo-
 myrespons;ble for EHDP(with implementationdelegated to aninter-ministerialFound-
 ation for Enterprise Restructuring (FER)) little coordination came from GOR either.2

 2.7      Although both projects were part o f the G7 industrial countries' framework for
 accelerated assistance to Russia, preparation was not unduly hasty: 16months for the
 HousingProject and 20 months for EHDP.Bothhadplentyo fresources for preparation,
 especially the Housing Project which mobilized 99 stafflconsultant visits to Russia,
thanks to USAID funding. EHDP sent 29. GOR spoke to OED o f the logisticalproblems
 receiving Bank missions o f 25 or more people inand around Moscow and GOR
 bewildermentover whom to make contact with among the manymissionmembers.

 RELEVANCE OF PROJECTAIMS

 2.8      Housing Project (Ln3850): The primary objective o f developing Russia's
housingmarket (Box 2.2) was substantially relevant to GOR's priorities and Bank
 strategy at the time of project preparation and remains so today. Most secondary
objectives o fthe project also were substantially relevant, except one aiming to break up
GOR's "monopoly inthe supply o furban land". This was a strange aim ina place that
had no functioning land markets. By choice and design, the project was most relevant td
the reform issues on the supply side o f the housing market, especially new housing
construction. Any one operation would be able, o f course, to focus only upon a few
themes o f Russia's very broadhousing reform (Box 1). Evenso, some GOR officials told

objective of accelerating the sustainable divestitureo f enterprise housing (Box 2.2) was
only a caricature o fwhat a project objective shouldbe. It was aiming for what had
already beenachieved before the project had even started. By then most enterprise
housing inRussia had already beendi~ested.~           Thus, it was no longer relevant to Russia's
ongoing housingreform. Some secondary objectives-notably                     containing the size o fthe
municipal housing stock and increasing energy efficiency-were                  perhaps more relevant
to housingreform insofar as they looked away from enterprise,housingdivestiture itself.

 FOCUS OF THE PROJECT DESIGNS

 Housing Project (Ln3850): Project components (Box 2.2) were consistent with the main
 objective, especially its supply side. GOR chose six participating cities for their commit-
 ment to the project's reformagenda. Inprinciple, MOSCOW'S to be limitedto
                                                                 role was
 hostingjust small-scale demonstration investments, since the city was already a magnet
 for donors and for foreign investment too. The largest component planned (but only one
 quarter implemented) was the auction o fmunicipal land and its development for housing
 byprivate developers. Theproject's support to buildingmaterials industries seemed a
 logical step to help ensurethat builderswould have the modern materials that they
 needed,but imports were not considered bythe project designers as an alternative source.
 Finally among the components, technical assistance (TA) for institutional andpolicy
 development, appropriately addressedas a priority property title registration-needed        to
 legitimize sellers and buyers inthe market.

 2.10     Consistent with the project objectives, but criticizedbyBank staff for it during
preparation, the project designincludedno components to deliver benefits to the poor.

2.11      The designconceived oftop-down management, eventhoughmanyprojectresults
dependeduponthe effective participation o f local government at boththe oblast (regional,
provincial or district) and municipal (city) levels. The central GORhadnot been keen on
lendingto sub-national authorities at all, but had deferred to the preference o f the Bank's
urban development department for greater decentralization. Municipalities themselves were
not too enthusiastic either, especially giventhe foreign exchange risk o fproject sub-loans.

2.12      This project management modelwas complex, costly, andvolatile. Itneeded .
fourteen subsidiary loan andparticipation agreements with cities and commercial banks.
As well as a projectimplementationunit (PIU) inGOR, a consortiumo f international
advisors, "the general consultant" was to overseeproject implementation. This
arrangement ledto excessive costs and wasteful duplicationrepeatedly questioned by
project financial audits.

2.13     Doubts about correctness o fthe supply side focus o fthe project design continued
within the Bank. Through its 1998 RussiahousingESW update, the Bank saw
reassigning (misallocated) existinghousingunits through markettransactions as an
alternative to new supply inmeetingdemand(World Bank 1998. p. v). But this new
insightdidnot leadto are-design o fthe HousingProjectitself.

2.14     EHDP (Loan 4012):Projectcomponents hadlittle to do with the main, albeit
irrelevant, objective o f this operation, nor could they. The largest o f these, the installation
ofmodernheat exchange equipment andimprovinginsulationto improve energy
efficiency accounting for 65-75 percent o f total project costs, was not even aimed            e

exclusively at former enterprise housing. With little project guidance on selecting
buildings for retrofits, anymunicipal housingwas eligible. Inthe context o fRussia's
sector reforms, one might have expectedproject guidance on the selection o fmarketable
units-the   better located, conditionand age, for instance-as    priority for such
investments. Instead, the project simply recommended giving first attention to larger

                                               7


buildingsthat might yield economies of scale ofthe works. But, for cost recovery
reasons, the project design also gave apreference to buildings with active condominium
associations. Project components to upgrade central boilers and main heating
infrastructureunder streets wexe even more disconnected from enterprise housing. TA
too, being mostly directed at city administrations, hadmore to do with municipal
development than enterprise housingdivestiture.

2.15     Yet the project documentation mentioned enterprises as beingthe main
beneficiaries. But they do not feature as much inthe project design as the project title
would lead one to expect. Enterprises are conspicuous by their absence from the project
stakeholder analysis, for instance. Their only project role i s to off-load their unwanted
housing and vanish from project sight. A more consistent designwould have at least
included an assessment o f the impact-using     the baseline surveys o f 24 enterprise
conducted duringpreparation-af housing divestiture upon enterprise efficiency, whose
improvement was given as the raison d'gtre o fthe project. With such an assessment, we
mightat least have learnedifthe enterprises became moreproductive after divestingtheir
housing, as hoped.

2.16     Instead, the design gave more attention to the selection ofbeneficiary cities. A
short list o f 13 and then6 finalists (Box 2.2) were chosen by GOR and the Bank as being
cities that hadprogressed furthest indivestiture akeements with enterprises, municipal
cost recovery, establishing condominium associations, and enabling a competitive market
for maintenance. Inother words, it chose the best performing cities. Project start-up was
planned, nevertheless, with demonstration investments inthe city ofRyazan, 150
kilometers southwest o fMoscow.

2.17     Evenwith today's hindsight, it is not easy to characterize what this project really
was and to understand its intendedrole inRussia's development. Was it a housing
reform, district heating, municipal development, or enterprise restructuring operation, or
all or none o f these?This ambiguity was both the result andthe cause o f inadequate
specialist inputs, especially by the Bank, at key moments o fproject preparationand
implementation. Inshort, it was the result o fpoor Bank performance both at the design
stage and during implementation.


3.       Results ofHousingProject (Ln. 3850)

IMPLEMENTATIONISSUES

3.1      Like other projects inthe Bank's Russiaportfolio at the time, disbursements
were initially slow. Since private sector demandfor municipal landdevelopment was
weaker thanexpected, efforts were made to disseminate the project andits reform
agenda, including skilfuluse o f the popular "teleutro" show onpublic television. Russia's
financial crisis in 1998 nevertheless disrupted such efforts. It led to even slower
disbursements, andto a political shakeup o f a GORproject team. GORwas no longer
keento establish a new all-powerful Minzemstroi (Ministry o f LandPolicy, Construction
and Municipal Economy) recommended by the project team. President Putinshowed

                                                    8


 great interest inhousing shortly after he took office in2001, but too late for aproject near
to closing. Already by 1998, GOR officials felt that the Bank hadbecome excessively
concerned with minutiae ofproject administration. This perceived shift came shortly after
the assignment o fthe Bank's country director to the field inMoscow. It also coincided
with concerns over project accounts expressed byproject financial audits.

3.2       The project financial audit o fFY1998, inparticular, highlightedthe costly-
US$3.5 million per annum-duplication o fproject management conducted by GOR's
PIUon the one hand and the General Consultant (a consortiumo f international advisors)
on the other. As well as incomplete financial reporting, this audit also found US$479,500
o fproject funds spent upon one foreign consultant over a three-year periodwithout
evidence o f any work performed. Another individual, who had worked as a Bank
consultant, shortly thereafter worked for the project itself (on GOR's side) in
contravention o f Bankhiringpractices. Obviously, Bank supervision effort had to give
more attention to day-to-day due diligence within the project.

3.3      Despite slow disbursements, GORwas reluctant to cancel unusedloan amounts,
even as the Bank urgedit to after 1998. Instead, GOR proposed restructuring the project
to finance certificates for the purchase o f subsidized housing, but the Bank didnot agree
to a change so far removed from the original objective o f developing housingmarkets.
TheBanknevertheless reluctantly agreed to Gosstroi's request to extend the closing date
by 18monthsuntilDecember 2003, bywhichtimeUS$195 million of the loanhadbeen
cancelled.


FACILITATING      HOUSING      MARKET      DEVELOPMENT       INRUSSIA     (PRIMARY OBJECTIVE)

3.4       Partiallyachieved: Infinancing private developerhousingprojects inparticipating
cities through commercial banks, the project helpedprovide 3,232 new dwelling units,
thereby generatingapproximately US200millioninnewsales. One downside isthatthe                         '

largest city shareo fproject lendingfor construction finance-totaling           US$36.0 million-
went to Moscow, withits alreadydynamic urbaneconomy andlivelyhousingmarketleast
dependentuponforeign assistanceamongRussia's cities. Higher-income families benefited
most inMoscow, as elsewhere. The most costly scheme financed bythe projectwas the
Novogorsk settlement inMoscow. Itconsisted o f 120single-family houses eachwith 164
squaremeters o flivingspace costing US$221,9 16per unitto buildandprobably sellingat
twice that value. Visitingseveralother housingschemesinother cities the OEDmission
could confirmthat most were hllyoccupied andfinished to a goodstandard. InSt.
Petersburg,they rangedfiom the luxury closed condominiumo fKrestovskyOstrov (86
apartments; 120squaremeters; US$166,395 cost each) to large 10-12 floor panel-built
apartmentbuildings (337 apartments; 61 squaremeters; US$26,617 cost each). Ironically,
the more affordable units were decried byWesternersfor their unattractive Soviet style.




4. During 1995-2002 the housing stock inMoscow (city plus oblast) grewby 16.7 percent, more than twice

3.5                     Theproject also increasedhousing-related fmancebyprivate commercial banksthat
made construction loans to developers. Invisitingone suchbank inSt. Petersburg,the OED
mission learnedthat its housing-related clients hadabove-averagecreditworthiness, andthat
the bankwould like to see this business expand. Important constraintsremain, however, such
as banks' unwillingness, ingeneral, to do business incities outside their homebase, andthe
continued strongpresence o f state-owned banks, such as Sberbankinthis market.

STIMULATING MUNICIPAL                                                      LAND PRIVATEHOUSING
                                                                              AND                                   DEVELOPMENTS

3.7                     Partially achieved: Against the planned 16 sub-projects covering 575 hectares,
the project financed 12 sub-projects covering only 110hectares. Demandwas much                                                                             ,
weaker than expected. The first project attempt to auction land(inNovgorodinlate
1995) attracted only one bidder and had to be suspended. City authorities there told OED
that project TA helpedthem prepare press announcements for a re-run auction that
eventually attracted bidders from Germany, UK, France, and Scandinavia, as well as
other parts o fRussia. HeldinMarch 1996, the bidprice exceeded the reserve by 35
percent. OED mission discussions with local officials invarious cities confirmedthat
there hadbeen little dissemination to them o f the Novgorod experience. St. Petersburg's
largerland auctions followed shortly thereafter, but they also attracted fewer bids than
expected, as did Tver's. Auctions inNizhnyNovgarod andBamaulwere more
successful. Inboth cases, auctions were widely advertised inMoscow itself. Infew of
these cases, however, did city revenues from the auctions' landsales fully cover
municipalities' infrastructure costs inservicing the plots sold.

3.8                     Three reasonswere commonly givenbymunicipalities anddevelopers for these
under-achevements. They maybeworthbearinginmindwhen conducting suchoperations
inthe hture.First,municipalitieswere reluctantto partwithland, asourceoftheirpowerand

                                                 10


influence. Second, private developers feared that city authorities might decide against the
timelyprovision ofinfrastructureto a site, adecisionover which they, as private developers,
hadno control. Thrd, some developersdidnot feel security o ftheir own tenure over urban
land"sold" to them inthis way, particularlywhenit could onlybe"re-sold" back to the local
authority, andnot to thirdparties, as it would inan open landmarket. Hindsightthus shows
that the Bankstaffassuranceat Boardpresentationthat theproject providedfor fillland
ownership to the final beneficiaries was exaggerated.For all these shortcomings-especially
inscale-the    project didlegitimize, for the first time, the process o flandauctions inRussia.

3.9       Local authorities inNovgorodand St. Petersburginformed OEDthat additional land
auctions (beyond the project) were underway at the time ofthe OEDmission. Morethan 100
lots were auctioned inSt. Petersburg(andthe surrounding oblast) inthe thirdquarter of2004
alone, for instance. Novgorod-again     as pioneer-has     recently made its landauction proce-
dures moretransparentbyholdingpublic hearingsbefore the actual auction itselfgoes ahead.

BREAKINGUPTHE GOVERNMENT              MONOPOLY        OF URBANLAND       SUPPLY

3.10      Not achieved: T h ~was becausetherewas a failure o fdesign that incorrectly
                                s
assumedthat an urbanlandmarket existedinthe RussianFederationinwhich the
government was amonopolysupplier. Suchamarket didnot exist at the time o fproject
preparation, nor does it still. Housingexperts agree that landmarkets are an area where
housing sector reformhasprogressedleast (Struyk 2000). With95 percent o furbanlandstill
reckoned to be inthe handsof the public sector, there is enormous scope for its divestiture.

DEMONSTRATING PRIVATE HOUSING'S              GREATER      EFFICIENCYANDATTRACTIVENESS

3.11      Partially achieved: Giventhehigher actualaverageunit costso fhousing
(US$63,469) versus that estimated(US$55,562), project housing investment was less
efficient thanintended. Buttreating demandas anindicator o fthe "attractiveness" o fproject
housing (rather than some aesthetic attribute), it was attractive for beingl l l y occupied for
the most part.The OED missionwas ableto confirmt h s during site visits inNovgorod, St.
Petersburg, andBamaul.The project builtawide range ofhousingtypes. These included
detachedsingle-familyunits, five-floor walk-up apartment buildmgs, andlarge-scale25
floor blocks (inSt. Petersburg) reminiscent ofearlier Soviet structures-at      leastvisually.

HELP   ESTABLISH    MODERN      BUILDINGMATERIALS         INDUSTRIES

3.12     Not achieved:There islittle evidencethat the project succeededinencouragingthe
establishmento fmodembuildingmaterials industries. The project didprovide-but at only
27 percent o fthe level expected-equity participation insix enterprisesinSt. Petersburgto
produce water pipesandwindows. While the 20beneficiary plants didincreaseproduction,
macro data for Russia show a declining output trend. Except for bathroom furniture, the
production o fmost buildingmaterials fell significantly duringproject implementation, even
while there was asmallincreaseinthenumberoffirms (Table 3.2). What the project design
failed to contemplate, were largescale imports o fhigh-qualitymaterials that are now
commonplace inRussia.

3.13      PartiaZZy achieved: Withinthe largeTA effort fieldedbythe project, the greatest
impact locallywas felt throughpropertytitle registration. Project TA helpedcities conduct
aerial surveys, set up central title registries (cadastres), carry out property surveys, and
establishproceduresfor helpingthe public to register titles. The project helpedconsolidate
Novgorod's own "single window" system-now                      inoperationfor 10year-that             allows   '


citizens to resolve all their propertytitling andtaxation issues inone easily accessibleplace.
DuringOED's visit to it, the single window was staffedby 13, who, amongotherjobs, deal
with50inquiries fiomthepublicper ninehourday. BamaulinSiberiareportedgettingless
attention from project TA, butwas still able to register the titles o f60 percent ofproperties in
the city. Later, project assistancehelpedprovide state-of-the-art software andhardware
support for titlingto more than33 cities across the RussianFederation, dispellingconcerns
that only ahandfulo fRussiancities may bereform-minded. An evenbroader impact was                             ,
throughencouraging laws instrumental to reform. Some 27 pieceso fnational legislation
relatedto housing were prepared andapprovedduringproject implementation (Box 3 lists
laws most closely associatedwiththe project). While the USAID-hdedInstituteofUrban

4.       ResultsofEnterpriseHousingDivestitureProject(Ln.4012)

IMPLEMENTATIONISSUES

4.1       Disbursements were slow for this project too. Reluctant at first to lend`anything
at all to local government, GOR wanted to tightly control project municipal credit and to
levy even higher interest on cities than the Bank itselfproposed. Another problemwas
that city responsibilities under the project-and those o fFERtoo-were                 not always
clear. Inone case, this ledto legal suit by a service provider against bothparties-city .
andFER-for        the alleged non-payment of a particular contract.

4.2       Onthe Bank side, a successionof six task managers over a seven-year period
frustrated the Borrower and appearedto have left GOR and FERwiththe impressionthat
Bank rules, standards, andprocesseswere similarly volatile. Unsignedsupervision aide
memoires were an indicator o f a difficult Bank-FER dialogue. For its part, EHDPhad to
compete for FER's attention with five other projects that FERwas responsible for
overseeing.

4.3       As happened withthe HousingProject, FERnotedthat Bank attentionto, and
interest inbroader sectoral issues inEHDPbeganto be displaced by a greater concern
with day-to-day oversight o fproject administration. The FY1998 project accounts found,
for instance, evidence o f misappropriation o f significant project funding for activities
unrelated to the project, such as the transfer o f enterprises' social assets to municipalities.
FER's assessment ofthe project at closing, nevertheless, highlightsthat the Bankhadnot
once declared mis-procurement during project implementation.

ACCELERATINGRHYTHMOFDIVESTITURE

4.4       Not achieved: Contrary to the acceleration intended, divestituredecelerated
duringproject implementation (andthereafter). The enterprise housing stock o fthe six
EHDPcities (Box 2.2) fell at an acceleratedrate-averaging              a 17.8 percent drop per
annumduring 1992-95. Inother words, fastest divestituretook placet>rior to project
appraisal inAugust 1995. While the project was being implementedduring 1996-2003,                       I

the annual decline of the enterprise housing stock slowed to just 6.5 percent o fthe total
outstanding inthe EHDPcities-a             rate that was even slower thanthe 8.1 percent
observed for the RussianFederation as a whole over the same period. Experts on
Russia's housing agree that the divestiture had a nationwide dynamic prior to andwas
well beyondthe scope o f a single operation such the EHDP (O'Leary et al. 1996). As



5. Estimates derived fromthe following figures. Number of buildings inEHDP cities' enterprisehousing
stock: 1992-9,OI1;   1995-3,287; 2003 - 1,139. Total areaof enterprise housingin Russia: 1995 192

                                                    millionm2 or 0.5 million dwelling units (Rosstat)

already mentioned, the divestiture was made intrinsically sustainable not by the project,
butby a legal and political framework that ensuredthat it was irreversible.

4.5       OED could findno linkat the city levelbetweenthe rhythmofdivestitureandthe
level o fEHDPproject interventions. Although the project S A R announcedthat the amount o f
project finding wouldbe awardedineach city accordingto the pace o fits divestiture, there i s
no evidencethat ths happened.Therewas no correlation at the city levelbetweenthe pace o f
divestiture-measured bytherelative decline ofthe enterprise housing stock-and      the share
ofEHDPproject fundingthrough sub-loansto the municipality(Table 4.1). Petrozavodsk,
first place interms o fpace of divestitureduringimplementation, by reducing its enterprise
housingby 95 percent during 1995-2003,was only infifthplace inthe share o fproject
disbursementsit received, having slippedfi-om fourthplace inthe rankingo fcommitments.

Firstplace inthe share o fproject disbursements(up fi-om thirdplace inthe rankingo f
commitments) went to Cherepovets, a city that was only infifthplace inreducingits
enterprisehousing-by     only 46 percent during 1995-2003, havingdone more priorto the
project. Except for the smaller companytown ofVolkhov, neither the absolute level o fcity
populationnor the size o fthe enterprisehousing stock seem to havebeen factors in
determiningthe levelo fproject support.Fromthts evidence, OED concludesthat divestiture
performance criteria didnot determineproject fbndingdecisions.

CONTAININGMASSIVE         INCREASESOF PUBLICHOUSING        (THROUGH      PRIVATIZATION)

4.6       Not achieved: Since privatizationdidnot occur on a significant scale while
enterprise housingwas transferred to cities, EHDP municipal housing stocks continuedto
grow, contrary to the project's intent. The municipalhousing stock o f EDHP cities at
project's end in2003 consisted o f 16,062 buildings, nearlydouble the 8,3 13 buildings
prior to EHDPin 1992. Without privatization, the transfer o fhousing from enterprises to

                                               14


municipalities remains a zero-sum game from this perspective, as the decline inthe
enterprise housing stock is mirrored inthe rise of the municipal stock.

4.7       Containing the municipal part o fthe public housing stock appears to have
worked better at the level of the RussianFederation as a whole than inthe EHDP cities in
particular, however. Russia's municipal stock actually fell from 783 millionsquare
meters (16.4 million dwelling units)in 1995 to 626 million square meters (12.6 million
dwellingunits) in2003 (Rosstat). Moscow and St. Petersburg alone account for most o f
the fall, while smaller cities showed small gains over this period. One result i s that in .
2003 the EHDP city o fRyazan (population: 0.5 million) had a larger municipal housing
stock than Moscow (population: 8.2 million), whereas MOSCOW~S       stock hadbeenfourteen
times larger thanRyazan's in 1995.

4.8       Privatization to contain the growth o f the municipal stock was not actively
pursuedbyEHDP.This was akey flaw ofproject implementation.FERinformed OED
that it considered the project's privatization aim to have lapsed after the Bank sent a letter
inJune2001 statingthat itwouldnotregard lack ofprogress inprivatizationas areason
for premature termination o fthe project. This didnot amount to the Bank's abandoning
the project's privatization objective, o f course. That would have required a formal
amendment to the loan agreement, something not pursuedeither by the Bank or
Borrower. That Bank policy andprocedures inthis regard were not fully understood
supports an earlier and more general findingo f OED's CAE for Russia, that only a small
number of government officials and advisors hada goodgrasp ofthe Bank's views on
reform (Zannini 2002. p.11).

4.9       Hadmore project attentionat the design stage been given to privatization,
marketability mighthave beenamong the criteria for choosing priority housing for
heating retrofits. Thus, better located buildings ingood condition with clear tenure status
mighthavehadahigherpriority. Poorly locatedanddilapidatedbuildingsmight not, ina
market sense, beworth improving. They might even be slated for demolition. Ignoring
marketfactors such as these, the EHDPS A R simply recommended investinginlarge
buildings to achieve economies of scale inthe works, whatever theworth o fthe housing
itself. Without applying any market-inspired criteria, the EDHP tried to improve all       '

kindso fbuildings-largehmall,      oldnew, centravperipheral. At the city level, selection
criteria were opaque.

MAKINGDIVESTITURE        AFFORDABLE FOR MUNICIPALITIES

4.10     Not achieved: Farflombeingaffordable, divestiture imposedheavyfinancial
burdensonmunicipalities through increaseddebt exposure(with foreign exchangerisk) and'
additional costs ofoperating andmaintaining an enlarged housingstock. These problems
were highlightedinFY 1998financial audits. Cities informed OEDthat they hadlittle choice
about whether to accept enterprisehousing or not. The transfer was nevertheless amajor
program o fthe RussianFederation, inwhtchmunicipalities felt they should carry their
weight andmoreover hlfilltheir politicalandsocial responsibilities to the affected citizens.

                                                15


4.11      EHDP offered the idea o f establishing condominium associations inmulti-family
buildings as away of easing the financialburdenofmaintenance costs onmunicipalities
by sharing them with residents. Altogether 510 such associations covering 2,543
buildingswere established inthe EHDP project cities, but the maintenance o fthe
majority o fprivatized housingremains a municipalresponsibility. Specific data was not
available from the EHDP cities, but for the RussianFederation as awhole, less than 10
percent o fhousing i s covered by condominium associations. EHDP city officials
informed the OED missionthat they didnot have current plans to create more, andthat
they expected to continuemost maintenance. Officials inBamaul, anon EHDPcity, told
OED that they had200 condominiumassociations inoperation inthe city. The Bank             ,
itself seemedunsure how to support this after an earlier proposal o f a large-scale stand-
alone adjustment program for this was tumed downby Bank management.

 PROTECTING     VULNERABLE      GROUPS  THROUGHTARGETED        HOUSING    ALLOWANCES

4.12      Partially achieved: The project spent US$30.4 million (against US$84.4 million
planned) on allowances to help poorer families unable to afford the higher payments for
maintenance that greater cost recoveryinevitably incurred. FER reportedthat the criteria
to select eligible families were more rigorously and transparently applied inproject cities
thaninRussiaas awhole, which were considered to bewell targetedbyhousingexperts
(Struyk 2000). EHDP cities passedlocal ordinances detailing the criteria for selecting
beneficiaries and for determining amounts to be awarded. Over the 1996-2003 period,
EHDP allowances paid to beneficiary families steadily increased, exceeding the averages
for Russia, but still accounting for no more than 1.8 percent o fmunicipal budget expens-
es. This reflects a national trend, whereby 2.7 million families inRussia receivingUS$42
millioninsubsidies rose to 7.1million families receivingUS$944 million in2003.

 INCREASINGPRIVATE SECTORPARTICIPATIONINHOUSING                 MAINTENANCE

4.13      Partially achieved: Inmost EHDP cities the share o fallmaintenance services
throughcompetitively contractedprivate providers increasedsignificantly duringthe
implementation o fthe project (Table 4.2). Morethan40 tenders were launched for t h s
purpose. Volkhov leads, now providingallmaintenancethroughthe private sector, but

REDUCING HOUSING        COSTSTHROUGH       ENERGYEFFICIENCY       COST SAVINGS

4.14      Not achieved:EHDPdidmakesignificant investments,albeit on a smaller scale
thanintended, to helpmunicipalities saveheatingcosts.Theresultswere considerably less
thanexpected, however, leadingmunicipalities to saveonlyof6.1percenttheir expenditures
onheating against an appraisaltarget o f34 percent.

4.15      Most project investment was innew heat exchange equipment andbetter
insulation in 1,192 buildingswith 124,155 apartments. OED inspected project provided
equipment in some 25 such buildings inthe cities o f Volkhov and Vladimir and found all
of it to be operational. While no resident interviewedbythe OED missioncomplained
about insufficient heating, a few said that excessive heating still required them to open
windows on cold winter days. Energyefficiency was underminedby operators (and their
equipment) not knowing indoor temperatures within apartments, where no thermostatic
control was installed, even though it hadbeen plannedby the projects. Without
thermostats even ina sample o f a few apartments, informationabout comfort levels o f
final beneficiaries was not available to set the correct intensityof operation o f each
building's central equipment. Insteadthe level o f heat transfer equipment operation was
determinedby Soviet-era formulae that considered the outside temperature and that of the
water arriving from the district heatingplant. This technical result was not consistent with
a project design that made much o f the need for temperature control at points o f final use.
The highcosts o fthese project investments would lead one to expect that such a feature
would have been includedwith the equipment.

4.16     The project would have had a greaterimpact uponenergy efficiency ifithad
addressedthe district heatingsystemas a whole, investinginrepairsandupgrades o fboilers,
andinsulatedpipesofthe street-sideinfiastructure, insteadofthebuildingsalone. While
some EHDP investments were made incentral boilers inthe city o fCherepovets, andinpre-
insulated service pipes inthe cities o fVladimir and Orenburg, these were not the result o f
system-wide appraisal.Moreover, they certainly hadn o t h gto do with enterprisehousing
divestiture.


5.       Conclusions and Lessons

OVERALLRESULTS

5.1     HousingProject: The project didhelpGORtake modest steps to develop and
transform Russia's housingmarkets. Datafor the RussianFederation (Table 1.1)show some
positive trends-a  growinghousing stock, greater private share andlarger averagedwelling
unitsize-but   withanincreasingshareo fdeficient housing. Theprojecthelpedtheprivate
sector demonstrate that it couldsupply housing types hitherto notavailable. The project also
encouragedthe introductiono fseveralnew laws andregulations neededfor housing reform.
Significant shortcomings included higher unit coststhanplanned, smaller scale landdevelop-
ment thanhopedfor. A shortcoming of the design was the littlebenefit the project broughtto
the poor.

5.2        Enterprise HousingDivestiture Project EHDP: The project did not accelerate
                                                           -
the sustained divestiture o f enterprise housing, most o f which hadbeentransferred to
municipalities before the project started. Enterprise housing divestiture hadbeen a
Russia-wideprogram, as OED saw invisits to other cities. It was not limitedjust to the
six EHDP cities. Duringproject implementationinthose EHDP cities, divestiture
actually decelerated. Four out o f the project's six objectives, including the primary
objective, were not achieved. There were, however, some minor developmental benefits
through increasingprivate sector participationinhousing maintenance.

RATINGS

5.3        Housing Project: Most project objectives were substantially relevant to GOR
and Bank priorities for Russia's housingreform gearedtoward the development and
transformation o fhousingmarkets. Project efficiency i sjudged to be modest inview o f
rising costs, both o finvestment andproject management.Project efficacy too i s modest
since objectives were either not fully achieved or achieved on a smaller scale than
intended. Uneven achievements o f these objectives with major shortcomings, leads to an
overall outcomerating of moderately unsatisfactory.6Sustainability i s rated as
unlikely: those aspects considered likely-facilitating           housingmarket development and
attractiveness o f private housing-are       outweighed byothers considered unlikely-
municipal land development and breakingup urban landmonopoly. Institutional
development impact i s rated as modest: while the project introducedmany new "rules o f
the game" of housing supply to Russia, their adoption fell short o f expectations. Bank
performance i s ratedunsatisfactory through disputesamong staffover project design
that underminedthe quality o f Bank service to the Borrower andthrough the very costly
andinefficient preparationeffort. Borrowerperformance is ratedsatisfactory
throughout project preparation and implementation, but only marginally so: borrower
management was very costly and ineffective incontaining rising investment costs.

5.4        Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project EHDP: For tryingto attain something
                                                          -
that had already been achieved earlier, project objectives were negligibly relevant to the
housing sector priorities o f GOR andthe Bank.Project efficacy andefficiency were
negligible too, since the objective was not-and           could not be-achieved         a second time.
For not having achieved its objectives, but leaving a few minor development benefits,
OED rates the overalloutcome as unsatisfactory.' Sustainability is rated as highly
unlikely, since the project did not generate any resilient benefit stream related to
enterprise housing divestiture. Institutional developmentimpact i s rated as negligible,
since the project didnot makethe use o f resources inthe sector more efficient inRussia.
Bunk performance i s rated as highly unsatisfactory, principally through a flawed


6. OED's outcome rating i s based upon a review o fthe project's explicit objectives only and does not
consider, therefore, the Region's downgrade based uponthe project's failure to disburse on a scale and at a
speed to help GOR's balance of payments needs, since the latter was not a declared aim o f this operation.
7. As the OED missionwas able to identify the minor development benefits o f increasing private sector
participation inhousing maintenance, OED is able to upgrade the ICR Review rating o f highly
unsatisfactory,that applies whenproject objectives are not achieved without any ancillary development
benefits at all.

                                               18


project design. Borrower performance i s rated as highly unsatisfactory too, particularly
for FER'Snot pursuing the project's privatizationpurpose and disregarding city
divestitureperformance when allocatingproject fundingto them.

LESSONS

5.5      The project experiences highlightthe following OED lessons:

    Having demonstrated that housingmarkets can work inRussia, reformers need to
    move on quickly to find sustainable solutions for the poor, who have drawn no
    benefit from project results thus far.

    For more public land to become available for private urban development inRussia's
    cities, the concerns o f municipalities (reluctant to part with their source o f power and
    influence) andprivate developers (unsureo f security o ftenure and that infrastructure
    will beprovided) needto be addressed.

    To help improve city levelperformance (of any kind), project designshould
    incorporate performance-related criteria to determine the allocation o f resources
    across cities.

   When Borrowers find themselves indisagreement with project objectives, the Bank
    should help themrecognize the need to formally restructure or cancel an operation.
