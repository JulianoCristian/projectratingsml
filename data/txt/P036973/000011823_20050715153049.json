This report i s based on the Implementation\n            Completion Reports for the projects, legal documents and\n            project files, and discussions with Bank staff involved in\n            the projects. The ratings of the PPAR generally concur with\n            the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) ratings, except\n            in the following instances : Housing Project- outcome (ICR\n            unsatisfactory, PPAR moderately unsatisfactory); and for the\n            Enterprise Housing Divestiture, sustainability (ICR\n            unlikely, PPAR highly unlikely), bank performance (ICR\n            unsatisfactory, PPAR highly unsatisfactory); borrower\n            performance (ICR unsatisfactory, PPAR highly\n            unsatisfactory). Lessons learned include the following:\n            reformers need to move on quickly to find sustainable\n            solutions for the poor, who have drawn no benefit from\n            project results thus far; project design should incorporate\n            performance-related criteria to determine the allocation o f\n            resources across cities; When Borrowers find themselves in\n            disagreement with project objectives, the Bank should help\n            them recognize the need to formally restructure or cancel an\n            operation;  and concerns of municipalities governments and\n            private developers need to be addressed, for more public\n            land to become available."}, "docdt": "2005-06-24T00:00:00Z"}
