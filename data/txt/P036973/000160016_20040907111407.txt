3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
According to SAR, the primary objective of the project was to accelerate and make the divestiture of
enterprise housing sustainable. This would help enterprises focus their limited financial and managerial
resources on restructuring core business activities to meet the challenges of an open market economy. To
ensure that divestiture is feasible for cities in the short term and sustainable over time, the project was to
support reforms that would transfer ownership, financing, and management of the housing stock into the
private sector.

The secondary objectives included a wide range of reforms in the housing sector as follows:
l Housing privatization, including condominium creation ­ so that enterprise housing divestiture does not
    lead to massive increases in the volume of public housing;
l Cost recovery of housing maintenance and utility fees from tenants ­ to make the process of divestiture
    more affordable for cities and rationalize the flow of funds in the housing sector;
l Targeted housing allowances ­ to protect vulnerable groups in the context of increased cost recovery;
l Competitive bidding for maintenance of housing ­ to rationalize and increase private sector
    participation in the provision of services in the housing sector; and
l Improved energy efficiency in divested housing ­ to reduce the costs of maintaining housing, and make
    the divestiture process affordable for both cities and households.

As described in a more concise way in the Loan Agreement, the objectives of the project were to accelerate
the sustainable divestiture of enterprise housing throughout Russia by demonstrating within the
participating cities a combination of housing reforms and investments designed to transfer housing to the
private sector and lower its operating cost.

The project was a demonstration project, and it envisioned that the benefits demonstrated in the six
participating cities would be adopted nation-wide.

3.2 Revised Objective:
Although the original project objectives were never formally revised, there was one important clarification
made by the Bank regarding one of the key secondary objectives of the project - namely, that of
privatization of apartment buildings. In its letter to the Russian Government of June 28, 2001 the Bank
expressed its understanding that the current social and economic circumstances in Russia made it virtually
impossible for the project to cause increased private ownership of apartment buildings and confirmed that it
would not use a shortfall in meeting this objective as a reason for terminating or limiting further activities
under the project. Unfortunately, this position of the Bank was never reflected in the legal documents. An
amendment to the legal documents to this effect could have led to a more streamlined project with
meaningful, albeit less ambitious, objectives.

3.3 Original Components:
The original project components described in the SAR included, for participating cities: (a) housing
divestiture from enterprises, associated general housing reforms, and housing allowances for vulnerable
households; (b) building retrofits, including metering, energy efficiency investments, and limited capital
repairs; (c) upstream investments in the divested utility networks; and (d) project management.

Original loan allocations were as follows:

         Category 1 Technical assistance: US$26.0 million,
         Category 2 Building retrofits: US$245.7 million for the procurement of goods and works,


                                                       - 2 -

         Category 3 Upstream retrofits: US$5.0 million for the procurement of goods and works,
         Category 4 Operating cost of the CPIU: US$3.0 million,
         Category 5 Refunding of Project Preparation Advance: US$3.0 million, and
         Category 6 Unallocated under the Investment Component: US$17.3 million.

(a) Housing Divestiture and Associated Reforms. This component would provide technical assistance to
strengthen the technical, institutional, and financial capacity of participating cities for the purpose of
implementing enterprise housing divestiture as well as technical assistance in the key areas of housing
sector reforms: (i) cost recovery for housing maintenance and utility services; (ii) establishment and
implementation of a system of housing allowances to protect vulnerable households; (iii) formation of
condominium associations, including the necessary legal and regulatory framework; (iv) competitive
bidding for housing maintenance. The component would also provide TA to commercial banks expressing
interest in lending to condominium associations for capital repairs and general rehabilitation not financed
under the energy efficiency component.

Within the framework of this component, the participating cities were responsible for establishing
institutional mechanisms for implementation of the housing allowances scheme and maintaining its capacity
to accommodate all eligible applicants, complying with the Government Resolution No 935 of September
22, 1993. According to the Loan Agreement, this component also included dissemination of experience
arising from the project reforms and investments both among participating cities and throughout Russia.

(b) Building retrofits, including metering, energy efficiency investments, and limited capital repair
(estimated investment costs US$383 million, including loan funds US$285 million). The component
includes two phases of loan-financed investments, plus capital repair of the divested housing stock by local
governments and tenants. The energy efficiency component Phase I would finance metering in the
participating cities, concentrating on the buildings to be retrofitted under Phase II. The energy efficiency
component Phase II would finance building retrofits investments in improving capital and energy efficiency
of retrofitted buildings. It would also provide support through technical assistance in developing and
implementing such investments.        The recommended investments (US$265 million credit line without
consulting costs) for increased efficiency include, inter alia, a list of forty different candidate measures
including, e.g.: (i) insulation in the ceiling and basement and around pipes; (ii) caulking around doors and
windows; (iii) building-level heat-point controls and heat meters; (iv) thermostatic controls and possibly gas
meters at the apartment level; and (v) lighting retrofits; and (vi) water conservation measures. It was agreed
that in order to make possible and/or enhance the gains from energy efficiency measures, the cities and
tenants would undertake capital repairs of the divested housing stock. This would include repair of roofs,
doors, walls, windows, etc. (see Annex 8).

(c) Retrofits in Upstream Energy Facilities (estimated investment costs US$49 million, including loan funds
US$5 million and local cofinancing of US$44 million). Even though Bank financing under the Project was
primarily for building-level investments, limited Bank financing was also provided for investments slightly
further up the distribution chain (e.g., substation) when they were (i) relatively simple; and (ii) believed to
have high returns or needed to ensure the building-level measures translating into real energy and financial
savings. Thus, the so-called upstream investments were included, such as upgrading or replacing district
heating and domestic hot water pipe insulation, equipment for automatic control and regulation for boiler
houses and central heat substations, renovation of district heating pumps and motors with variable-speed
drives, and water treatment measures for better pipe corrosion protection. The costs for these repairs and
investments would be covered by the city budgets, with some cities getting additional in-kind or cash
contributions from enterprises and households and/or possibly future donor assistance.

(d) Project Management. (Technical Assistance component, estimated costs ­ US$17.0 million, with
US$10 from the loan). The project had to be carried out through the Central Project Implementation Unit
(CPIU) in Moscow and Local Implementation Groups (LIGs) in participating cities. Responsibility for
procurement and disbursement had to be initially concentrated in the CPIU but it was expected that over
time it might be devolved to the LIGs. CPIU funding was to come from the loan while participating cities
were responsible to organize, maintain, and finance the respective LIGs.

The table below shows the relative size of the components and of the loan allocations. The physical
investments components (mainly in building retrofits) and housing allowances make up the bulk of the
project costs and financing. No dedicated privatization component was included in the project design.

It should be noted that the costs and loan allocations for the components given in the SAR (reproduced in
the table above) did not include a separate TA component for Housing Divestiture and Associated Reforms.
Actual IBRD loan funding for this component has been made from the consulting services budgets of the
Building Retrofits component, as well as from a USAID grant.

3.4 Revised Components:
The original components have not been formally revised.

However, substantial modifications to the loan expenditure categories and allocations were made after
appraisal, and over the implementation period there were six consecutive reductions in the loan amount.
The table below reflects the new categories in which the loan expenditures were monitored during project
implementation:

Besides the separation of technical assistance into an explicit category and a marked reduction in the
allocation for building retrofits, there was a notable change in the loan allocation between building retrofits
and upstream retrofits. In part, this adjustment was based on the results of a pilot project in Ryazan which,
by 1997, demonstrated rather modest benefits from building retrofits. The financial crisis of 1998
underscored both the weak cofinancing capacity of the cities and the need for focusing the investments on
the most urgent needs, and the cities Petrozavodsk, Ryazan, Vladimir, and Orenburg started to concentrate
on the urgently needed upstream retrofits. Eventually (by 1999), the scope of upstream retrofit component
was revised from "investments slightly further up the distribution chain (e.g., substation)" to include the
whole district heating network.


3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is rated unsatisfactory for the following reasons:

The objectives of the project - particularly, those related to privatization - were neither realistic nor clearly
formulated, and were in part based on outdated or inaccurate assumptions. The primary objective of the
project was to accelerate and make the divestiture of enterprise housing sustainable. The statistics for the
project cities over 1992-2003 show that divestiture from enterprises to the municipalities was largely
completed by the time the project started. Although the PIU (FER) and, eventually, the Finance Ministry
have asserted that, even before the project started, the divestiture was accelerated by the related
requirements set forth as prerequisites for cities to participate in the project, the impact of this factor is
hard to demonstrate. It is far more evident that, while the city-owned housing stock increased by 93.2%
from 1992 to 2003, the overwhelming majority of this increase had occurred before 1996 when the project
had just reached its implementation phase.

This has two important implications. First, this means that the objective of divestiture of the housing stock
from enterprises to municipalities was achieved independently of the project, and the only possible
remaining challenge was to prevent the reversal of the divestiture. Secondly, this means that the massive
increases in the volume of public (municipal) housing which the project was supposed to prevent under one
of its secondary objectives was a fait accomplis at the start of the project.

Despite the above, the push for privatization remained a legitimate project goal. However, this objective
would have been easier to address if: (a) it was formulated in accordance with the actual fact that most of
the housing was already in municipal ownership, and (b) the concept of privatization relevant to the current
situation was more clearly defined to make sure that the approach was realistic and properly prioritized.

The latter is particularly important since privatization of the municipal housing stock is a very challenging
task indeed. The following aspects of privatization could have been targeted by the project: (i) increase in
the share of privatized apartments in the municipal buildings; (ii) increase in the proportion of buildings
owned by condominium associations and the like; (iii) increase in the proportion of buildings with private
contractors for management and maintenance; (iv) transfer of buildings from municipal to real estate
company ownership; (v) all or some of the above combined. The definition could have been further clarified
by indicating the targeted building stock - e.g., each of the indicators above could be applied either to the
divested buildings only, or to all municipal buildings in the participating cities, etc. Finally, a legitimate
objective related to privatization could be the introduction of legislation and/or regulatory framework
removing uncertainties about building ownership (e.g., the ownership of the common areas and
infrastructure in buildings) and/or introduction of a utility/rental tariff policy that would create incentives
for housing privatization. The lack of clarity on the targeted aspects of privatization has made the
implementation difficult for the Borrower, making it also difficult to assign the responsibility for the
apparent lack of success with privatization.

Further, the design of the project did not fully correspond to the project objectives, as (a) project objectives
were mainly of institutional and legislative nature and were only indirectly supported by the planned
investments; (b) design of the investments did not prove to be fully adequate to the objective of lowering
operating housing costs.

Additional factors in the assessment of unsatisfactory Quality at Entry included overly optimistic estimates
of the economic and financial rates of return, as well as overly optimistic macroeconomic forecasts.

Selection of the Ministry of Economy as the main counterpart was appropriate and ensured active support
to the project preparation and project conformity with macroeconomic and post-privatization restructuring
policies. However, the developed technical assistance mechanisms were quite complicated, and mechanisms
to involve Gosstroi as a leading Government body responsible for housing policy were not elaborated at the
design stage. Implementation capacity was adequately assessed and supported at the federal level, but was
seriously overestimated at the local level.

Innovative Aspects of Project Design. At the same time that Quality at Entry is assessed as unsatisfactory,
it should be noted that the project had a number of innovative design features that may be replicable in
future operations. These are described in detail in Annex 12, and include: (i) competitive selection of
participating cities; (ii) the role of institutional targets and investments in promoting housing reform; (iii)
identification of the city administration as the loan recipient, beneficiary, and the agent responsible for
project implementation and loan repayment; (iv) conformity with the Russian government housing reform
policy.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Achievement of divestiture as primary objective in the cities - participants of the project. Divestiture
was achieved as the project intended, however, the EHDP was not the main factor. As noted earlier,



                                                        - 6 -

divestiture of housing from enterprises to the municipalities was largely completed by the time that EHDP
began, and therefore this positive outcome cannot be attributed to the project. With divestiture largely
complete in the participating cities, it is important to note that work under the project helped to strengthen
this and other reforms (as detailed below) and make it more sustainable.

Overall Assessment of Outcome

Overall project outcome is assessed as unsatisfactory.           As noted, the achievement of the primary
objective, divestiture of enterprise housing, was principally accomplished by forces acting outside of the
EHDP, and so credit for this achievement cannot be attributed to EHDP. Although the desired outcome
was achieved, this is neither a plus nor a minus for the purpose of rating project outcome. Consequently,
the ICR's assessment of outcome rests on the degree to which achievement of the sub-objectives was
successful. Based on the information presented below on achievement of the sub-objectives, they are
assessed as follows:

a)       Housing privatization:             unsatisfactory
b)       Cost recovery:                     marginally satisfactory
c)       Targeted Housing Allowances        satisfactory
d)       Competitive Bidding for Housing
         Maintenance                        mixed
e)       Improved Energy Efficiency         below expectations
f)       Demonstration Effect for Housing
         Reforms                            uncertain

Based on these judgments, overall project outcome is assessed as unsatisfactory.

The achievement of secondary objectives
(a) Housing privatization including condominium creation ­ so that enterprise housing divestiture does not
lead to massive increases in the volume of public housing. Achievement in this area was unsatisfactory. As
explained in Section 3.5, the way in which this objective was formulated has made its implementation
difficult. Neither the key conceptual elements of privatization nor the ways of achieving it were clearly
defined, and the project components supported this objective only indirectly. Because the concept of
privatization was not clearly defined, the monitoring was also poor and inconsistent (in fact, in its letter to
the Russian Government of June 28, 2001 the Bank revised the list of monitoring indicators and excluded
percentage of privatized housing stock from the list). The original indicators for achievement of this
objective were: percentage of privatized housing stock and percentage of housing stock organized as
condominium associations, to be compared with the national average. These monitoring indicators were
interpreted differently by different evaluators. For instance, when the percentage of privatized housing
stock was understood to refer to the number of privatized apartments in relation to the total number of
apartments in the buildings of the participating cities, the following statistics was produced:

The comparison of these city-by-city percentages with the Russian average (56.2% in 1995 increasing to
69.4% in 2002) may be questioned as, ideally, the average should have been restricted to urban settlements
and excluded rural areas, where private housing has been historically more prevalent. Pre-existing
privatized stock in the cities also may not have been properly considered in this comparison. Nevertheless,
it is hard to deny that, within the narrow definition of housing privatization as privatization of apartments,
the outcome of the project cannot be seen as successful. While the proportion of privatized apartments in
multi-storey buildings did increase somewhat, the increase was modest by any standard and the eventual
percentage of privatized apartments is less than half. For comparison, in the Baltic states, private
ownership of apartments increased rapidly throughout the 1990s and the overwhelming majority of
apartments is now privately owned.

Meanwhile, in the course of the project, doubts were expressed about the appropriateness of apartment
privatization as an objective of the project. Privatization of apartments was not believed to be a sufficient
(and perhaps not particularly relevant) indicator of housing privatization because, it was argued, true
privatization of the divested stock was only possible with the creation of condominium associations.
Otherwise municipalities still had to carry out financial and managerial responsibilities related to the
divested housing.

The degree to which privatization of apartments and condominium creation had to be seen as competing
(rather than complementary) objectives was not well clarified in the discussion between the Bank and the
Government about the project objectives, and no amendments were made to the legal documents to reflect
the changed understandings. As for condominium creation, the project cities achieved results that can only
be characterized as quite modest, although somewhat better than the national average. The average share of
housing stock in condominiums and cooperatives in Russian cities is estimated at 6%, while in the project
cities it is 9.7%. Providing statistics specifically for condominiums, FER has reported that as of July 1,
2003, the average share of the housing stock in condominiums was 9.2% in the project cities, while the
national average rate was substantially lower still.

The overall conclusion of this ICR on the privatization objective is that the objective was not achieved. It
also bears repeating that the design of the project had an emphasis on physical investments in the housing
infrastructure and was far from appropriate for a housing privatization project (see Section 3).

(b) Cost recovery. The overall results of this sub-objective are rated as satisfactory, although its fulfillment
took substantially longer than expected. According to SAR, its achievement should be measured as
percentage of cost recovery from households for maintenance and utility services compared to national
average. By the end of the project the average level of cost recovery in cities-participants is 83%, which is
110% of national average, though it is lower than the national standard (90%).

It should be noted that the satisfactory rating for the achievement of the cost recovery objective is based on
the overall result, but three out of eight cities - Orenburg, Saratov, and Petrozavodsk - have still not
reached an adequate cost recovery ratio.

(c) Targeted housing allowances. The results in meeting this sub-objective are largely satisfactory (with the
possible exception of the cities of Vladimir and Orenburg as explained below). Within the framework of
this component, the participating cities were responsible for establishing institutional mechanisms for
implementing a housing allowances scheme and maintaining its capacity to accommodate all eligible
applicants, pursuant to the Government Resolution No. 935 of September 22, 1993. As the cities were
moving to full cost recovery for housing and utility services, the targeted housing allowances would reduce
the burden on the poor. The maximum burden limit was established at the level of the federal standard of
22% of family income (2003) or lower (in some cities only 10%), as allowed by federal regulations. By
2003, from 4 to 18% of families in the project cities were receiving housing allowances in different project
cities. For most participating cities, this percentage is similar or somewhat lower than the Russian average
of about 13% (see Annex 9, Table 9.4 for details). In the cities of Vladimir and Orenburg, the percentage
of families receiving the allowances (7% and 4%, respectively) appears too low in relation to the other
cities and to the Russian average, which may be a sign of a deficient delivery of housing allowances in
these cities.

At the same time, the average amount of a housing allowance is substantially higher in the participating
cities than the Russian average level of RUR 150 (see Annex 9, Table 9.5). This indicates that, compared
with the national average, the allocation of the taxpayers money for housing allowances was targeted to
fewer families, but the level of assistance per family was higher. This may be an indication of better
targeting. Indeed, the screening process (including income verification) for the provision of housing
allowances was more rigorous in the participating cities than in Russia on average.

The conclusion that can be made safely is that the phase-out of universal subsidy support for housing
utilities was achieved fairly successfully, and the introduction of housing allowances targeted to the poor
was an important element in this process. The city of Cherepovets was the first to achieve full cost recovery
for housing and utility services and proved the possibility to do so without significant social upheavals. By
project completion, an adequately functioning system of housing allowances to protect the poor was
established in all or most of the participating cities. From a city budgetary perspective, as shown in
Annex 9 (Tables 9.10-9.17), the introduction and gradual increase of housing allowances was a small
burden on the cities, more than compensated by the reduction in the housing expenditures borne by the
cities when subsidized housing services were provided to all. For example, in Ryazan, by 2003, the city
budget expenditures for housing allowances reached 2.44%, while the overall budgetary expenditures
related to housing decreased by 14.4% (from 36.9% to 22.5%). The statistics from Cherepovets,
Petrozavodsk, Vladimir, Izevsk, and Orenburg show broadly similar patterns.

(d) Competitive bidding for housing maintenance. The results for this sub-objective were mixed. According

to SAR, the achievement of this sub-objective should be measured as percentage of housing stock
maintained or managed under competitively bid contract compared to national average. As national average
for this indicator had never been reported on a regular basis, the revised monitoring indicators in the World
Bank letter of June 28, 2001 dropped this comparison. The average share of competitively maintained
housing stock constantly increased during the lifetime of the project, though the results are highly disparate
in different participant cities (see table below). The project's role in the creation of new companies with
adequate capacity for participation in competitive bidding for housing maintenance and management should
be acknowledged. In this way, the project cities were among the first to start to form preconditions for
competitive management.

(e) Improved energy efficiency in divested housing. The results achieved under this sub-objective are
positive, if very modest in comparison with the high expectations set at appraisal (34%). The actual
average heat savings in participating cities, measured over the period 1998-2003, have amounted to a
modest 6.1%. The CPIU claims that the investments made under the project allow to reduce heat
consumption by an additional 10.4%, bringing the total savings to 16.5%. However, these additional
savigns have yet to be demonstrated and would require additional costs and efforts. The cities and heat
suppliers would have to work together to convince the apartment residents to implement additional
measures such as better temperature balancing and undertake additional investments in apartment-level
heating system improvements and metering. Therefore, only the measured savings demonstrated to date are
relied upon here.

It should be noted that the 34% target set in the SAR relied upon insufficiently tested assumptions (the
results of the Ryazan pilot project were not yet available) and, in hindsight, may have been too optimistic.
Apart from this, the shortfall on the energy savings achieved was due to the following factors:

(a) Many of the investments actually made under the project were focused more on overall housing
improvements (e.g., basement reconstruction works, stairway lighting replacement, entrance door
replacement, etc.) than on energy efficiency. The rationale for these investments was based on hygienic,
structural safety, security, and comfort reasons which in many cases took precedence over energy savings;
(b) Some of the investments (e.g., stairway lights, booster pumps, improved heating in underheated
buildings) would actually increase energy consumption in order to achieve better living conditions; (c)
Some cities increased the comfort-level standard for the in-door temperature from 18°C to 20°C and
higher; (d) Some of the proposed energy efficiency measures (such as installation of thermostatically
controlled radiator valves) were not accomplished due to lack of cooperation on the part of the apartment
residents; basic heat-flow balancing was achieved only to a limited extent, leaving different floors with
average in-door temperatures varying from 18°C to 24°C and higher.

According to SAR, the achievement of this sub-objective should reduce the costs of maintaining housing,
and to make the divestiture process affordable for both cities and households; reduce net costs to
households and cities even after loan repayment; increase comfort levels; create new local industries/
increase demand for local labor; decrease air pollution; free up gas and other fuels for other valuable
domestic uses or export; avoid or substantially defer investments in new heat generation capacity. Under
the project, divestiture would therefore be accompanied by housing reforms and investments to reduce the
costs of operating the housing stock. Since over two-thirds of the operating cost of the housing stock is
accounted for by utility costs, it was expected that most investments would be designed to reduce energy
consumption, especially from district heat and hot water, which together account for 80-85 percent of total
residential energy use.

Given the much more modest energy savings than projected in the SAR, not all of the aforementioned
benefits were realized. However, the project did make a significant contribution to improved comfort levels
in many homes - particularly, by reducing the incidence of severe underheating. The project retrofitted
1,192 buildings (124,155 apartments, corresponding to approximately 330,133 tenants) excluding Izhevsk,
which was not part of the SAR. For 32,000 residents of the participating cities for which data could be
obtained, their apartment temperatures during winter increased from a range of 8 to 18 C to a stable 20 C.
                                                                                   o    o               o


The most significant benefits in this regard have been achieved in Petrozavodsk and Ryazan (see table
below). In addition, hot water became available for an additional 1,800 people.

Credtit should be given to project participants for realization of technical assistance programs to improve
the quality of energy savings measurement and estimation. This program continued throughout project
preparation and implementation, and its scope significantly exceeds all similar work done elsewhere in
Russia. The Buildings Measurement sub-program has included installation of thousands of building-level
and apartment-level heat and water meters and temperature probes, data collection and treatment,
development of physical saving methodology and software development and verification. Smaller scope
Upstream Measurement sub-program executed in 1999-2003 also made a useful contribution. Further
acknowledgement of the results achieved in the development of energy auditing tools is given in Section 4.5
(Institutional development impact).

Demand for local labor also increased substantially due to the sub-projects. In addition, the benefits of
technology transfer have also become apparent as the sub-projects have trained local design institutes and
contractors to be familiar with new technology. The benefits are starting to be utilized in other projects as
Municipal Heating Projects where the Russian consulting companies and contractors have achieved
remarkable victories in international competitions.

Investments have also generated environmental benefits, resulting in annual CO2 emission reduction of
112.1 thousand tons. This is not insignificant, although much lower than the SAR estimate, which was
based on a larger volume of investments and higher energy savings.

The economic and financial payback on the energy efficiency investments made is, overall, far below
expectations (see Sections 4.3 and 4.4).

(f) Achievement of the demonstration effect of the project. Achievement of this sub-objective is uncertain.
According to the SAR, the demonstration effect of the project could be considered achieved if: (a)
divestiture in the project cities was completed by 1997; (b) the rate of other policy reforms in the project
cities outpaced the rate of reforms nationwide; and (c) housing affordability in project cities increased.

The actual timetable for divestiture proved to be longer, but the majority of the eligible housing was
transferred already at the start of the project. The remaining margin of less than 5%, which actually
remains even now, has been considered small enough for the Bank to recognize the completion of
divestiture by the year 2000. As noted earlier, divestiture which took place in other cities cannot be
attributed to EHDP since most of this activity took place prior to project inception.

However, a number of cities particpating in the project did adopt policies and set replicable examples of
housing reform.      For instance, the city of Vladimir demonstrated innovative approach in divestiture
acceleration through creation of a special management company for divested housing, all of which had to
be maintained competitively, and achieved good results.

The rate of policy reforms in project cities in most cases outpaced the rate of reforms nationwide. Different
project cities were the leaders in various reform areas. For instance, Petrozavodsk, Orenburg and
Cherepovets were among the leaders in cost recovery level. Petrozavodsk, Orenburg and Volkhov at
different stages of the project demonstrated the most innovative approaches in competitive management and
maintenance. Orenburg and Ryazan occupied leading positions in condominium creation. Volkhov
demonstrated the potential for institutional changes in housing sector in a small city.

The cost of housing, as measured by the cost of utility services per square meter of housing, has been



                                                    - 12 -

roughly on a par with the Russian average or slightly lower. The average cost per square meter of
maintaining and providing utility services for housing (in RUR/month) was between 21.7 and 28.9, while
the Russian average was 29.5. This appears consistent with the expectations of increased affordability.

To strengthen the demonstration effect of the project, several mechanisms for dissemination of project
results were used. In 1997-2003, the CPIU (FER) issued 11 newsletters on project activities and results,
including analytical studies. Special housing reform seminars with detailed analysis of institutional
development in project cities' housing sector were organized annually, and information on the project was
available on the web site of the FER.

Some additional examples of housing reforms catalyzed by the project are presented in Section 4.5 below.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The project components described in the SAR included: (a) housing divestiture from enterprises, associated
general housing reforms, and housing allowances for vulnerable households; (b) building retrofits,
including metering, energy efficiency investments, and limited capital repairs; (c) upstream investments in
the divested utility networks; and (d) project management.

The expected outputs from the project, however, were not explicitly linked to these components. Outputs as
such were identified only for the energy efficiency investments and for technical assistance. For the
evaluation of the project results, the loose linkage of components to outputs as defined in the SAR, can be
made as follows:

                   Project Components                                         Project Outputs

  (d) project management.                                   LIGs carrying out procurement, disbursement,
                                                            reporting activities;
                                                            CPIU carrying out coordination of activities,
                                                            information dissemination.


For component (a), the relevant outputs are various forms of technical assistance undertaken under the
project. In 1996-1998, technical assistance was financed by the USAID and carried out by the Urban
Institute. However, by the end of 1998 the USAID stopped financing this component, having spent
US$562.8 thousand instead of US$2 million. In this situation competitive bidding for consulting services
on institutional reforms was organized in 1999 and the contract was signed with the winner ­ consortium of
the Urban Institute (USA) and the Institute for Urban Economy (Russia) in September 2000. However, the
contract was suspended in January 2002 and subsequently terminated. The reason was the decision of one
of the cities-participants (Vladimir) not to continue its participation in the contract primarily because of
financial problems. Long gaps in provision of technical assistance in 1999-2000 and in 2002-2003
negatively affected the progress of cities-participants in housing reform and the ability of FER to monitor
this component, though did not undermine the ability of the cities to achieve development objectives of the
project.



                                                      - 13 -

Several other outputs of technical assistance were produced within the component, including
creditworthiness analysis of the cities-participants (1998, 2001, and 2002); assistance in design of the
mechanism to accumulate financial gains of the project in the local budget (1998-99), etc. Active
dissemination activity had been carried out.

The outputs achieved under components (b) and (c) are described in detail in Annexes 8 and 13. The total
number of buildings retrofitted by the end of the project is 1,487 (including Izhevsk) - about 42.5% of the
number (3,500) targeted in the SAR - while the final amount of the loan is 39.5% of the initial size. The
comparison of the planned and actual numbers should be viewed in the context of the overall reduction of
the loan as was shown in Sections 3.4 and 10.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic analysis for the investment component of the project (Energy Efficiency Investments) was
conducted at appraisal and is reflected in the SAR. The Loan and Project summary concluded that the
retrofit packages ultimately implemented could provide an average economic rate of return of 40 percent
with respect to the direct savings from energy efficiency retrofits alone, which account for about 70%
percent of project costs. These retrofits would be leveraging substantial policy and institutional reforms
that have extremely high - though not precisely quantifiable - returns.

The detailed analysis conducted at appraisal examined returns to the Russian Federation as a whole. In this
analysis, financial prices were net of taxes and duties on project-financed investments (approximately 15%)
and opportunity costs were used for energy, primarily natural gas for generation and district heating. The
analysis purported to demonstrate that the proposed retrofit packages could provide an average economic
rate of return of 40 percent, with the returns on individual packages varying between 32 and 45 percent.

Average economic rates of return for the implemented sub-projects expected at the time of sub-projects
preparation and re-estimated at completion are provided in the table below.

The rates of return developed above are based on the results of the Building Retrofits component only and
account mostly for the benefits related to energy efficiency, as did the rates of return derived at appraisal.
However, it is important to note that the investment scope changed significantly during project
implementation. As a result, many of the investments made under the project were focused more on overall
housing improvements (e.g., basement reconstruction works, stairway lighting replacement, entrance doors
reinforced for security reasons, etc.), than on energy efficiency. Therefore the rates of return would have
been more accurately estimated if they included other benefits such as increased value of the housing stock
(measured by increased rent or selling price of the apartments). However, no such calculations were done
by project completion, and the relatively conservative estimates above have to be used.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial analysis for the investment component of the project (Energy Efficiency Investments) was
conducted at appraisal and reflected in the SAR. The analysis examines the combined financial returns to
city budgets and households. The retrofit packages to be financed under EHDP were expected to have an
average payback of less than five years in financial terms at the city level. The investment packages would
vary across building types and climatic zones, and would be adjusted over the course of the project as
energy and other prices change. Technical considerations, especially related to the size and characteristics
of the building, meaning that the payback period for different buildings would vary from 2 to 3 years,
implying a corresponding variation in FIRRs from 40 to 55 percent. Based on the analysis made at
appraisal in the Project Agreement, an overall FIRR of 20% was established as a minimum requirement for
any proposed retrofit intervention and no less than 10% for each single retrofit measure included in such
intervention.

Average financial rate of return for the implemented sub-projects expected at the time of sub-projects
preparation and re-estimated at completion are provided in the table below. FIRRs for the specific
investments under sub-projects is provided in Annex 13.

financial returns above are based narrowly on the energy savings. The basic limitations of this approach
are similar to those described in the last para of Section 4.3.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The project had a modest institutional development impact. The project was expected to support the
following institutional improvements: (1) acceleration of sustainable enterprise housing divestiture
throughout Russia; (2) implementation of a wide range of policy reforms in the housing sector, including:
(a) increasing cost recovery for housing maintenance and utility services; (b) establishment and
implementation of a system of providing housing allowances to protect vulnerable households; (c)
formation of condominium associations, including the legal and regulatory framework necessary therefor;
(d) competitive bidding for housing maintenance; (e) building capacity of local authorities in the
participating regions to develop and implement sound energy efficiency programs; and (f) strengthening the
ability of the federal government to design, appraise, and supervise investment programs in the heating
sub-sector; (3) creation of institutional framework for effective energy efficiency investments.

The institutional reforms effecting the divestiture of housing from privatized enterprises to the
municipalities were partly implemented prior to the project, but the cost recovery policies, in combination
with the increasing introduction of targeted housing allowances, did make them more sustainable. The
project contributed to the following specific improvements in the housing reform concept:

l movement from the "Single Customer Service" approach in housing management to the concept of
    housing management as a business sector;
l consideration of demonopolization in housing management as relatively more important reform than
    demonopolization of housing maintenance;
l development of new, investor-friendly approaches in tariff regulation system (see the example of
    Cherepovets in Annex 10).

The results in the area of energy efficiency fell short of the expectations partly due to the lack of effective
organization of homeowners, but also due to lack of effective integration between the housing and district
heating sector policies. E.g., the residents of the multi-apartment buildings are still paying for heat based on
city-wide norms of consumption per square meter of floor area, so the installation of about 1,600
building-level heating and DHW meters will have a limited value unless consumption-based billing is
introduced. Cost recovery principles pursued under the project were not always reflected in the Government
policies (listed in Annex 11). Nevertheless, the institutional impact on the technical side should be
acknowledged. During the project, special "Building AuditHelp" software was developed which can be
widely used throughout Russia to assess the energy efficiency of the different types of retrofits. This model
is uniquely adopted for the Soviet-type multi-storey buildings and is applicable for about 50 different types
of retrofits. Specifically, this model can be used for:

l technical audit of building structures and engineering equipment;
l calculation of building heat balance and room temperature in pre-retrofit conditions;
l modeling of building post-retrofit conditions after implementation of different combinations of energy
    efficiency technologies and capital repair activities.

For the purposes of the project, special guidelines for metering of heat and hot water consumption were
agreed with the governmental body responsible for this task as early as in 1996, which contributed to the
basis for creation of general regulations of this type in Russia.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The Asian financial crisis of 1997 was a probable contributing factor in the 1998 Russian financial crisis.
However, the principal reasons for the crisis of 1998 were the Russian Government's own fiscal policy
failures.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Macroeconomic conditions. Analysis of city creditworthiness of participating cities was done under
assumptions derived from the Bank's medium-term macroeconomic forecast for Russia (World Bank
Report No. 14472-RU), which assumes successful macroeconomic stabilization. The model proved to be
overly optimistic, as the financial crisis of August 1998 substantially changed the macroeconomic
environment. As a result of radical devaluation, the assumptions made in 1995 lost credibility and the new
economic environment negatively affected the implementation of the investment components in the
following ways:

    l Ruble prices of foreign equipment and technologies rose dramatically, which led to the sharp
         increase of taxes and duties to be paid from the local budgets and increasing price gap between
         foreign and domestic commodities.

    l The benefits from the energy efficiency retrofits substantially decreased because of the relative fall
         of energy prices in Russia in relation to the pre-crisis and the world levels. In the participating
         cities, the average heat tariffs in dollar terms fell 3.9 times in year 2000 in comparison with 1997.

    l The borrowing capacity and creditworthiness of the participating cities decreased sharply.


Please see Section 7.5 for details.

At the local level, the selection of buildings for renovation was subject to arbitrary changes due to the local
political cycle. Lack of feasibility studies that the local government could commit to at the outset of the
project (see below) was a significant complicating factor.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Under the Project Agreement, the PIU (FER) was in charge of the following activities: (a) Adopt an
operations manual, acceptable to the Bank, setting forth its own detailed operations and procedures; (b)
Engage consultants for engineering, procurement, and technical services for the benefit of the participating
cities; (c) On behalf of the participating cities, invite bids in respect of goods, services, and works to be
provided for the participating cities; (d) In selecting housing facilities to be renovated, the PIU was
expected to: (i) assure that no investments should be carried out in respect of housing facilities owned by
enterprises; and (ii) apply appropriate eligibility and priority criteria; (e) In selecting investments in respect
of building retrofits, the PIU was expected to review investments proposed by the participating cities in
order to ensure an overall internal financial rate of return of no less than 20%, and an internal financial rate
of return for each single retrofit measure generally not less than 10%; and (f) Maintain policies and
procedures adequate to monitor and evaluate results on an ongoing basis.

In hindsight, the lack of a specific requirement for the PIU to ensure the availability of feasibility studies
and enforceable business plans was a substantial impediment for successful project implementation. At the
start of the project, feasibility studies were not in place. The buildings for renovation were selected only
after project effectiveness, and it was difficult to check whether the selection was appropriate. The
responsibility that feasibility studies are in place and up-to-date typically belongs to the implementing
agency. In this case, however, the omission was the Bank's (see Section 7.1) as much as the PIUs, as the



                                                       - 17 -

Bank should have ensured carrying out adequate feasibility assessments as part of the procedures included
in the operations manual.

5.4 Costs and financing:
In the SAR, the total costs of the project activities (as restructured in 1996 before loan signing) - were
estimated at the equivalent of US$ 551 million, of which US$ 300 million were to be financed by the
IBRD loan. Counterpart cofinancing to cover costs of engineering, procurement, installation of equipment
under investment sub-projects, operating cost of PIU and LIGs, housing allowances and incremental
recurrent costs was estimated at US$ 251 million.            Revisions made to the project scope during
implementation are summarized in Section 10.

The eventual disbursements amounted to about US$ 104.7 million. The incomplete use of funds mostly
resulted from: (i) the reduced scope of the investment components due to the decreased cities' borrowing
capacity after the 1998 financial crisis, which led to numerous cancellations; and (ii) slow implementation
and procurement progress. Also, suspensions in view of arrears toward Ministry of Finance (Petrozavodsk,
Orenburg, Vladimir and Volkhov) delayed or even stopped project implementation (Petrozavodsk and
Orenburg). In addition, the decision of Saratov not to implement the sub-project resulted in a US$ 34
million reduction of the project size.

Nevertheless, the significance of the Russian cofinancing must be emphasized - especially, given the
difficulties of the 1998 financial crisis. Total cofinancing of the project by participating cities and the
Ministry of Finance totaled about US$ 58.8 million or 56.2% of the total disbursed loan funds, including
US$ 343,340 contributed by the Ministry of Finance and about US$ 58.5 million contributed by the
participating cities. With this local contribution to the project implementation, the Russian side has
completed all obligations taken at the beginning of the project.

Estimated project costs and actual disbursements are presented in Annex 2.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
In and of itself, the divestiture of enterprise housing ­ both in the cities-participants and in the country
overall ­ is likely to be sustainable. Key considerations affecting this assessment are the following. Since
the beginning of the project, despite serious political and financial distresses, no instances of returning
divested housing back to enterprises have been registered. Although very few cases of privatization of the
divested apartment buildings have occurred to date (mainly, through the formation of condominium
associations), it has to be recognized that the cities have successfully adapted managerially and financially
to the new conditions of radical increase in housing stock under their control. This adaptation took different
forms ­ in some cities, more market-oriented than in others, but was relatively successful in all
participating cities.

However, according to the SAR, the sustainability of the project's impact was supposed to be achieved
largely through its demonstration effect. The housing divestiture, combined with the housing allowances
and associated reforms, was supposed to show that the appropriate policy and institutional changes could
make the housing divestiture process more affordable and sustainable for all stakeholders. This, in turn,
would pave the way for a private housing market, although neither the mechanisms nor incentives for
privatization were spelled out in the SAR. With respect to the investment components of the project, it was
expected that, once the financial and economic gains of the investments (most of which would be in energy
efficiency) were demonstrated, there would be many public and private parties willing to undertake similar



                                                     - 18 -

investments. The SAR emphasized that, to attract the needed financing, demonstration of the energy
efficiency potential would have to be combined with many improvements in the institutional policy
framework. Finally, sustainability of the project's outcome would be supported through increasing use of
local expertise and equipment.

Thus, the key to sustainability was considered two-fold: devolution of the utility cost recovery
responsibilities to the population would make the divestiture more affordable for the municipalities, while
the energy efficiency investments and similar capital improvements would make the whole scheme more
affordable for the population. In the SAR, the project benefits for the local budgets were predicated on
100% cost recovery from population by 1999. Unfortunately, the country-wide progress of cost recovery
was dramatically slowed down by the financial crisis of 1998, and, regrettably, the participating cities were
not able to cope with the problem much better than Russia on average. The 100% cost recovery has still
not been achieved. However, by 2003, six out of seven participating cities exceeded the Russian average
cost recovery level (see Table 4.1.2).

A significant demonstration effect from the energy efficiency investments proved unlikely as the average
measured heat savings in participating cities were 6.0% - very modest in comparison with the high
expectations set at appraisal (34%). The likelihood of many public and private parties willing to undertake
similar investments is, therefore, rather low and probably not higher than it was before the project. Part of
the problem is that some key elements of the institutional framework (such as consumption-based billing
for heat) are still lacking in the Russian Federation.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
EHDP plan for future operations after project completion was received by the Bank on April 27, 2004. The
plan includes plans for every participating city based on the contracts signed by the cities' administrations
as well as contracts signed by FER.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The objectives of the project were fully consistent with the government's priorities in the housing sector;
during preparation, the project team envisioned large-scale tasks aimed at the implementation of
government's policies both through investments and through a wide range of institutional reforms. Project
preparation process was based on extensive research including:

l survey of 24 enterprises in 10 cities that identified the problems associated with the divestiture process
    at enterprise and municipal levels;
l household survey of 808 households in two project cities ­ Vladimir and Volkhov ­ in 1995 that
    evaluated utility services and estimated residents' response to different types of activities associated
    with the project;
l pilot study of energy efficiency measures in six buildings in Ryazan in 1996-97.


Several important steps during the project preparation were taken to secure the Borrower's commitment to
the project objectives. In particular, the competitive selection of project cities made it possible to achieve a
higher level of commitment from the selected cities.

However, the project team underestimated several risk factors (instability of the federal government, lack
of clarity in fiscal relations between regional and municipal governments, etc.) As a result, for example,
regional governments were not directly involved in the project preparation process. In addition, sound


                                                     - 19 -

feasibility studies for prospective investments were not undertaken in any of the participating cities, and the
implementation capacity of the project cities was considerably overestimated. In addition, forecasts of
macroeconomic performance and of the EIRR and FIRR of project investments were overly optimistic.
Project monitoring indicators were not sufficiently developed; details of the building selection process and
some financing issues were not resolved in advance of implementation.

It should be taken into account that the operation was prepared in the beginning of the Bank's lending
activities in Russia and suffered from the generic problems due to the lack of the Bank's operational
experience in Russia and uncertainty of Russian macroeconomic policy and the government's commitment
to reforms. These problems were typical for many of           the projects prepared at this early stage of
cooperation between the Bank and the Russian Federation.

Despite the above efforts by the Bank during project identification, as described in section 3.5, Quality at
Entry was unsatisfactory.

7.2 Supervision:
The Bank team made a substantial effort to manage a demanding supervision agenda within the resource
limitations imposed by country allocations for supervision, especially in the second half of the project
implementation. The project implementation progress in the areas of financial management and
procurement, as well as implementation, institutional, and technical issues were reviewed and
implementation problems were identified in a timely manner and addressed adequately and proactively.
Whenever implementation and management issues would arise, remedial actions were promptly
recommended to the Borrower; the follow-up on agreed actions was adequate.

The Bank was sufficiently proactive in analyzing changes in the cities creditworthiness after the 1998
financial crisis and, if needed, cancelling sub-loan amounts. Procurement under the project started slowly
but gained speed and efficiency after decentralization of the procurement unit to the Moscow office.
However, the Bank supervision team should have been more pro-active in reporting issues related to the
lack of progress with regard to the overall project objectives. As a result of the primary objective
(divestiture) having been met, the ratings of the project tended to present too rosy a picture and forestalled
proactivity to improve the performance of the project. Indeed, given the fact that the primary objective of
the project was already achieved, and given the lack of success in achieving the secondary objectives of the
project, both the Bank and the Borrower might have been better off by stopping the project before the
original closing date (December 31, 2002) instead of extending it. Finally, the task managers of the project
changed several times but none had specialist expertise in the housing sector.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Based on unsatisfactory Quality at Entry, overall Bank performance is rated as unsatisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
There was close cooperation between the Government and the Bank at the time of the project preparation.
Input provided by the leading government agency responsible for the project, the Ministry of Economy,
ensured that the developed program addressed urgent needs of the Russian housing sector. Representatives
from all the counterpart agencies and from the project cities were involved in the preparation of the project
providing adequate technical, institutional, administrative, and financial support.

A meeting of participating cities was organized to discuss the actions needed for a rapid project start-up;
the loan agreement, proposed on-lending arrangements, local contributions, and project cash flows were



                                                    - 20 -

reviewed in considerable detail by municipalities' financial specialists; cities' representatives participated in
the loan negotiations.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Borrower performance was unsatisfactory. In the initial stages of project implementation, the Government
actively supported the project. Until summer of 1997, the PIU was headed by a high-level official from the
Ministry of Economy whose position ensured direct control and supervision over the project
implementation by the leading government body responsible for the project.

However, after the financial crisis of 1998, the Ministry of Economy's involvement in the project
implementation became limited. This happened at a critical stage of project implementation, when the need
for active measures to overcome post-crisis project difficulties was especially acute. An Inter-ministerial
Committee for project supervision was established, with the leading role, essentially, transferred to
Gosstroi. The Committee did provide the needed framework for coordination of efforts by different
government bodies involved, but this could not fully substitute for direct control over project
implementation that existed before. Project restructuring was delayed and happened as a reaction to local
financial restrictions rather than to a shift in the government's developmental priorities. Monitoring of the
cities' compliance with policy requirements, monitoring indicators, and efficiency benchmarks was
loosened.

Other aspects of Borrower Performance included:

Macroeconomic conditions. The macroeconomic situation described in Section 5.2 was aggravated by the
deliberate policy of the Russian authorities to restrain increase of energy prices. As a result in 1999-2000
inflation was not fully compensated in tariffs. In the cities - participants of the project - the average heat
tariff increase in ruble terms in the year 2000 was only 25%, while general level of prices went up almost
three times. In Vladimir, Volkhov and Petrozavodsk tariffs in 2000 were almost the same as in 1997 (in
Vladimir they even fall in ruble terms in 1998 and 1999), and only in Ryazan they increase more than two
times during this period.

Changes and slowdowns in reform implementation at the federal level. The SAR was based on the
Government of Russia housing reform policy, as it was formulated in time of project preparation. However,
the government policy was not consistent. At certain stages of the reform there were also discrepancies
between the positions of the State Duma and the Government on housing reform issues. Annex 11 shows
changes in cost recovery policy during the life of the project. All these fluctuations disoriented the
cities-participants of the project and sometimes led to the contradictions between the project targets and
governmental instructions.

Political cycle at the regional and local levels. Project implementation was badly affected by political cycle
in several ways. First, almost any elections led to the slow down of institutional progress, which included
many unpopular measures, and return to the populist policies. Second, if regional and local leaders were
changed as a result of the elections, the new ones considered the project not as part of the strategic
development of the city, but as part of the previous team's policy, which caused serious problems and
delays and in several cases led to the excessive decrease in the loan amounts. Third, as there was no
continuity on the bureaucratic level, elections inevitably led to considerable slowdown in project
implementation in general, as the decision-making process usually stopped several months before the
elections and did not start again until several months after the elections.

7.6 Implementing Agency:



                                                      - 21 -

FERFID (Foundation for Enterprise Restructuring and Financial Institutions Development, also referred to
as FER), which was established by MEDT as an implementing agency (CPIU) for the Project
implementation, operated effectively. Internal arrangements for project management, audit, monitoring and
evaluation were adequate. The quality and number of FER staff and consultants were adequate in the areas
of project management, financial management, procurement, implementation, technical issues, and until the
end of 2001 in the area of housing policy issues. FER demonstrated strong commitment to the project,
maintained the required project management controls, retained qualified staff, and ensured continuity of
implementation and supervision services.

FER was active in the development of "Audit Handbook" and "Building Audit Help" software for energy
efficiency investments. These tools are now widely used throughout Russia to assess the energy efficiency
of different types of retrofits supporting energy efficiency investments. The quality of FER's reporting
system was adequate and all required reports were delivered to the Bank in a timely manner.

However, throughout the project, FER's assessment of procurement, implementation and disbursement
situations were overoptimistic, which resulted, e.g., in overspending on consultants. From the beginning of
2002, the FER was not staffed with housing policy specialists and FER's policy reform activities were
primarily limited to collection of data. Perhaps the weakest part of FER's performance was the incapability
to ensure completion of a number of contracts, which has led to disputes and unfinished investments.
Petrozavodsk was in the most complicated situation, as it had a number of uncompleted and partially
unpaid contracts, but no identified funds to finance them. Ryazan, Orenburg, and Vladimir have continued
to have problems solving long-standing contractual disputes until the end of the project.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, based on unsatisfactory Government performance, Borrower performance is rated unsatisfactory.
The Borrower failed to establish and maintain implementation capacity at the local level to fully achieve
project objectives and maximize benefits from the operation. Much of the original loan amount eventually
had to be cancelled. As noted earlier, the ability of the government to implement the project was also
constrained by lack of coordination between the Ministry of Economy and the other stakeholders.

8. Lessons Learned

l The objectives of a multi-year project such as EHDP should be expected to evolve due to various
    internal and external factors. Appropriate adjustments to the original objectives and design features, if
    they cannot be made prior to project effectiveness, should be an integral part of supervision. In this
    case, original objectives should have been formally revised early on as (a) the primary objective of
    divestiture was largely achieved by project effectiveness and (b) the privatization sub-objective had to
    be re-considered with respect to the means and forms of its implementation - e.g., households united
    into condominium associations or cooperatives are still only a small minority of divested housing, and
    their increasing numbers may or may not be the critical factor in the sustainable operation of the
    divested housing stock (this thesis is confirmed by experience from other market economies). The very
    rationale for privatization of the divested housing might also have to be formally revised.

l The project objectives need to be adequately supported by the project components. Mismatch between
    the objectives of divestiture and privatization on the one hand, and the heavy emphasis on the physical
    investment in energy infrastructure retrofits on the other, left the project ill-equipped to meet its stated
    objectives. While high energy losses in the buildings are an obvious deterrent to potential buyers of
    housing, it takes much more than reducing energy losses to enable housing privatization. The
    components of a housing privatization project would have to be designed accordingly.



                                                     - 22 -

l The effectiveness of energy efficiency investments in the buildings can be substantially improved by
  proper coordination between the housing and heating sector policies and activities. In the absence of
  consumption-based billing for heat, it is difficult to expect appropriate demand response from the
  consumers of heat. Thus, it is critical for the authorities to develop and enforce appropriate
  methodologies for billing based on actual consumption in the apartments and matching it to the metered
  consumption of the building. The second-best solution is to meter heat consumption at the building
  level and divide the heating costs in proportion to the floor area of individual apartments. Continued
  payment according to norms of heat consumption is the least desirable option.

l The appropriate choice of indicators for monitoring is essential for proper evaluation of project results
  and for timely corrective measures. The assessment of effectiveness (rates of return ) of some EHDP
  investments would be much more complete if it included appropriate accounting for such benefits as
  increased value of apartments (measured as an increase in its rent or selling price). The inclusion of
  indicators such as the number of tenants whose comfort level has improved was an important element
  of the evaluation, but it is difficult to integrate this information into the calculation of the monetary
  benefits from the project. Thus, this potentially very powerful indicator of EDHP benefits fell short of
  allowing to change the overall view of the rates of return as inadequate.

l Strong local leadership and expertise are essential for city-based development programs to succeed.
  Establishment of local implementation capacity and arrangements for the sufficient and timely local
  co-financing of project activities should be assigned the highest priority at the preparation stage,
  because these factors have an important effect on procurement and administrative efficiency during
  implementation.

l The Bank and the Borrower should consider it a priority during implementation to establish and
  maintain arrangements to ensure the required interagency coordination and single-point responsibility
  for project deliverables. Coordination of the project activities and objectives with long-term federal
  programs should be an important consideration throughout the project.

l Selection of participating cities through competitive procedures is an effective way to increase the
  commitment of the participating cities to the project. However, for the project participant selection
  process to be more open, competitive, and more effective in reaching better consensus, it can be
  implemented in two-steps: federal authorities select regions, and then regional authorities select
  municipalities.

l Strong fiscal relations between the regional governments and municipalities responsible for loan
  repayment are key to successful project implementation.

l When appraising and implementing city-based/regional sub-projects, special attention should be paid to
  reviewing sub-borrower creditworthiness (on an annual basis) as well as the technical preparedness to
  implement the project. Lack of feasibility studies and enforceable business plans at the outset of the
  project was a substantial impediment for EHDP's successful implementation.

l The PIU for the investment components of the project ­ Foundation for Enterprise Restructuring ­ was
  operationally autonomous from MEDT. Implementation would have been more efficient if the PIU
  operated more closely with MEDT. This would have strengthened PIU capacity to work with the
  regional authorities and executing agencies, and would have helped MEDT to address critical
  implementation matters in a timely and proactive manner.

9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Comments on this ICR were received from all three main official counterparts: MEDT, MoF, and the
Department for Construction and Housing and Communal Services (DCHCS) of the MIE. The complete
text of the comments is included in Annex 14. In addition, the PIU produced a 66-page "Borrower's ICR"
(please see Annex 7 for the complete title of the report) which is available in the project file.

l The comments from MEDT are largely consistent with the Bank's assessment of the project results.
    However, MEDT (as well as MoF) expressed their disagreement with the Bank's assessment of the
    performance of the Inter-ministerial Committee and emphasized its essential role - not only as an
    inter-agency coordination vehicle, but also as a body involved directly in project implementation.

l The comments made in the letter from the DCHCS of the MIE focus mainly on factual information
    such as applicable regulatory framework and missing statistical data. In addition, a question was raised
    about the main reasons for cancellation of loan amounts.

l Finally, extensive comments have been received in the letter from the MoF. The Ministry's overall
    opinion is that the Bank's ratings for the project are inappropriately low, and both the overall objective
    of enterprise housing divestiture and the sub-objectives should have received satisfactory ratings. The
    key substantive comments supporting this conclusion are as follows: (a) divestiture was facilitated by
    the project through the related requirements of the competitive selection of the cities; therefore,
    divestiture that occurred in the selected cities prior to project effectiveness may be regarded as having
    resulted from the project; (b) the objectives specified in the Loan Agreement did not include
    privatization of apartment buildings, therefore this indicator cannot be used for project rating purposes;
    (c) the Bank's information about the degree of apartment privatization in Russia and in the project
    cities is unofficial and cannot be relied upon for rating project performance; (d) the efforts to create
    condominiums in the participating cities have been successful; (e) the energy savings of 16.5% have
    been achieved, which is a fairly successful outcome, while the SAR expectation of 34% had no sound
    basis; an accurate calculation of energy savings should take into account that the retrofit packages
    were implemented only partially.

The Bank's response providing clarifications, acknowledging factual corrections, and maintaining some key
points of disagreement is given in Annex 14 next to each of the respective letters.

(b) Cofinanciers:
The Participating Cities and the Ministry of Finance provided the due cofinancing.

(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
N/a.

Data used for Economic Benefits and Costs calculations

Savings in fuel consumption, electricity, treated water, untreated water, personnel and repair/maintenance
costs were computed based on the difference in costs before and after investments, and valued at the
economic price of the relevant items.

The lifetime of the individual investment items is estimated as follows: (i) boilers - 15 years; (ii) pipes - 30
years; (iii) individual heat substations (IHS) and centralized heat sub-stations (CHS) - 15 years; and (iv)
civil works - 30 years.

Main Assumptions

Price of gas. Domestic gas in Russia has been valued, in economic terms, at long-run marginal cost
(LRMC). On average for Russia, this is estimated to be about $35 to $40 per thousand cubic meters
(TCM) before application of taxes. This consists of upstream development costs of $7-9/TCM, plus the
transmission and distribution costs. The cost of transmission from the major gas fields to European Russia
(a distance of over 2,000 km) is estimated at about US$1.00/TCM per 100 km. The distribution costs add
another $5-10/TCM. Due mainly to the varying distance from the gas fields to the project cities, the
economic value of gas shown below in the table of Economic Values varies from US$35/TCM to
US$45/TCM.

Price of Heavy Oil (Mazut). The basis for the economic value of mazut was the Northwest European price
for 3.5% sulfur residual fuel netted back to Russia with the deduction of overland freight costs (about
$50/ton). This results in an economic value of mazut of about US$90 - $100 per ton. It should be noted
that the benchmarks used to derive this estimate reflect the current environment of very high crude oil
prices. The appropriate economic values that reflect a "normal" market environment are estimated to be
US$70 - 80 per ton. However, given that mazut was used only in very rare instances (such as the poultry
farm in Petrozavodsk), the economic values of mazut do not have a significant impact on the EIRRs.

Price of Electricity. The economic price of electricity in Russia is depressed by the effect of current
over-capacity in the system. Hence, in calculating the economic price based on long-run marginal cost, the
discounted value approaches the short-run marginal cost of supply. The low cost of the primary thermal
fuel (gas), together with the prevalence of co-generation (CHP plants account for approximately 40 percent
of total capacity) further limit the economic value. Although no comprehensive analyses of long-run
marginal cost of supply was carried out in Russia, the economic value of generation was taken as US$20
per MWh. Since there is less reserve capacity in the transmission network, the economic value is assumed
to be US$10 per MWh. Distribution costs are assumed to be about US$10-15 per MWh. Thus, the overall
economic value of electricity at the retail level is estimated at US$40.6 per MWh in Orenburg and US$44.1
per MWh in Petrozavodsk.

Price of Water. The economic price of water is estimated to be comparable to financial prices in market
economies. The economic value of untreated water is estimated at US$0.40 per m3 and, of treated water -
at US$1.20 per m3 .

Financial Rates of Return

From the perspective of financial feasibility, all subprojects and their components yielded a varying
financial rate of return. Some of project components yielded a high financial rate of return, despite the
relatively low prices paid for energy supply.

Additional Annex 10. The Cherepovets Example

The project was most successfully implemented in the city of Cherepovets. This city is characterized by:
·        reasonable continuity in local governance;
·        limited influence of 1998 crisis on the local budget and general economic situation in the city (in
         dollar terms budget 2000 is almost equal to budget 1994);
·        stable inter-budgetary relations for several years;
·        relatively high (according to the Russian standards) per capita income and per capita budget;
·        highly skilled and stable local implementation group.

In the beginning of the project Cherepovets was the least reformed city among the project participants, so
the initial conditions for project implementation were not very promising. It was not included into the
project as a result of competition and entered the project only when one of the initial participants left. It had
good divestiture results, but very low level of cost recovery, almost no condominiums, no competition in
housing maintenance.

At the end of the project Cherepovets was one of the acknowledged leaders in housing reform, Cherepovets'
experience is actively publicized and disseminated throughout Russia and truly influences the general
progress of institutional reforms in housing sector. It was the first city to achieve the full cost recovery for
housing and utility services and proved the possibility to do it with no significant social conflicts and
disturbances. At the same time housing allowance scheme was modified to better support the poor. The city
has a unique system of tariff regulation, which clearly defines all the procedures and sets the framework for
cooperation between the local government and local utilities. Even though Cherepovets is not among the
leaders in competitive maintenance, conditions for private firms, which entered the market, were more
stable than in the other cities (5-year contracts with competition winners were signed). The city has plans
for wide privatization of municipal enterprises engaged in housing maintenance and management.
Condominiums are being actively created and unite their efforts with private firms in developing private
housing management market. All the preconditions for competitive management in the city were formed.

All these reforms were elaborated and implemented in dialog with project implementation team and with
active support of institutional consultants employed by the project. The special role of the project in these
achievements is confirmed by the fact that the city is quite rich by Russian standards and could have
afforded to continue subsidization of housing sector and delay of institutional reforms. Reforms were not an
unavoidable necessity, but the conscious choice of city's leadership.

At the same time the city could successfully implement the investment program without decrease in
sub-loan amount and changes in design of investments. The amount of work done within the project
significantly increased the initial projections and financial returns from investments are fully satisfactory.
Cherepovets managed to create a standardized package of investments at the building level and provided
skilled management of contracts, as a result unit costs were decreasing and the efficiency of investments
grew.

In Cherepovets the system of social security for low-income citizens is in effect since 1995. The service of
subsidies was organized with the Department of Housing and Communal Facilities of Mayor's Office.
Considering that a system of grants to enterprises was in effect in the housing and communal segment,
subsidies were applied for by no more than 5 % of the families. End recipients of subsidies through the

achieving addressees of the allocated budgetary funds. After July 1, 2001, grants from the budget to
enterprises towards provision of housing and communal services were abolished in the city. Along with an
increase in the share of payments by the general public for housing and communal services, measures were
taken to enhance social security of the citizens. The share of internal expenditures by citizens in the
aggregate income of a family within the limits of the social norm on residential area and the norms for
consumption of housing and communal services has been reduced from 15% to 10% (or 46 % of the
Federal Standard of 22 %).

As of August 1, 2003, 18 523 families were receiving subsidies towards payment of housing and
communal services (about 18 % of the total number of families). An average subsidy as on 1.08.2003
amounted to RUR355 and varies between 12 kopecks and 2073 rubles per month.

Additional Annex 12. Innovative Features and Risks Inherent in the Project Design

Project design in general contained several interesting and innovative ideas, which have been successfully
used in the other projects more recently. At the same time there were significant shortcomings and problems
which negatively affected project implementation (these are discussed in Quality at Entry). The following
features of project design were the most innovative and the most controversial at the same time:
·        Competitive selection of participating cities. From the initial list of 12, 6 cities were finally
selected as project participants as a result of competition. In the process of competition cities had to meet
the list of institutional targets measured their progress in achieving development objectives of the project. It
allowed ensuring substantial institutional progress already in the process of project preparation and
increasing the cities' adherence to project objectives.
·        The equally important role of institutional targets and investments in project design. Such a
complicated project structure led to numerous problems and contradictions (for example, achievement of
project development objectives was only indirectly related to project investments, institutional and technical
criteria for building selection for investments could contradict each other, etc.). However, in the course of
project implementation it proved to be increasingly visible, that efficiency and real financial returns of
investments critically depend on housing sector governance and management mechanisms, forms of
contracts with different service providers, tariff regulation approaches and other institutional arrangements.

·        Identification of the city administration as the loan recipient, beneficiary, and the agent
responsible for project implementation and loan repayment. This choice increased political risks and
decreased the ability of private structures (condominiums, owners of apartments) to gain from project
implementation. However it seems that there was no other choice.

The issue of splitting project benefits between the city and the residents was considered local policy choice
not to be solved within the project design. The experience proved that in general it was the correct decision.
Even with the much higher level of cost recovery today residents are quite reluctant to take responsibility
for management of their housing collectively or for measurement and regulation of utility services'
consumption individually.
·        Conformity with the Russian government housing reform policy. It strengthened the role of the
project as it allowed dissemination of project experience and its influence on the general housing reform
progress in Russia. It can be stated that the project absorbed the best understanding of the situation and the
most innovative solutions, which were available in time of project preparation.

Project risk analysis

Project analysis in SAR realistically identified main stakeholders with high influence on project
implementation. From 6 such stakeholders identified in SAR the role of 3 (top city administration, federal
government, oblast government) proved to be critical and the role of 2 (city maintenance and utility
enterprises) can be considered substantial. CHPs (combined heat and power plants) played no important
role in project implementation in all the cities-participants.

Identification of project risks also proved to be adequate. However, in analysis of these risks several
important factors were underestimated or not taken into account, specifically:
·        Political risks associated with the change of representative and executive powers as a result of
elections both on regional and municipal level. Newly elected leaders and bodies often based their policy on
the negation of all the decisions of the previous powers. The lack of continuity in regional and municipal
policy resulted in many delays in project implementation as well as twists and turns in housing reform
policy. Change of mayors in Ryazan and Orenburg and Petrozavodsk (2 times) had the most negative
consequences for the project. Election of new governors in Ryazan oblast, Vladimir oblast, Leningrad



                                                      - 51 -

oblast, Orenburg oblast, Karelia republic coursed serious problems in project implementation and loan
repayment.
·        Risks associated with instability in inter-budgetary relations. On project preparation stage it was
assumed that regional authorities being guarantors of sub-loans would be interested in maintaining city
government financial strength. However it proved not to be true. Substantial and frequent changes in
inter-budgetary relations negatively affected most of the cities-participants. The direct impact was on
financial conditions and cities' ability to repay the loan, which in cases of Volkhov, Orenburg and
Petrozavodsk was drastically worsened. However, the indirect effect on cities' motivation for reforms was
not less damaging. Additional financial gains which were to be acquired through increase in cost recovery
and cost savings could be almost immediately withdrawn from the city and redistributed on the regional
level. So the main city government incentive to intensify housing reform was significantly weakened.
·        Risk associated with Russian government housing reform concept. This concept was based on the
evolutionary approach to reform, which meant that local governments had to undertake significant efforts
to reduce their role and power in housing sector and to give way for market relations. This approach could
be productive if local authorities had other incentives in addition to improving living conditions of the
citizens. However, it came to the sharp contradiction with the interests of local authorities as
institutionalized and bureaucratic bodies striving for expansion of their influence and control. This
contradiction was not properly identified and taken into account both by the Government and the Bank.
·        Risk associated with instability of federal housing reform policy. While it was established that the
cities, which do not act in accordance with reform targets, could be financially punished (investments could
be decreased or suspended) no reaction for possible changes in government housing reform policy was
proposed. However, this factor seriously affected the progress of the project. For instance, the completion
of transition to full cost recovery was delayed from 1998 to 2008 by State Duma decisions, and finally this
deadline was just excluded from the legislation.
·        Risk associated with lack of implementation capacity on the local level. Implementation capacity
was assessed too optimistically both on the level of local authorities and local implementation groups
(LIGs). The lack of implementation capacity on the local level was one of the critical factors, which caused
delays and problems in project implementation. In this respect more attention in SAR had to be given to
local implementation groups staffing and funding. The idea that local governments themselves would be
interested in successful project implementation and it would secure adequate managerial capacity of LIGs,
proved not to be true in most of the cases.

Additional Annex 13. Project Energy Efficiency Results City-by-City

Summary description of the energy efficiency programs supported under the Project

a)     Petrozavodsk (loan cost - US$8.1 million; local co-financing ­ US$10.5 million; beneficiary ­
       Government of Petrozavodsk")

The city's commitment to the project implementation during the second half of the project's life has been
very weak. The implementation performance can be rated as unsatisfactory.

Sub-loan:
In 2000 the city reduced it's original sub-loan amount from $41.07 million to $23.54 million, following
SAR's guidance (the volume of the funds lent to each of the cities should not be greater than 50% of the
estimated (2002) total budget funds). In autumn of 2002, the city's financial situation deteriorated
substantially. The city's borrowing capacity achieved the maximum level set in the Russian Budget Code
which lead to the delay of the implementation plan and payments to contractors. Later on, the city was not
able to fulfill its obligation toward MinFin. As a result, the SLA was suspended and the project was
technically closed at the end of 2002. In 2003, the Republic of Karelia paid the arrears to MinFin on the
the city's behalf and requested reduction of the SLA to the amount equal to disbursements as of December
31, 2002. The city has fulfilled its obligation toward MinFin, but has had significant arrears to contractors.

Implementation:

It should be noted that all statements below are made on the assumption of the city's capability to
finance and complete all the unfinished contracts by the end of 2004. If this assumption is wrong, the
number of renovated buildings, and, consequently, the benefits and IRR's, will be significantly lower.

The SAR envisioned renovation of 23% of city-owned and enterprise-owned building volume (2112
buildings), but after the sub-loan reduction and the city's financial crisis, it was possible for the city to



                                                     - 53 -

renovate only 195 buildings (9.2%). Therefore, the ICR assesses this segment of the project as
unsatisfactory.

Activities have covered 14 contracts for capital repair and energy retrofits of apartment buildings,
building level heat, DHW and cold water meter installations, installation of one building level boiler and
one area boiler. The sub-project was only partially completed at the end of 2003. Three contracts remain
unfinished and it is expected that the city will complete these contracts by the end of 2004. The project's
investments retrofitted 165 buildings and, correspondingly, 18,099 apartments Accordingly, the living
conditions of 47,350 tenants were significantly improved.

The installed equipment includes (see Annex 8): (i) 271 heat exchangers; (ii) 194 building level heat and
DHW meters; (iii) 1361 building level cold water meters; (iv) 14 heat meters in purchase point; (v) 19 cold
water booster pumps; (vi) installation of entrance doors for 191 buildings; (vii) replacement of stairway
lighting in 172 buildings; (viii) one building level boiler; and (ix) one area boiler house; also insulations
were made to (i) 24 external wall archways; (ii) 100 roofs; (iii) 39 attics; 184 heat point rooms were
reconstructed.

The city followed original project concept in the frame of its financial capacity. The oblast, city and the
LIG have been strongly committed to the project's objectives. The performance of sub-borrower can be
rated as satisfactory.

Sub-loan:
The city reduced it's original sub-loan amount from $12.87 million to $4.5 million in the year of 2000,
following SAR's guidance. The city has fulfilled in full its obligations toward MinFin and contractors.

Implementation:
The SAR envisioned renovation of 33% of the city-owned and enterprise-owned building volume (471
buildings), but after the sub-loan reduction, it was possible for the city to renovate only 43 buildings
(9.1%). However, it can be stated that the city has implemented completely the investment part of the
project in the frame of its financial capacity.

Activities have covered 12 contracts for capital repair and energy retrofits of apartment buildings, building
level heat, DHW and cold water meter installations and installation of one roof boiler .The sub-project was
completed at the end of 2003. 43 buildings and, correspondingly, 3,298 apartments were retrofitted during
the life of the project. The living conditions of 8,137 tenants were significantly improved.

The installed equipment includes (see Annex 8): (i) 64 heat exchangers; (ii) 87 building level heat and
DHW meters; (iii) 84 building level cold water meters; (iv) 4 heat meters in purchase point; (v) 23 cold
water booster pumps; insulations were performed in (i) 1 archway; (ii) 24 attics; reconstruction of 101 heat
point rooms were made; entrance doors in 52 buildings were installed; and stairway lighting in 52 buildings

* Remark: The original contactor was not able to fulfill its obligations, the contract was terminated. The city procured a new contract for completion
of installation works. The boiler house was put into operation at the end of 2003. However, due to the above-mentioned reasons the total increased cost
has weakened the outcome of the component.

Sub-loan:
Despite the financial crisis of 1998, the financial situation of the city of Cherepovets has been very strong
during the implementation of the project. The city has been able to keep its loan amount unchanged. The

Implementation:
During the preparation stage (reserve city) the city intended to renovate 678 of city-owned and
enterprise-owned buildings. The city exceeded expectations and was able to renovate all intented 678
buildings. Based on this, it can be stated that the city's implementation performance can be rated as
outstanding.

Activities have covered 13 contracts for capital repair and energy retrofits of apartment buildings, building
level heat, DHW and cold water meter installations. The sub-project was completed at the end of 2003
except two contracts, which the city will complete using its own funds during the summer of 2004. The
project has retrofitted 678 buildings, correspondingly 67,433 apartments were retrofitted and living
conditions of 173,732 tenants were significantly improved.

The main installed equipment includes (see Annex 8): (i) 1,137 heat exchangers; (ii) 735 building level heat
and DHW meters; (iii) 66 building level cold water meters; (iv) 2 cold water booster pumps; 792 heat point
rooms were reconstructed; entrance doors for 797 buildings were installed and stairway lighting in 674

In 2000 the city changed the original project concept, reducing the share of building retrofits and increasing
the share of upstream retrofits. However, the city was not able to follow the revised investment plan. The
commitment to the project from oblast, city and the LIG side varied through the implementation process.
The project objectives were not met due to the uncommitted management. The implementation
performance can be rated as unsatisfactory.

Sub-loan:
In 2000, the city reduced its original sub-loan amount from $69.76 million to $36.77 million, following
SAR's guidance. In 2001, due to the uncommitted management from oblast, city and LIG side, the city lost
its interest in EHDP and concentrated on completion of the ongoing contracts. In 2001 and in 2002, the city
reduced its sub-loan to match to reduced scope of works left under the project. Final sub-loan amount was
only 13.8% of the original loan amount. The city has fulfilled in full its obligation toward MinFin and
contractors except for the last payment for the installation of boiler contract (contractual disagreement).

Implementation:
The SAR envisioned renovation of 20% of city-owned and enterprise-owned building volume (4215
buildings), but after the sub-loan reduction, it was possible for the city to renovate only 61 buildings
(1.4%). Based on this, it can be stated that the city was not able to implement the investment part of the
project completely in the frame of its financial capacity.

Activities have covered 9 contracts for capital repair and energy retrofits of apartment buildings, building
level heat, DHW and cold water meter installations, installation of one basement boiler and seven container
type building level boilers. The sub-project was completed at the end of 2003. The project has retrofitted

commitment to the project from oblast, city and the LIG side varied through the project implementation.
Due to the uncommitted management, the project's objectives were not met. The implementation
performance can be rated as unsatisfactory.

Sub-loan:
The city of Vladimir followed in the very late stage (in 2001) SAR's guidance that the volume of the funds
lent to each of the cities should not be greater than 50% of the estimated total budget funds. The city
reduced it's original sub-loan amount from $64.33 million to $19.60 million. In 2001, due to the
uncommitted management from oblast, city and LIG side, the city lost its interest in implementation of the
EHDP and concentrated onto the completion of the ongoing project. The city reduced its sub-loan again in
2002 to match the reduced scope of work on the project. Final sub-loan amount was only 20.4% of the
original loan amount. The city has fulfilled in full all its obligation toward MinFin and contractors.

Implementation:
The SAR envisioned renovation of 23.0% of city-owned and enterprise-owned building volume (3,337
buildings), but after the sub-loan reductions and city's uncommitment to the project, it was possible for the
city to renovate only 62 buildings (1.9%). Based on this, it can be stated that the city was not able to
implement the investment part of the project completely in the frame of its financial capacity.

Activities have covered 14 contracts for capital repair and energy retrofits of apartment buildings, building
level heat, DHW and cold water meter installations and installation of one area boiler. The sub-project was
completed at the end of 2003, except for the installation of the area boiler, which can be completed in
summer of 2004 at best. The project has retrofitted 62 buildings, correspondingly 5,220 apartments were
retrofitted, and living conditions of 14,563 tenants were significantly improved.

The main installed equipment includes (see Annex 8): (i) 62 heat exchangers; (ii) 63 building level heat and
DHW meters; (iii) 63 building level cold water meters; (iv) 37 heat meters in purchase point; (v) one area
boiler house, insulation was performed on 13 roofs; 57 heat point rooms were reconstructed; entrance doors

In 2001 the city changed the original project concept, reducing the share of building retrofits and increasing
the share of upstream retrofits. However, the city was not able to follow the revised investment plan due to
the deterioration of the city's financial capacity. The commitment to the project from oblast, city and the
LIG has been adequate through the project implementation. The implementation performance can be rated
as satisfactory.

Sub-loan:
The city of Orenburg was not following SAR's guidance that the volume of the funds lent to each of the
cities should not be greater than 50% of the estimated total budget funds. In 2001-2002, the deterioration of
the city's financial capacity had a strong impact on co-financing which resulted in the delay of the city's
investment program, and finally in 2002 MinFin suspended the SLA of the city Orenburg and the project
was technically closed. The city has not fulfilled in full all its obligations toward MinFin. However, the
city has fulfilled in full all its obligations toward contractors except for one building level boiler contract.
The city has contractual disagreement with the contractor.

Implementation:
The city intends to: (i) renovate 7% of its district heating and domestic hot water network; (ii) install 295
Individual Heat Substations; (iii) support vigorously creation of condominiums and, as a part of this
program, the city will renovate 43 buildings envelopes and infra-networks on condition that the tenants will
create condominiums; (iv) automate 78 Central Heat Substations to achieve energy efficiency. Based on
this, it can be stated that the city has very clear investment program in housing and energy sectors. On
the basis of information provided by the city, it can be expected that the city's financial capacity is
adequate to provide all needed funds for completion of the project by 2005.

Activities have covered 16 contracts for goods for capital repair and energy retrofits of apartment
buildings, renovation of district heating and domestic hot water network, automation of central heat
substations and installation of individual heat substations. The sub-project will be completed at the end of
2005. The project will retrofit 43 buildings and 295 heat point rooms. Correspondingly, 22,093 apartments
within the buildings will be retrofitted, and the living conditions of 58,060 tenants will be improved.

The sub-project has invested in goods for rehabilitation of the city's district heating system, CW and DHW
network, automation of centralized heat substations and retrofitting of 43 apartment buildings. Procured
equipment includes: (i) space heating network equipments, windows, external wall and attic insulation
materials for 43 buildings; (ii) 295 individual heat substations (including above mentioned 43 buildings);
(iii) automation including heat exchangers and variable speed pump for 78 centralized heat substations; and

h)        Environmental benefits

It was envisioned in the SAR that the project would have a positive environmental effect due to the reduced
energy use in the participating cities. The SAR implied that during the winter much of the heat and hot
water produced on the margin in several project cities was generated by burning mazut (heavy fuel oil) in
extremely inefficient and polluting heat-only boilers. It was assumed that many of these boilers would be
shut down as a result the efficiencies gained under the project. The beneficial impacts of the project
included reduced atmospheric emissions of nitrogen-oxides (NOx), sulfur-dioxide (SO2), and
carbon-dioxide (CO2) from reduced consumption of natural gas and mazut in district heating plants or
combined heat-and power plants. Preliminary SAR estimate for total annual emissions reductions by the
end of the project implementation were: 7,600 tons SO2, 1,600 tons NOx, and 950,000 tons CO2.
Guidelines were developed to ensure proper handling of any hazardous substances while the buildings were
under renovation. The project was classified as category B.

Total annual emissions reductions of the EHDP compared with SAR estimate are presented in the table
below. The reasons for lower than estimated emissions reductions were: (i) the reduced project scope
(34.7% of planned project); (ii) energy savings were significantly lower than estimated. Due to that the
above reasons only one inefficient and polluting heat-only boiler (Petrozavodsk, Ptitsefabrika area) was
shut down.

TO: Ms. Kristalina Georgieva
Country Director for Russia
World Bank Resident Representative in Moscow

Dear Ms. Kristalina Georgieva,

         The MEDT of Russia has reviewed the Implementation Completion Report for the Enterprise
Housing Divestiture Project financed with the funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (Loan 4012-RU) and, following the World Bank letter, offers its comments for the
Report's Section "Partner Comments" (Section 9).

         MEDT is in agreement with the Bank's opinion and believes that the outcomes of the
Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project (the Project) proved to be below the original expectations. A
lack of clearly stated goals and objectives that would correspond to the realities of the enterprise
housing sector led to a situation where the main objective of the Project, namely, the divestiture of the
enterprise housing stock in the participating cities, had been basically achieved independently, even
before the project implementation was launched and, therefore, may not be viewed as a criterion for
positive assessment of the Project. Indicators for housing privatization, including the establishment of
home-owners' associations that were developed at the stage of Project preparation, proved to be
ineffective, failing to take account of the developments that took place by that time in housing
privatization in the country.

         The Bank has given satisfactory ratings to the achievement of such objectives as full recovery
of costs of services and targeted housing allowances. However, these assessments have a relative
nature since the difference in the outcomes among the participating cities is substantial. Besides, the
outcomes are comparable with the Russia-wide indicators.

         In terms of achieving the objective of targeted housing allowances, a positive result of Project
implementation is the fact that almost all participating cities have introduced a properly functioning
system of housing allowances to protect the poor.

         Regarding the objective of competitive bidding for the provision of housing maintenance
services, it should be noted that in view of the lack of data about the share of houses that are being
maintained or managed on the basis of competitive contracts across the country, the respective
monitoring indicator has been excluded, given its inability to provide an accurate assessment of
effectiveness of such contracts.

         A positive result of Project implementation was a higher energy efficiency in the divested
housing stock in the participating cities, even though the result fell short of the expectations set at the




                                                    - 68 -

time of Project preparation. The investments were more directly aimed at improving the general
condition of the buildings than at the achievement of the energy saving objective of the Project. But the
implementation of the Project has greatly contributed to more comfortable conditions in many homes
due to improved heat supply to the buildings.

        In conclusion, it should be noted that MEDT does not share the view of the Bank that the
Ministry was insufficiently involved in the Project implementation process. MEDT representatives
were in the Inter-Agency Commission and thus participated in Project implementation within their
areas of competence.

Sincerely,

S. V. Ganeeva
Director
The Department for Investment Policy and Public Investments

The Bank's response. It is noted that the comments from MEDT are largely consistent with the Bank's
assessment of the project results. However, MEDT expressed its disagreement with the Bank's assessment
of the performance of the Inter-ministerial Committee. The final language of the ICR (Section 7.5)
recognizes the role of the Committee in ensuring inter-agency coordination, while retaining the point about
the weakened direct control over project implementation after 1998.

Mr. Richard L. Clifford
IBRD Acting Country Director for Russia

         The Department for Construction, Housing and Communal Services of the Ministry of
Industry and Energy of the Russian Federation has reviewed the Implementation Completion Report
(TF-29324 SCL-40120 PPFB-P2740 PPFB-P2741) for Loan 4012-RU of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project) and deems it
appropriate to give the following comments on this report.

1. An outdated regulatory framework was used in the preparation of the Report (for example,
     references are made to the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation dated
     September 22, 1993, No. 935, which has not been in effect for several years already).

2. The Report does not indicate the floor area of the enterprise housing stock that has been
     reconstructed under the project.

3. The statement that the Russian reporting system does not have a separate statistic for
     home-owners associations (see the Report, page 14) is inaccurate.

4. The point that has been made across the sections of the Report time and again was that the
     program proved to be outside the basic concept of enterprise housing divestiture. It is, in effect, a
     statement that the divestiture process was unrelated to the project.

5. Many indirect reasons of the consecutive reduction of financing is given, but there is no clear
     explanation of the main reasons (lack of cofinancing, lack of guarantees of loan repayment, etc.).

Director of the Department for Construction and Housing and Communal Services (DCHCS)
The Ministry of Industry and Energy of the Russian Federation

The Bank's response. It is noted that the comments from the DCHCS focus on factual information. The
Bank's response is as follows: (a) reference to Resolution No. 935 is made as a matter of historical record
and this does not render the description of housing allowances in Section 4.1 obsolete; (b) The total floor
area reconstructed under the project is 10,745,757 m2; this statistic was not mentioned in the draft ICR due
to its limited illustrative value; (c) the statement that Russian reporting does not have a separate statistic for
home-owners' associations has been removed; (d) the point that the housing divestiture proceeded largely
independently of the project remains valid; (e) the cancellations were mainly due to revised investment
priorities of the Borrower, as well as changed macroeconomic environment.

          Ref. Implementation Completion Report of Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project

Dear Mr. Clifford,

The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation has reviewed the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR) of the Enterprise Housing Divestiture Project (EHDP) submitted by the World Bank
(Bank) on June 10, 2004, and informs you of the following.

Comments to the EHDP ICR prepared by the World Bank (hereinafter the Bank's ICR) are provided
following the structure of the Bank's ICR. A detailed review of the EHDP preparation and
implementation is found in the Borrower's ICR (see attached).

1.       Project Data

It is important to specify that the Foundation for Enterprise Restructuring and Financial Institutions
Development (FER) acted as the EHDP Implementing Agency.

2.       Principal Performance Ratings

We believe that the Bank underrated the Project performance. Project ratings based on the analysis
provided in the Borrowers' ICR are as follows.

Outcome: satisfactory

Sustainability: satisfactory

Institutional Development Impact: substantial

Bank Performance: mixed (satisfactory in procurement and financial management support;
unsatisfactory in implementation support)

Borrower Performance: mixed (satisfactory in case of the Borrower and most Sub-borrowers and their
respective Regional Administrations, except Saratov and Petrozavodsk)

3.       Assessment of Development Objectives, Design, and Quality at Entry

The Bank's assessment of development objectives was made according to the Staff Appraisal Report
that is an internal Bank's document. However, not all these objectives (e.g. privatization of apartment
buildings) were mentioned in the Loan Agreement that is a legally binding document for the Russian
Federation. This means that there was no legal basis for the Bank to use this indicator for the Project
rating assessment.

Analysis of revised Project components on pages 4 - 5 of the Bank's ICR is not accurate enough. The
reason for cities Petrozavodsk, Ryazan, Vladimir and Orenburg to change priorities in investment
from building retrofits to upstream retrofits included not only cofinancing problems, as it was
indicated in the Bank's ICR, but an urgent need to invest in the whole heating chain. Extending
upstream retrofit category was required because of modest results of the 1997 Demonstration project
in Ryazan. The Bank assessment of Quality at Entry did not capture this Demo project, while it was
during the Demo project that all basic investment implementation approaches were tested and results
should have been used in the Project implementation stage.

There is a mistake in figures in Table 2 on page 4: the text should read as follows:
Category 1. "Technical Assistance" as of December 2, 2003 - US$ 22.1 million.

We believe that the following statement in Section 3.5 "Quality of Entry" on page 5 is wrong: "While
the city-owned housing stock has increased 93.2% from 1992 to 2003, 85% of this occurred by 1995,
before start of the project".

Before 1995, the share of divested buildings was on the average only 40.3% - see the following table:

City/Date                      01.01.1995                  01.01.1996                 01.01.1997
Petrozavodsk                   14.0%                       74.0%                      87.0%
Volkhov                        94.0%                       95.0%                      100.0%
Cherepovets                    50.0%                       97.4%                      98.3%
Vladimir                       11.0%                       33.0%                      82.0%
Ryazan                         33.0%                       47.0%                      80.0%
Orenburg                       40.0%                       85.0%                      92.0%
Average                        40.3%                       71.9%                      89.9%



By 1996, during participating cities selection, proportion of divested housing increased to 71.9% on
average and reached 89.9% by 1997. This result could not have been achieved without the Project.
Divestiture statistics were regularly reported to the Bank and can be tracked in the FER annual reports
for the years 1997 and 1998. By the end of the project implementation, proportion of divested housing
made up 96.4%.

Other similar statements of the Bank should be revised (see page 6, Section 4.1 "Achievement of
divestiture as primary objective in the cities - participants of the project"; page 7, section "Overall
Assessment of Outcome"; page 11, paragraph (f) "Achievement of Demonstration Effect").

4.       Achievement of Objective and Outputs




                                                     - 72 -

The assessment of the Project outcome and achievement of secondary objectives as made by the Bank
is not accurate. The Loan Agreement set up acceleration of sustainable divestiture of enterprise
housing as the main objective of the Project. No amendment to the Loan Agreement was signed to
change this. The divestiture statistics provided by the Participating cities is rather remarkable: from
99.7% in Volkhov to 85.7% in Izhevsk. It is also worthwhile looking again at the figures provided in
Section 3 above. Despite the fact that this objective was partially achieved before disbursement
started, the Project (during both preparation and implementation stages) has, to a significant extent,
determined the completion and sustainability of the divestiture process. Bank's unwillingness to
consider evident achievement of the main Project objective affected the overall Project rating. In our
opinion achievement of the main Project objective should be rated as "satisfactory".

The achievement of Project sub-objectives must be assessed as follows:

a) Housing privatization ­ satisfactory
b) Cost recovery ­ satisfactory
c) Targeted housing allowances ­ satisfactory
d) Competitive bidding for housing maintenance ­ satisfactory
e) Improved energy efficiency ­ satisfactory
f) Demonstration effect of housing reform ­ satisfactory

Brief analysis of each sub-objective is provided below. More detailed analysis is provided in the
Borrower's ICR.

a) Housing privatization.

Speaking about housing privatization, the Bank includes in this sub-objective the creation of
condominiums to avoid a drastic growth of publicly owned housing stock.

Both the Bank and the Borrower agreed that creation of condominiums was the most appropriate
Project monitoring indicator. However, the assessment of this sub-objective as "quite modest, although
somewhat better than the Russian average" is not quite correct. On page 8 the Bank states: "The share
of housing stock in condominiums and cooperatives in Russia is 6% ...". However, as of July 1, 2003,
the average share of the housing stock in condominiums was 9.2% in the Participating Cities
(exceeding the national average by 7.5 %) and varied from 1.3% in Volkhov to 33.4% in Orenburg.
By December 31, 2003, at least 510 condominiums (home-owner partnerships -HOPs) were created in
the Participating Cities, which covered at least 2543 multi-apartment buildings, including:

- Petrozavodsk - 65 HOPs (65 buildings);
- Volkhov - 3 HOPs (3 buildings);
- Cherepovets - 41 HOPs (41 buildings);
- Vladimir - 64 HOPs (97 buildings);
- Ryazan - 164 HOPs (164 buildings);
- Orenburg - 67 HOPs (753 buildings);
- Izhevsk - 36 HOPs ­ as of August 1, 2003;
- Saratov - 70 HOPs (1384 buildings) ­ as of October 1, 2002.

According to Gosstroi estimates, in 2002, the total number of HOPs in Russia was about 5 800.
Therefore in eight Participating Cities with population slightly over 2.4% of Russia total population
(approximately 3,531,000 persons), at least 8.8% of the total number of HOPs in Russia have been



                                                    - 73 -

created.

Thus, the EHDP participating cities achieved better than average national results in the condominium
creation objective, and this fact has been acknowledged by the Bank. Hence, this sub-objective should
be rated as satisfactory rather than modest.

Regarding data provided in Table 4.1.1 (page 7), it is important to note the following. The Table does
not indicate the source of data in column "Average in Russia". Column "Average in Russian cities"
should be used to make a correct comparison because houses are private in rural areas (they used to
be such in the Soviet era as well). Starting 2001, these data covering the participating cities were
provided neither in the Borrower's not in the FER reports because this indicator was not on the list of
monitoring indicators. Values provided in the Bank's report are not official: these are estimates of the
LPIUs made in 2003 and they refer only to multi-apartment buildings (without private buildings).
Bank's serious conclusions may not be based on weak methodology and unprocessed unofficial data.
We consider it appropriate to delete Table 4.1.1, and comments to it, from the Bank's ICR.

b) Full cost recovery. In Table 4.1.2 on page 8 the Bank indicates that cost recovery "Actual in
Russia in 7/2003" was 76.0%, while cost recovery in the participating cities varies from 100 % in
Cherepovets to 70 % in Orenburg, with the average value being 83.03 %. All Participating Cities,
except Orenburg, are above national average. The EHDP average percentage of cost recovery exceeds
the average national indicator by 10.33 percentage points, and this sub-component should be rated as
satisfactory rather than marginally satisfactory as the Bank assessed.

c) Targeted housing allowances. The results in meeting this sub-objective supported by correspondent
statistics are largely satisfactory as assessed by the Bank.

d) Competitive bidding for housing maintenance. It was not correct to assess the rating of this
objective without having national statistics for comparison. This made the rating process subjective
and not supported by objective data. Despite evident success of the Project in organization of
competitive bidding for housing maintenance and the fact that EHDP participating cities were among
the first to start creating conditions for competitive management (this was stated in the Bank's ICR),
the Bank has unfairly refused to assess this sub-component as satisfactory. We strongly believe that
achievement of this objective should be rated as satisfactory.

On page 9-10 in Table 4.1.3 "Housing stock under maintenance (management) on a competitive basis
% of the total housing stock" the following data should be added: "80% for Saratov in 2002". This
figure was reported to the Bank in the EHDP Monitoring Indicators Report as of July 1, 2002,
prepared by the FER.

e) Improved Energy Efficiency

On page 10, the Bank made the following observation: "The results achieved under this sub-objective
are positive, if very modest in comparison with high expectations set at appraisal (34%)". We feel it is
important to express our disagreement with the above:

1) Bank used wrong approach and values for the estimation of energy efficiency objective.

First, the SAR does not set up the value of expected physical savings of 34% as a criterion for the
Project performance rating. This value of 34% can be calculated indirectly using data of paragraph


                                                      - 74 -

5.19 of the SAR that refers to an apartment with a space of 50 sq. meters with 3 tenants. But this
value was mentioned without indication of the building type or construction standard, climate, retrofit
package, etc. Hence, the value of 34% is abstract and cannot be used as a rating criterion.

Second, Chapter "Monitoring Indicators" of the SAR says that performance indicator and method of
assessment is "quantity of energy saved in the city compared to without project scenario, derived from
baseline data in Year 1". Table D-5 of the SAR presents estimation of utility savings in two climates
for small, medium, and large prototype buildings separately for heat (with and without controls),
electricity, cold and hot water. These calculations are based on the assumption that the whole set of 40
retrofits at 100% completion will be implemented in each prototype building. Therefore to estimate
Project performance based on SAR assumption it would be necessary to apply Table D-5 to each
retrofitted building in all Participating Cities taking into consideration actual retrofit package and
actual scope of works done in each package. The Bank's ICR does not follow this approach and this is
a methodological mistake.

Third, values of expected physical savings for selected buildings should be less than those in Table
D-5 of the SAR because only part of retrofit packages were actually implemented and not necessarily
in the whole building but in its part. Estimates of savings have to be different for different
Participating cities.

Fourth, the SAR expectations were estimated with FEDS software (USA). This software was tested
on western types of low-rises, but not on Russian multi-apartment high-rises. During the
implementation of the assignment under the TAG-1 contract it became clear that prompt
customization of FEDS for the EHDP purposes was too costly to be accomplished within the
framework of the Project. This was the main reason of the TAG-1 contract's early termination.

Given the above, it is necessary to conclude that Bank's analysis of the Project's energy efficiency
cannot be used for the purposes of assessment of this sub-objective.

2) The Bank's ICR does not give any consideration to the Project participants' efforts aimed at energy
metering and savings measurement. This program was implemented throughout the whole period of
project preparation and implementation, and the scope of this work significantly exceeded all similar
work previously done in Russia.

The "Metering in Buildings" sub-program included installation of thousands of building-level and
apartment-level heat and water meters and temperature probes, routine data collection and processing,
development and testing of physical energy savings methodology and software, etc. For each building
with a      specific climate, building type, retrofit package and its actual implementation, this
methodology allows to: (1) assess heat and water savings obtained by now in comparison with
baseline without retrofit; (2) calculate changing of temperature conditions in apartments; (3) estimate
potential savings to be made during the equipment lifetime resulting from better tuning and
adjustment. These are the three parameters to be considered as the result of each building retrofit.

Software developed under this sub-program was tested on an enormous data base collected during
several years in 92 multi-apartment buildings of six Participating Cities. Potential heat savings
estimated by the FER and Project consultants vary from 0.2% to 10.4% for the Participating Cities
depending on the comfort temperature level set for the apartments. This value reaches 20.3% for
Vladimir and Cherepovets.

All reports concerning metering program were submitted to the Bank on a timely basis.

3) It is also important to mention that the Project concept allowed the Participating Cities to form their
customized investment packages from the list of approx. 40 activities prepared by Battelle Memorial
Institute (USA) hired as TAG-1 contract consultant. This approach has never been formally revised.
All investments critically mentioned in the Bank's ICR, such as basement reconstruction works,
stairway lighting, entrance door replacement, were part of this list. These activities had different
benefits for the Participating Cities and different payback periods, but all of them were considered
appropriate during implementation of the Project.

It was assumed in the SAR that energy efficiency investments of US$ 600-1000 per apartment
complete with capital repairs to be financed by the Participating cities and households themselves
could produce utility expenditure savings of 34%. This assumption was purely theoretical and not
based on Russian experience because results of the Ryazan demonstration project were not available
yet at the time of SAR preparation.

The practical outcomes of the EHDP proved that energy efficiency investments of US$ 420-870 per
apartment already allowed decreasing heat consumption by 6.1% on average along with improving
comfort of living to the standard level or higher and, subsequently, further reduce heat consumption by
10.4% on average, i.e. by 16.5% in total.

Energy savings of upstream retrofits are on the same level or higher.

Detailed analysis of this sub-component is provided in the Borrower's ICR. On this basis, we believe
that implementation of this sub-objective should be rated as satisfactory.

f) Achievement of the demonstration effect of the project. The SAR set up certain criteria for
achievement of the demonstration effect of the Project but failed to provide tools to be used. In fact,
dissemination of experience (both positive and negative) and knowledge being the major demonstration
method was left out of consideration in this sub-objective. The Bank's ICR just briefly mentions the
EHDP newsletters and web site.

The rate of policy reforms in the Project cities outpaced the rate of reform across the country ­ this
fact was acknowledged in the Bank's ICR. Different tools were used to disseminate this experience.
Ten newsletters totaling 315 pages were issued during the Project implementation period, over 30
seminars were organized to discuss the Project topics. Given modest financial resources allocated for
dissemination of Project experience results may be evaluated as quite satisfactory. The Borrower's
ICR contains more detailed arguments to prove this.

4.2. Output by components. On page 13 in the sentence "Several other outputs of technical assistance
were produced within the component, including creditworthiness analysis of the cities-participants
(1998)" years 2001 and 2002 should also be added. In next paragraph after words "The total number
of buildings retrofitted by the end of the Project is 1 487 (including Izhevsk), i.e. about 42.5% of the
buildings (3 500) targeted in the SAR" please add, "while final loan amount was 39.5% of the initial
size".

5.       Major Factors Affecting Project Implementation and Outcomes

The authors of EHDP ICR have attributed macroeconomic conditions - in particular financial crisis of


                                                     - 76 -

1998 - to the factors generally subject to government control. However, the Community Social
Infrastructure Project ICR (loan 4009-RU) states that 1998 financial crisis was triggered by the
international financial crisis and attributed it to the factors beyond the government control. Hence we
should note the inconsistency of the Bank's position regarding the 1998 financial crisis in the
evaluation of the Borrower's performance under EHDP.

On page 16 in Section 5.3 "Factors generally subject to the implementing agency control" the Bank
criticizes building selection process: "The buildings for renovation were selected only after project
effectiveness, and it was difficult to check whether selection was appropriate". The building selection
procedure combining institutional and investment criteria prescribed in the SAR obliged the
Participating Cities to select buildings not before the Project start but during implementation. The
priorities for selection of buildings were established in the SAR giving preference to condominiums
and large multi-apartment buildings. These priorities were kept during the Project implementation, and
more detailed building selection criteria were approved by the Bank practically on an annual basis.
This fact is ignored in the Bank's ICR. The normal procedure that was used under the Project and was
never questioned before the Bank's ICR was issued was the following: Participating Cities proposed a
list of buildings to be included in the list for renovation; the implementing agency together with Bank's
engineers made detailed assessment of selected buildings in accordance with criteria approved by the
Bank and by common decision excluded those of them that did not meet the criteria. To improve
payback of retrofitting investments in each specific building, the FER advised the Sub-Borrowers on
the most optimal package of energy efficient technologies using AuditHelp software. The
Sub-Borrowers made final decision about each retrofit package taking into consideration both energy
efficiency considerations and capital repair needs, safety reasons etc., but in any case only those
activities were chosen that were either on the SAR list or later approved by the Bank. Following the
final estimation of selected investment package, cost analysis and estimation of the payback period for
each building were considered in the course of preparation of the bidding documents and estimation of
the contract cost - all these documents being available for the Bank review under bidding approval
process.

In Section 5.4 "Costs and Financing" of the Bank's ICR, no serious cost analysis is presented. Actual
local contributions to the Project financing made by Participating Cities and the RF Ministry of
Finance are completely ignored, despite the fact that the FER was providing the Bank with timely and
accurate cofinancing data during the whole life of the Project. This makes the above section of the
Bank's ICR incomplete. In fact, total cofinancing of the Project by Participating cities and the RF
Ministry of Finance amounted to about US$ 58,798,141.51 or 56.2% of the total disbursed loan
funds, including US$ 343,339.78 contributed by the RF Ministry of Finance and US$ 58,454,801.73
contributed by Participating Cities. Local contribution to the Project implementation has never been
questioned by the Participating Cities and the RF Ministry of Finance even after the financial crisis of
1998, and the Russian party has met all obligations taken at the beginning of the Project.

6.       Sustainability

Given sustainable results of the main project objective ­ enterprise housing divestiture ­ demonstrated
in course of the Project implementation, sustainability should be rated as satisfactory.

7.       Bank and Borrower performance

Bank. The Bank's performance is quite mixed: it can be assessed as satisfactory in case of
procurement and financial management support, but unsatisfactory in Project preparation and


                                                       - 77 -

implementation support.

The major staffing problem of the Bank's team was frequent rotation of Project Team Leaders. During
Project implementation period, six of them were appointed. As result much time was wasted by newly
appointed PTLs on studying the Project. It is important to note that no steps were made to adjust the
Project monitoring and sub-objectives monitoring indicators to the changing Project environment.
Rating of the Project became worse as it was coming to the end, despite evident Project achievements
such as increased disbursements and positive results of investments.

On page 18 in Section 7.1, please delete the wording "pilot study of energy efficiency measures in six
buildings in Ryazan in 1995-96" because Ryazan Demo project construction works were executed
from January 17, 1996, to October 9, 1996, and the subsequest analysis of energy and water savings
was done only after completion of the 1996-97 heating season, i.e. in summer 1997.

On page 19 in Section 7.2, please revise the sentence "given the fact that the primary objective of the
project was already achieved and given the lack of success in achieving the secondary objectives of the
project ..." because, as shown above, many secondary objectives were achieved consistently and
successfully during the Project.

Borrower. We strongly disagree with the Bank's statement that the EHDP Project Steering Committee
"although formally established, ... was not sufficiently effective in ensuring the implementation of the
project". The Committee has never been just a formal mechanism of Project management. In
particular, it made a number of crucial decisions for the Project, such as the loan and sub-loan
restructuring, undertook creditworthiness analysis, dissemination of Project experience and many other
things.

It seems illogical to rate the overall Borrower performance as unsatisfactory while two of three
indicators ­ Project preparation and implementation agency performance - are rated as satisfactory.

In spite of some problems occurring during the Project implementation and considering achievement of
the main Project objective and sub-objectives, performance of all Sub-Borrowers and their respective
regional administrations (guarantors), except local self-government of Petrozavodsk/Government of
Karelia and Administration of Saratov/ Administration of Saratov region, may be assessed as
satisfactory.

8. Lessons learned. To the list of lessons prepared by the Bank, the following can be added:

1)       Project objectives, project components and loan categories are to comply with each other;
2)       Project objectives are to be closely tied with long-term federal target programs;
3)       If project objectives include federal, regional and municipal-level objectives, it is advisable to
allocate adequate sub-loans to selected regions and municipalities;
4)       Feasibility studies developed during the project appraisal are to be updated periodically during
project implementation through updating the performance targets.

Given the above, we believe it is important to finalize the ICR incorporating the comments provided
above.

The Bank's response. It is noted that the comments received from the MoF are based largely on the
information included in the "Borrower's ICR" and the positions expressed there. The final ICR incorporates
the following points from the MoF's comments: (a) urgent need for upstream investments is recognized as
legitimate reason for deviation from original project design, and the value of the Ryazan pilot project is
acknowledged (Section 3.4); (b) cost recovery for maintenance and utility services is assessed as
satisfactory (Section 4.1); (c) full credit is given to the programs introducing energy measurements
(Sections 4.1 and 4.5); (d) the significance of cofinancing contribution is acknowledged and emphasized
(Section 5.4); (e) several of the proposed lessons learned have been incorporated (Section 8); (f) factual
information supplied for Tables 2 and 4.1.3 are accepted.

At the same time, the following key positions are left unchanged in the final ICR: (a) divestiture is still
believed to have been achieved mostly prior to and independently of the project; (b) the objectives specified
in the Loan Agreement included privatization of the divested housing stock (see Section 3.1); (c) Table
4.1.1 and comments to it provide useful insights about the degree of apartment privatization in Russia and
the project cities; (d) the degree of success in condominium creation as a means of moving the divested
stock into private hands is still believed to be modest; (e) the energy savings of 16.5% are believed to be
hypothetical, whereas the measured savings of 6.1% are clearly below expectations, even though it is
acknowledged that the SAR expectations might have been set too high; the fact that the retrofit packages
were implemented only partially does not strengthen the case for a satisfactory energy savings rating; (f)
while the probable contribution of the Asian financial crisis of 1997 is acknowledged (Section 5.1), the
Russian crisis of 1998 is still believed to have had largely domestic origins.
