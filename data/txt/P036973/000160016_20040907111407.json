Among the lessons learned were the\n            following: 1) The original objectives should have been\n            formally revised early on. The very rationale for\n            privatization of the divested housing might also have to be\n            formally revised. 2) The project objectives need to be\n            adequately supported by the project components. Mismatch\n            between the objectives of divestiture and privatization on\n            the one hand, and the heavy emphasis on the physical\n            investment in energy infrastructure retrofits on the other,\n            left the project ill-equipped to meet its stated objectives.\n            3) The effectiveness of energy efficiency investments in the\n            buildings can be substantially improved by proper\n            coordination between the housing and heating sector policies\n            and activities. In the absence of consumption-based billing\n            for heat, it is difficult to expect appropriate demand\n            response from the consumers of heat. Thus, it is critical\n            for the authorities to develop and enforce appropriate\n            methodologies for billing based on actual consumption in the\n            apartments and matching it to the metered consumption of the\n            building. 4) The appropriate choice of indicators for\n            monitoring is essential for proper evaluation of project\n            results and for timely corrective measures. The assessment\n            of effectiveness (rates of return) of some project\n            investments would be much more complete if it included\n            appropriate accounting for such benefits as increased value\n            of apartments (measured as an increase in its rent or\n            selling price). 5) Establishment of local implementation\n            capacity and arrangements for the sufficient and timely\n            local co-financing of project activities should be assigned\n            the highest priority at the preparation stage, because these\n            factors have an important effect on procurement and\n            administrative efficiency during implementation. 6) The Bank\n            and the Borrower should consider it a priority during\n            implementation to establish and maintain arrangements to\n            ensure the required interagency coordination and\n            single-point responsibility for project deliverables. 7) For\n            the project participant selection process to be more open,\n            competitive, and more effective in reaching better\n            consensus, it can be implemented in two-steps: federal\n            authorities select regions, and then regional authorities\n            select municipalities.  8) Strong fiscal relations between\n            the regional governments and municipalities responsible for\n            loan repayment are key to successful project implementation.\n            9) When appraising and implementing city-based/regional\n            sub-projects, special attention should be paid to reviewing\n            sub-borrower creditworthiness (on an annual basis) as well\n            as the technical preparedness to implement the project. Lack\n            of feasibility studies and enforceable business plans at the\n            outset of the project was a substantial impediment for the\n            project's successful implementation. 10) Implementation\n            would have been more efficient if the project implementation\n            unit operated more closely with the Ministry of Economic\n            Development and Trade."}, "docdt": "2004-08-30T00:00:00Z"}
