 million barrels of oil, reaching a peak production of 20,000\n            barrels per day in 1988. It will also include; (ii) field\n            development under association contracts between ECOPETROL\n            and private oil companies, with a peak production of 16,500\n            barrels per day in 1988. ECOPETROL will also participate in\n            this development, paying 50% of the cost of development. The\n            project will further provide; (iii) a 290 km pipeline to\n            move Occidental Association crude from Cano Limon in the\n            LLanos across the Andes mountains to Rio Zulia where it will\n            enter existing westward-bound pipelines. Finally, the\n            project will provide funds for; (iv) technical assistance\n            and studies."}, "docdt": "1984-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
