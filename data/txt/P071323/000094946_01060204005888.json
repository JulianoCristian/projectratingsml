Second Bank Restructuring Facility\n            Adjustment Loan Project will assist the Government of\n            Mexico, implement its Bank Restructuring Program, aimed at\n            improving a banking sector, capable to withstand external\n            shocks, and to improve lending to the private sector. The\n            project will support additional legal, and regulatory\n            reforms, to strengthen governance in the banking sector,\n            extend the new capital, and credit portfolio classification\n            regulations to public banks, and, provide an early warning\n            system. It will also involve the resolution of the remaining\n            banks under the Bank Savings Protection Institute's\n            (IPAB) purview, which includes the restructuring, and\n            sale/liquidation of Bancrecer, and liquidation of seven\n            smaller intervened banks. Funding will help finance part of\n            IPAB's debt-servicing needs arising from the\n            implementation of its bank resolution program, complementing\n            other sources of funds available to IPAB, such as fiscal\n            transfers, proceeds from asset disposal/recovery, and fees\n            from deposit insurance premiums. Although the project will\n            be beneficial in reducing the potential repeat of the\n            1994/95 banking crisis, risks include IPAB's limited\n            ability to refinance its debt, potentially facing increased\n            limitations in its capacity to capitalize and sell, or\n            unwind and liquidate, troubled banks. Moreover, IPAB's\n            large debt issues associated with the resolution process,\n            could imply higher, volatile interest rates than otherwise.\n            Nonetheless, the transactional nature of the loan\n            disbursements, and its legal monitoring, would reduce those risks."}, "docdt": "2001-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
