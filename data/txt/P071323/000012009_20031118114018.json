specific conditions for the\n            release of the Third Tranche. Waiver for the condition of\n            the Regulatory Reform Program, as contained in the\n            agreements is sought on the grounds set therein. Based on\n            the assessment that: a) the National Banking and Securities\n            Commission (CNBV), and the Ministry of Finance (SHCP) have\n            approved other important new prudential rules that\n            contribute to improving the health, and stability of the\n            financial sector; and, b) the Asset Disposal Program, and\n            the Bank Resolution Program have been implemented on a\n            consistent basis with the implementation letter, exceeding\n            the minimum requirements for compliance, this memorandum\n            recommends that a waiver be granted with respect to the\n            pending conditions, and the Third Tranche be released. The\n            Project supports the Government of Mexico's second\n            phase of its Bank Restructuring Program, which includes up\n            front measures to improve the legal and regulatory\n            framework, for a safer operation of the Mexican financial\n            sector, and the sale, merger or liquidation of the remaining\n            insolvent banks under government control. Compliance with\n            the tranche release conditions is discussed, specifying\n            actions under the Regulatory Reform Program - amendment to\n            the rules applicable to external audit reports, and\n            introduction of new rules to regulate the risk of banking\n            operations through the internet - have not been met.\n            However, given that the National Banking and Securities\n            Commission (CNBV) has issued other important new regulatory\n            rules that contribute to strengthening the governance in the\n            banking sector, a waiver of compliance with the Third\n            Tranche requirements, is justified."}, "docdt": "2003-11-17T00:00:00Z"}
