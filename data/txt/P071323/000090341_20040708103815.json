ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was highly likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory,. The lessons learned indicate that the\n            financial sector adjustment operations need to be based on\n            prior economic and sector work. Financial sector adjustment\n            operations should set limited objectives. Over-ambitious\n            objectives such as the restoration of the solvency and\n            soundness of the banking system are long-term goals that go\n            beyond a single operation. Bank restructuring operations\n            should disburse against the completed resolution of specific\n            bank cases, not against the promise of future actions which\n            may not materialize. Ensure that the main implementing\n            agency is the main recipient of the Bank resources. Bank\n            funds should benefit the main agency in charge of\n            implementing the policy reforms, to strengthen the\n            incentives of these agencies to work in close collaboration\n            with the Bank."}, "docdt": "2004-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
