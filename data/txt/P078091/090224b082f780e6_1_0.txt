   F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The project development objective was to support Burkina Faso's efforts to increase access to,
and use of, energy services to improve living conditions in selected rural, peri-urban, and urban
areas by (i) assisting the Government to implement its rural electrification strategy to enhance
                                                   ii
productivity and the impact of health and education programs, (ii) supporting community-based
sustainable woodfuels supply management and introduce alternative household fuels to reduce
unsustainable pressure on forest resources and illnesses induced by indoor air pollution; and
(iii) strengthening key sector institutions to create a favorable investment environment for more
cooperatives and private sector participation in energy service delivery initiatives.

    1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

        1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.       Country Context: In 2004, at the time of project preparation, the Government of
Burkina Faso issued its revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and set the following
quantitative objectives: (i) increase per capita gross domestic product by at least 4 percent per
year beginning in 2004; (ii) reduce the current incidence of Poverty to less than 35 percent by
2015; and (iii) increase life expectancy to at least 60 years by 2015. These objectives were in
line with the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the goals set forth by the New
Partnership for Africa’s Development. The Government acknowledged that meeting these goals
would require faster economic growth coupled with an accelerated pace of poverty reduction.
It also recognized that reforms to improve provision of infrastructure services (energy, water,
transport, and telecommunications) were fundamental to increase productivity and
competitiveness of the economy and to improve access to basic services.

2.       The country had achieved macroeconomic stability through fiscal discipline and
significant inflows of external support of about 8 to 9 percent of GDP during the previous
decade. However, major constraints to long-term growth and global competitiveness needed to
be addressed if this relatively good performance was to be sustained. Key obstacles to long-
term growth and competitiveness were as follows: (i) weak human resources and low labor
productivity; (ii) weak infrastructure and high input costs; (iii) limited size of the formal sector;
and (iv) weak institutional capacity. The 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) through
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs), specific investment operations, and advisory
services supported the Government’s Poverty Reduction Program through four main pillars: (i)
accelerated and shared small growth; (ii) improved access to basic services; (iii) increased
employment and income opportunities for the poor; and (iv) good governance with greater
decentralization. In particular, the upcoming PRSCs (7, 8, and 9) will support reforms intended
to: (i) improve the investment climate and promote exports; (ii) improve access to basic social
services through deepened decentralization and strengthened institutional capacity; and (iii)
promote efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of public resources through
enhanced public financial management

3.      Energy sector. At appraisal (and until the present time) Burkina Faso had no significant
known fossil fuel resources. Petroleum product consumption was entirely dependent on imports
(more than 500,000 tons annually) by road at high cost from ports over 1,000 km away. The
majority of the population (about 90 percent) still relied on wood energy (firewood and
charcoal). The country’s hydroelectric potential was limited, with less than 100 MW of potential
capacity in five identified sites. Two hydropower plants have been developed with 27 MW of
installed capacity and 16 MW of available capacity. These plants were vulnerable to erratic
rainfall conditions. Only about 18 percent of the population had access to electricity (about 40
percent in urban areas and about 3 percent in rural areas). Per capita consumption was 44 kWh
in Burkina Faso, compared with 100 kWh in Cameroon, 200 kWh in Senegal, and 270 kWh in
Cote d’Ivoire. The majority of the population (about 90 percent) was still relying on wood
energy (firewood and charcoal). The country faced four main challenges in the energy sector:
(i) the need for additional capacity to meet an increasing demand for energy services; (ii) to
                                                 1
improve the efficiency and equity in energy services provision by reforming tariff and subsidy
policies in a context of high supply costs; (iii) to expand access of energy services to rural and
peri-urban populations; and (iv) to achieve a sustainable supply of wood fuels used by the
majority of the population, while introducing alternative fuels to households.

4.      For about a decade before appraisal, the Government had been putting in place key
building blocks for reforming the regulatory environment of the energy sector. These reforms
were initiated in 1998 with the breakup of SONABEL’s distribution monopoly, followed in
2000 by the adoption o f a Letter of Sector Development Policy emphasizing a private sector-
led energy sector development. The broad outline of the restructuring of the sector was
completed in 2004 when the generation segment was opened to competition, and the
transmission and distribution segments were bundled into two sub segments. The first
subsegment covers the current perimeter of SONABEL and the second subsegment covers all
the area outside SONABEL’s perimeter.

5.      At appraisal, wood fuels (firewood and charcoal) were the main source of energy used
by about 90 percent of households in Burkina Faso, mostly for cooking. The reliance on wood
fuels was one of the important causes of deforestation, and was especially relevant in the context
of high population growth and increasing land clearance for agriculture. Farming on marginal
lands and land degradation were increasingly becoming concerns for environmental
sustainability, especially around major towns. Unsustainable pressures exerted on the biomass
resource base and cultivable land have long-term consequences such as the acceleration of
desertification and its associated climate change impacts, soil erosion, recurrent flooding, and
increased siltation in rivers. Besides environmental consequences, there were also negative
health effects associated with inefficient use of wood fuels. Inefficient burning of firewood
emits toxic substances like carbon monoxide, sulfur, and nitrogen oxides, which cause
bronchitis, acute respiratory infections in children, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in
women, low birth weight, and contribute to the prevalence of high morbidity and mortality rates.

6.      At appraisal, several development partners were involved in Burkina Faso’s energy
sector. The European Investment Bank (EIB) and the French Development Agency (AFD)
funded the transmission line from Cote d’Ivoire to Bobo-Dioulasso, which was commissioned
in 2001. DANIDA financed the rehabilitation and expansion of several diesel power plants in
Bobo-Dioulasso and Ouagadougou, and financed the development of a demand-side
management program and provided technical assistance to the DGE. The West African
Development Bank (BOAD) mobilized capital markets to finance expansion of power supply
in Ouagadougou. The EIB, AFD, Nordic Development Fund (NDF), and DANIDA were
financiers together with the World Bank of the Power Sector Development Project (more
below). The EAP through its outreach, partnerships, and harmonization subcomponent closely
collaborated with the African Development Bank (AfDB) rural energy services expansion
agenda and the Islamic Development Bank PV Support project.

7.     Project rationale. The Energy Access Project (EAP) was designed to capitalize on the
Power Sector Development Project (PSDP), which was approved by the Executive Directors in
November 2004 following the country’s paradigm shift towards the consideration of least-cost
investment options, including interconnection with neighboring countries. The PSDP under

                                                2
implementation would allow bringing substantially cheaper hydro and gas-based electricity
from neighboring Cote d’Ivoire into Ouagadougou by the end of 2008. Along the proposed
Bobo-Dioulasso-Ouagadougou transmission lines there was a tremendous potential for
electricity access expansion to households, production units, basic social services (health care
and education centers), and administrative and recreational centers in many communities, which
the EAP would facilitate. Furthermore, there was a potential for linking isolated centers
currently powered by diesel generators to the main grid and expanding distribution networks in
major towns and peri-urban areas. Both the PSDP and the EAP were in line with the objectives
of the Bank’s Africa Action Plan regarding the need to reduce the infrastructure gap. They were
also in alignment with objectives of Pillar 1 of the Clean Investment Framework on energy for
development and access for the poor. The PSDP and EAP covered all five tracks identified
under Pillar 1, namely: Track 1 - Scaled-up programs of household electrification; Track 2 -
Additional generation capacity (including regional projects); Track 3 - Provision of energy
services for key public facilities such as schools and clinics; Track 4 - Provision of standalone
lighting packages for households without electricity service; and Track 5- Access to clean
cooking, heating, and lighting fuels.

8.     The EAP was aimed towards supporting the Government’s efforts underway through
the PSDP to reduce production factor costs through the provision and rational use of energy
services. The EAP was thereby consistent with the CAS’S objective to help improve
competitiveness and to support broad-based growth. By expanding energy services access
through grid-based and standalone off-grid initiatives. The EAP was would allow the
Government to reach out to remote and poor populations, thus helping them to increase their
productivity and to improve their overall livelihoods.

9.       Following-up on this concept, the project was designed to (i) support conventional
electrification through SONABEL, the state electricity company; (ii) support rural
electrification through grid extensions to small communities; (iii) support rural electrification
through off-grid investments (diesel power plants, solar equipment); (iv) support sustainable
woodfuel production through improved forest management; (v) improve end-use energy
efficiency by disseminating improved stoves and substituting traditional energy by modern
energy.

      1.2. Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

10.     The Project Development Objective was to support Burkina Faso's efforts to increase
access to, and use of energy services to improve living conditions in selected rural, peri-urban,
and urban areas by:
        • Assisting the Government to implement its rural electrification strategy to enhance
            productivity and the impact of health and education programs;
        • Supporting community-based sustainable woodfuels supply management and
            introducing alternative household fuels to reduce unsustainable pressure on forest
            resources and illnesses induced by indoor air pollution;




                                               3
        •   Strengthening key sector institutions to create a favorable investment environment
            for more cooperatives and private sector participation in energy service delivery
            initiatives.

11.     Key outcome indicators of the project included: (i) People provided with access to
electricity by household connections (ii) Community electricity connections constructed under
the project iii) increased number of households with access to electricity; (iv) increased number
of education and health facilities in selected areas with access to electricity services; (v)
increased number of administrative and recreational facilities with access to electricity services;
(vi) increased number of hectares under community-based sustainable woodfuel supply
management programs; (vii) increased number of improved wood and charcoal stoves
disseminated; and (viii) increased number of cooperatives and private sector enterprises
providing energy services.

       1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and reasons/justification

12.     The PDO as stated in the legal agreement remained unchanged and relevant throughout
project implementation. Three of the key outcome indicators were revised in 2013. At the same
time, two core sector indicators (CSIs) were added during the opportunistic restructuring of
April 2103 following Sustainable Energy Department (SEG) recommendation to add core
sector indicators into the results framework. The table below shows the key changes made to
the results framework during project restructuring:

   Key Indicators                                                  Original         Revised
                                                                   Target           Target
    People provided with access to electricity by                   New             626,040
    household connections (core sector indicator)
    Community electricity connections constructed under              New              136
    the project (core sector indicator)
    Increased number of education and health facilities in            528             214
    selected areas with access to electricity services
    through the project
     Increased number of administrative and recreational              450             303
    facilities with access to electricity services through the
    project
    Increased number of improved wood and charcoal                 250,000           70,000
    stoves disseminated to households through the project

13.    The main reasons for the revision to the results framework were to better align the targets
determined during project appraisal with the signed contracts, hence improving realism and
adding new intermediate indicators to better track progress. The extension of the closing date
allowed important activities already initiated to be completed by the revised project closing date.
There was a combination of over-optimism and over-estimation and methodological
measurement issues at the time the project targets were initially put together. Regarding the
improved stoves component, the target was revised downward due to over-optimism and the

                                                4
failure of two initial approaches during implementation. The original approach, aimed at signing
business protocols with selected cooperatives, was not approved at the national level. The Bank
and the client therefore decided to proceed with a bidding process that was unfruitful until a
successful strategy was developed with the participation of NGOs in 2013.

       1.4. Main Beneficiaries

14.     The beneficiaries were not identified clearly in the PAD. Based on the PDO, the primary
target groups included (a) consumers lacking electricity connections in urban and peri-urban
areas of the main cities, which would be served directly by SONABEL; (b) rural communities
lacking electricity service, which would be connected to the grid and managed by local groups
of beneficiaries through a cooperative scheme; (c) mainly rural communities who would benefit
from improved school and health facilities by providing them with electricity service; (d)
communities where wood fuel is produced and who would benefit by increased employment
and a rational use of the resource; (e) households who would save on energy costs by requiring
less wood fuel by adopting improved wood stoves, as well as benefitting from improved living
conditions and fewer health hazards associated with traditional stove fumes and, in particular,
women (who would enjoy more time for productive activities) and children (who would enjoy
more educational and leisure time), given their traditional roles in cooking and woodfuel
collection, (f) small producers, such as millet beer brewers, who would benefit from switching
from wood fuel to modern energy. These beneficiaries remained unchanged throughout project
execution.

       1.5. Original Components (as approved)

15.   Component 1: Increasing Access to Electricity Services in the Urban, Peri-Urban
and Rural Areas (US$26.7 million equivalent). The component included three
subcomponents:
a)   Subcomponent 1.1 Grid-based extension and reinforcement in urban and peri-urban
     areas ($13.1 million):(i) Construction of medium voltage (MV) distribution lines linking
     three isolated centers to the main grid, (ii) distribution network rehabilitation, extension,
     and reinforcement in urban and peri-urban areas, and (iii) promotional initiatives to
     finance initial connection costs of new customers, prepayment meters, and energy saving
     bulbs. The subcomponent was expected to benefit 42 communities and to connect around
     86,000 new users, benefiting a population of around 685,000. This subcomponent was to
     be executed by SONABEL.
b)   Subcomponent 1.2 Increasing access in rural and remote areas ($13.1 million):
     financing investments for providing electricity services in 56 communities lacking power,
     and outside SONABEL’s perimeter. The activities included: (i) connection of 31
     communities to the grid; (ii) construction of standalone thermal–based minigrids in 6
     communities; (iii) construction of multifunctional platforms (diesel engine connected to
     several equipment items such as a water pump, welding and carpentry equipment etc.)
     with small distribution networks in 19 communities; and (iv) pre-electrification activities
     in 20 remote communities with PV systems (2,000 solar kits and 100 institutional
     systems). The target for this subcomponent was to achieve around 18,600 new


                                               5
     connections and to benefit a population of 145,000. It was to be executed by Fonds du
     Développement de l’Électrification (FDE).
c)   Subcomponent 1.3 Information, education, and communication ($0.5 million): this
     was expected to finance (i) information and promotional campaigns, mostly in rural and
     peri-urban areas; (ii) demonstration workshops where prospective consumers are
     introduced to energy devices; and (iii) the organization of focus groups to elicit feedback
     from stakeholders regarding project performance.

16.    Component 2: Wood fuel supply management and inter-fuel substitution initiatives
($6.7 million).
a)   Subcomponent 2.1 Community-based Wood fuels supply management ($5.1 million).
     Financing sustainable community-based forest management over an additional 440,000
     ha from a reference area of 600,000 ha currently under management. It also included
     equipment for forestry services, and the establishment of rural based microenterprises
     (e.g. carbonization units, agroforestry processing units, apiculture, etc.). It was executed
     by the Direction Générale des Forêts et de la Faune (DGFF) under the Ministry of the
     Environment.
b)   Subcomponent 2.2 Inter-fuel substitution initiatives ($1.0 million). The primary goal
     of this component was to support the penetration of 250,000 improved stoves within five
     years. It would also support other fuel substitution opportunities, and pilot projects for
     biofuel development from Jatropha, cotton and other agricultural waste. The Direction
     Générale de l’Énergie (DGE) under the Ministry of Energy executed it.
c)   Subcomponent 2.3 Training and promotional campaigns (US$ 0.6 million). Training
     and promotional campaigns on the advantages of sustainable woodfuels management,
     possibilities of inter-fuel substitution, and household economy gains from adopting
     alternative and energy-efficient devices.

17.     Component 3: Institutional strengthening, capacity development, and
harmonization ($5.4 million). The goal of this component was to finance institutional
strengthening of public sector energy agencies (national and decentralized agencies) to support
scaling up of energy service expansion. It would also finance capacity development of energy
service providers as well as outreach, partnerships, and harmonization initiatives. The
component included three sub -components:
a)   Subcomponent 3.1 Institutional strengthening in the public sector ($4.1 million): This
     component was for training and equipment to strengthen SONABEL, FDE, DGE, the
     General Directorate of Nature Conservation (DGCN), including planning, management,
     impact assessment, legal and regulatory improvements, monitoring, and pricing and
     taxation to support the development of energy services expansion.
b)   Subcomponent 3.2 Capacity development of energy service providers ($0.8 million).
     This was oriented towards supporting organizations such as cooperatives, NGOs, local
     communities and SMEs in cooperation with the UK DFID and ESMAP to provide
     diagnostic and business modules to finance training to encourage energy services
     expansion. In addition, it would help remove barriers to renewable energies.

                                               6
c)     Subcomponent 3.3 Outreach, partnerships and harmonization ($0.5 million). . This
       component was oriented towards supporting DGE in forming partnerships with other
       institutions to ensure that energy programs are effectively designed to support social
       development and contribute to increased productivity. It would also support DGE in
       attracting national and international institutions to participate in increasing energy access.

         1.6. Revised Components

18.      The components remained the same throughout project implementation.

         1.7. Other significant changes
19.     A level 2 restructuring was approved in April 2013 to extend the project closing date to
30 April 2014, revise the results framework and introduce core sector indicators, in addition to
revision to targets for three (3) PDO level indicators. In April 2014, a six-month extension was
approved, extending the closing date to October 31, 2014 to finalize activities under
implementation. Both restructurings reallocated funds among expenditure categories, as
follows:

                                                                    Revised           Revised

      2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

         2.1. Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

20.     Project preparation was grounded on (a) Burkina Faso’s poverty reduction strategy, (b)
the Government’s Rural Electrification Strategy and Biomass Energy Strategy, (c) as a follow-
up to the IDA Power Sector Development Project (PSDP–P069126), and (d) as a partial follow-
up of the Bank’s AIJ/RPTES pilot project. The 2004 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
recognized that reforms to improve provision of infrastructure services, including energy, are
fundamental to increase productivity and competitiveness, and to improve access to basic
services. The Government’s rural electrification strategy recognized the need to increase access

                                                  7
in rural areas, which was estimated at a mere 3%; as an indication of its commitment, it set up
the rural electrification fund (FDE) in 2003. The biomass strategy was based on the need to
replicate proven operational models, already implemented in Burkina Faso, for sustainable
forest management. The PSDP implemented interconnection lines with Ivory Coast, which
could be tapped to extend services in rural towns and communities. The AIJ/RPTES pilot
project was launched by the Government in 1998 to demonstrate the viability of community-
based integrated forestry and natural resource management, and proved to be successful. Based
on the foregoing, project conception was sound and founded on solid information.

21.     The PDO was structured around three categories of outcomes expected from the project,
namely (a) increases in productivity, and enhanced impacts of health and education programs
associated with extended electricity coverage; (b) reduced pressure on forest resources and the
reduction in illnesses associated with indoor pollution; and (c) an improved investment
environment and private sector participation in energy service delivery initiatives. The biomass
strategy was exclusively oriented towards preventing deforestation and ensuring the
sustainability of forest resources; however, the activities resulting from improved forest
management are also expected to generate additional revenues for rural populations, and should
have been contemplated in the PDO.

22.      The objectives of the project responded to Bank and Government priorities. Preparation
took place when the 2005 CAS had been issued; the latter was structured around several pillars:
(a) accelerating growth, which included strengthening economic infrastructure and electricity
supply; (b) expanding employment and income opportunities among the poor, including
community-driven development and land management, as well as rural infrastructure and
electrification; and (c) promoting good governance.

23.     The project was designed with three components that reflected the categories of
outcomes mentioned above (an “electricity” component, a “forest management and inter-fuel
substitution” component, and an “institutional strengthening” component); consequently,
project design followed a well-defined structure, from outcomes to objectives, and from
objectives to components.

24.     The scope of the components themselves can be characterized as follows: (a) Energy
services expansion comprised grid extensions, standalone grids, solar systems, and information
and education; all three activities had precedents both within Burkina Faso (as executed by other
development partners) and in numerous electrification projects throughout the region, many of
them supported by the Bank, and the scope was reasonable; (b) the scope of the woodfuels
supply management component was more difficult to comply with, as forest development is an
activity that can take from six to ten years, far beyond the project’s duration, and therefore
support would only be provided for the initial stages, associated with community organization;
(c) inter-fuel substitution, consisting of improved stoves, penetration of modern energy in
households, and pilot studies for the production of biofuels, is a well-defined activity which has
been performed in other projects within Burkina Faso, within the region, and many of the
Bank’s client countries; (d) finally, institutional strengthening as proposed is fairly standard and
can be executed within the project’s time range with Government cooperation.



                                                 8
25.     EAP preparation included research on lessons learned from other projects, which were
taken into account for its design, such as:
        • Simple program design based on contextual conditions and constraints;
        • Clear Government energy strategy;
        • The requirement for subsidies, preferably OBA-based;
        • Public/private partnerships as the preferred implementation option;
        • Promoting ownership through consultation with stakeholders;
        • Differentiated tariffs for rural electrification to ensure sustainability;
        • Multiple sector support to link electricity to productivity improvements and poverty
            alleviation;
        • Community-based natural resources management as the preferred vehicle for rural
            development.

26.  At appraisal, pertinent risks were identified, together with mitigation measures, as
summarized below.

 management

27.     The only risk to materialize was the full implementation of the electricity sector reform
(the regulatory authority was setup in 2013) but the sector was not unbundled; this event had
no consequences on project implementation. Unforeseen risks (which materialized) consisted
of implementation capacity of sector and Government agencies—including procurement
weaknesses.

       2.2. Implementation

28.     Implementation was characterized by two distinct phases: a period of inactivity and
delays, which lasted roughly three years, until end-2010, and a period of active implementation,
which lasted about four years until project closure in October 2014.

29.     Three years after effectiveness, as of March 2011, only 11% of the project funds had
been disbursed, against an original expectation of 80%. Ratings of the project during this first
phase ranged from MU to U. The MTR took place between October 2010 and early 2011 and
noted the different obstacles faced by the project. The principal cause of delay in the electricity
component was a failed procurement of equipment required by SONABEL due to bids that
largely exceeded the allocated budget; the process was reinitiated in 2010 with adjusted
procurement lots, which allowed the participation of local suppliers and resulted in acceptable
bids. Delays in procurement were also associated with local procurement rules that were
modified after project preparation and required a lengthy approval process by the National
Procurement Directorate (for contracts above US$2,000). The biomass and improved stoves
component also experienced delays associated with a lack of proactivity of DGE and DGCN,
and difficulties in recruiting trained staff.

30.     In 2011, the project was turned around and started to progress significantly. The bidding
processes were successful and disbursements increased to 58% during 2012 with the signature
of contracts for about 78% of the loan amount. As a result, the project was upgraded to MS
status. With improved perspectives of complying with its objectives, the project was
restructured in April 2013 with adjustments to several indicators and a one-year extension of
the closing date. Thereafter, the project progressed until closure with consistent MS ratings.

       2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.    Design. M&E was conceived within the framework and experience gained with the
previous PSDP project, which included SONABEL, DGE, and UER; these M&E systems were
expected to be upgraded and better coordinated for the EAP. Government statistics were

                                                10
considered unsuitable for reporting on project performance, i.e. on project outcomes or proxies
thereof; as a result, M&E was designed to rely on project-specific data such as its performance
indicators. The following table provides an assessment of the selected indicators and their
appropriateness for project monitoring.

32.     Implementation. M&E was performed by the UER together with staff in each of the
organization groups in charge of project execution. Monitoring consisted of collecting data
relative to component execution and indicators, which was discussed in monthly meetings. This
setup did not always perform well, as staff within the groups did not see this activity as a major
responsibility. UER prepared quarterly activity reports, including financial reporting, which
were shared with IDA as well as all staff activity reports, financial statements, and budgets.

33.      Utilization. On the Bank side, the M&E was utilized to follow the progress on the
implementation of the different components by targeting successful activities that would receive
additional funding through the two restructurings of the project, and detecting under-achieving
activities in order to take actions that would encourage the progress on the implementation of
those activities such as the improved cook stoves component. The UER used the M&E to
follow project progress; as noted under implementation, the executing institutions did not, in
general, take much note of the M&E process; greater awareness of the M&E process could have
avoided some of the delays in implementation.

       2.4. Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

34.    Safeguards. The project triggered the environmental assessment (Op 4.01) and
involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12) safeguards. The EAP was classified as a Category B project
(i.e. minimal, site-specific, and manageable impacts). An Environmental and Social
Management Plan was prepared, together with a Resettlement Policy Framework.

35.     Safeguard compliance was rated either as MS or S during project execution. Actual
impacts of the project included compensation and resettlement of 838 people, at a cost of around
US$160,000 during the construction of MV lines; 341 people were relocated and compensated
at a cost of around US$400,000 during the execution of the rural electrification component.
The only safeguard-related conflict took place when extending urban and peri-urban networks
under component 1.1; SONABEL had understood that these works did not need environmental
and social studies and remedial measures, but the Bank required them; the issue was resolved
through an agreement whereby SONABEL compensated users affected by the project, and
ultimately 341 compensation was arranged for 322 people at a cost of around US$122,000.

36.    Ultimately, the project confirmed the B rating, as environmental and social impacts were
easily managed in the field, were financially affordable, and did not delay the project
implementation significantly.

37.     Fiduciary. Financial management aspects of the project were continuously rated either
MS or S (particularly at the end of the project); the related FM risk was rated moderate
throughout project implementation. Overall, financial management covered adequately the
project’s accounting and reporting arrangements, internal control procedures, planning and
budgeting, counterpart funding, funds flow arrangement, external audit reporting arrangements,
and project accounting staff issues. Staffing remained adequate and proper books of accounts
and supporting documents were kept in respect of all expenditures. Most of the audits were



                                               12
submitted on time, and were unqualified. The interim un-audited financial reports were also
submitted on time and the quality of those reports improved throughout project implementation.

38.    Procurement. As noted in section 2.2, the project experienced failed bidding processes,
which resulted in major project delays. Procurement was rated Unsatisfactory until early 2011,
and the corresponding ISR noted likely weaknesses in capacity and recommended training.
Once the goods and services were repackaged into smaller and more numerous tenders, thereby
enabling the participation of local enterprises, bidding was successful, procurement proceeded
adequately, and project implementation improved.

         2.5. Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     Post-completion. Investments financed by the project under Component 1.1
(SONABEL extensions and lines) are standard equipment requiring basic and well-known
maintenance procedures. Under Component 1.2 (rural lines, networks, and power plants), the
lines and networks are maintained either by SONABEL or by an enterprise (required by FDE),
which takes care of technical maintenance of rural facilities. The diesel power plants are
operated by electricity cooperatives in the beneficiary villages, which have received training on
the standard O&M required by the facilities. The solar PV kits distributed through the project
do not require much maintenance and can be expected to operate adequately under normal
conditions. The transition arrangements are summarized in the following table.

40.      Follow-up of the electricity component of the project is expected for the SONABEL and
FDE activities. In the case of SONABEL this is executed as part of normal maintenance and
supervisory activities. In the case of FDE, there are arrangements to follow up on the principal
electrification variables (households, consumption, commercial performance) in communities
under its purview. .

41.      Next phase. The major components financed by this operation include two follow-up
initiatives:
        (a) The Electricity Sector Support Project (P128768), a $85 million loan whose PDO
includes (i) increasing access to electricity, (ii) improving the reliability of electricity supply,
and (iii) improving energy efficiency in targeted areas. The increased access will build upon
lessons learned from the EAP
      (b) The $26 million Decentralized Forest and Woodland Management Project—FIP—
(P143993), designed to build upon the EAP achievements in addressing fuelwood and forest
management issues.


   3. Assessment of Outcomes

       3.1. Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Substantial

42.     The objective of the operation was and continues to remain highly relevant to the overall
development goals of Burkina. It is considered that the project has made a significant difference
to the country´s poverty reduction strategy and the MDGs by facilitating the increase in the rate
of electrification from 40%percent during appraisal to an estimated 56 percent in 2014. In
October 2013, the Council of Ministers adopted a new energy policy (Politique Sectorielle de
l’Energie (POSEN) 2013 – 2022) as the sector’s response to the national accelerated growth
and sustainable development strategy (SCADD). The POSEN is based on four strategic pillars:
(i) promoting the use of local (renewable) energy resources; (ii) enhancing sub-regional
cooperation; (iii) ensuring universal access to quality energy services; and (iv) making energy
an engine for sustainable development. The Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF)’s goal is to
achieve: (a) a 100% access rate to electricity services in urban areas and 49% in rural
communities; (b) an 80% market penetration of improved cook stoves in urban households and
90% for rural ones; all to be achieved by target year 2022.

43.      The latest CPS was issued in 2013 and covers FY13-16. The strategies envisioned in
the CPS include the reduction of infrastructure deficits (transport, energy, and ICT). For the
energy sector, the CPS recommends that the EAP direct its efforts to expanding access in
targeted rural, peri-urban, and urban areas. It presents the ESSP as a continuation of the EAP,
to increase access and to enhance rational use of energy in target areas. Consequently, the EAP
can be considered to be well grounded in terms of supporting both past and current priorities.
In fact, the EAP objectives will continue to be relevant for several years; for example, the access
target for electricity in 2016 in the CPS is 50%, still far below many developing country
standards; likewise, the continued dependence on traditional fuels in the near and medium term
requires improved management of scarce forest resources.

      3.2. Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives
Rating: Substantial

44.     The project succeeded in connecting 127,000 new households to the SONABEL grid;
the 2006 baseline consisted of 247,000 customers, which indicates that the project contributed
to an increase in connections of 51% over 8 years. In 2013 SONABEL had reached 472,000
customers, which would indicate that the project contributed to 56% of SONABEL’s customer
growth during the implementation period. In the case of FDE, the project connected 19,800
homes by end-2014; with a baseline of less than 15,000 users, the project will have contributed
to more than 100% growth of rural users during the implementation period.

45.      Rating the PDO involves, as mentioned in the implementation and M&E sections,
assessing whether the outcomes were achieved. In the case of the EAP, the outcomes included
in the PDO were improved living conditions in general and, in particular, (i) enhanced
productivity, (ii) enhanced impact of health and education programs, (iii) reduced pressure on
forest resources, (iv) impact on illnesses induced by indoor air pollution, and (v) improving the
investment climate for cooperative and private sector participation in energy services delivery.
The chosen indicators did not measure outcomes directly and are proxies for them. However,
evidence from other projects financed by the Bank indicates that electrification generates
benefits and welfare at the household level, mainly by the availability of lighting and the
facilitation of communication and improved leisure time. During the ICR mission, a visit to a
rural community, which lacked electricity and is now connected to the grid evidenced a high
degree of satisfaction with; the indicators for forestry management do not allow an assessment
as to the deforestation benefits or the benefits for the rural population in terms of improved
sources of income.

47.     The project achieved all of its revised key indicator targets, surpassing several of them
by a significant margin. In addition to the key indicators, there is a meaningful intermediate
indicator, consisting of the number of communities with access to energy services in the
targeted areas. The initial value consisted of less than 100 communities; the target consisted of
136 communities, and the achieved value was 191 communities, practically doubling the
number of communities with access to energy services in the targeted areas during the seven-
year project execution period.

51.     An economic reevaluation of the project was performed on the basis of actual costs and
estimated benefits (Annex 3). The analysis concentrated on the electricity components of the
project, with separate evaluations for the grid extension projects and the off-grid ones, and the
improved stoves and fuelwood substitution initiatives. The economic analysis of project
components yielded the following results:

52.     These indicators merit the following comments: (a) the 33kV extensions are justified on
the basis of a counterfactual in which the towns continue to be supplied by local diesel generator
sets, and benefits are therefore associated with fuel savings and capital cost savings of future
plant investments; (b) the SONABEL grid extensions yield a high IRR due to the consumer
surplus associated with a Willingness to Pay (WTP) of $0.7/kWh based on an IEG/ESMAP
study; (c) FDE grid extensions yield a lower IRR because of lower consumption and higher
costs associated with longer MV and LV distribution lines; (d) the isolated diesel power plants
are marginally justified due to the high fuel costs they require to operate; (e) individual solar
kits were evaluated on the basis of a WTP of $10/month, but continue to be justified with a
WTP of $6/month (11% IRR); (f) community systems were analyzed through a cost
effectiveness approach using diesel powered gensets, thereby incurring high counterfactual
costs, hence the high IRR; (g) the improved stoves were evaluated according to wood fuel
savings and a variety of stove designs (clay and metal models); (h) finally, the substitution of
fuel wood by LPG was evaluated on the basis of savings in fuel purchases by using LPG and
field data collected during the ICR mission. All of the evaluated components show that the
project outputs are economically justified.

       3.4. Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

53.     The rating is based on (i) the substantial relevance of the project to the economic and
social development of Burkina Faso, (ii) the substantial accomplishment of the objectives set
out by the project as measured by the performance indicators, and (iii) a high efficiency
evaluation

       3.5. Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

          (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     The project has had important verifiable poverty impacts by providing electricity access
in both peri-urban and rural areas, where benefits of lighting, communications and improved
leisure have materialized (as confirmed, for example, during the ICR mission field visit to a
rural community that benefited from the project). Improved gender equality can be surmised
to be a consequence of the project in the long term with better woodfuel supply in rural areas
and more efficient stoves, thereby alleviating female household cooking chores. The
substitution of woodfuel by LPG in the millet beer production improved the financial yield of
this activity, which is 100% run by women (the “dolotières”), as verified during the ICR
mission. Social development can be a positive consequence of electrification in rural areas by
supporting, for example, after-work and leisure community activities (as in the development of
“video clubs” in villages, which can now be connected and informed through media). The
community management of forests is also a project component that supports social development
by creating a sense of ownership of common resources.

          (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

55.     Component 3 of the project provided training for 153 public sector officials in five
organizations (DGE, SONABEL, FDE, DGFF), as well as 158 staff of the regional cooperatives
organized to operate off-grid electricity systems. It also provided physical support through
investments in office and transport equipment. This support can be expected to provide benefits
and to improve public energy and forest sector institutions. Also, experience gained with the
EAP in areas such, as procurement and safeguards will be reflected in future projects such as
the ESSP and the FIP, as well as in the internal evaluation and execution of projects developed
by SONABEL and FDE.

        (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None were identified.

      3.6. Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not Applicable.

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

56.     The development outcomes associated with the electricity-related components of the
project are at risk only if there occurs a physical or management breakdown that leads to severe
service curtailments. As noted in post-completion, the electricity-related facilities are standard
and robust equipment that is being operated under reasonably knowledgeable management, and
service curtailments are unlikely to be associated with either equipment breakdown or
management crises as long as the overall external environment remains stable (e.g. the
regulatory setup and cost-reflecting tariffs, available electricity production to be channeled to
the load). The deforestation control outcome associated with the forestry component could be
at risk if the community organizations are not supported, but given the local ownership they
enjoy, they are likely to persist; additionally, in the measure that the country develops and
modern energies become available to households, deforestation associated with wood fuels is
likely to diminish. The outcomes associated with improved stoves and fuel wood substitution
are more short term and present little risk.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
       5.1. Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

57.     The proposed rating reflects detailed project preparation and development of the
project’s concept, but it also reflects a choice of PDO, which could have been better conceived
to reflect a longer term project outcomes. For the electrification component, the Bank prepared
a comprehensive design of how the project would put in place different elements, depending on
the type of subprojects under consideration (on-grid and off-grid types), which were
instrumental in implementing successful management schemes. The forestry component was

                                               19
also prepared in detail and took into account similar operations. However, there were failings
that would subsequently impact on project execution, such as (a) an overly optimistic evaluation
of the procurement capacity of the different agencies, and (b) an underestimation of the
difficulties associated with managing multiple agencies involved in implementation (UER,
DGE, SONABEL, FDE, and DGFF).

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

58.     The proposed rating reflects the proactivity of the project team in addressing important
challenges for the project to implement and disburse, and, in particular, the procurement
weaknesses of four different agencies (SONABEL, FDE, DGFF, and DGE). Significant delays
were recorded in project execution. However, the project team was diligent in addressing the
problems that arose in this context and providing support to the executing agencies. It also
reflects a strong focus on supervision to achieve PDOs; proactive responses to emerging issues
(such as cost overruns and delays in procurement) through project restructuring; accelerated
implementation performance after initial restructuring, were positive aspects of supervision.
The team composition changed during project implementation, including three TTLs. The core
team was located in the field, including the TTL who conducted an intensified dialogue with
the Borrower and local staff, energy and procurement specialists, with good knowledge of
Burkina Faso’s energy sector. The supervision reports were candid and of good quality,
including reporting on the outcome indicators. Lessons learned from the design and
implementation of the EAP was incorporated into ESSP currently under execution.

59.     Financial management supervision was satisfactory and the adequacy of financial
management arrangements was reviewed regularly. Safeguards supervision was also successful
in implementing safeguard policies, such as those associated with the environment, but
particularly those requiring compensation to the few populations negatively affected by the
project. The project team was successful in negotiating acceptable implementation policies
when safeguard guidelines conflicted with implementing agency practice.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

60.    Overall Bank performance was rated Satisfactory based on the ratings for quality at
entry (Moderately Satisfactory) and Supervision (Satisfactory), which combined yield the
proposed rating. It should be noted that, despite procurement delays, overall, the project
development objectives have been reached and the disbursement rate reached 100 percent.

       5.2. Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     The Government was directly involved in the project through DGE and DGFF, which
are directorates directly ascribed to Government Ministries. These organizations performed
quite adequately towards the end of the project, but they were relatively passive during the early

                                               20
years of implementation, when disbursements were practically nil. DGE was unsuccessful in
arranging a functional procedure for fabrication and distribution of improved stoves under the
initial targets. The GoBF itself showed commitment to the operation and the objectives of the
project. Effectiveness conditions were all satisfied on time. The Electrification Development
Tax (EDT), applied exclusively for rural electrification development, was settled. The five-
year tax exemption for renewable energy equipment was adopted. During project preparation
and execution, the GoBF adopted strategic policy documents for the energy sector
complemented with a three-year action plan. Because the Government was ineffective in
spurring the entities under its control (DGE, DGFF), its overall performance, together with that
of the agencies, was rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.    SONABEL and FDE put in place the components under their responsibility but
exhibited a general weakness in execution, which resulted in delayed implementation.
However, they were successful in overcoming this limitation. SONABEL and FDE had solid
technical expertise accumulated from the design and implementation of previous projects. They
were also successful in following the Bank’s safeguard policies and guidance. Overall, UER
performed satisfactorily and ensured good coordination of procurement, financial management,
and monitoring activities. The implementation progress reports, audits, and financial reports
were diligently submitted to the Bank. However, overall, implementation agencies performance
rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63.     The proposed rating reflects the ratings for Government performance (Moderately
Satisfactory) and the Moderately Satisfactory rating for the implementing agencies (UER
SONABEL and FDE) performance. The coordinating and implementing agencies developed
project management expertise, which is valuable for follow-up operations. No major issues
regarding the fiduciary or safeguards policies were recorded. The working relationship among
the coordinating unit, UER, and the implementing structures/institutions, DGE, FDE, DGFF,
SONABEL, was sometimes challenging and contributed to procurement delays.

   6. Lessons Learned

64.     Early detection of implementation weaknesses can prevent delays. Project
implementation can benefit by taking a thorough look at human resources of agencies and their
preparation to deal with the critical tasks of tender design, procurement procedures (and the
particularities of Bank procurement), and financial management. If necessary, resources should
be allocated to training the client’s teams at the outset of the project. Possible conflicts with
local procurement rules should be identified early —hopefully at project preparation— and
solutions should be agreed with the Government in advance.

65.    Access projects require a “market conditioning phase” before funds start to flow.
The delays associated with access projects should be taken into account at appraisal and built

                                               21
into project design by allowing for an initial period of project preparation and information
dissemination among potential beneficiaries. This implies a potentially longer implementation
period for access projects, together with a longer period before initial disbursements take place.

66.     Focusing on one sector. Mixing objectives, even if they are related, leads to
complicated project implementation. The EAP is a good example: although electricity and
fuelwood fall under the same energy umbrella, the institutions involved, the issues and
challenges addressed, and the resources allocated to them were completely different. As a
result, there was little synergy between the electricity components and the forestry/fuel
substitution components. Maintaining strong links between components (talking the same
language, as it were) leads to more streamlined implementation: for example, the main grid
network extensions (SONABEL) were complemented by FDE investments in distribution grids,
thereby leading to coherent execution and outputs with a better chance of leading to the desired
outcomes. Hence it is difficult to combine electricity access and household energy—forestry in
particular—in one project. It may be better to combine household/cook stove activities with
environment or health projects.

67.     Limiting the number of institutions involved in implementation improves the
chances for success. The EAP had to deal with four implementation agencies, in addition to
interacting with the UER. This is difficult, particularly when TTLs have multiple projects to
supervise; in fact, it’s like supervising four different projects. A reasonable limit for any project
should be two implementation agencies.

68.   Relying on local communities creates ownership and contributes to successful
implementation. The EAP provides two examples in this respect:
        (a) for rural electrification, local communities were given responsibilities regarding the
        management of commercial functions (billing and collection) through village
        cooperatives, thereby relieving the main utility (SONABEL in this case) of having to
        perform these functions in remote locations and minimizing commercial losses by
        billing the community through a collective meter;

        (b) the forestry component was oriented towards strengthening community links for
        forest management; local communities responded positively to this initiative and
        increased the chances of ensuring that project outcomes can be sustained once it closes.

69.     M&E design and implementation should be addressed in detail at preparation and
early stages of implementation. In particular, there should be coherence between the PDO
intended outcomes and the monitoring indicators chosen for the project. In the case of the EAP,
the link with the intended outcome, particularly in the case of the forestry component, was not
very clear.

70.     Safeguard implementation should be clarified at the outset of the project. In the
case of the EAP, adhering to certain safeguard guidelines came as a surprise to SONABEL for
its peri-urban electrification. Seminars or workshops during the project’s first stages of
implementation would have provided the necessary clarifications and would have helped to
streamline project execution.

                                                 22
71.      Planning for a beneficiary survey should be thought out upfront and not just at the
time of project closing: beneficiaries’ survey should be performed for projects such as the EAP
with large numbers of beneficiaries who are being provided with basic energy infrastructure. In
the EAP case, at the time of closure the country was experiencing a political crisis, which made
it particularly difficult to conduct a beneficiary survey.

                             Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Connection between project outputs (listed in Annex 4) and project outcomes:
       •   Component 1 outputs consist of medium voltage lines, low voltage lines and
           network extensions, diesel-powered units together with distribution networks, and
           solar PV kits for individual households; all of these facilities provide the
           infrastructure to connect users who lacked electricity service (and are thereby able
           to enjoy its benefits), which is the ultimate outcome sought by this component of
           the project;

       •   Component 2.1 outputs consist of putting in place or strengthening community
           Forest Management Groups, preparing base information (including maps and forest
           inventories), training of forest users, and awareness raising for potential
           users/beneficiaries; the outcomes associated with this component are essentially an
           improvement in the availability of fuel wood and an increase in rural dwellers
           income through the organization of a technical management of forest resources. The
           outcomes in this case will be ascertainable in the long run, as the results of putting
           in place technical and efficient forest management is a lengthy process which can
           take 6 to 10 years; however, given the experience in other countries, the process can
           be expected to lead to a positive result (see below for the follow-up Bank project);

       •   Component 2.2 is mainly associated with efficiency increases through the
           dissemination of improved stoves; project outputs consist of the stoves themselves
           and outcomes are immediately visible (and strongly related to outputs) when
           beneficiaries start using the stoves; this also applies to the outputs of substituting
           fuelwood based processes with LPG;

       •   Component 2.3 was bundled with component 2.2, and information sessions were
           organized during the dissemination of improved stoves.

       •   Component 3 outputs consisted largely of supportive office equipment and training
           programs for staff and personnel involved in managing the sub-projects supported
           by the other components, and as such are closely linked to the previously mentioned
           outcomes.

                         Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.    The economic evaluation of the EAP comprises separate analyses for the following
different components:
        • Subcomponent 1.1. which comprises works executed by SONABEL: connections of
            three centers to the main grid, network extensions in Ouagadougou, and network
            extensions together with access expansion in Bobo-Dioulasso, Kaya, Korsimoro,
            Boussouma, Kombissiri, Ziniaré, Koudougou, Réo, Tenkodogo, Garango,
            Pouytenga, and Zorgho.
       •   Subcomponent 1.2. which includes works executed by FDE: inter-urban
           connections, 6 diesel power plants in the Sahel region, rural network extensions, and
           PV kit distribution; and
       •   Subcomponent 2.2. distribution of improved stoves and substitution of wood fuel by
           gas.
Analysis of works executed by SONABEL

2.    Connection of Boromo, Dédougou and Gaoua to the main grid. This project included
the connection of these three villages to the main grid through 33kV lines fed from substation
Pâ. These three communities used to be supplied by local diesel plants with an installed capacity
of 14.6MW.

3.   The methodology used to evaluate the benefits consists of comparing the ‘With’ and
‘without’ project scenarios:
       •   Without project scenario: the villages continue to be supplied with diesel power
           plants, including investments for serving future demand;
       •   With project scenario: the villages are supplied from the main grid, and the diesel
           plants are no longer necessary.

4.    Project costs consist of line and network investments, and project benefits consist of the
cost of fuel saved by supplying the load from the main grid as well as savings in future diesel
plant investments. Other benefits include improved reliability and 24-hour service (not included
in the evaluation due to lack of information). Table A3-1 summarizes the costs and benefits of
this component of the project

         Table A3-1 Costs and Benefits of Grid Extension and Connection of Boromo, Dédougou and Gaoua




5.   The resulting economic indicators yield:
NPV Costs @12%: 11.3M$; NPV Benefits @12%: 15.8M$; B/C ratio: 1.4; IRR: 20%

6.   Grid extensions. These consist of the installation of different transformers and lines to
supply load increases. Some of these facilities were visited during ICR preparation: although
some of the extensions have reached formerly unsupplied areas, most are within the city proper
and benefit customers who are seeking to be connected, including new businesses and housing
developments. The costs for the corresponding investments in different sites are summarized
in Table A3-2.

7.    The extensions have not reached their full utilization and new customers are to be added
in the coming years. As a measure of benefits of electrification in these grid-based extensions
by SONABEL, the Willingness to Pay (WTP) was estimated with the same approach used in
the recent (May 2014) additional credit for the Electricity Sector Support Project, i.e. a WTP
within a conservative range of $0.7 to $0.5/kWh. The underlying justification was based on a
2008 IEG study2. A summary of costs and benefits is shown in Table A3-3.

8.   The economic indicators yield the following values: NPV Costs @12%: 27.19M$; NPV
Benefits @12%: 76.78M$; B/C ratio: 2.8; IRR: 85%.

9.      These results merit the following comments:
          •    The average connection cost, at $197 per connection, is reasonable and indicative of
               users that are located in peri-urban or at least agglomerated communities; these are
               therefore users that can be expected to consume more than basic lighting and
               telecommunications, including some kind of refrigeration on average, hence the
               assumption of 50kWh/month as an initial consumption value;
          •    Consumption per beneficiary is assumed to grow at a rate of 3 percent per year,
               reflecting the availability of electricity for more uses and the effect of economic
               growth;
          •    The average cost over the analysis period (NPV of costs/NPV of demand at the 12%
               discount rate) yields a value of $0.25/kWh, which is reasonable for this type of
               project;
          •    The minimum WTP to yield a 12% IRR is around $0.31/kWh, i.e. around 40% of
               the assumed WTP; in this sense, the result is robust.

Analysis of works executed by FDE

10. These works are oriented towards rural electrification, which, in contrast to works
executed by SONABEL, comprise communities with lower demand densities. The analysis
proceeds by outlining a methodology for valuing the economic benefits of these projects and
by applying it to the different components executed by FDE.

11. Methodology for greenfield electrification: Greenfield electrification consists of either
grid extension or putting in place generation facilities to serve new customers who lack
electricity. In the EAP case, greenfield electrification is oriented towards households. The
following benefits result from the availability of electricity in a home: (a) improvements in
lighting quality and quantity extend the working day and allow for income-generating activities
after dark, and lead to better conditions under which children can read and study, (b) access to
radio and television, (c) reduction of indoor pollution, contributing to improved health, and (d)
access to refrigeration (small refrigerators) with food conservation benefits. For the ex-post,
economic evaluation only benefits (a) and (b) will be quantified because of the lack of
information on other sources of benefits.

12. Lighting benefits. The assumed counterfactual is that beneficiaries use kerosene lamps
for lighting in the absence of electricity. Expenditures on kerosene amount to a cost of around
44 liters per year per lamp, at a price of US$1.10 per liter3, in addition to the purchase cost of
the lamp. Dry cell batteries are used to power radios, and can cost around US$4 to US$5 per
month. Electricity brings about important qualitative changes; for example, a 15W compact
fluorescent lamp (CFL) produces around 800 lumens, while a kerosene lamp will produce only

                                                     32
around 60-70 lumens at best4. In terms of useful illumination (measured in terms of lux, i.e.
lumens per square meter), the CFL produces 122 lux, while the kerosene lamp provides only
10 lux.

13. Consequently, economic benefits associated with better lighting derive from two sources:
(a) savings from the substitution of kerosene and batteries by lower cost power, and (b) the
benefits of additional consumption derived from the higher illumination provided by electricity.
Figure A3-1 illustrates the benefits as represented by a consumer demand function.

        Figure A3-1 Demand Function for Lighting




14. In Figure A3-1, (PK, QK) is the initial point of consumption (based on kerosene), and (PE,
QE) is the final point of consumption, based on electricity. Areas A+B+D represent total (gross)
surplus in the initial situation, where B+D is the cost of kerosene and dry cell batteries; the net
surplus is therefore area A. At the final point of consumption, gross surplus increases to
(A+B+C+D+E); areas D+E are the costs of supply with electricity, and areas B+C yield the net
consumer surplus gain to beneficiaries.

15. Communications benefits. Lighting benefits can be estimated with some degree of
assurance, as there exists a quantifiable alternative (kerosene lamps); no such information is
available for benefits such as watching TV (hearing the radio has the associated cost of dry cell
batteries). Also, consuming TV is a one-off experience, i.e. there is no continuum of
consumption. The benefits of TV availability have been estimated from willingness to pay
studies in developed countries. For example, in the UK a survey commissioned by the Radio
Communications Agency in 2000 (later Ofcom) assessed the willingness to pay for radio and

TV5. It found a willingness to pay on the order of £10 per month per household (around US$15
per month). At the time, income in the UK for poor households was on the order of
US$12,000/year6. They would be willing to pay up to around 1.5% of disposable income for
TV. Although extrapolating this value to another country, such as Burkina Faso, is debatable,
it would represent a WTP of around $23 per year based on a self-reported median household
income of $1,530 per year7.

16. Willingness to Pay (WTP). The analysis assumes that households connected to the grid
replace two kerosene lamps with one CFL8, with a resulting gross consumer surplus of around
$185 per household per year. Added to the WTP of communications benefits, this would result
in a total WTP of $208 per year per household.

17. A recent study regarding the impact of rural electrification9 yielded values of WTP for
different scenarios based upon alternative considerations, as shown in Figure A3-2.

18. In the case of Burkina Faso the assumption used would correspond roughly to Scenario 3
with a monthly WTP of about $18, or $216 per year, which is slightly higher than the WTP

19. These isolated networks benefit users who lacked electricity services and therefore fall
into the category of greenfield electrification projects. Table A3-4 summarizes the costs and
benefits of these investments.

20. The resulting economic indicators are NPV Costs (@12%): 2.22M$, NPV Benefits
(@12%): 2.25M$, B/C ratio: 1.01, IRR=12.2%. These results merit the following comments:

21. FDE Electrification through grid extension. FDE accomplished the electrification of
25 communities through interurban connections at 33kV and LV grid extension. The
characteristics of these investments are shown in Table A3-5 below.

            Table A3-5 Characteristics of Communities Electrified by FDE through Grid Extension




22. The resulting benefits and costs, using a similar approach to the SONABEL analysis are
shown in Table A3-6:
                   Table A3-6 Costs and Benefits of FDE Interurban Connections and Extensions




23. The corresponding economic parameters yield the following values: NPV Costs (@12%):
21.2M$, NPV Benefits (@12%): 36.1M$, B/C ratio: 1.7, IRR=24%.

24.   The results merit the following comments:
       •   The average connection cost, at $525 per connection, is representative of greater
           distances required to reach beneficiaries, which is indicative of predominantly rural
           users; these are therefore users that can be expected to consume essentially basic

                                                      36
           lighting and telecommunications, hence the assumption of 30kWh/month as an
           initial consumption value;
       •   Consumption per beneficiary is assumed to grow at a rate of 3 percent per year,
           reflecting the availability of electricity for more uses and the effect of economic
           growth;
       •   The average cost over the analysis period (NPV of costs/NPV of demand at the 12%
           discount rate) yields a value of $0.41/kWh, which points towards weak financial
           viability in the absence of subsidies;
       •   The minimum WTP to yield a 12% IRR is around $0.51/kWh, i.e. around 70% of
           the assumed WTP; lower WTPs would indicate that the investments are just
           marginally justified.

25. Solar component. FDE implemented a solar program with the characteristics shown in
Table A3-7:
                                       Table A3-7 FDE Solar Equipment
                          Type                 Quantity       Unit Cost $   Total Cost $
                      Individual Kit             3929            248          972,525
                   Community Systems             180             5,393        970,772
                          Total                                              1,943,297


26. Economic evaluation of the individual kits. These are three-lamp kits of 15W (5W/lamp).
The price paid by the beneficiaries was around $50 (i.e. a subsidy of around $200), collected
(a) through a $10 down payment, (b) $1 per month plus a $0.60 maintenance fee for a total
$1.60 during 40 months, and (c) a $0.60 per month maintenance fee thereafter. According to
the WTP discussion, these kits would fall into category 1 of Figure A3-2, i.e. basic lighting (no
TV), and a WTP of $10 per month. With this assumption, the cash flow for an individual solar
kit would consist of the following parameters:
                 • Initial cost: $248
                 • Maintenance cost: $0.6/month
                 • WTP (benefit): $10/month

27. These parameters, assuming a 60-month useful lifespan for the kit, yield: NPV costs
@12% (0.95% per month): $275, NPV benefits @12% (0.95% per month): $456, B/C ratio:
1.7, EIRR: 3.2% per month (39% per year).

28.   Given the uncertainty associated with the WTP and the lifespan
       • A more conservative value for WTP of $6 per month yields an EIRR of 11%
       • A lifespan of 36 months yields an EIRR of 21%.

29. Within a relatively wide variation of parameters, the positive economic indicators of
individual solar kits appear to be robust.



                                                    37
30. Economic evaluation of the community systems. Assessing the economic benefits from
outcomes of these investments, such as better health, better education etc. is difficult and there
is a lack of documentation (in contrast to better understood benefits such as those associated
with individual households). As an alternative, a cost-effectiveness approach consists of
comparing the costs of the solar systems with the option of using small gensets during a few
hours each day. The latter option compared to the solar alternative produces the following
results over a 5-year period:

                             NPV Gen set Costs       $6,363.24
                             NPV Solar Costs         $5,335.91
                             Savings                 $1,027.33


Analysis of works executed by DGE.

31. These comprise improved stoves and the substitution of fuelwood by LPG for large users.
Improved stoves that were distributed included (a) improved “three stone” stoves, (b) clay
stoves, and (c) metal stoves. Benefits from improved stoves have traditionally included
fuelwood savings and health benefits due to avoidance of fumes in enclosed spaces. The latter
are usually associated with stoves equipped with chimneys; in the case of stoves distributed in
Burkina, none of them included chimneys and therefore their health benefits are minimal (many
of them are used for open-space cooking where fumes pose a much lower risk compared to
closed-space cooking).

32. Several evaluations of improved stoves in Burkina Faso provide insight into their
benefits10; estimated per capita consumption of fuelwood is on the order of 0.7kg per day,
resulting in around 80-100kg per month for a family of 4-5. The improved stoves yield reduced
fuelwood consumption of 15%-20% depending on the model of stove, or around 12-20kg of
fuelwood savings per month per family. Prices of fuelwood vary widely. At the wholesale
level in Ouagadougou the price of wood is around $500 for a load of 20 stères (20m3),
equivalent to around $0.08 per kg; at the retail level this price can increase to $0.10 or more per
kg. An improved stove can mean savings in the range of $1 to $2 per month.

33. The production cost of improved stoves varies between $1.50 for a clay stove and $3-$5
for metal stoves. Distribution can add $0.25 to $0.40 per stove. With benefits of $1 per month
the payback period could vary between two months for a clay stove to around four months for
a metal stove. In the case of improved “three stone” stoves, these are essentially better mud
stoves with lower savings but very low costs. Assuming a 24-month lifespan for the improved
stoves, these figures translate into an IRR of around 29% or higher, showing it is a well-justified
alternative, at least in an urban environment.

34. Substitution of fuelwood by LPG. This component of the project was oriented towards
millet beer manufacturers (the “dolotières”), who are the largest consumers of fuelwood within
the cities. Information gathered during the ICR mission from a visit to a manufacturer yielded

the following information: before conversion, a brewing would require around 9,000F ($18) of
fuelwood (around 180kg), whereas after conversion a brewing required about 1½ LPG cylinders
(12.5 kg for each cylinder). LPG costs therefore amount to $10.7 per brewing, thereby
generating savings of around $7 per brewing (around 10 brews per month). Equipment
conversion costs amounted to around $400. For a single enterprise, over 4 years this yields an
IRR of 17%, in addition to externalities associated with the prevention of deforestation. These
figures provide a justification for the initiative, which was confirmed during the ICR mission
by the satisfaction of the dolotière entrepreneur with the arrangement.

         Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

1.      The completion report for the EAP was prepared by UER in January 2015. It provides
a thorough documentation regarding project indicators, costs and financial aspects, including
procurement questions. The following sections summarize the relevant conclusions reached by
the borrower and included in the report.

Overall project evaluation

2.     Relevance. The EAP as a whole is deemed relevant as its objectives are in line with
national priorities outlined in the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable
Development document and defined in the Energy Sector Policy document and the action plan
adopted in October 2013.

3.      EAP is relevant as it meets an important need in terms of access to services of electrical
energy given the coverage rate of 40% in urban areas and 4% in rural areas in 2013, which is
among the lowest in the sub-region. Added to these weaknesses, there is the deficit in the supply
of electric power and the very high costs of access.

4.       Thus, the EAP in its planning and implementation efforts focused on access to energy
services. Despite the higher costs due to inflation and the delay in starting Component 2
activities, budget reallocations and extensions of the project closing date have allowed the
achievement of the initial objectives of the project. These included the number of serviced
locations, households and community and administrative infrastructure connected, the number
of improved stoves distributed, and the number of jobs and income generated by forest
management activities. In view of the foregoing, the EAP can be considered highly relevant.

5.      Efficiency. Unit costs of long distance electricity lines for connecting isolated centers
by SONABEL were between 8 and 10 million FCFA / km for MV lines and 6 million FCFA
francs per kilometer on average BTA lines including connection costs.
These unit costs are similar and even slightly lower unit than those of projects being
implemented by the EDF and SONABEL with other funds. This demonstrates the efficiency of
the project on the achievements made. This is essentially a row the high level of competition in
procurement and the diversification of supply areas for equipment.

Efficacy:
       • SONABEL component. This component was executed and it reduced production
          costs in Dédougou, Gaoua, and Boromo, and it also increased the profitability of the
          Bobo-Dioulasso to Ouagadougou connection put in service in December 2009. At
          30 April 2014, the number of households connected by SONABEL was 94,073,
          representing a completion rate of 109.93%. Taking advantage of the extension of
          the closing date of the technical activities to 31 October 2014, 33,189 additional
          households were connected bringing the total to 127 262 households as of 31
          December 2014, a rate of 148.72% of accomplishment.




                                               44
       •   Rural electrification component. Despite the constraints which caused a delay of
           more than three years in the development of electricity infrastructure and therefore
           the connection of users, the component “Increased access to electricity services in
           urban, peri-urban and rural zones” as a whole, achieved satisfactory results. Indeed,
           this component has greatly contributed to increasing and improving access to
           services of electrical energy, including households, community infrastructures, and
           administrative and recreation facilities. The sustainability of the facilities is assured
           through the organization of 92 cooperatives and private sector groups in the targeted
           communities.

       •   Forestry component. The results of this sub-component are considered satisfactory
           in terms of achieving the goals of forest surface under management. However, the
           process of forest management was not completed in certain forests, including:
                  o the delimitation of certain older forests with terminals and signs and
                      proofreading fronts management plan projects for some ancient forests,
                  o the realization of biophysical studies, development fronts management
                      plan projects for new forests,
                  o the capacity building in the implementation of different management
                      techniques, rules of logging, direct seeding, enrichment planting, fire
                      management, etc.

6.      One of the goals of the participatory forest management is the creation of seasonal jobs
in rural areas but this has not been fully achieved since the entire development process has not
been completed in all the forests. These activities will be continued with alternative sources of
funds, and a plan for residual activities has been completed.

       •   Energy efficiency and inter-fuel substitution component.
                 o At mid-term the initial objective of improved stoves was reduced. In
                     2013 a dissemination and monitoring strategy was put in place; improved
                     stoves were disseminated through seven regional fairs and support to
                     promoters, an NGO, and a private enterprise. The results of this
                     component have certainly been achieved, but are considered moderately
                     satisfactory because of the very long process to implement them.
                   o Regarding energy substitution twenty gas installations for millet beer
                     production were put in place to replace wood-burning facilities.
                     Choosing the purveyor was delayed but the activities were executed
                     before closure.
                   o The bioenergy sub-component included two technical studies for the
                     production of bioenergy and terms of reference for pilot projects. Given
                     the delay in the implementation of the recommendations of the studies
                     that have advocated the establishment of three (3) pilot projects for
                     biofuel production, equipment were acquired and transferred back to
                     three (3) promoters of the Jatropha sector. Similarly, building human
                     resource capacity of the promoters was made to equip in the matter.


                                                45
       •   Institutional strengthening component. This included physical elements (office
           and field equipment) and human capital (planning, M&E) that benefitted 346 agents,
           which helped in better execution of their activities.

General conclusions

7.      The project effectively contributed to the achievement of the goals reflected by the level
of indicators on number of households and localities electrified and in areas of forest placed
under management. Indeed, the implementation of the EAP has enabled:
        • A favorable environment for the development of an energy sector strategy;
       •   An increase in electricity supply of urban, peri-urban and rural populations through
           the execution of production and transmission infrastructure and the extension of
           electricity distribution networks;
       •   Strengthening the capacities of the Ministry of Mines and Energy and those
           associated with the Environment and Sustainable Development;
       •   Conducting a dissemination strategy of improved stoves that will be a reference for
           future action in the field;
       •   Developing, with the local population and the local authorities, a new vision for
           sustainable management of forest resources;
       •   The support of efforts of GOBF in the growth and expansion of services of electrical
           energy and the reduction of poverty.

8.      Shortcomings include cost increases which reduced the potential coverage of electricity
services in target zone, and the non-implementation of a differentiated kWh price to benefit
rural areas.

Performance:

       •   Bank performance. The overall assessment of the work of the World Bank is
           considered satisfactory because supervision missions and the substantial increase in
           the threshold for review of tender documents have helped greatly improve the
           management of the project. However, it was noted that the processing time of
           procurement records, subject to a priori review, have been shortened but are still
           relatively long.

       •   Government performance. The performance of the Government of Burkina Faso
           is considered satisfactory because from the start of the project, the conditions for
           credit effectiveness were all made on time. Similarly, although not foreseen in the
           financing agreement, measures have been taken to recruit forty eight (48) support
           staff in forest management activities and mobilize financial resources for their
           wages. Also financially, the GOBF took an important measure by the introduction
           of an electrification development tax (TDE) exclusively for investment in electricity
           infrastructure in rural areas. It is also appropriate to acknowledge the effort made
           by the GOBF by granting a subsidy on fuel used for electricity production in isolated

                                               46
    centers on the one hand and on the other to harmonize the kWh prices in rural areas
    with those of the perimeter of SONABEL as well as the tax exemption for five years
    on the exploitation of renewable energy equipment. During the life of the project,
    GOBF showed its determination to carry out the project through the mobilization of
    technical and financial partners of the sector through several meetings for
    consultation and the development of strategic policy documents. It is in this sense
    that a sectoral policy document was adopted in October 2013 together with a three-
    year action plan. Finally, all government departments have been actively involved
    and played their part in the direction of the project. However, It should be
    emphasized that the systemic superposition of national procurement procedures
    with those of the World Bank was a factor in lengthening the approval times of
    different project components.
•   Steering committee. The performance of the Steering Committee was satisfactory.
    It held the two annual statutory sessions for approving activity programs and activity
    and financial reports. The Steering Committee sessions also helped to provide
    guidance and make recommendations for the implementation of the EAP activities.

•   DGE. Insufficient staff committed to monitoring the EAP was an impediment to
    the realization of technical activities for which it was responsible. Indeed, the
    activities of the sub-component "promotion of energy conservation and alternative
    energy" experienced more than three years of lethargy which led to the revision of
    the key indicator in the mid-term. Ultimately, the performance of DGE is considered
    moderately satisfactory in terms of physical targets that could only be achieved by
    means of the last extension of the project closing date.

•   SONABEL. The performance of SONABEL is considered satisfactory. Despite
    the high mobility of agents of the technical structure in charge of conducting the
    activities of the EAP, the rate of implementation was satisfactory. The monitoring
    mechanism is functional, but improvements will be necessary to disaggregate the
    monitoring indicators relative to the number of consumers specifically stemming
    from EAP investments. Recovering from the unexpected high cost tender result,
    long response times to requests for validating and approving procurement, and the
    environmental component in urban areas affected the performance of SONABEL.
    This factor will be taken into account in future projects.

•   FDE. The performance of the FDE is considered Satisfactory. The rate of physical
    implementation was achieved thanks to the budgetary reallocations. The assessment
    tracking service is functional but there are difficulties associated with certain
    cooperatives that do not allow provide operating statistics.

•   DGFF and DREDD. The DGFF and DREDD benefited from a relatively large
    strengthening in human resources through the implementation of activities for which
    they were responsible. Despite this increase, the activities were slow due to
    institutional constraints. It should be stressed that recruited staff is near their contract
    term, and most have already resigned. This leaves weak structures with a moderately


                                          47
           satisfactory performance, despite the achievement of objectives, because of the
           current lack of accompanying measures after the project.

       •   UER. The UER played its role despite institutional constraints that emerged in the
           implementation of certain activities and fiduciary management. The quarterly
           activity reports, financial monitoring reports, audit reports of annual financial
           statements and the reports of the Steering Committee sessions were delivered on
           time. The recommendations of the different control missions were monitored and
           thanks to the experience of staff and rigorous adherence to procedures, the project
           achieved its objectives. The performance of the UER is considered satisfactory.

Lessons learned

   •   Subsidies for the initial investment enabled a large number of the rural population to
       access electricity service. The support of the people for the electrification of their
       locality through cooperatives shows that, despite their limitations, they have greatly
       facilitated the realization and ensured the viability of investments.

   •   Under the implementation of the forest management process, the principle of the project
       to rely on local communities for the execution of the work is a rich experience despite
       the weaknesses identified. This was a lower cost management option that will have a
       significant impact on rural development and poverty reduction.

   •   Budget overruns in tenders for the construction of electricity infrastructure and
       environmental and social issues that have led to delays in the completion of the
       infrastructure indicate that supporting studies should be executed during project
       preparation.

   •   Delays in non-objection approvals due to differences in procurement procedures should
       be addressed by seeking a harmonization of national and Bank procedures.
