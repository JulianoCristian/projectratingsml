satisfactory, risk to development outcome was low, Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and Borrower performance was\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            project implementation can benefit by taking a thorough look\n            at human resources of agencies and their preparation to deal\n            with the critical tasks of tender design, procurement\n            procedures (and the particularities of Bank procurement),\n            and financial management. The delays associated with access\n            projects should be taken into account at appraisal and built\n            into project design by allowing for an initial period of\n            project preparation and information dissemination among\n            potential beneficiaries. Limiting the number of institutions\n            involved in implementation improves the chances for success.\n            Monitoring and evaluation (M and E) design and\n            implementation should be addressed in detail at preparation\n            and early stages of implementation. Planning for a\n            beneficiary survey should be thought out upfront and not\n            just at the time of project closing."}, "docdt": "2015-06-18T13:25:01Z"}
