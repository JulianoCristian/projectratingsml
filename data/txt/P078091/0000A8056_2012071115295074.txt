                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All major contracts have now been signed and disbursements have increased from 14% in November 2011 to 32% in June 2012. The component aimed at increasing access to
                         electricity services in the urban, peri-urban and rural areas has therefore recorded significant progress. Regarding the grid-based extension and reinforcement in urban areas (US
                         $13.1 million), SONABEL has to finalize its strategy for the supervision of the works. Regarding FDE's sub-component (US$13.1), the work for the electrification of 25 communities
                         has been launched. As to the construction of thermal-based mini-grids in 5 communities, the contract is in the process of being signed. For the wood fuels supply management and

                         timetable for the remaining activities need to be established. The procurement process for the production and distribution of improved stoves is advancing and the call for proposal
                         has been made for the acquisition and distribution of 50,000 stoves.
