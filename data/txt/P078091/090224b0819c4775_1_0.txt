                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All major contracts have now been signed and implementation is progressing well. This is reflected in an increased disbursement rate from 32% in June 2012 to 58% in February
                         2013. The component aimed at increasing access to electricity services in urban, peri-urban and rural areas has recorded significant progress. Regarding the grid-based extension
                         and reinforcement in urban areas (US$13.1 million), SONABEL is able to better predict the number of households that will have access to electricity through the signed contracts for
                         Bobo, Ouaga and 12 other cities. Regarding FDE's sub-component (US$13.1), the work for the electrification of 25 communities has been launched and is expected to be finalized
                         by 2013. As to the construction of thermal-based mini-grids in 5 communities, the contract has been signed and the work is expected to be finalized by mid-2013. For the wood fuels

                         distribution of improved stoves is advancing and the call for proposal has been made for the acquisition and distribution of 50,000 stoves.
