                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All major contracts have now been signed and implementation is progressing well. This is reflected in an increased disbursement rate from 58% in February 2013 to 73% in August
                         2013. The intermediate indicators show that most indicators have been met at the end of 2012 and those for 2013 and 2014 are on a good track. The component aimed at
                         increasing access to electricity services in urban, peri-urban and rural areas has recorded significant progress with access to electricity in 81 communities (55 through SONABEL and
                         26 through FDE). For the wood fuels supply management and inter-fuel substitution initiative component ($US 6.7 million), progress is also recorded in the implementation of the
                         action plan for household energy activities, and the number of hectares under community-based wood energy management is likely to exceed 441,000 ha as 272,309 ha have been

                         the call for proposals has been made for the acquisition and distribution of 50,000 stoves. The Bank is urging the client to accelerate the implementation of this activity to ensure its
                         finalization before the project closing date.
