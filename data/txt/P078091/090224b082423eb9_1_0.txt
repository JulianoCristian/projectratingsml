                         Implementation Status Overview
                         All major contracts have now been executed. This is reflected in an increased disbursement rate from 58% in February 2013 to 91% in April 2014. The current disbursement rate has
                         strengthened project performance with a satisfactory status on IP in view of satisfactory progress.

                         The results indicators show good progress. The component aimed at increasing access to electricity services in urban, peri-urban and rural areas has recorded significant progress
                         with access to electricity to more than 46,000 households for SONABEL and more than 16,000 for FDE. For the wood fuels supply management and inter-fuel substitution initiative

                         component (US$6.7 million), progress is also recorded in the implementation of the action plan for household energy activities. The objective of reaching 441,000 hectares under
                         community-based wood energy management has already been surpassed with 547,802 hectares under community-based wood energy management. The subcomponent aimed at
