They\n            include the following: Resettlement scheme will be prepared\n            for project affected persons. Industrial and commercial\n            suffering economic loss will be provided compensation and\n            relocated according to Chinese and local laws. Land use\n            plans will minimize the reduction of land used for\n            cultivation. Those affected by land acquisition will be\n            compensated according to Chinese regulations. Cleaning up\n            the site, refilling the topsoil, and collecting manure and\n            using fertilization will alleviate soil infertility.\n            Temporary ditches will be built to control problems caused\n            by destroyed irrigation and drainage works. A temporary\n            passage will be built to replace destroyed farm roads.\n            Temporary detours and bridges will be constructed to\n            re-route traffic on roads, bridges, and riverways. A sand\n            sink pool will alleviate river pollution. The project will\n            adhere to a discharge standard to prevent water pollution.\n            To minimize noise, construction will not operate at night\n            within 200 m of residential areas and a sound barrier will\n            be erected. Waste will be disposed of according to a\n            disposal plan and will be prevented from release onto\n            farmland or into rivers, channel ponds, etc. Waste will be\n            used to fill up the base of a newly-built building or for\n            some other project."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
