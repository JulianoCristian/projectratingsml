The\n            objectives of the RAP are to improve, or at least restore\n            living conditions of the project affected people (PAP),\n            including their prevailing income levels, and, provide\n            vulnerable groups with preferential policies in housing, and\n            employment opportunities. Land, and/or housing compensation\n            will be in the form of either cash (based on real estate\n            market values), or relocation based on equal value for the\n            exchange of property housing. Leased residential housing\n            will be negotiated based on a rental amount formula, while\n            public-owned leased housing will be at the Government\n            regulated rental rate. Non-residential housing, businesses,\n            and equipment losses will be compensated at replacement\n            costs, with special considerations for equipment\n            depreciation, while compensation for business income losses\n            shall be in accordance with standard regulations. In\n            addition, construction companies should provide assistance\n            in land preparation, in accessing credit, and in providing\n            training assistance for new job opportunities. Vulnerable\n            groups will be assisted to improve their living conditions,\n            while involuntary resettlement will be regarded as an\n            integral part of project implementation. Public awareness,\n            and consultations with PAPs were part of the process, as\n            well as grievance mechanisms to redress potential\n            resettlement issues."}, "docdt": "2002-04-29T00:00:00Z"}
