       Environment Project for China were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: to achieve significant sustainable impact\n            of environmental infrastructure improvements and addressing\n            complex policy issues in a major city, strategic planning,\n            consistency in implementation, and time for evolution is\n            required. Early project implementation demonstrated the\n            importance of doing site visits as part of feasibility\n            studies/design to prevent unforeseen complications\n            (surprises) on the ground at implementation stage. The\n            deletion of one sub-component in the project is a reminder\n            that in situations where there is a risk of significant\n            delay in loan negotiation or effectiveness, it may be more\n            effective for a borrower to exclude very urgent investments\n            from the project scope and instead implement them with other\n            funding, if possible. At locations where traffic impacts\n            were significant, the contractors were required to use\n            pipe-jacking techniques to alleviate traffic problems."}, "docdt": "2010-09-29T00:00:00Z"}
