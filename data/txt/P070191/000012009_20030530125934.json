Environment Project\n            aims to support the implementation of urban environment goal\n            of the country's development strategy, and thereby help\n            ensure that economic growth takes place in an\n            environmentally, and institutionally sustainable manner,\n            developing innovative policies, institutional reforms, and\n            financing methods. Project components address: 1)\n            Shanghai's wastewater management, by financing both\n            collection, trunk sewers, pumping stations, wastewater\n            treatment plants, as well as outfall and sludge treatment\n            methods. Collection systems will include either separate\n            wastewater and storm-water collection systems, or combined\n            wastewater systems, that would include a main conveyor to\n            the treatment plant, incorporating full secondary treatment\n            of effluents discharged through existing outfalls, while\n            sludge, and solid wastes will be disposed at selected\n            landfills; 2) urban solid waste management, to establish\n            environmentally cost-effective municipal solid waste\n            management services in urban areas, by adopting user tariffs\n            to ensure cost recovery of municipal services, as well as\n            adopting a market-oriented institutional arrangement for the\n            provision of municipal solid waste management services. On a\n            pilot basis, a set of administrative, and economic\n            market-based instruments to support waste recycling, will be\n            introduced; 3) urban planning, and pilot upgrading, will\n            assist in the planning for institutional, and administrative\n            frameworks, focused on the planning, construction, and\n            management goals for urban infrastructure improvements,\n            implemented in a three-phase adaptable program lending; 4)\n            the Upper Huangpu River catchment environmental management,\n            to improve its environmental management, and protection of\n            its water resources. To this end, support to policy\n            development, and physical investments will be provided ,\n            comprising data collection, analysis of pollution sources,\n            developing policy and investment strategies; and, 5)\n            institutional strengthening, and training, by supporting a\n            range of technical assistance, and capacity building\n            activities in the implementation of agencies supporting the\n            Shanghai Municipal Government."}, "docdt": "2003-05-20T00:00:00Z"}
