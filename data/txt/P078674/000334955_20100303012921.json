outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was moderate, Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            Given the high levels of international assistance for\n            Kosovo, such coordination is necessary to ensure that Bank\n            funded operations add value and avoid placing an unnecessary\n            burden on counterpart institutions. Intensive coordination\n            to ensure synergy with the interventions of key development\n            partners is required. Because of the limited IDA funds, the\n            Project attempted to combine support for three different\n            sectors that were considered as priorities for the country.\n            This weakened the coherence of project design which\n            comprised three rather loosely connected components related\n            to different sectors, and created difficulties for prompt\n            coordination, monitoring and supervision. In small countries\n            with limited lending programs, multi-sectoral projects may\n            be unavoidable. In such cases, more supervision budget is\n            necessary for a complex project. Project management without\n            dedicated project implementation staff can place a heavy\n            burden on civil servants in implementing agencies,\n            especially in view of their limited familiarity with Bank\n            operational procedures. If a decision is made to forgo a\n            free-standing public implementation unit (PIU), some sort of\n            separate project implementation support mechanism is\n            essential in fragile or post conflict environments,\n            especially for multi-sectoral projects involving multiple\n            ministries and implementing agencies. The results framework\n            should be prepared with the Borrower's active\n            participation to improve project design and monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E), not just as a compliance requirement\n            of the Bank."}, "docdt": "2009-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
