The project has\n            three major components. The first addresses cross-cutting\n            problems inpublic expenditure management: budget\n            formulation, budget execution, and procurement, focusing\n            particularly on high-spending ministries. The remaining\n            components support policy and procedural reforms in two key\n            sectors. One ofthese is healthcare, with three\n            sub-components, which will: finance implementation of the\n            family medicine model in four municipalities; test a new\n            system for paying providers; and provide limited training\n            for the Ministry of Health on management, policy development\n            and planning, and communication skills.  The other component\n            concerns transport, which will contribute to improving both\n            the management and use of public expenditure in the\n            transport sector via four sub-components: expenditure\n            allocation, financial sustainability, road safety, and\n            traffic management by the Pristina Municipality."}, "docdt": "2005-06-15T00:00:00Z"}
