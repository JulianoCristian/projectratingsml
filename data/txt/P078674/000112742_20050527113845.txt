A. STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1. Countryandsectorissues

Political andEconomic Developments

1.      Kosovo* i s emerging from a post-conflict environment. At the end of the conflict, in
1999, UnitedNations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1244 authorized the establishment of
the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) as the interim
administration of Kosovo, to be replaced over time with local institutions. The presence of a
large NATO-led international force (KFOR) has provided security.                             GDP, after falling an
estimated 20 percent as a result of the 1998-99 conflict, has begun to grow at an average of 3
percent per annum.* But the situation remains precarious. The issue of KOSOVO'S status                      final
remains unresolved. Government institutions are weak. And recent economic growth has been
driven by donor support, which i s not sustainableand already beginning to fall.

2.      The governance structure in Kosovo i s complex. In 2001, a Constitutional Framework
established the legal framework for the transfer of responsibilities to the Provisional Institutions
of Self Government (PISG) comprised of a President, a 120-member Assembly, and an executive
branch headed by a Prime Minister. The handover has gradually taken place since 2001.
Currently PISG's responsibilities include the provision of education, health, social welfare,
energy, telecommunications, and some forms of transport services. UntilKOSOVO'S                           final status i s
determined, however, UNMIK retains control over the Banking Payments Authority of Kosovo
(BPK), publicly-owned and socially-owned enterprises, customs, and ultimate responsibility for
economic and fiscal matters with the power to veto decisions made by the PISG that it finds
inconsistent with UNSC Resolution 1244.

3.       Under a policy of `standards before status' UNMIK and the PISG are working on a
specific series of reforms aimed at strengthening democratic institutions, protecting minority
rights, and establishing the basis for a market e~onomy.~                    In mid-2005, the UN will review
progress toward these standards. On that basis, the UN will decide an appropriate critical
pathhiming for initiating discussions on Kosovo' final status. Progress in the development of
capable public sector institutions will be a critical factor in that decision.

Macroeconomic Issues

4.       Since the end of the 1999 conflict, there has been a shift away from the policies of the
former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia toward a liberal market policy. The former trade
regime was replaced by a simple regime with no quantitative barriers and initially a single 10
percent tariff rate, followed by a subsequent two-tier tariff rate with a lower 0 percent rate on


  Kosovo is currently under United Nations' interim administration pursuant to United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1244 (1999) o f June 10, 1999 (hereafter referred to as Kosovo).
  All GDPdata are estimates only. Considerable progress has been made on the compilationof economic statistics
but there are still large errors and omissions, difficulty in capturing informal activity, and a lack of fundamental data
such as a recent census and production-basedestimates o f National Income Accounts.

  See UNMIK, "Kosovo Standards Implementation Plan' (March 31,2004).


                                                              1

capital and intermediate goods. The use of foreign exchange was legalized for all domestic
transactions, initially establishing the Deutsche Mark and later the Euro as the local currency.
The Banking and Payments Authority of Kosovo was established to handle domestic payments,
and, inter alia, licensing and supervision of the banking sector. A Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MFE),with responsibility for the Kosovo Consolidated Budget (KCB), and a new tax
systemand administrative structure have also been established.

5.       National Income Account data in Kosovo are weak and largely based on estimates of
household consumption from the Household Budget Surveys and government spending from the
Treasury accounts. The resulting estimates of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are weak and are
prone to considerable revisions as new data becomes available. The latest GDP data indicate that
there has been a recovery of economic activity and positive growth since 2000.4 According to
IMFestimatesreal GDPgrowth, reflecting highlevels ofpublic andprivate investment, reached
approximately 30 percent in 2001 and has since averaged around 3 percent per year. GDP per
capita, at approximately US$400 in 1995, increasedto around an estimated US$780 by 2001 and
over US$lOOOin 2003. Price stability has been achieved, with inflation rates coming down from
double digits at the beginningof the decade to zero inflation in 2003. Despite the slow-down in
the post-conflict reconstruction boom, private sector activity continues to show signs of
recovery, with construction activity exhibiting considerable strength and banking credit more
than doubling ineach of the last three years.

6.       The external financial position has also improved markedly since 2000. The current
account deficit (before foreign assistance) has fallen dramatically in the last three years from
almost 80 percent of GDP to 50 percent of GDP in 2004, primarily due to an improvement inthe
merchandise trade balance and as a result of a contraction in import^.^ The external situation is
still far from sustainable: the trade deficit in 2004 was about 50 percent of GDP6. Regular
exports have been growing rapidly in the last four years, but from a very low base: merchandise
exports are currently only about 5 to 8 percent of imports.

7.       Prospects for economic growth depend upon the success of two inter-dependent
overarching factors: (i)implementation of a policy program that promotes private sector-led
growth, including completion of the reconstruction effort and export promotion, within a
sustainable macroeconomic framework which will require fiscal prudence; and (ii)                        a resolution
of KOSOVO'S     political status and the maintenance of peace and security in the region.

8.       The key public expenditure management problem facing the PISG is to maintain fiscal
balance in the face of declining donor receipts while improving the quantity and quality of
essential public services. To accomplish this, weak systems of budget formulation, budget
execution, auditing, and procurement need to be strengthened. Institutional arrangements for


 Estimates o f macroeconomic data are based on the IMFand Kosovar authorities estimates concluded in November
2004. The next revision is due following the IMF mission planned for April 2005. Inthe past, these revisions have
resulted not only in new current estimates and future projections, but also to changesto historic estimates.
  It should be noted that there is also considerable uncertainty regarding the accuracy of balance of payments
estimates. Error and omissions have been growing in size and accounted for 49 percent of the current account deficit
in 2003. Given stepped up efforts to stem smuggling, however, it is unlikely that unrecorded trade flows fully
explain accounting discrepancies. The export amounts, infact, include an allowance for smuggling.
 The official trade balance includes sales to expatriates as exports.


                                                           2

fiscal responsibility that are currently `shared' between UNMIK and the PISG must be improved.
To attract and retain high caliber staff, the public sector needs to reform the terms of public
sector employment. Specific sectoral reforms are also urgent. Inthe health sector, spending must
shift toward primary care. Mechanisms for allocating resources to health care providers must be
improved. In the road sector, road user charge policies must be revised and mechanisms for
prioritizing and allocating expenditures on road construction and maintenance, strengthened.

2. Rationale for Bankinvolvement

9.      A number of donors are already providing technical assistance to the PISG in Kosovo.
USAID is providing extensive support to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MFE)
particularly for macroeconomic forecasting, budget formulation, and treasury operations. The
EU, through the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR), is financing major programs of
technical assistanceinpublic investment planning, internal audit, and procurement. But efforts to
improve public expenditure management have largely been confined to the MFE.They have yet
to extend to the sectoral ministries. Moreover, little attention has been directed to policy and
procedural reforms in key sectoral ministries, which are essential to overall improvement in
public sector management. These are areas where the Bank has a clear comparative advantage.
They would be the focus on the Public Expenditure Management Technical Assistance Grant
(PEMTAG).

3. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes

10.     The proposedoperation contributes to a key objective identifiedinthe recent Transitional
Support Strategy (TSS) for Kosovo (April, 2004): building capacity to strengthen economic and
public expenditure management. The project's budget analysis and treasury subcomponents will
improve expenditure management in the MFE. Its budget formulation and procurement
subcomponents will improve expenditure management in key sectoral ministries, The project's
health component will demonstrate a more cost-effective means of providingprimary health care
coupled with testing a new performance-based provider payment mechanism. Its transport
subcomponent will increasethe effectiveness of spending inthe roads sector.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

11.     The proposed project would be structured as an International Development Association
(IDA) Grant. IDA grants to international organizations are permitted under the Association's
Article of Agreement. Kosovo i s not a member of the Bank Group, and i s therefore not eligible
to borrow from the Association. In accordance with the recently approved TSS, the project i s
proposed to be funded through an IDA Grant which will be provided to UNMIK (the Recipient)
for the benefit of Kosovo.

Project development objectives and key indicators

12.     The project's development objective i s to improve the PISG's ability to use public
resourcesmore effectively, efficiently and transparently through strengthenedpublic expenditure

management. The project's impact on budget formulation in key sectoral ministries will be
measured by comparing the budget priorities of UNMIK and the PISG, as indicatedinthe M F E ' s
initial budget circular, to the subsequent budget submissions of the sectoral ministries. Its impact
on procurement will be measured by counting the number of external audit findings of material
violations o f procurement rules. The project's impact on healthcare will be measured by the
number of patients registered with family medicine practitioners and the proportion of medical
workers' income derived from incentive payments in the demonstration municipalities. Its
impact on road management will be measured by counting the number of staff trained in the use
of expenditure prioritization software and the number of traffic counters installed. (The latter
provide the detailed data necessary to prioritize spending on roads.)

2.     Project components


13.        The project has three major components. The first addresses cross-cutting problems in
public expenditure management: budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement,
focusing particularly on high-spending ministries. The remaining components support policy and
                                                                   procedural reforms in two key sectors. One of
                                                                   these is healthcare where the combined effects of
                                                                   neglect, ethnic conflicts, and chaos after the break

                                                                   The other i s transport, which has emerged as a key
                                                                   to KOSOVO'S        economic integration with the rest of
                                                                   Europe.

                                                                    14.       As shown in Table 1, cross cutting public
                                                                   expenditure management reforms account for 40

further 21 percent and 35 percent of grant resources respectively.

Public ExpenditureManagement

15.        The public expenditure management component o f the project consists of three
subcomponents: budget formulation, budget execution, and public procurement. Each
subcomponent has been designed to complement large-scale ongoing programs supported by
other donors, particularly EAR and USAID. As a result, few o f the sub-components are free-
standing.         While other donors have welcomed Bank engagement in these areas, close
coordination will be crucial. Table 2 demonstrates how World Bank assistance will complement
the work of other donors.

17.     Budget Formulation. While substantial support is being provided by international
advisers to the central institutions involved in the budget process (including particularly the
MFE)the quality of budget submissionspreparedby line agenciesis poor. Submissions are well
outside initial ceilings provided by the MFE and are unrelated to agreed policies and priorities.
Within the MFE, the budget department lacks the capacity to analyze and challenge budget
users' proposals in any depth. This component of the project would focus on two major areas of
budget formulation. The first would be a consultancy and training program to build capacity in
budget preparation in the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and Communications and
Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. The second would focus on buildingcapacity among the
budget analysts in the Ministry of Finance, including the counterparts of the same major line
ministries. Both tasks would be carried out by long-term and local consultants with specific
knowledge inthese fields as well as inbudget preparation and analysis.

18.     Budget Execution.          With the recent decline in KOSOVO'Sreserves and its shift to
                                                                               cash
cash-based appropriations, cash management skills have become increasingly necessary. This
component would finance technical support to the PISG's fledgling cash management unit.
Assistance is also required to improve the quality of financial information produced by the line
ministries. The project would therefore finance the drafting of a set of comprehensive written
proceduresfor bookkeeping, accounting and financial reporting.

19.     Procurement.               With EAR support, and on the basis of World Bank and other
recommendations,the PISG will amend the recently-enacted Law on Public Procurement (LPP).


                                                        5

EAR is also financing the drafting of the law's implementing secondary legislation and plans to
finance a series of training courses to support their implementation. But one-on-one mentoring
by experienced procurement specialists will be required to ensure that the new procurement
system i s implemented as intended. In cooperation with the EAR, the project will therefore
finance international consultants to work with local counterparts.

Health Sector Reforms

20.      The transport and health ministries, as major spending entities, will be targets of
assistance in budget formulation and procurement. As noted in the Kosovo Transitional Support
Strategy (TSS), additional support i s warranted.

21.      Reforms in the health sector would focus on the introduction of the family medicine
model. A major source o f inefficiency in KOSOVO'S     health care system is its reliance on queuing
to ration access and its excessive use of secondary and tertiary facilities. Inprimary health care,
no system of scheduled appointments exists. And because primary care physicians are trained in
a narrow range of fields, referrals to more expensive secondary and tertiary facilities are
common, imposingcosts on boththe health care system and on patients.

22.      The PISG intends to address this problem by introducing the family medicine model of
primary care. Under this approach, patients would register with an individual doctor o f their
choice who would become the primary point of contact in the heath care system. These doctors,
in turn, receive training in a broad range of primary health care fields, limiting the need for
referrals. Although the EAR and the Finnish Government have financed an extensive training
program in family medicine, trainees return to their former organizational environment. As a
result, the model has yet to take hold. Family doctors and nurses have the mandate but not the
incentive to adopt the family medicine approach.

23.     The Health Component would have three sub-components: The first sub-component
would finance implementation of the family medicine model infour municipalities. Itwould
include support to: (i)an initial review of legislation to remove any legal obstacles to the
implementation o f the family medicine model; (ii)   technical assistance to assist municipal health
departments inorganizing doctors and nurses into teams and setting up systems for making
appointments (micro organizational changes); (iii)   the development of guidelines, protocols and
standards for family medicine teams and for disease management and disease prevention for
practical use inprimary health care, (iv) a media campaign to inform the public about the family
medicine reform and encourage patients to register with a doctor of their choice; and (v) a study
tour to a country inECA where family medicine has been implemented successfully.

24.     A second sub-component would test a new system for paying providers. Although
doctors and nurses would continue to be municipal employees and be paid a basic salary, a
performance-based payment mechanism would be established for specific treatments in
accordance with an agreed program of work for family medicine teams, providing a financial
incentive to improve patient care at the primary level and reduce unnecessary referrals. This
sub-component would also review relevant legislation to identify any legal obstacles to the
implementation of performance-based payments. Training will be provided in the essentials of
the new payment system for the Health Care Commissioning Agency, other staff, and



                                                  6

participating providers. Incollaboration with the U.K.'sDepartment for International
Development (DFID),the health component would also include a third sub-component to
provide limitedtraining for the Ministry of Health on management, policy development and
planning, and communication skills.

TransportSector Reforms

25.     Long-standing neglect of maintenance and the conflict in 1999 have had a deleterious
impact on KOSOVO'S    road network. Road maintenance has been persistently under-funded, while
funds are exhaustedon new works, some of which are not economicallyjustified. The poor road
network i s hampering the internal integration of Kosovo and could, potentially, isolate Kosovo
from regional trade flows. Traffic congestion in the main cities and at the border crossing with
FYRMacedonia is also a problem.

26.     The PISG's immediate strategy for the roads sector is to rehabilitate most of the damaged
parts of the road network and reduce the road maintenance backlog as soon as possible. The
long-term strategy i s to build institutions which will be capable of administering and managing
the road network in an efficient and effective manner. To support the PISG's objectives, this
component of the proposed project will contribute to improving both the management and use of
public expenditure inthe transport sector. It will have four sub-components.

27.     Expenditure allocation. The first would facilitate the prioritization of recurrent and
capital expenditures within the road sector and involves the provision of technical assistance to
review and strengthenthe current RoadInformation Database (RID), including the incorporation
of new traffic data and road condition data, the latter collected by a bump integrator to be rented
by the MTC from their own resources.             This would include a review of the current
responsibilities and organizational structures for the operation and management of the RID,
together with training in the use of network expenditure optimization software (HDM4). To
provide basic data on current traffic levels, the project would also finance the purchase of
automatic traffic counters to measure traffic on the network.           (Under the public sector
management component of this operation, technical assistance would also be provided to
strengthen the budget application process within the MTC.) This component would also produce
an assessment of the current expenditure priorities on the primary and secondary road network,
at a network level.

28.     Financial sustainability.       Second, the project would finance the development of a
detailed action plan to implement some of the key recommendations of the recent road user
charges study: first, the introduction of a general increase in fuel duty of 6 and 8 Euro cents per
liter on leaded and unleaded gasoline and diesel, respectively; second, to design and implement
an appropriate transit fee regime, consistent with EUrequirements as manifest in, inter alia, EU
Directives 1999/62/EC and COM 2003/448, to ensure that international transit traffic pay a
charge that reflects the cost of their actions; and finally, to review, and recommend changes in
the current scale and structure of road user charges, more generally, to ensure that the fees all
vehicle classes pay covers the damage to the roadinfrastructure that resultedfrom their actions.

29.     Road safety.    Third, the project would finance: (a) technical assistance to assist in the
identification of `black spots' and appropriate remedial actions based on international best



                                                 7

practice; (b) a review of the recently-produced manual on road design to ensure that it i s
consistent with best practice on safe road design principles; (c) technical assistance for the
establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Road Safety Council; (d) technical assistance to develop
capacity in the area of road accident reconstruction, a skill entirely missing at present. The
project would also finance the purchaseof suitable software for an Accident InformationSystem,
together with establishment and training.

30.     TrafJic management by Pristina Municipality.         This sub-component of the project
would finance technical assistanceto improve traffic management capacities and practices in the
Municipality of Pristina, including junction design, traffic signals, road markings, pedestrian
policy and practices, and improvements in parking policy, capacities and revenue. In addition,
this component would finance a few defined high priority traffic managementmeasures(signage
and traffic signals), the purchase of appropriate software, and the collection of necessary data, to
establish a tactical traffic assignment model, and a review of both current road investment plans
inthe area, and an assessment of the need and scope of an `urban outreach unit' inthe MTC, to
disseminatebest urban transport policy andpractice.

3. Lessons learned and reflected inthe projectdesign

31.     Recent sectoral and country reviews of World Bank assistance by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) have concluded that support for institutional development (ID)
efforts has been largely ineffective. (See OED, Evaluating Public Sector Reform, 2001.) It
argues that such efforts to improve public management systems were compromised, inter alia,
by a pattern of underinvesting in governance sector work (or ignoring it during project
preparation), a bias toward supplying capacity inputs (such as training and equipment) before
reforming governance structures, and weak coordination among donors which led to duplication
and an improper sequencingof reforms.

32.     These lessons are largely reflected in the project design. The public sector management
components of the project were identified on the basis of extensive recent sector work, including
the Kosovo Economic Memorandum (2004), Operational Procurement Review (2004),
Operational Financial Accountability Review (2004) and the IMF's Preliminary Findings on
Budget Processes (2004). Preparation of the PEMTAG also coincides with an ongoing Bank
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR). While the Bank has not undertaken sector
work in the health or transport sectors, both components reflect extensive prior sector dialogue
and close collaboration with other donors to ensure complementarities of activities. The health
sector component was identified on the basis of policy dialogue in connection with the Bank-
financed Education and Health Project (2000). The transport component, similarly, reflects
earlier discussion in connection with the preparation and implementation of the Urgent Road
Project (2000).

33.     The project's technical assistance, training, and equipment financing follow from broader
reforms in legislation and governance. Technical assistance for budget formulation follows the
enactment of the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability in May 2003.
Training in procurement will occur only after the revisions to the 2004 procurement law and its
implementing regulations are in place.        The health component i s aimed at improving the
governance structure itself; training having already been provided by other donors. There are,



                                                  8

however, underlying structural issues that lie beyondthe reach of this project. These include the
complex budget formulationprocess and respective roles of UNMIK andthe PISG.

34.    The problem of donor coordination has been addressed by deliberately designing the
project to focus on gaps in other donor assistance.          Thus USAID's support for budget
formulation in the Ministry of Finance will be complemented by the project's support for budget
formulation in key line ministries. EAR's support for revisions in procurement legislation will
be complemented by the project's mentoring program. EAR's support for family medicine
training will be complemented by the project's support for the actual implementation of the
family medicine PHC strategy and health financing reforms.

4. Alternativesconsideredand reasonsfor rejection

35.     Previous Bank support for public sector management reforms in Kosovo has taken the
form of adjustment grants.        There have been three of them; each based on up-front
conditionality.   (A fourth, in 2002, was solely aimed at private sector development.)        The
Implementation and Completion Reports (ICRs) on these operations are positive. Up-front core
conditions were consistently met. Most supporting legal and policy actions have also been
carried out. But experience suggests that conditionality alone i s not a sufficient means of
addressing the fundamental capacity constraints on public sector management in Kosovo. On-
the-job mentoring will be required to inculcate improvements in budget formulation and
procurement in the line ministries, as well as the system for expenditure evaluation in the
transport ministry. Hands-on technical assistance will be required to implement the family
medicine concept in the health sector. For this reason, the project is designed as a technical
assistancegrant, rather than an adjustment operation.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

36.     Overall responsibility for each of the three components will be assignedto its respective
implementing ministry: Economy andFinance, Health, and Transport and Communications.
Each implementing ministry will designate a high-levelrepresentative to serve on a Project
Steering Committee which will be responsible for monitoring progresson the project as a whole
and for resolving inter-ministerial disputes.The Ministry of Public Services and the Ministry of
Labor and Social Policy, as participants inthe public sector managementcomponent of the
project, will also appoint highlevel representatives to the steering committee. UNMIKPillar IV
will also be represented.The Committee will meet on a quarterly basis or more frequently if the
need arises. The assistant to the permanent secretary of the MFE will act as the steering
committee's secretariat.

37.     Each of the three implementing ministries will also appoint a Project Supervisor who will
be responsible for monitoring overall progress on its respective component of the project. (The
ministries' representatives on the Steering Committee may serve in this capacity.) The project
supervisor will be assisted by a project administrator who will be responsible for drafting terms
of reference, technical specifications for goods; drawing up shortlists, participatingin evaluation




                                                  9

committees and contract negotiations, facilitating the work of consultants, and approving
payments after checking the quality andquantity of work undertaken.

38.     Procurement will be carried out by each of the three implementing ministries, under the
supervision and with the advice of the Public Procurement Agency (PPA). The PPA has agreed
to provide such assistance to the line ministries. A start-up procurement consultant will be hired
using project funds to assist the PPA inthis regard.

39.     With respect to large value consulting contracts (those requiringprior review of the Bank
as specified in Annex 8) and the procurement of goods under ICB (including large value
shopping), PPA will act as an internal procurement agent of the implementing ministries.
Implementing ministries will be responsible for preparing draft TORs, Expression of Interest
Notices, and technical specifications (in the case of goods) with the advice and supervision of
PPA. Both the PPA and the implementing ministry will participate in the committee that will
evaluate technical and financial proposals (and bids in case of goods). Both will also participate
incontract negotiations. The PPA will draft the RFP contracts for each package. The respective
implementing ministry will sign the contract and will be responsible for ensuring that the
contract i s implemented effectively.

40.     With respect to small value consultancy contracts, the respective implementing ministry
will be responsible for drafting TORs and preparing short-lists of consultants and firms and with
limited assistance from the PPA to carry out the subsequent procurement activities. Ministries
will also handle small value shopping contracts for goods with the advice of the PPA. Both the
PPA and the ministry will participate in evaluation committees and contract negotiations. The
implementing ministry will sign the contract basedon standarddraft to be given by the PPA and
will be responsible for ensuring that the contract i s implemented.

41.     Financial management activities will be performed by the Grants Unit in the MFE,with
the participation of the relevant implementing ministry. The implementing ministries will be
responsible for checking the quality and quantity of work carried out against contracts, issuing
payment orders, and producing disbursement documentation.            The MFE/Grants Unit will
approve SOEs and other disbursement documentation and submit them, through UNMIK,to the
Bank.

42.     The MFE will maintain a financial management system acceptable to the Bank. The
project's financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptableto the Bank and
on terms of reference acceptable to the Bank commencing with the accounts for the year ending
December 31,2006. The annual audited statements and audit report will be providedto the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year. The audits will need to be conducted in
accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as issued by the IFAC and on terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank. MFE will maintain acceptable financial management on a
cash basis of accounting including additional commitment information as explained in the
section above on accounting policies and procedures.

2. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomeshesuits

43.     The project's impact on budget formulation in the sectoral ministries will be measured by
comparing the budget priorities indicated in the MFE's initial budget circular, to the subsequent
budget submissions of the sectoral ministries. (In the past, sectoral submissions have greatly
exceeded guidelines provided in the circular.) This is clearly a crude indicator o f improvements
in the quality of budget formulation in the sectoral ministries and in the quality of budget
analysis in the MFE. Nevertheless, an increasing match between the two sets of figures will
indicate that budget users are talung the budget process seriously. The project's impact on
procurement will be measured as the number of external audit findings of material violations of
procurement rules. The project's impact on healthcare will be measured by counting the number
o f patients registered with family medicine practitioners and the proportion o f medical workers'
income derived from incentive payments in the pilot municipalities. Its impact on road
management will be measured by counting the number of staff trained in the use o f expenditure
prioritization software and the number of traffic counters installed. (The latter provide the
detailed data necessary to prioritize spending on roads.)

3. Sustainability

44.     There i s substantial evidence of broad-based political support for the sort of reforms the
project would finance.      As detailed in Annex 2, UNMIK and the PISG have successfully
complied with public sector management reform measures supported by the Bank's Economic
Assistance Grants I,11, and IV. The legislative record i s also reassuring, as witnessed by the
enactment o f the Law on Public Financial Management and Accountability (May 2003) and the
new procurement law. The PISG continues to employ a large number o f external advisors in
senior positions and observes their advice.

45.     This support is motivated in part by strategic considerations: the widespread perception
that the successful resolution of KOSOVO'S    status will require the establishment o f viable public
sector institutions-an  item implicit in the Contact Group's `standards before status' policy. The
PISG's recent decision to embark upon a stabilization-association agreement with the EU
provides a similar impetus for reform, as does the prospect of EUaccession itself.

4. Critical risksand possible controversial aspect

46.     The project confronts three overarching risks.      First, domestic political events andor
heightened tension over KOSOVO'S     political status may distract the PISG, or weaken its resolve to
undertake reforms. This risk is mitigated to some degree by the incentive the PISG has to
continue to make progress against the Standards, so as not to jeopardize the successful resolution
of KOSOVO'S   status and its eventual accession to the EU

47.     A second risk is that the impact of the project's training components will be offset by the
departure of trainees. As noted earlier, the PISG does not offer competitive salaries for high
level staff. This risk will be mitigated by the planned decompression of salaries and b y the
project-supported efforts to improve the recruitment process.             Ironically, the expected
withdrawal o f donors from Kosovo i s likely to improve staff retention, as job opportunities
outside the public sector will diminish.


                                                   11

48.       The third risk i s that the advisors hiredunder the project will fail to provide sound policy
advice or impart their knowledge successfully to permanent Kosovar staff. This has clearly been
a concern in other donor-financed technical assistance in Kosovo, and elsewhere in the region.
The project will reduce this risk in part by explicitly including handover provisions in terms of
reference and requiring the use of local personnel. But, it must mainly be addressedby devoting
sufficient Bank attention, during supervision, to the consultant recruitment process (including
terms of reference, evaluation of individual candidates, and periodic evaluations of
performance).

D. APPRAISALSUMMARY

1. Economic andfinancial analyses

49.     The project is financed as a grant, which the recipient (UNMIK) will pass on to the
Kosovo Consolidated Fund (KCF) for the purposes specified in the project documentation. To
the extent that the grant replaces own-source revenues that would otherwise have been usedfor
these purposes, it will increase the general budgetary resources of the KCF. The public sector
management component may imply eventual increases in certain staff salaries, however, to
prevent the departure of staff once they are trained. As the number of such positions i s small, this
would not have any significant fiscal implications for the KCF as a whole.

50.       The fiscal situation of the KCB itself has fluctuated in recent years. Considerable
progress was made in raising domestic revenues and controlling expenditures in the immediate
post-conflict years. Buoyed by the introduction of new taxes and a post-conflict boom, tax
revenues exceeded rojections. At the same time, public spending was discouraged by certain
budgetary practices. As a result, budget surpluses were achieved in every year until 2004 and a
                         r3
cash surplus of approximately 300 million had accumulated by the beginningof 2003.

                                                                     51.      Growth      in tax       revenues
                                                                     leveled off in 2003 and 2004, while
                                                                    the      constraints     to     expenditure
                                                                     management have             largely  been
                                                                    removed. As a result, the budget
                                                                    recorded a cash deficit of 130
                                                                    million (6.8 percent of GDP) in 2004.
                                                                    The prospects for further growth in
                                                                    the tax base are not encouraging.
                                                                    Between        1999     and      2003   the
international donor community spent an estimated 1.96 billion in Kosovo, while remittances
from the Kosovo diaspora added another 550m per annum over this period. Since 2000, donor
grants have fallen by 70 percent, and are forecast to continue to decline. As a result, over the
next four years, KOSOVO'S          medium term fiscal framework will require an absolute reduction in
general government expenditures from the levels inn 2004. Beginning in 2006, the Government
will have to maintain a balanced budget, using the remaining cash surplus as a liquidity buffer.
The PER, currently under preparation (and due out in gray cover inJune of this year) will assist
the authorities inensuringthat fiscal policy is prudent and that the surpluses accrued to date are
spent in a sustainable way, in line with short and long term priorities. The PER will also identify
numerous contingent liabilities, as yet not explicitly included in the medium term fiscal
framework.




* Budget managers, for example, had no incentive to meet expenditure targets as unused appropriations were
routinely rolled over into the following year appropriation.

2. Technical

52.     The project has been designedon the basis of extensive prior sector work, including the
Kosovo Economic Memorandum (2004), Operational Procurement Review (2004), Operational
Financial Accountability Review (2004) and the IMF's Preliminary Findings on Budget
Processes (2004). Preparation of the project also coincides with the PEIR. The health sector
component was identified on the basis of policy dialogue in connection with the Bank-financed
Education and Health Project (2000). The transport component, similarly, reflects discussion in
connection with the Urgent Roads Project (2000). Project design also reflects extensive
consultations with PISG counterparts, donors, and consultants who have been working in
Kosovo for several years. The scope of the operation has been restricted so as not to overstretch
the implementation capacity of the benefiting organizations. An attempt has also been made to
adjust the degree of sophistication of the reforms to current conditions and absorptive capacity.

53.     The Bank's Operational Procurement Review ( June 2004) identifiedseveral corrective
measures to be taken by the government including the need for simplifying the Law on Public
Procurement( UNMIK Regulation 2004/3 of February 9, 2004) that became effective on June
09, 2004. OPR also recommended: (a) creation of new oversight bodies Public Procurement
Regulatory Commission (PPRC) andPublic Procurement Agency (PPA); and (b) preparation and
use of implementing regulations and Standard Bidding Document; EAR i s assisting PPRC in
these areas as also the training. Discussions were heldduring appraisal both with PPA and PPRC
which havejust started functioning. Substantial work remains to be done to build capacity in
the PPA, the PPRC and major spending institutions to implement public procurement efficiently
and cost-effectively.

3. Fiduciary

54.     The financial management arrangements of the project are acceptable to the Bank. As of
the date of this report, the Recipient i s in compliance with its audit covenants of the existing
Bank-financed project. Current project financial statements and auditing arrangements for the
previous grants managed by MFE are acceptable and it has been agreed that these arrangements
will be replicated for the proposed project. The annual audited project financial statements will
be provided to the Bank within six months of the endof each fiscal year.

55.     An Operational Financial Accountability Report was finalized in November 2004.
Despite significant progress since 2001, public financial management in Kosovo suffers from
fundamental weaknesses, and basic structures for financial accountability are still in their
infancy. The overall legal framework for budgeting and budget management i s largely
compatible with internationally recognized standards, but for some aspects it appears to be too
advanced for the current administration's capacity. Carry-over practices and weaknesses in
capacity, organization and coordination hamper budgetpreparation and undermine the credibility
of the budget as a policy managementinstrument.While treasury and cash management are well-
regulated areas of public financial management, they suffer from inefficiencies. The system
through which Commitment and Payment Orders flow to ensure authorization of payments i s
well regulated. The Treasury authorizes commitments and payments based on proposals and
supporting documentation by budget organizations and municipalities. The Treasury pays from a
single account inthe central Banking and Payment Authority of Kosovo (BPK).


                                                14

56.     As with most public financial management functions, accounting is constrained by
limited capacity, and financial reporting needs more realistic requirements and statutory
deadlines, improved procedures, and trained personnel. Internal control and internal audit at all
levels of government are in their infancy. Considerable time and effort will be required to make
them fully operational. External audit is undeveloped and, as with internal audit, it will need
sustained external support for its development. Specific procedures have been developed by
MFEto secure proper financial accountability of this project.

4. Social

57.    The project takes place in the context of KOSOVO'S    uncertain political status and ethnic
tensions. Improvements in public sector management are perceived to be helpful to a successful
conclusion to the status negotiations. However, prolonged uncertainty carries the risk that ethnic
tensions could spill over, distracting the PISGfrom the reform agenda.

58.    The political economy of the proposed reforms i s typical of governance reforms in
general: the benefits will be diffused among the general population while the costs will be
concentrated on the relatively few who exploit the weaknesses in the existing system. The
procurement reforms, in particular, should lower the costs and improve the quality of public
services, by increasing competition and reducing fraud. But those who benefit from corruption
will suffer. Although winners will clearly outnumber losers under the reforms, the latter are more
likelyto mobilizepolitically.

59.     Reforms in the health sector may also encounter resistance from older, less
entrepreneurial medical staff, who may resist retraining in family medicine and the increased use
of output basedmeasures as a means of determiningcompensation.

5. Environment

60.    The project focuses on management reforms in public administration, along with
procedural reforms in the Ministries of Health and Transport and Communications. It has no
direct environmental impact. The project does not include any major physical rehabilitation or
civil works. The project i s therefore rated as `C'.


6. Safeguard policies

61.    The project triggers no safeguardpolicies.

                       Annex 1: Country and Sector or ProgramBackground


1.       Kosovo i s now emerging from a post-conflict environment. In 1999, UNResolution 1244
authorized the establishment of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK)to provide an interim administration. The presenceof a large NATO-ledinternational
force (KFOR) has provided security. GDP, after falling 20 percent as a result of the 1998-99
conflict, has begun to grow. But the situation i s precarious. There is no resolution of Kosovo's
final status. Government institutions are weak. And recent economic growth has been driven by
donor support and remittances. Both exogenous factors, these external finance flows have
financed domestic consumption and supported the economy since the end of the conflict. The
large current account deficit implies real sector adjustments should there be a sudden or drastic
fall ineither private inflows or foreign assistance.

2.       The governance structure in Kosovo is complex. In 2001, a Constitutional Framework
established the legal framework for the transfer of responsibilities to the Provisional Institutions
of Self Government (PISG) comprised of aPresident, a 120-member Assembly, and an executive
branch headed by a Prime Minister. The handover has gradually taken place since 2001.
Currently PISG's responsibilities include the provision of education, health, social welfare,
energy, telecommunications, and some forms of transport services. Currently, under UNSC
Resolution 1244 and the Constitutional Framework, UNMIK i s responsible for, inter alia, the
Banking Payments Authority of Kosovo (BPK), the administration and oversight of publicly-
owned and socially-owned enterprises, customs, and bears ultimate responsibility for economic
and fiscal matters.

3.       Under a policy of `standards before status' UNMIK and the PISG are working on a
specific series of reforms aimed at strengthening democratic institutions, protecting minority
rights, and establishing the basis for a market economy.' In mid- 2005, the UN will review

  See "KosovoStandards Implementation Plan' (March 31,2004).

progress toward these standards. On that basis, the UNwill decide when and if discussions will
start on Kosovo' final status. Progress in the development of the legal and regulatory framework
and capable public sector institutionswill be a critical factor inthat decision.

4.       The key public expenditure management problem facing the PISG i s to maintain fiscal
balance in the face of declining donor receipts while improving the quantity and quality of
essential public services. To accomplish this, weak systems of budget formulation, budget
execution, auditing, and procurement need to be strengthened. Institutional arrangements for
fiscal responsibility that are currently `shared' between UNMIK and the PISG must be improved.
To attract and retain high caliber staff, the public sector needs to reform the terms of public
sector employment. Specific sectoral reforms are also urgent. Inthe health sector, spending must
shift toward primary care. Mechanisms for health financing and allocating resources to health
care providers must be reformed.        In the road sector, the mechanisms for prioritizing and
allocating expenditures, and capacity to manage the sector more generally, need considerable
strengthening.

5.         Budget formulation. The overall legal framework for budgeting and budget
management is largely compatible with internationally recognized standards. Substantial
progress has been made in institutionalizing the budget process specified in the recent Law on
Public Financial Management and Accountability, although in some respects it appears to be too
complex for the current administration's capacity. One of the principal problems has been the
practice of budgeting on a commitment basis so that funds for multi-year activities were fully
appropriated in advance. The result has been the accumulation of a pool of unused, although
largely committed, funds amounting to about 171 million. One of the main advances during
2004 and for the 2005 budget process has been to move to an annual cash budget, which will
provide a more accurate view of KOSOVO'S situation.
                                              fiscal

6.         While substantial support i s being provided by international advisers to the central
institutions involved in the budget process (including particularly the MFE), the quality o f
budget submissions prepared by line agencies i s poor. Submissions are well outside initial
ceilings provided by the MFE. (Initial submissions for 2005 exceeded 1 billion, despite an
overall resource ceiling of 600 million.) Submissions of line ministries are largely based on
previous years' submissions and are not linked to sectoral priorities and policies. The problem i s
compounded by the previous practice of multi-year appropriations which has generated a sense
of entitlement to resources which will no longer be available.

7.         Within the MFE, the budget department lacks the capacity to analyze and challenge
budget users' proposals in any depth. Until 2003, the number of budget analysts was extremely
small. The department administration was heavily reliant on external assistance funded by a
U S A l D technical assistance project. Although 15 new staff were recruited in 2003, they have had
to be trained from scratch. This weakness is particularly acute in the case of the MFE's capacity
to analyze the Kosovo Trust Agency's requests for transfers to publicly-owned enterprises (POE)
of which the most important is the energy utility (KEK). In 2003 and 2004, subsidies to the
POEs under the KTA amounted to 97 million and 93 million respectively, out of total General
Government expenditure of 544 million in 2003 and 748 million in 2004. While there i s a
clear need to improve the analytic capability of the Budget Department in all sectors, the need i s




                                                  18

particularly great in the case the largest spending ministries, particularly health, transport and
labor and social protection.

8.        Fundamental structural problems in the budget formulation process also exist. The
distinct roles o f the PISG and the UNMIK complicate the budget process. Although the PISG i s
responsible for budget formulation, the SRSG (Special Representative o f the Secretary General)
has the ultimate authority to approve the budget and as such constitutes a `court of appeal' over
the government for budget organizations that are unhappy with their appropriations. This i s most
notable in the case o f the publicly owned enterprises under the KTA. Donor financed capital
works are also excluded from the budget, particularly at the preparation stage. The result i s that
decisions on Public Investment Program (PIP) and non-PIP capital spending are taken separately,
and are thus less likely to be consistent with sectoral and overall government priorities. While the
PEMTAG cannot address these issue directly, solutions to this problem will be proposed under
the ongoing Public Expenditure and Institutional Review.

9.        Budget execution. Budget execution, performed by the Treasury Department, is
relatively efficient and transparent. Once the budget has been appropriated and signed by the
SRSG, line item appropriations are entered into the system. Treasury then allocates quarterly
spending limits for all appropriations. Budget organizations can commit and spend funds up to
the amount of the allocation. The Treasury pays from a single account in the central Banking
and Payment Authority o f Kosovo (BPK). Procedures for bookkeeping, accounting and financial
reporting are not codified, however. Even the central Treasury lacks a manual of procedures
specifying many of the processes and controls that are currently in place.

10.     The Treasury uses a software system (Freebalance) to record commitments and payment
orders. While municipalities are able to enter data on the system, line ministries are not. Instead,
they are required to submit paper copies of commitments and payment orders, which are then
entered into the system at Treasury. This delays budget execution. Until recently, budget
execution was also slowed by the absence of an electronic link between the Treasury system and
the Banking and Payments Authority o f Kosovo (BPK). Improvements are in train. In late 2004,
payment orders began to be transferred from the Treasury to BPK on CDs. (A direct electronic
linkis in the works.) The Treasury is now inthe process of extendingthe electronic payment and
commitment components of the software system to the line ministries. A time bound plan to this
effect was prepared and presented to the PISG in December, 2004. Technical assistance in the
use of the software will be provided by the Canadian and Swedish governments, which have
been working with the Treasury Department in parallel with the USAID contractor.

11.     Until now the existence of a considerable surplus of funds and the pattern of under
spending by sectoral ministries has meant that the cash management function was not critical.
(Although, as noted earlier, this surplus was partly illusory, as it included cash committed to
multi-year projects.) With the shift to cash based annual appropriations and a fiscally constrained
environment, cash management skills will become essential.

12.     Procurement. A new Law on Public Procurement (LPP) was promulgated as UNMIK
Regulation 2004/3 o f February 9, 2004. It addressed many of the flaws in the prior legislation
(Finance Administration Instruction 2/99). Inparticular, it established open tendering as the main
procedure for awarding public contracts and imposes controls over the use of other, less



                                                 19

competitive procedures. The new LPP also providedfor a number of valuable safeguards, which
were designed to make abuses of the procurement procedures more difficult, to improve
transparency in decision-making related to procurement and to ensure that more than one pair of
eyes review transactions in which competition may be restricted to a limited number of bidders.
The Bank, however, has expressedits concern over the complexity of the law and, inparticular,
its call for three separate enforcement agencies: a public procurement regulatory board, a
regulatory authority, and a rules committee. In light of the Bank's and other comments, the
Government i s expected to amend the law. An EAR-financed consultant is now in the final
stages of drafting the amendments.EAR is also financing the drafting of the law's implementing
secondary legislation and intends to finance a training program to support their implementation.
The latter would consist of a series of periodic training courses for staff of the major line
ministries, along with the development of a procurement training module inthe Kosovo Institute
of Public Administration.

13.     To improve transparency and accountability in procurement, Kosovo needs a
management information system to collect and publish information on public procurement. This
could include automated systems for communicating procurement information between the
contracting authorities and key executive and oversight bodies, a public procurement website for
publication of legislation, regulations, standardforms, invitations to bids, contract award notices,
as well as comprehensive information on public procurement operations and performance
measurement statistics. At present, the public procurement agency has a website (www.ks-
gov.net/prokurimi) which contains the procurement law and a very small number of invitations
to bid and notices of contract awards. It falls far short of the public procurement website
envisaged in the Bank's recent Operational Procurement Review. EAR has agreed to fund the
technical assistance required to upgradethe system.

14.     Audit. Internal control, including internal audit i s underdeveloped in Kosovo's public
sector. There is a lack of comprehensive written procedures for financial management and
control processes. Basic control activities, such as reconciliation of accounting and transaction
data from different sources, are not performed. The             central internal audit function was
transferred from the Central Fiscal Authority of UNMIK to the MFE in 2002. Most of the staff
(totaling some 25 staff) in the department have only received very basic training ininternal audit.
Another 75 staff are employed as internal auditors inother ministries and inthe municipalities. A
few of these auditors have producedreports on their individual institutions. The audits performed
are focused on compliance aspects and the checking of certain types of transactions.Both the EU
and the IMF have recommended that the Government give high priority to the development of
intemalfinancial control in all budgetary institutions, along with appropriate capacity building.

15.     The EAR i s currently financing a 1.9 million project aimed at strengthening public
internal financial control and intemal auditing throughout the MFE and other PISG institutions
includingministries. The project, which i s still at its inception stage, will run over a period of 24
months and consists of two components. The first, focused on internal control, will provide for
training and the development of a strategy and regulatory framework for internal control. The
second, focused on internal audit, will provide training for internal auditors and managers.

16.     External audit of the Kosovo consolidated budget i s currently outsourced to the
Netherlands's Court of Audit, which undertook the audits for 2002 and 2003. An Auditor


                                                 20

General's Office was established by UNMIK Regulation 2002/18 "On the Establishment of the
Office of the Auditor General of Kosovo and the Audit Office of Kosovo" of October 4, 2002,
and an Auditor General has recently been appointed, along with a deputy and twenty local
trainees. The plan i s to recruit another 40 trainees in 2004 and 2005.               Funding for the
development of the OAG's audit capacity will be provided from a  2.8 million EAR-financed
grant over aperiodof 44 months.

17.       Public Employment The PISG's ability to improve performance in public expenditure
management--and to prepare for the phase out of external assistance--is constrained by the
difficulty of recruiting and retaining highly skilled local staff. This i s in part due to compressed
pay scales within the public sector. It is also due to competition for skilled employees from the
numerous international organizations present in Kosovo. Slapdash enforcement of the recruiting
procedures specified in the civil service law has resulted in some positions being filled by under-
qualified staff. A significant part of the wage bill i s said to be wasted on overstaffing,
particularly in the municipalities and in support positions in the health ministry. While the
PISG's ability to add staff and increase salaries is subject to severe resource constraints, it is
evident that it could do better.

18.      One avenue for improvement is wage decompression. At present, salaries in senior
technical positions are only about one-fifth of those in equivalent donor-financed positions. A
recent EAR-fundedreview of the pay and grading system recommended a substantial increase in
the spread between wages in senior positions and those at lower levels. This would allow the
PISG to increase top-level wages at a relatively modest cost. (It is estimated that the
recommended strategy would raise the wage bill by about 6-7 percent.) Implementation of the
new system requires the matching of all staff from their existing positions to the appropriate new
grade and pay range. An initial round of matching was undertaken in late 2004, but resulted in a
large number of irregularities. (Each ministry was permitted to grade its own staff, resulting in
some cases, in a highdegree of grade inflation.) The PISGinitially expected to introduce the new
pay and grading system on January 1, 2005. Unexpectedly poor fiscal results from 2004 and a
recognition that the review process was not carried out effectively have since prompted the
Government to postpone the date. It is now scheduledto be introduced on July 1,2005.

19.      At the same time, the PISG could improve its staffing and recruitment procedures.
Although the civil service law lays out a procedure for creating new positions and for recruiting
staff, it appears that it i s observed in the breach, particularly in municipalities. To add positions,
line ministries simply include funding for new positions in their annual budget requests. If
sufficient funding i s available, they can proceed. Municipalities require no prior authorization, as
long as the positions are funded in their budgets. (At its outset, UNMIK did set a cap on
employment for each budgetary organization, but i s not a bindingconstraint-reportedly        because
the cap is high. A temporary freeze on new hiring was imposed in 2003, but only to free up
resources to finance a 20 percent wage increase. The freeze i s no longer in effect.) For 2005,
stricter procedures including clear authorizations for recruitment by the Ministry of Public
Services and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, have been approved.

20.      Ultimately, Kosovo cannot afford to offer competitive salaries unless it reduces
overstaffing. This i s a considerably more ambitious task, requiring a ministry-by-ministry
functional review and analysis of staffing needs. EAR estimates that this would cost 3.5


                                                   21

million. It would also require a program of layoffs and early retirements. This would be
politically difficult, particularly in an environment in which unemployment is already high.
While the MFE i s nominally committed to a rationalization of staffing levels, the broader
political consensus required to successfully carry one out does not exist. The PEMTAGtherefore
includes no funding for such an activity.

21.      Health Sector.           Kosovo inherited a system of publicly financed universal health
care from the former Yugoslav regime. This has now crumbled under the combined effects o f
neglect, ethnic disagreements, and chaos after the break up of the former Yugoslavia.                    A major
source of inefficiency in KOSOVO'S       health care system is its reliance on queuing to ration access
and its excessive use of secondary and tertiary facilities. No system of scheduled appointments
exists. Because primary care physicians are trained in a narrow range of fields, referrals to more
expensive secondary and tertiary facilities are common, imposing costs on both the health care
system and on patients.

22.      The current health financing system, by the same token, provides no incentives for
improved performance. The current flow of public health funds includes two types of
disbursements. Funding for secondary and tertiary care is provided directly by the MOH to
individual facilities on the basis o f inputs (salaries, equipment and supplies, etc.) Funding for
primary health care (PHC) is disbursed to the municipalities, where the Director of Health Care,
in collaboration with PHC providers, is responsible for health care provision. In principle, a
health allocation commission" defines the annual PHC allocation to municipalities based on
population size, a "fair share financing" rule to ensure adequate financing of minority
communities, territorial characteristics, and the number of health facilities in the form of a
specific health financing grant.         In reality, the final amounts are negotiated between the
municipalities and the MFE on the basis of existing facilities and staff and historical input costs.
As a result, neither primary or secondary care providers have an incentive to increase efficiency
or expand provision.

23.      The Government intends to address these problems by introducing the family medicine
model of primary care. Under this approach, patients are encouraged to register with an
individual doctor of their choice who becomes the primary point of contact in the heath care
system. These doctors, in turn, receive training in a broad range of primary health care fields,
limiting the need for referrals. With support from the EAR and the Finnish Government, over
400 doctors have already completed the 2-3 year training program in family medicine. Eight
hundred nurses have also been trained. But because trainees return to their former organizational
environment, the model has yet to take hold. Family doctors have neither the mandate nor the
incentive to adopt the family medicine approach.

24.      To provide the necessary mandates and incentives, the PISG intends to fundamentally
restructure the provision and financing of primary health care, starting in two or three
demonstration municipalities. The reform would have two principal sub-components. The first
would support primary health care restructuring to address sectoral inefficiencies.                     The sub-
component will support the restructuring in demonstration sites of the traditional narrow

majority.

specialist based PHC system into family medicine units that will ultimately have the capacity to
address 80 percent of the municipality health needs, thus significantly reducing the unnecessary
high rate of cases now treated at hospitals. The second would support be the development and
test of a new system for paying providers through a performance-based payment mechanism to
be established for specific treatments in accordance with an agreed program of work for family
medicine teams, providing a financial incentive to improve patient care at the primary level and
reduce unnecessary referrals. (Furtherdetails are included in Annex 4.)

25.     Transport.      Long-standing neglect of maintenance and the recent conflict have had a
significant impact on KOSOVO'S     road network. In addition to bombed bridges and landslides, a
significant part of the network i s still in very poor condition. Road maintenance, now carried out
through contractors, has been persistently under-funded, while funds are exhausted on new
works, some of which are not economically justified. This has resulted in a continuous
deterioration of the road network partially mitigatedby the rehabilitation of the sections financed
by the donor community inthe past four years. The poor roadnetwork is hampering the regional
integration of Kosovo and will keep the country outside of the regional trade flows.

26.     Traffic congestion in the main cities and at the border crossing with FYR Macedonia i s
also a problem. Pristina has experienced explosive growth due to the effects of the Kosovo
conflict. The population of the city has more than doubled over the past decade to over 500,000
persons and now constitutes about a quarter of the total population of Kosovo. As the city i s the
dominant commercial and administrative center of the region, a functioning urban road system i s
crucial to the economy of Kosovo. Traffic safety is also an issue with 900 accidents involving
1,470 injuredand 160fatalities in 2001, according to UNMIK records.

27.     The Government's immediate strategy for the roads sector is to rehabilitate most of the
damagedparts of the roadnetwork and reduce the road maintenance backlog as soon as possible.
The long-term strategy i s to build institutions, which will be capable of administering and
managing the roadnetwork, involvingprimarily the Ministry of Transport and the Department of
Roads. Some initial steps have been taken, including the establishment of a regulatory
framework in line with EU requirements. The Government has also commissioned a study on
road financing (by Roughton Intl.) and a separate study on road safety. Recommendations of
these reports would be supported by the proposedproject.

       Annex 2: Major Related Projects Financed by the Bank and/or other Agencies
                            KOSOVO: Public Expenditure Management

1.     The Bank has financed three adjustment-type grants aimed at improving public sector
management.

    0  Economic Assistance Grant I(US$5.0 million; approved in CYOO; closed) supported
       the creation of a fully functioning budget management system and a bank licensing and
       supervision capability. Under its aegis, the newly-created Central Fiscal Authority (CFA)
       made good progress in designingand implementing the Kosovo budget. The Banking and
       Payments Authority of Kosovo (BPK) was established at the end of 1999, and legislation
       for bank licensing, regulation and supervision then followed.

    0  Economic Assistance Grant I1 (US$5.0 million; approved in CYOl; closed) supported
       the formulation of a sustainable 2001 budget as well as tax and tariff reforms. A basic
       system of border-basedtaxation was established, resulting in a dramatic drop inthe share
       of revenues contributed by donor funding (from 48 percent in 2000 to 21 percent in
       2001). A liberal trade and customs regime was maintained. However, the full elimination
       of tariffs at the time of the introductionof the VAT did not take place because of revenue
       considerations.'    '

    0  Economic Assistance Grant IV (US$5.0 million; approved in CY03; closed) aimed at
       enhancing medium-term macrofiscal sustainability and improving financial management.
       The Kosovo Consolidated Budget for calendar year 2003 was approved by the SRSG.
       The 2004-2006 macro and revenue framework were agreedby the SRSG and usedin the
       development of the 2004 budget. Regulations establishing the Office of the Auditor
       General andthe Audit Office were promulgated andthe Audit Office was established.

2.     Inthe health sector, the Bank has supported an Education and Health Project (US$4.4
million. approved in CYOO), which funded the development of an interim health care financing
strategy, including the identificationof priorities for publicly financed health care, the design and
implementation of a co-payment system, and the development of options for private financing
and private provision of health care. In the roads sector, the Bank supported the Urgent Road
Project (US$5.0 million, plus US$43 million inco-financing; approved in CYOO); closed) which
supported the re-establishment of a road management capacity in the MTC, along with priority
rehabilitation projects.

3.     Other donors have been active in supporting public sector management reform. The
European Agency for Reconstruction supported the development of a uniform salary and grading
system for civil servants and the establishment of the Institute for Public Administration. As
noted in the main text, the EAR i s currently funding revisions to the procurement law and the
drafting of the law's implementing regulations. It plans to finance a series of training courses to
support their implementation later in 2005. EAR i s also financing a 1.9 million, two-year
project aimed at strengtheningpublic internal financial control and internal auditing throughout
the PISG.


  The Bank also financed the Economic Assistance Grant 111.Itfocused on private sector development.


                                                    24

4.     The United States has also been strongly involved in governance activities, including the
provision of technical support for the Ministry of Economy and Finance (in the form of close to
twenty long-term advisors and numerous short-term advisors.) With USAID support, the MFEi s
implementing new budget control procedures at the central and regional levels, including a
computerized treasury ledger system, to ensure transparency and accountability in public
expenditure practices. USAID has also supported the design of a new system of
intergovernmental finance. The system resulted in the formulation of systematic grant policies
andproceduresbasedon expenditure needs for the 2004 budget cycle.

                              Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                         KOSOVO: PublicExpenditureManagement


1.      Budget Fomzulation. This component of the proposed public sector management
technical assistance grant (PEMTAG) would focus on two major areas of budget formulation.
The first would be a consultancy and training program to buildcapacity in budget preparation in
three major line ministries (Labor and Social Welfare, Health and Transport). It would pay for
long-term consultants with specific knowledge of policy and technical issues in the area of each
ministry, in addition to experience in budget preparation. To ensure the transmission of
knowledge to local staff, terms of reference would include specific handover provisions. The
second part would focus on building capacity among the budget analysts in the Ministry of
Finance. This would include the counterparts of the three major line ministries and the
municipalities, as well as the counterpart of the UNMIK-entity responsible for publicly-owned
and socially-owned enterprises, the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA). Again, this work would be
carried out by long-term consultants with specific knowledge in these fields as well as in budget
preparation and analysis, supportedby local consultants.

2.      The project will not attempt to address the budget formulation problems of all the major
spending agencies. Municipalities, for example, account for close to thirty percent of general
government spending (including spendingon education and health) and represent a logical target
for assistance.   Such assistance, however, would be difficult, given the number of such
jurisdictions (30). USAID i s now implementing a Local Government Initiative (LGI) project
which involves placing long-term advisers for three years, in five municipalities (Gjakove,
Gjilan, Podujeve, Shterpce and Suhareke). The LGI will assign a resident municipal consultant
who will work side-by-side with municipal authorities to develop capacities, establish systems,
and provide on-the-job training while addressing real community challenges. The LGI will also
assist in improving the legislative framework for local governance and refining and clarifying the
roles and responsibilities of municipal governments. Given the extent of USAID's efforts and the
limited resources available under the PEMTAG, municipalities are excluded from the proposed
operation

3.      The project will also give short shrift to the major publicly owned enterprises (POEs),
except for the loss making power-company KEK.KEK, along with other publicly- and socially-
owned enterprises, i s administered by the KTA, an UNMIK established entity. This arrangement
has not worked harmoniously in the past, particularly when KCB budgetary resources have been
required to assist the financially ailing company. In August 2004 a foreign private utility
company was contracted to operate KEK. It i s required, inter alia, to prepare a medium term
business plan for the utility and to achieve certain performance benchmarks. This is expected to
reduce KEK's claims on the KCB budget. Funding is nevertheless included in the PEMTAG to
assist inthe analysis of KEK's annual budgetsubmissions.

4.      A second component of the proposed project would aim at strengthening the capacity of
the Ministry of Economy and Finance to analyze the submissions of major budget users. This
would focus on the counterparts of the main spending ministries, the municipalities and the
KosovoTrust Agency (KTA).



                                                29

5.        The costs of the two components is estimated at  935,000. This would finance:

e    eight consultant-months of international consulting servicesI2 and 24 consultant-months of
     local consulting services to each of the three major spending ministries to assist in
     developing budget submissionslinked to policy priorities and strategies;

e    24 consultant-months of international consulting services and 72 consultant- months of local
     consulting services to assist the Ministry of Economy and Finance in analyzing the budgets
     o f the three target ministries, the municipalities, and KTA; and

e    seven consultant-months of international consultants and 21 consultant-months of local
     consultants for training related to these two activities.

6.        Assistance for budget preparation in the line ministries would be coordinated with related
projects supported by other donors. These include the EAR'Splanned support for investment
project identification and preparation in the line ministries (which will begin in January, 2005)
and USAID's ongoing support to the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the municipalities.
Assistance in the area of budget preparation and analysis under the PEMTAGproject will also be
coordinated with other components of the PEMTAG, including procurement reforms and
sectoral reforms inthe Ministries of Health and Transport.

7.        BudgetExecution.         With the recent decline in Kosovo's cash reserves and its shift to
cash based accounting, cash management skills have become increasingly important. This
component would finance technical support to the PISG's fledgling cash management unit.
Assistance i s also required to improve the quality o f financial information produced by the line
ministries. Procedures for bookkeeping, accounting and financial reporting are not codified.
Even the central Treasury lacks a manual of procedures specifying many of the processes and
controls that are currently in place. The PEMTAG would therefore finance the drafting of a set
of comprehensive written procedures for bookkeeping, accounting and financial reporting. The
Treasury currently has available 100,000 for training in this area, from funds derived from the
proceeds of a World Bank credit line for Small and Medium Enterprises. An additional 230,000
would be needed to finance the marginal cost of 24 consultant-months of technical assistance.
The proposed manual would complement the planned extension of the Treasury's software
system to the line ministries.

8.        Procurement One-on-one mentoring by experienced procurement specialists will be
required to ensure that the new procurement system i s implemented as intended. In agreement
with the EAR, the PEMTAG would finance international consultants to work with local
counterparts over a period of up to two years. Specific institutions will be selected, in
consultation with the PISG, based on their responsibility for implementing procurement for
critical, high-value public investments and their readiness to allocate dedicated resources to
achieve high performance in their procurement operations.) These will be the Ministries of
Health, Transport, and Public Services. It is estimated that this will cost approximately 500,000.




l2International Consultants includes consultant service firms from the region.


                                                          30

Health Sector Reforms

9.     The Health Component would havethree sub-components.

10.    The first sub-component would finance implementation of the family medicine model in
four municipalities. It would include support to: (a) an initial review of legislation to remove
any legal obstacles to the implementation of the family medicine model; (b) technical assistance
to assist municipal health departments and Main Family Medicine Centers in organizing doctors
and nurses into teams and setting up systems for making appointments (micro organizational
changes); (c) the development and implementation of guidelines, protocols and standards for
family medicine teams and for disease management and disease prevention for practical use in
primary health care, (d) a media campaign to inform the public about the family medicine reform
and encourage patients to register with a doctor of their choice; and (e) a study tour to a country
inECA where family medicine hasbeenimplementedsuccessfully.

11.    A second sub-component would test a new system for paying providers. Although
doctors and nurses would continue to be municipal employees and paid a basic salary, a
performance-based payment mechanism would be established for specific treatments in
accordance with an agreed program of work for family medicine teams, providing a financial
incentive to improve patient care at the primary level and reduce unnecessary referrals. This
sub-component would also provide training in the essentials of the new payment system for the
Health Care Commissioning Agency, other staff, and participating providers.

12.    The thirdsub-component would support skills development for the Ministryof health and
would be coordinated closely with DFID. It would target training in three areas - management,
policy development and planning, and communications skills.        The health component would
finance technical assistance, training, software and limitedincremental operating costs.

TransportSectorReforms

13.    Expenditure allocation The transport component of the PEMTAG would have four
subcomponents. To facilitate the prioritization of recurrent and capital expenditures within the
road sector, technical assistance would be provided to review and strengthen the current Road
Information Database (RID). This would include: (i)a review of the current responsibilities and
organizational structures for the operation and management of the RID; (ii)      the incorporation
within the RID of data from a bump integrator (which i s to be rented at MTC expense from FYR
of Macedonia) which will measure road conditions across the whole network; (iii) provision
                                                                                     the
of training in the use of network expenditure optimization software (HDM4); and (iv) the
production of an assessment of expenditure priorities on the primary and secondary road
network, at a network level. This component will also finance the purchase of 50 fixed and
mobile automatic traffic counters to measuretraffic on the network, and intemational training for
key staff in the MTC. (Under the public sector management component of this operation,
technical assistance would also be provided to strengthen the budget application process within
the MTC.)

14.    Financial sustainability.       Second, the project would finance the development of a
detailed action plan to implement three of the main recommendations of the recent road user



                                                 31

charges study. Specifically, technical assistance would be provided to: (i)assess the costs and
benefits and identify appropriate steps to introduce a general increase in the fuel duty of 6 and 8 Euro
cents per liter on leaded and unleaded gasoline and diesel, respectively; (ii)
                                                                             design and implement an
appropriate transit fee regime, consistent with EU requirements as manifested in, inter alia, EU
Directives 1999/62/EC and C O M 2003/448; (iii)      review, and recommend changes, in the current
scale and structure of road user charges, more generally, to ensure that the fees all vehicle classes
pay covers the damage to the road infrastructure that resulted from their actions.

15.     Road safety.     To address road safety issues, the project would finance technical
assistance for: (i)   the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Road Safety Council (including
assistance with the clarification of its organizational composition, actual role, internal and
external communication, campaign plan, and funding and annual report); (ii)         the identification of
`black spots' and the implementation of appropriate remedial actions based on international best
practice; (iii)training in road accident reconstruction; (iv) a traffic safety audit on a defined
route; and (v) a review of the recently produced manual on road design to ensure that it i s
consistent with best practice on Safe Road Design principles. This subcomponent will also fund
the purchase of suitable software for an Accident Information System, together with
establishment and training.

16.      Trasfic management by Pristina Municipality                     This subcomponent of the
project would finance       technical assistance to improve traffic management capacities and
practices in the Municipality of Pristina. This would include assistance in: (i)developing traffic
management schemes to improve traffic flow; (ii)        planning and managing parlung to improve
utilization of available parking spaces and to minimize disruptions to motor vehicle traffic and
pedestrians; and (iii)public transport planning and regulation to improve public transport
services. In addition, this subcomponent would finance a few defined high priority traffic
management measures (signage and traffic signals), the purchase of appropriate software, and the
collection of necessary data, to establish a tactical traffic assignment model, and a review of both
current road investment plans in the area, and an assessment of the need and scope of an `urban
outreach unit' in the MTC, to disseminate best urban transport policy and practice.

                             Annex 6:ImplementationArrangements

Overall responsibility for each of the three components will be assigned to its respective
implementing ministry: Economy and Finance, Health, and Transport and Communications.
Each implementing ministry will designate a senior-level project supervisor who will be
responsible for monitoring overall progress on its respective component of the project. Bgh-
level representatives appointed by the Minister from each relevant ministry will participate in a
steering committee which will be responsible for resolving inter-ministerial disputes. The
Ministry of Public Services and the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy, as participants in the
public sector management component o f the project, will also appoint representatives to the
steering committee. UNMIK Pillar IV will also be represented. The Committee will meet on a
quarterly basis or more frequently if the need arises. The assistant to the permanent secretary of
the MFEwill act as the steering committee's secretariat.

Each project supervisor will be assisted by a more junior project administrator, who will be
responsible for:

    0   developing annual work program drafts and activity budgets;
    0   developing quarterly management draft reports and annual reports on activities to be
        implemented by each Ministry;
    0   preparing the mid-term review;
    0   drafting terms of reference (TORS)and technical specifications for goods; drawing up
        shortlists; participating in evaluation committees, contract negotiations and award of
        contract;
    0  post contract work including facilitatingthe work of consultants; and
    0   approving payments after checking the quality and quantity of work undertaken.


Procurement will be carried out by each of the three implementing ministries, with the assistance
of the Public Procurement Agency (PPA). While the implementing ministries will be responsible
for drafting TOR, specification and signing of contract including its implementation ,the PPA
will act as their internal procurement agent.

The implementing ministries will be responsible for checking the quality and quantity of work
carried out against contracts,       issuing payment     orders,  and producing disbursement
documentation. The Grants Unit will approve SOEs and other disbursement documentation and
submit them to the Bank throughUNMIK.

Based on the documents prepared by the implementing ministries, all relevant documents will be
processed by the Grant Unit in the MFE,either to be paid by the Treasury or by direct payments.
The MFE will prepare all the relevant documents in support of applications for withdrawal, sign
them and forward them to the Bank through UNMIK. Contributions from the Kosovo
Consolidated Budget (KCB) and the Municipality of Pristina will be made using normal PISG
procedures.

The designated project administrator in each implementing ministry will check and process all
CPOs received from the implementing ministries before submission to the MFE.The Grants Unit


                                                34

inMFEwill assign a staff member to be responsible for the processing andcontrol of payments,
production of withdrawal applications, and for producing quarterly and annual financial
statements for the project. The Grants Unit in MFE will work closely with the Procurement
Agency and the implementing ministries to ensure that quarterly FMRs, annual financial
statements and other progress reports are submittedin a timely manner to the Bank reflecting the
implementation status of the project. Disbursements from the Grant will be made based on
traditional disbursement methods, reimbursing the KCB based on Statements of Expenditures
(SOEs) as well as using direct payments from the Grant. Reimbursement will be made monthly
throughout the project period. The Grants Unit will also be responsible for drafting the
Implementation Completion Report.

The accounting books and records will be maintained on a cash basis by the MFE based on the
documentation provided by the implementing ministries, including additional commitment
information for signed contracts. Quarterly and yearly project financial statements will be
presented in EUR. MFE will institute a set of appropriate accounting procedures and internal
controls including authorization and segregation of duties for this project based on previous
similar projects.

The project financial statements and auditing arrangements for the previous projects managedby
MFE are acceptable and will be replicated for the proposed project. The auditor will be
appointed by the MFE.The audits will be conducted in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing. The annual cost of the audits will be covered by the grant.

MFE will produce all financial reports and SOEs for the Bank. The formats of the quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to be used for project monitoring and supervision and the
formats of these will be agreedduringnegotiations and will be included in the Fh4manual. MFE
will produce a full set of FMRs every three months throughout the life of the project.

The chart of accounts will be based on the Government Financial Management Information
System. As the participants under the project fall under the umbrella of the Kosovo Consolidated
Budget, all project-related payments will be made via the Single Treasury Account (STA), and
the accounts would be maintained as part of the MFE's accounting system. Based on monthly
reports from this system (Freebalance) MFEwill, through the Grants Unit, manually produce the
quarterly and annual financial reports required.

              Annex 7: FinancialManagementand DisbursementArrangements

Country Issues

An Operational Financial Accountability Report was finalized in November 2004. Despite
significant progress since 2001, public financial management in Kosovo suffers from
fundamental weaknesses, and basic structures for financial accountability are still in their
infancy. The overall legal framework for budgeting and budget management i s largely
compatible with internationally recognized standards, but for some aspects it appears to be too
advanced for the current administration's capacity. Carry-over practices and weaknesses in
capacity, organization and coordination hamper budget preparation and undermine the credibility
of the budget as a policy management instrument. While treasury and cash management are well-
regulated areas of public financial management, they suffer from inefficiencies. The system
through which Commitment and Payment Orders flow to ensure authorization of payments is
well regulated. The Treasury authorizes commitments and payments based on proposals and
supporting documentation by budget organizations and municipalities. The Treasury pays from a
single account in the central Banking and Payment Authority of Kosovo (BPK).

As with most public financial management functions, accounting is constrained by limited
capacity, and financial reporting needs more realistic requirements and statutory deadlines,
improved procedures, and trained personnel. Internal control and internal audit at all levels of
government are in their infancy. Considerable time and effort will be required to make them fully
operational. External audit i s undeveloped and, as with internal audit, it will need sustained
external support for its development.

Specific procedures are developed by MFE to secure proper financial accountability o f this
project.

Strengthsand Weaknesses

The significant strengths that provide a basis of reliance on the project financial management
system include: (a) the experience of MFE and UNMIK of implementing previous projects and
satisfying Bank financial management requirements; and (b) the audit reports and management
letters issued by the auditors.

There are no significant weaknesses of the project financial management system.

Implementing Entily

Overall responsibility for each of the three components will be assigned to its respective
implementing ministry: Economy and Finance, Health, and Transport and Communications.
Each implementing ministry will designate a project administrator who will be responsible for its
respective role in procurement and financial management.       This would specifically include
drafting TORS, shortlists, and technical specifications for goods, participating in evaluation
committees and contract negotiations, facilitating the work of consultants, and approving
payments after checking the quality and quantity of work done.



                                               36

Procurement for each implementing ministry will be carried out by the Public Procurement
Agency (PPA), with the participation of the relevant ministry. With respect to technical
assistance and training, the implementing ministry will be responsible for drafting TORS for
consultants' assignments and preparing short-lists of consultants and firms. Both the PPA and
the ministry will participate in evaluation committees and contract negotiations. With respect to
goods, the ministry will be responsible for preparing technical specifications for goods, with the
assistance of the PPA. The PPA would be responsible for carrying out the procurement, i.e.,
inviting expressions of interest, preparing bidding packages, obtaining clearances, inviting bids,
and evaluating proposals.

Financial management activities will be performed by the Grants Unit in the MFE, with the
participation of the relevant implementing ministry. The implementing ministries will be
responsible for checking the quality and quantity of work carried out against contracts, issuing
payment orders, and producing disbursement documentation. The Grants Unit will approve
SOEs and other disbursement documentation and submit themto the Bank through UNMIK.

Funds Flow

All payments will be made by the MFE from its own sources of funds and no special account
will be needed. Based on the documents prepared by the implementing ministries all relevant
documents will be processedby the Grant Unit in the MFE,either to be paid by the Treasury or
by direct payments. The MFE will prepare all the relevant documents in support of applications
for withdrawal, sign and forward them to the Bank through UNMIK. Contributions from the
MTC and the Municipality of Pristina will be made usingnormal PISGprocedures.




 The project administrator in each implementing ministry will check and process all
Commitment and Payment Orders (CPOs) received from the implementing ministries before
submission to the MFE.All entities producing the CPOs have duly established finance units with
adequate staffing and the processing of the project invoices will follow the normal procedures
these units are already using. The designated point person in each implementing ministry will
check and process all CPOs received from the implementingministries before submission to the
MFE.The Grants Unit in MFE will assign a staff member to be the focal point for processing
and control of payments, production of withdrawal applications, as well as producing quarterly
and annual financial statements for the project. The Grants Unit in MFE will work closely with
the Procurement Agency and the implementingministries to ensure that quarterly FMRs, annual
financial statements and other progress reports are submitted timely to the Bank reflecting the
implementation status of the project.

Accounting Policiesand Procedures

The accounting books and records are maintained on a cash basis by MFE based on the
documentation provided by the implementing ministries including additional commitment
information for signed contracts. Quarterly and yearly project financial statements are presented
in EUR. MFE will institute a set of appropriate accounting procedures and internal controls
including authorization and segregation of duties for this project based on previous similar


                                               37

projects.

The policies and proceduresare further elaboratedinthe Project Implementation Manual.

Internal Audit

No internal audit is establishedandno such function is deemednecessary.

External Audit

As of the date of this report, the grant receiver is in compliance with its audit covenants of the
existing Bank-financed project. Current project financial statements and auditing arrangements
for the previous projects managed by MFE are acceptable and it has been agreed that these
arrangements will be replicated for the proposed project. The audit will only cover the project
activities. The auditor will be appointed by the MFE.Specific terms of reference will be agreed
during negotiations. The audits are conducted in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing. The annual cost of the audits will be covered by the grant.

Reporh'ngand Monitoring.

MFE will produce all financial reports and SOEs for the Bank. The formats of the quarterly
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will be agreed during negotiations to be used for project
monitoring and supervision and the formats of these will be included in the FM manual. MFE
will produce a full set of F M R s every three months throughout the life of the project.

Information Systems.

The chart of accounts is basedon the Government's Financial Management InformationSystem.
This systemwas assessedinthe Operational FinancialAccountabilityReport andfound to be
acceptablefor the purpose of registeringthe necessary financial information. As the participants
underthe project fall under the umbrella of the Kosovo ConsolidatedBudget, all project related
paymentswould be made via the Single Treasury Account (STA), and the accounts would be
maintained as part of the MFE's accounting system. Basedon monthly reports from this system
(Freebalance), MFEwill produce the quarterly and annual financial reports required. The
consolidated reports on uses of funds according to organizational code, the uses of funds
according to sub-component, and the commitment/obligation analysis report with commitment
and actual data (that i s report 1to 3), will all be produced by the Freebalancesystem on request
of the GrantsUnit.The contract monitoring information (report 4a, 4b, and 4c) will be produced
by the implementing ministries basedon the commitment/obligation analysis report and the
informationon each contract. The narrative report andthe consolidation of the other reports will
be done by the Grants Unit.

DisbursementArrangements.

Disbursements from the Grant will be made based on transactional disbursement methods,
reimbursing the Recipient based on Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) as well as using direct
payments from the Grant, although only inexceptional cases as initiated by the MFE.No special


                                                   38

account will be opened.. Reimbursement will be made monthly throughout the project period.
There i s no plan to move to report-based disbursement.


SupervisionPlan

Duringproject implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial management
arrangements in two main ways: (i)   review the project's quarterly financial management reports
as well as the project's annual auditedfinancial statements and auditor's management letter; and
(ii) theBank'ssupervisionmissions,reviewtheproject's financialmanagementand
    during
disbursement arrangements to confirm that satisfactory financial management arrangements have
been maintained. As required, a Bank-accreditedFinancial Management Specialist will assist in
the supervision process.

Project Implementation Manual. The               detailed   procurementkelection   arrangements,
procurement methods and organization of procurement              are   also given in the Project
Implementation Manual, which i s available as part of the project documentation


                                                 40

Procurement will be carried out by each of the three implementing ministries, under the
supervision of the Public Procurement Agency (PPA). With respect to small value consultancy
contracts, the implementing ministry will be responsible for drafting TORs and preparing short-
lists of consultants and firms, with the assistance of the PPA. Both the PPA and the ministry will
participate in evaluation committees and contract negotiations. With respect to large value
consulting contracts (those requiringprior review of the Bank) and the procurement of goods, the
implementing ministry will be responsible for preparing TORs and technical specifications (in
the case of goods) and will also prepare the first draft of the request for proposals and bidding
documents, with the procurement assistance and advice of the PPA. Both the PPA and the
implementing ministry will participate in the committee that will evaluate the technical and
financial proposals. Both will also participate in contract negotiations. The implementing
ministry will sign the contract and will be responsible for ensuring that the contract i s
implemented.


B. Assessmentof the agency's capacity to implement procurement

Procurement activities will be carried out by the Public Procurement Agency, with the
participation of the relevant implementing ministry.The Ministry of Finance will implement the
public sector management component; the health and transport components will be implemented
by their respective ministries.

An assessment of the capacity of the implementing agency to implement procurement actions
for the project was carried out by Devesh Mishra (World Bank) in December of 2004. This
assessment was carried out in association with the task team for          the proposed Business
Environment Technical Assistance Project. This was followed by another round of discussions
with PPA in MarcMApril 2005 particularly on making the PPA aware of the changes in the
Bank's     Guidelines and to ensure        that the procurement management arrangement as
recommended in the Project Implementation Manual i s workable.

The PPA has a staff of 15, with backgrounds in economics, law or engineering. Although they
have little procurement experience (averaging about two years), many have been trained at
courses organized by the International Labor Organization. . It was concluded that though these
staff have minimumbasic experience in Bank-funded procurement, they will need mentoring by
one more experienced procurement consultants(start-up consultant) This start-up procurement
consultant will be an international consultant with approximately 10 years of experience in
Bank-funded procurement or experience in a similar international funding agency. The
procurement consultant's services will be financed under the Project Management (Grants Unit)
component of the PEMTAG project. Bank staff will have to be closely involved in the initial
project periodto assistPPA till the start-up procurement consultant i s selected.

C. ProcurementPlan

The Borrower, has developed a procurement plan for project implementation which provides the
basis for the procurement methods. For each contract to be financed by the grant, the different



                                                 41

     procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated
     costs, prior review requirements, and time frame will be agreed between the Borrower and the
     Bank and specified in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least
     annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in
     institutional capacity. The Procurement Plan will be available at the office of the Public
     Procurement Agency. It will also be available in the project's database and inthe Bank's external
     website.

     D. Frequency of ProcurementSupervision

     In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out by Bank staff, periodic supervision
     missions (at least every 12 months) will visit the field to carry out post review of procurement
     actions.

                                 Annex 9: Economicand FinancialAnalysis


1.       The project is financed as a grant, which the recipient (UNMIK) will pass on to the
Kosovo Consolidated Budget (KCB) for the purposes specified in the project documentation. To
the extent that the grant replaces other revenuesthat would have been usedfor these purposes, it
will increase the general budgetary resources of the KCB. The public sector management
component may imply eventual increases in certain staff salaries, however, to prevent the
departure of staff once they are trained. As the number of such positions i s small, this would not
have any significant fiscal implications for the KCB as a whole.

2.        The fiscal situation of the KCB itself has fluctuated in recent years. Considerable
progress was made in raising domestic revenues and controlling expenditures in the immediate
post-conflict years. Buoyed by the introduction of new taxes and a post-conflict boom, tax
revenues exceeded rojections. At the same time, public spending was discouraged by certain
budgetary practices.73 As a result, budget surpluses were achieved in every year until 2004 and a
cash surplus of approximately 300 million had accumulated by the beginningof 2003.

3.       Growth in tax revenues leveled off in 2003 and 2004, while the constraints to expenditure
management have largely been removed. As a result, the budget recorded a cash deficit of 130
million (6.8 percent of GDP) in 2004. The prospects for further growth in the tax base are not
encouraging. Between 1999 and 2003 the international donor community spent an estimated
1.96 billion in Kosovo, while remittances from the Kosovo diaspora added another 550
million per annum over this period. Since 2000, donor grants have fallen by 70 percent, and are
forecast to continue to decline. As a result, over the next four years, Kosovo's medium term
fiscal framework will require an absolutereduction in general government expenditures from the
                                                                   levels in 2004. Beginning in 2006,
                                                                   the government will have to maintain
                                                                   a     balanced      budget, using the
                                                                   remaining cash surplus as a liquidity

                                                                   preparation (and due out in gray

                                                                   the authorities in ensuring that fiscal

and long term priorities. The PEIR will also identify numerous contingent liabilities, as yet not
explicitly included in the mediumterm fiscal framework.

                              Annex 12: TOR for BudgetFormulation
Background

The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has received a technical
assistance grant to support the strengthening of public expenditure management. The grant will finance
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG) in budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, as well as specific policy
and procedural reforms inthe health and transport sectors.

The budget process i s governed by a modem organic budget law (the Law on Public Financial
Management and Accountability of May 2003), which clearly indicated the responsibilities and main
processesfor the preparation, approval and execution of the budget. Formally the processes are followed.
However the quality of budget submissions prepared by line agencies i s poor. Little capacity exists
within the line ministries to prepare relevant and meaningful budget submissions linked to policies and
priorities. Inaddition submissions are well outside initialceilings provided by the MFE. Within the MFE,
the budget department lacks the capacity to analyze and challenge budget users' proposals in any depth.
Thus the discussion of budget proposals i s very much a mechanical exercise in which the MFE allocates
resourcesto agencies and municipalities without a clear understanding of their policy impact.

Substantial support i s being provided by international advisers to the central institutions involved in the
budget process. USAID is providing a team of advisors to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MFE),
particularly for macroeconomic forecasting, budget formulation, and treasury operations. The European
Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) i s financing major programs of technical assistance in public
investment planning, internal audit, and procurement. This assignment would complement those efforts.

Objectives of Assignment

The objective of the assignment is to assist the PISG in increasingthe institutional capacity for budgeting
with an initial focus on the MFE and the 3 key line ministries (Labor and Social Welfare, Health and
Transport and Communications). The component will focus on two major areas of budget formulation.

The first would be a consultancy and training program to buildcapacity in budget preparation inthe three
key line ministries. This will be provided by long-term consultants with specific knowledge of policy and
technical issues in the area of each ministry, in addition to experience in budget preparation. The focus of
the work will be to ensure the transmission of knowledge and capacity buildingof local staff, which can
subsequently be extended beyond the three recipient ministries.

The second part would focus on buildingcapacity among the budget analysts in the budget department of
the Ministry of Economy and Finance. These would include the counterparts of the three major line
ministries (Labor and Social Welfare, Health and Transport and Communications) and the municipalities,
as well as the counterpart of the Kosovo Trust Agency (KTA) responsible for public utilities. Again, this
work would be carried out by long-term consultants with specific knowledge in these fields as well as in
budget preparation and analysis, supported by local consultants, who would be able to continue the work
of capacity building after the end of the project.

Scope of Work

The specific tasks of the advisers inthe line ministries are to:




                                                     49

        Buildanalyticalcapacities for budgetingwithin aresults orientedframework ina uniformand
        coherent manner acrossthe line ministries (inclose cooperation with other budget advisors,
        including particularly the USAID advisors inthe MFE);
        Buildlinksbetween the budgetingand strategic policy making capacity of the line ministries;
        Provide advice inthe costing and evaluation of new policies and initiatives;
        Makeproposals on the reorganization of the budgetingand policy making unitsof the line
        ministries together with internal procedures and regulationconsistent with the legal framework
        and budget regulations issued by the MFE;
        Provide advice on the elaboration of forward estimatesin line ministries (inclose cooperation
        with the USAID advisors) and with due consideration for capacity of ministries to develop such
        estimates and the need to provide adequateresources for the development of the annual budget;
        Organize and performrelevant training inthe areas mentioned above;
        Organize change management sessions, for top and middle management to assist the process of
        changing the culture and organization of budgeting inthe line ministries;
        Work closely with other teams providing assistanceunder the project, including particularly those
        providing assistance inprocurement, financial management and policy advice inthe Health and
        Transport Sectors to ensure that the budgeting reforms are fully consistent with and linkto the
        public managementreforms being supported under this project and by other donors;
        Buildcapacity of the local officials to managethe process of budget preparation ingeneral, and
        through the use of local consultants contracted under the project provide a sustainable mechanism
        to continue transferring capacity to the ministries not targeted by the assistance.

Specific tasks of advisers inthe Ministry of Economy and Finance are to:

        Work with the Budget Analysts of the budget department of the MFEto assistthem to identify
        the strengths and weaknesses of budget submissions of the line ministries and the KTA (for
        Publicly Owned Enterprises), particularly as these refer to the agreed priorities of the Kosovar
        authorities;
        Provide guidance and training to the budget analysts inevaluatingbudget submissions against
        proposed results and outcomes;
        Provide advice to budget analysts on giving useful feedback to line ministries on budget
        submissions so as to improve the quality of budget submissions;
        Organize or promotejoint working groups between MFEbudget analysts and line ministry
        counterparts to promote a common understanding of the requirements of the budget process
        methodology, particularly as it refers to budget submissions by ministries;
        Assist the MFEto draft guidance methodology for the line ministries for the preparation of
        budget submissions;
        Buildcapacity of the local officials inthe MFEto managethe process of budget analysis, and
        through the use of local consultants contracted under the project provide a sustainable mechanism
        to continue training and development of budgetary analysis capability.

Suggested Methodology

The work under the project should be organized in four task forces, corresponding to the three key line
ministries identified previously and the support to the budget analysis section of the MFE. They should
cover the tasks listed above.

A team leader of the project who will be one of the advisers to the Ministry of Finance will coordinate the
work of the four task forces. (S)he will meet the other three task force leaders on a continuous and




                                                     50

regular basis in order to discuss the progress of their work, and ensure the application of a consistent
methodology across ministries.

In addition to the MFEand 3 key ministries, representatives from other ministries should be invited to
participate inthe task forces.

Each of the three line ministry task forces should consist of the following members:

1. The Adviser responsible for the line ministry, as a task force leader;
2. The MFEbudget analyst dealingwith financing of this ministry, as a liaison officer;
3. The budget officer from the ministry;
4. An official responsible for policy development inthe ministry;
5. 2-3 MFEbudget analysts responsible for financing of other ministries;
6. Budget experts from other ministries;
7. The local task force coordinator assisting the Adviser.

The task force of the MFE will consist of the international and local advisors contracted to develop the
budget analysis capacity of the MFE,together with the budget analysts of the MFE.

Each task force should meet on a regular basis, at least once a month, in order to discuss tasks being
carried out, bottlenecks tackled and results delivered.         The task force leaders will ensure that each
member of their task force is actively involved and participates in the process of elaboration of tasks that
should be completed.

To ensure that the task force leaders are able to provide effective on the job coaching and mentoring it is
recommended the task force leaders be based in their respective ministries. From there they will also
maintain regular contacts with other ministries involved. The task force leaders will be assisted in their
work by local coordinators (consultants).

At the end of their assignment the consultants will be required to demonstrate that the officials of the
ministries receiving the assistance are in a position to carry out their functions without external support. It
i s therefore essential that prior to the approval of the final report the consultants can show what skills and
capacity have been transferred to local officials and indicate further weaknesses that may need to be
addressed.

The authorities will consider proposals with alternative methodologies from that outlined above if these
can be shown to produce the required results.


RequiredOutputs

     Annual budgets prepared according to pre-agreedcalendar with budget submissions clearly linked to
     policy priorities and to initial ceilings given by MFE;

Liaisonand Reporting Requirements

The Advisers in the three line ministries will report to the Adviser in the MFE (the Team Leader) who
will be responsible for overall consistency of the approach in the different line ministries. (S)he will be
responsible to the Minister of Finance and the Permanent Secretary and will report on a regular basis. At
the end of the second month the Team Leader will submit an inception report showing a work plan of
significant tasks to be undertaken during the contract period, acceptable to the Ministry of Economy and
Finance In addition (s)he will submit short (maximum 3 pages) monthly updates of the inception report
to the Permanent Secretary and the Steering Committee which will show achievements over the previous
month, work program for the next month and problems encountered, as well as progress toward achieving
the goals set in the inception report. At the end of the contract (s)he will submit a final report on work
undertaken which will include recommendations for future work and development in the area of
budgeting and demonstrate the skills and capacity transferred to local officials.

Monitorable Indicators of Performance

The success of the advisers will bejudged by the delivery of the RequiredOutputs. Inaddition the
following indicators will be of importance:


    0   evidence of close collaborationwith Advisers working under other contracts of the PEMTAGand
        with other advisers supporting public sector reforminKosovo;
    0   satisfactory progress toward goals set out inthe inception report as described inthe previous
        section;
    0   close cooperation and communicationestablished between the MFEand individual ministries in
        the area of budgeting;
    0   Clear indication that skills have been transferred to local officials.

Consultants Qualifications

The Team Leader should have at least 8 years experience at a senior policy level in a Ministry of Finance
or equivalent and have a detailed working knowledge of results oriented budgeting. The other Advisers
should have at least 5 years experience and have a working knowledge budgeting techniques. It i s
desirable that the advisers in the three line ministries should have experience in the ministry's area of
sectoral responsibility. In addition one of the advisors supporting the budget analysis section of the MFE
should have experience in the areas of infrastructure and or public enterprise budgeting, while the others
should ideally have knowledge or experience in the sectoral areas of health, transport, and social welfare
and employment.

Other important qualifications for all advisers include:

Background


The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has received a technical
assistance grant to support the strengthening of public expenditure management. The grant will finance
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG) in budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, as well as specific policy
and procedural reforms inthe healthand transport sectors.

Objectives of the Assignment

The objective of this assignment i s to enhance the reliability of the financial reporting of the PISG.
Whereas it i s assumed that the procedures used to operate the Treasury system (FREEBALANCE) are
well described in the documentation given by the system provider, bookkeeping, accounting and financial
reporting and indeedthe principles behind sound accounting practices are not documented or promoted in
a consistent manner. It i s expected that the development and eventual endorsement of a comprehensive
accounting manual will facilitate this.

Inaccordancewith the statements of accounting policy presented in the reports of the external auditor on
the Kosovo Consolidated Budget (KCB), the accounting standard applied by the KCB is the cash basis
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (Cash Basis (CB) IPSAS). One of the objectives of
developing the Accounting Manual will be to institutionalize and harmonize the accounting practices
across the PISGand UNMIK administrationinaccordancewith CB IPSAS.

Scope ofWork

The work will consist of researching for, drafting and ensuring the submission for formal endorsement by
the PISG and SRSG of a manual of accounting (hereafter the Manual) to be applied by the financial
services of all KCB spending entities. The Manual must cover detailed written procedures for
bookkeeping, accounting and compilation and presentation of financial statements. It should also contain
job-descriptions for bookkeeping and accountancy functions at different levels and suggestions as to how
to obtain and maintain the skills required to perform bookkeeping and accountancy functions. The draft
Manual should be discussed and eventually agreed with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, including
its internal audit department, and the SRSG. The draft should also be discussed with the Office of the
Auditor General.

Activities


The work of the consultant must include:
0    Analysis of legal and other backgrounddocumentation
0    Development and drafting of detailed written procedures for bookkeeping and accounting, including

0    Addressing the issue of the need for current training of public sector accountants by proposing a
     concrete training plan attached as an annex to the Manual
0    Discussion and eventual agreement with any regulatory authorities who are competent in the field of
     audit or accounting

                            Annex 14: TOR for Procurement Consultants

Background

The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has received a technical
assistance grant to support the strengthening of public expenditure management. The grant will finance
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG) in budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, as well as specific policy
and proceduralreforms inthe healthand transport sectors.

A new Law on Public Procurement (LPP) was promulgated in February, 2004 and was to become
effective inJune of the same year. Although it addressedmany of the flaws in the prior legislation, it was
extremely complex, particularly in calling for three separate enforcement agencies: a public procurement
regulatory board, a regulatory authority, and a rules committee. The Government has now decided to
amend the law. An EAR-financed consultant i s now drafting the amendment. EAR i s also financing the
drafting of the law's implementing regulations and plans to finance a training program to support their
implementation. The latter would consist of a series of periodic training courses for staff of the major line
ministries, along with the development of a procurement training module in the Kosovo Institute of
Public Administration.

But one-on-one mentoring by experienced procurement specialists will be required through this
consultancy to ensure that the new procurement system i s implemented as intended. Inagreement with the
EAR, the technical assistance grant will therefore finance international consultants to provide this
assistance. Specific institutions will be selected, in consultation with the PISG, based on their
responsibility for implementing procurement for critical, high-value public investments and their
readiness to allocate dedicated resources to achieve high performance in their procurement operations.
Likely candidates include the Ministries of Health, Transport, and Public Services.

Scope of Work

The objective of this assignment is to buildcapacity for procurement ina uniform and coherent manner in
key line ministries, consistent with the newly revised LPP and procurement regulations. The work under
the project should be organized in three subcomponents, corresponding to the three key line ministries
identified previously. The consultant assigned to one of the components will also serve as a project team
leader and will meet on a regular basis with the other procurement advisors and with the Public
Procurement Agency to ensurethe application of a methodology that is consistent across ministries.

The procurement activities under this assignment will include: (a) procurement planning; (b) preparation
of bidding documents (with basic technical input provided by the line ministries); (c) bid evaluation; and
(d) preparation of contract agreements. Inthe course of mentoring local procurement staff, the consultant
will carry out at least two full procurement procedures ineach ministry.

At the end of their assignments the advisors will be required to demonstrate that the officials of the
ministries receiving the assistanceare ina position to carry out their functions without external support.

RequiredOutputs

e   An annual procurement plan for each ministry, consistent with the revisedLPPand its implementing
    regulations

Liaisonand Reporting Requirements

The project team leader will report to the director of the Public Procurement Agency, who will be
responsible to the Minister of Finance and the Permanent Secretary and will report on a regular basis. At
the end of the second month the team leader will submit an inception report showing a work plan of
significant tasks to be undertaken during the contract period, acceptable to the Ministry of Economy and
Finance In addition (s)he will submit short (maximum 3 pages) monthly updates of the inception report
to the Permanent Secretary and the Steering Committee which will show achievements over the previous
month, work program for the next month and problems encountered, as well as progress toward achieving
the goals set in the inception report. At the end of the contract (s)he will submit a final report on work
undertaken which will include recommendations for future work and development in the area of
procurement.

Monitorable Indicatorsof Performance

The success of the Advisers will bejudged by the delivery of the Required Outputs. Inaddition the
following indicators will be of importance:


    0   evidence of close collaboration with advisers working under other contracts of the PEMTAG and
        with other advisers supporting public sector reform inKosovo;
    0   satisfactory progress toward goals set out inthe inception report as described inthe previous
        section;
    0   close cooperation and communication established between the MFEand individual ministries in
        the area of procurement;
    0   Clear indication that skills have been transferred to local officials

BACKGROUND


The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has received a technical
assistance grant to support the strengthening of public expenditure management. The grant will finance
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG) inbudget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, as well as specific policy
and procedural reforms inthe health and transport sectors.


Kosovo has a tradition of a publicly provided health care system financed through social health insurance.
Until 1989,the system was typical of those inthe Balkan, central and eastemEuropean region, dominated
by the large "policlinics" and hospitals. As part of the former Yugoslav Republic, the health system was
financed through a social health insurance system. In the years leading up to the war, systems began to
decay. From 1989the health system suffered significant decline. Large sections of the population were
excluded from using the main systems and became dependent on a parallel network of services provided
by NGOson a voluntary basis or by the private sector.

Since the conflict, Kosovo has initiated important reforms in the health sector aimed at increasing access
to health care, improving financial sustainability, and improving quality of care. Kosovo has made
substantive progress in the following areas: (i)   policy development and re-organization of sirvices, with
emphasis given to PHC and gradual integration of vertical structures in the health care system; (ii)
training, through the development and implementation of new curricula for family doctors, nurses and
health care managers; (iii)    infrastructure, with most health facilities refurbished and re-equipped; (iv)
development of a Health Information System (HIS) although still in the design stage; (v) initiation of a
modem approach to continuing professional education; and (vi) upgrading of nursing education to
bachelor level. Although progress has been attained, the ongoing health reform process still encounters
many difficulties.

The challenges for the Kosovo health care reform have been daunting. They include a radical change in
the objectives and organization of the health care system, in management structures, tools and practices,
and in the training of health care professionals. Successes and difficulties have characterized the reform
process. The main difficulties that remain are: (i)lack of adequate managerial capacity and tools,
particularly at the local level; (ii)
                                    lack of implementingregulations governing the private sector, including
the private use of public healthfacilities; (iii)lack of quality assurance strategiesand systems; (iv) lack of
capacity to address emerging health issues, such as adolescent and youth health; (v) unsustainable
financing mechanisms for the sector as well as mechanisms to address weaknesses in efficiency, equity,
and quality of health services; (vi) poor health indicators; (vii) unequal access to health care, including
lack of integration of health services in the minority areas; (viii) shortage of doctors and nurses; (ix) lack
of a comprehensive human resource policy; and (x) lack of reliable statistics. MOH, as shown by the
recent report "Health and Health Care in Kosovo", i s aware of the problems and of the need of urgent
policies to address them, starting with the rapid growth of a largely unregulated private sector.


According to the 2004 Poverty Assessment, in general, the provision of health services i s quantitatively
reasonable, but some important barriers to access exist, particularly for the poorest, the elderly, and the
disabled. The health services network, both at primary health care (PHC) and secondaryhertiary care
levels, is quantitatively adequate and geographically well distributed. However, in some cases, there is a
lack of medical and nursing staff to ensure effective accessibility to PHC services. In addition, a limited



                                                      58

number of areas need better infrastructure for tertiary care, including equipment and training. The main
barriers to access to health services include, inter alia: (i)
                                                             limited functioning of PHC in rural areas; (ii)
costs - including informal payments and drugs that should be provided by the system but are not; (iii)lack
of confidence by the public in the health system, particularly at the primary level. In principle, health
facilities are accessible to everybody regardless of ethnicity. M O H supports a few small hospitals and
health facilities run by Serbian health personnel. However, most of the Kosovar Serbs utilize a parallel
health systemdirectly subsidized by Serbia and Montenegro, which does not report to MOH.

Public health expenditures are relatively low. According to Government estimates, in 2003 public health
expenditures were 4.4 percent of GDP, which i s below the regional averages and well below the neighbor
countries with the exception of Albania. Prospects for 2003-5 are for a very small increase of public
expenditure inabsolute terms (less than 5 percent inthree years).

Private health expenditures as a proportion of total private consumption i s relatively low on average. A
notable proportion of households, particularly among the poorest, incur catastrophic expenditures.
Because of the use of different survey methods, estimates of private health expenditures show substantial
variation, ranging from 1.6 percent of GDP based on the 2002-3 HBS, to 3.4 percent based on the 2000
LSMS.      Based on recent data, private health expenditures average Euros 7.05 per month, which
corresponds to 1.9 percent of the total household consumption.

The benefits of the system of universal coverage practiced in Kosovo are compromised by inefficiency
and corruption that cause undue out-of-pocket expenditures. According to the Poverty Assessment, the
cost of drugs account for 65 percent of private expenditures, but a highproportion of these out-of- pocket
payments are for drugs that are supposed to be provided for free, or that are not essential and, therefore,
should not be prescribed. Informal payments are also widespread and affect the poorest population. The
rapidly growing private sector undermines efforts to improve service delivery and does not guarantee
better quality of care. Private sector regulation is thus a priority to avoid further leaking of resources
from the public sector and to protect consumers from poor quality.


OBJECTIVESAND EXPECTEDRESULTS


The healthcomponent will support the Ministry of Health to initiate improvements in service delivery by
introducing in demonstration municipalities, the family medicine model of primary health care and
performance based incentives focusing on quality, efficiency and access to PHC. These efforts will
represent important steps towards financial sustainability of the health care system and support the
analytical, planning and management capacity at the central and municipality level to improve the
chances for sustainability of future healthreforms.

The health component will have three sub-components: (i)Primary Health Care Restructuring, (ii)
development and test performance based payment mechanism, and (iii)skills development. This TOR
refers to the first of these subcomponents.

SCOPEOFWORK

With support from the EuropeanAgency for Reconstruction (EAR), MOHhas been implementing a 2 and
3 year training program for family doctors. As of the end of June 2004, more than 400 physicians have
received this training. Inaddition with support from Finland, training for family medicine nurses i s being
provided. One important achievement of the physicians training i s that the program was accredited by the

Royal Collegeof Physiciansof the UK. However, changes inthe organizational modelof PHCare yet to
be developed to ensure that the principlesof the family medicinemodelare implementedinthe PHC.


The TA will support development and implementation of the following tasks:


   0   Review of legislation and drafting of necessaryamendments to allow for family medicine
       implementation, includingintroduction of performancelbased payment mechanismsfor
       PHC to provide incentives for efficiency. Since these reforms are new, the current
       management capacity and infrastructure do not allow for full implementation of these
       changes and therefore it i s essential to identify gaps and make necessary changes.


   0   Development and implementation of micro and macro organizational changes. The
       transition to the family medicine model would require changes in the internal
       organization of health centers as well as redistribution of staff and tasks. The current
       organizational model of delivery system i s highly fragmented within the health centers
       and can not adequately accommodatefor full implementation of the family medicine
       model. Therefore, it i s essentialthat local plans are developed and implementedthat
       would facilitate internal restructuring and relocation of staff. The family medicine model
       would be basedon teams rather than on dispensaries.


   0   Changesin the flow of patients andpatients-doctor relations. The family medicine model
       requires systematic planningandproactive outreach towards disease prevention. The
       current practice of queuinginwithout an appointment systemin place preventsfamily
       medicine teams to adequatelyplan and organize their activities and to devote adequate
       amount of time for individualpatients. Development of an appointment system should be
       basedon phone or inperson scheduling with allowance for emergency interventions as
       needed. Inaddition, adequate recordkeeping of patients and family memberswill be
       developed at the level of a family medicine team which will promote better patient-doctor
       relations.


   0   Development of guidelines for diseasemanagement and diseaseprevention and standards
       for practical use inprimary health care. Clinical protocols and therapeutic guidelines will
       be developed for about 20 most common diseases to standardizetreatment andpreventive
       activities at the primary care level. Special emphasis will be put on clear instructions for
       the family medicine teams on how to organize preventive services for their population.
       Working groups comprising of staff from the Instituteof Public Health (IPH), university,
       hospitals, PHC, medical associations andM o Hwill be established for this purpose. The
       guidelines will serve as a basis for contracting and assessment of quality standards. Also
       they will serve as a basis for the development of family medicine annual work plans.


   0   A media campaign to promote patients registration with a doctor of their choice (once the
       previous steps have been completed). The family medicine model requires that a family
       medicine team serves a defined population inthe municipality. Inthis regard,
       communication activities will support information and awareness of the public at large
       regardingthe new model of service delivery andencourageregistration of the population
       with a family doctor of their choice.

BACKGROUND

(Same Text as Annex 15)

PROBLEMDESCRIPTION

The current flow of public health funds includes two types of disbursements: (i) central level health budget
                                                                                  the
to the Ministry of Health (MOH), who pays health facilities and programs and (ii)     the PHC health allocation
directly to municipalities. The Ministry of Finance (or of Health Care in collaboration with PHC providers) is
responsible for implementation. At the municipality level, around 80 percent of spending i s financed by central
government allocations for primary health care, education and general spending, which are nominally driven by
formulas. About 20 percent i s paid by own resources. In theory, the health grant commission defines the
annual PHC budget allocated to municipalities based on the population size, the "fair share financing" rule to
ensure adequate financing of minority communities, the territorial characteristics, and the number of health
facilities.  In reality, the final amounts are negotiated by the commission members and derive from the
theoretical formula-driven amounts. The current input-based flow of health funds from the MOF to the MOH
and to municipalities does not provide the opportunity to set incentives for expenditure management in the
public sector. The Health Care Commission Agency (HCCA) i s responsible for contractual arrangements
between MOHand healthproviders. However, HCCA encounters serious limitations inplayingthis role.

Compared with neighboring countries, Kosovo spends a similar percentage of the total government budget on
health, but gets less health outcomes for the money. The limited public health finance envelope should thus be
allocated to improve efficiency inthe provision of care and the population's health status.

Utilization rates in PHC facilities seemto be low, considering that only 47 percent of the women interviewed in
the 2003 DHS reported visiting a health facility for either themselves or their children in the last 12 months.
HIS diagnostic hospital information suggests that PHC facilities do not fulfill their gate-keeper and referral
function. Consequently, a relevant proportion of hospital contacts are requested for problems that should be
dealt at the PHC level, pointingto efficiency gains by PHC centers playing their gate-keeper role.

SCOPEOFWORK

The objective of the assignment will be to change the current health allocation system from the MOF to
municipalities to include a performance-based element that rewards providers for contributing to improve
quality of care, and efficiency in the provision of care. The work will build on the experience of an earlier
provider payment pilot designed with support from the Bank-financedEducation and HealthProject.

The technical assistance will work with MOH to further define, design, test, evaluate and plan for possible
roll-out a new provider payment system, which harbors the incentives to improve effectiveness and efficiency
of patient treatment at the primary health care level and reduces unnecessary referrals to specialists and
hospitals. Inthis connection, the consultants will:

(i) analyze the current provider paymentmechanisms inuse and design a provider payment system,
develop specific contracts outlining goals, related indicators and performance benchmarks. The contracts will

consistent with legislation ineffect at the time of the a~signment;'~

(ii) identifyinformationneedslflowandhelpadjusttheexistinghealthinformationsystemdesignedwith

(iii) train HCCA,other staff and participating providers in the essentials of the new system, including
development of training programs and materials and delivery of formal and on-the-job training. This will
promote change from input to performance-based incentives and allocation of resources;

(iv)      provide guidance and support duringimplementation to ensure:

           funds for primary health care facilities; to interpret results on provider performance against
           benchmarks specified inthe contracts and specify payments for family medicine teams;
      0    To communicate providers' performance results to ensure transparency, accountability and to increase
           peer-pressure for better performance;

       Annex 17: TOR for Strengtheningthe Financial Sustainabilityof the Road Sector



BACKGROUND

The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has received a technical
assistance grant to support the strengthening of public expenditure management. The grant will finance
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG) in budget formulation, budget execution, and procurement, as well as specific policy
and procedural reforms inthe health and transport sectors.

The road network in Kosovo amounts to an estimated 8,50Okm, comprising 647km of main, or
Magisterial, roads, 1,304 km of secondary roads, 571 km of city roads and approximately 6,000 km of
rural roads, of which the vast majority of the latter i s unpaved. The main and regional road network has
been estimated to carry 60 percent of all vehicle journeys. There i s little robust data on the quality of the
road network, but one recent studyI5 estimated that 35 percent of the paved network required
reconstruction or rehabilitation, and that 97 percent of the unpaved network requires upgrading. It i s also
estimated that all bridges and structures are inneed of urgent repair, with the exception of those that have
been recently constructed.

The responsibilities for managing and maintaining the road network in Kosovo are split between the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) of the Kosovo Provisional Institutions of Self
Government (PISG), which is responsible for the Main and Regional road network, and the 30
Municipalities, which are responsible for local roads. Within the MTC, the programming of maintenance
i s the responsibility of the Department of Roads (DOR), with the supervision of works being undertaken
by an implementing agency, the Directorate of Roads (DIR). The split of responsibilities between these
two units was formalized inan Administrative Instructiondated September 8, 2003.


The funding for the maintenance of the road network i s allocated to the MTC, as part of its overall
budget, by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MFE) from the Kosovo Consolidated Budget (KCB).
A recent study for the World BankI6concluded that the present allocation was insufficient to meet the
maintenance and rehabilitation needs of the sector. The overall funding requirement for the whole
network i s estimated at 14 million per annum for routine maintenance and 48 million per annum for
rehabilitation, suggesting a total annual funding requirement for the whole road network of 62 million.
The current expenditures were estimated as amounting to 15 million for MTC and some 11.8 million at
the Municipallevel, suggesting a current funding gap of some 35 million per year.

The earlier study made a number of recommendations to try and close this funding gap, and this technical
assistance has been provided to assist the MTC and the M E to confirm the earlier analysis and define a
detailed action planto introduce those recommendations.


OBJECTIVES

The primary objective of this assistance is to assist the MTC and the MFEto define a detailed action plan
to introducedefined mechanisms to addressthe fundinggap inrecurrent expenditures inthe road sector in

        expenditures, potentialneeds, and the estimated fundinggap, in the sector;
    0   To identifykonfirmappropriate measures to address that gap, interms of changes inthe structure
         and level of road user charging system, introductionof transit taxes, increasesinfuel duty and

        Model of the World bank; and
    0   To detail an action plan, agreed with all official stakeholders, of the legislative and procedural
        changes necessary to introduce these measures.


THESCOPEOFTHEASSISTANCE

The assistancei s being provided to establish a system, which mhieves cost recovery, on a user-pays basis,
and provides for sustainable and secure road needs financing. It i s expected this will include confirmation
of the previous analysis of current road user cost recovery and infrastructure user charging, for all road
classes. The primary concern i s to achieve and secure adequate levels on maintenance and rehabilitation
fundinginthe short term, with development needs to be considered as a longer-term option once the loan
financing is available.

The followingrepresent the specific activities envisaged to be required to meet these objectives:

Task 1 A comprehensivereview of the earlier Road User Charges Studv
The consultant should review, confirm and update the analysis contained in the earlier road user charging
study.

Task 2 The identificationof current and potentialfinancingneeds
The consultant should identify potential recurrent and capital funding requirements, based on the
comprehensive assessment of the condition of the road network and associated structures, which i s to be
undertaken by the M T C in the spring of 2005, and estimate the current and future funding gap in the
sector in terms of financing requirements, under a number of realistic scenarios. This review should also
consider the elements to be included in a common accounting framework for assessing the various road
infrastructure costs at a national level (principally internal costs at this stage).

Task 3 A review of the current Road User Charging System
The consultant should review the principles to be used in calculating road costs and review and describe
indetail the current system for road user charginginKosovo. This review shouldcover the revenuefrom
the current system, the equity of the system, in terms of the overall objective of cost recovery for each
vehicle class.

Task 4 An assessment of the effectivenessand coverage
The consultant should also, in collaboration with the Kosovo Police Force, consider the effectiveness of
the current system, including an assessment of the extent of avoidance, on the part of users, and the
revenue implications, and an assessmentof the effectiveness of current sanctions, in terms of recovery of
imposed fines for individuals and firms.




                                                       66

Task 5 The identificationof suitable measures
The consultant should confindidentify clear recommendations to address the funding gap, and achieve
the objective of cost recovery for each user class. The scope of the recommendations i s expected to focus
on the structure and level of road user charging system; the enforcement regime and the scale of the legal
sanction; and the introduction of appropriate transit taxes.            This will also include and reflect an
assessment of the affordability of each of the recommendations. The consultant should also review and
recommend appropriate changes in terms of the scale of road user charges necessary, if the environmental
and social externalities of road use, consistent with EU transport policy, are to be included in the road
user charging systemin future.

Task 6 The definitionof an Action Plan
The final task is the development of a detailed action plan, agreed with all stakeholders, of the requisite
legislative and procedural changes necessary to introduce these measures, together with a timetable for
their introduction.

Indeveloping the recommendations interms of the structure and scale of the systemofroadusercharges,
the following, inter alia, EUrequirements and guidelines are to be considered:

    0    Minimumrates oftax (registration charges) for heavy goods vehicles are stipulated inCouncil
         Directive 1999/62/EC. This directive also covers tolls and user charges;

    0    Council Directive 1999/62/EC specifies maximumvalues of user charges reflecting the damaging
         effects of heavy axle loads; and

    0    Minimumrates of fuel tax are stipulated inCouncil Directives 92/8UEECand 92/82/EEC, as
         amended respectively by 94/74/EC and 96/1/EC.
