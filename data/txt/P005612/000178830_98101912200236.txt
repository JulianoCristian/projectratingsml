-v-
vi.        5NI has good business prospects.  It expects its approvals
in 1973 to be somewhat down from the exceptionally high record of
1972.  It is expected that approvals, over the period 1974-77 will
increase by at least 5 - 6% per year. SNI will nead fresh resources
early in '973.    It counts on tbe availability of a new credit line
from SIDA and a first loan from KfW. SNI is trying to diversify its
resources both at home and in the Euro-currency market to supplement
its resource needs. In the short term it is likely to be more success-
ful in securing Dinar resources, particularly through bond issues.
For the balance of its needs to finance imports. SNI is expecting a
fifth Bank loan.  A proposed loan of $14K.( million will enable SNI
to carry Lts estimated financing program throtgh the end of 1'78 
vii.      The terms of the nroro.sed loAn shmild hi, thn.va nneium.7 v
applied to Bank loa-,s ,o development finanr companies. including
the stanriar  commitment charge.  Under the last Bank hpp. SNI'l
debt/equity limit was h:1, the free limit was $2C0.CX and the
aggregate free limit was set at 25$ of the loan. 'The IJ:1 debt equity
limit should be retained in the proposed $14 million loan, a-i, the
aggregate free limit should be $4.0 million.  ,iven the increase
in the size of SNI's Frojects. the imi7rovenent in SNI's appraisals.
and the rise in costs due to inflation and dollar devaluation - the
free lnimt above which Bank arproval of a subpro,ect ts required
should be raised from $200,CCO to -$40.(OC. The term loans to hotel
prc.ects financed out of Ban'; funds should be available ou  to 2C years
in cases where this is warranted. Financing of industrial investment
,ro,'ects should remain limited, as in previous loans, to 15 years.
Contrary to the last Bank loan, nc restriction need be imposed on
the use of Bank funds for loans and investments in public sector en-
terprises. provided-there is no change in SNI's policy which limits
its public sector assistance to 25sb of total portfolio.
viii.     Arrangements have been made for th'e Bank to review, by
the middle of 1M73, progress SNI has nade in its reorganization,
rarticularly in collection, technical arpraisal and fullow-up. The
metholoi.gy to be used by SNI in the economic justification of its
Trojects would also be reviewed at that time In the light of the
findings of a mission from the Operations Evaluation 4ivision of the
Bank. now in the field.



I. riTRODUCTICN
1.01      The Societe Nationale d'Investissement (SNI) was formed in
1959 and then -cdorganized in 1965 with the help of the Hank Group.
The purpose of SNI is to provide term financing for industry and
tourism in Tunisia, in both t,he public and orivate sectors. SNI
has so far received four Bank loans totaling .`535 irillion, the last
of which amounted to .10 million and was signed on February 9, 19?2.
In holds 20% of the companv's shares.  The most recent report on
the economy of Tunisia, "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of TunisiaP' (ii-7?-210). was distriluted to the Executive Directors
on September 1, 1972. A detailed review of the tourism sector can
be fould in `.opraisal of the Tourism Infrastructure Project -
Tunisia," (;'-7_-136-A, IDA/R-72-55-A), June 5, 1972.
II.  SNI'S ECONOMIC &VISON!EiNT
General Economic Performance
'.Q1      in 1970, Tunisia initiated a new development strategy which
called for relaxing admiristrative controls and reducing Government
intervention  in the economy.  The objectives ast-'blished were an
a^ceLeration in the growth rate, an increase in exports uid employ-
ment, support to production activities in the private sector, and
encouragement )f foreign investment in selected sectors. As a result
of very favorable we.ther conditions *or agriculture as well as im-
plementition of the new development policies, Tunisia's GDP at con-
stant Prices rose '9y about 9d in 1971% compared to an average rate
of about ); for the 1960-70 period.  GNP per capita in 1971 was $235,
while population growth was about 2.t'.
..02      The sestoral composition of GDP in 1971 was 17% agriculture,
21' industry, ?6% services, and 36% Government and other.  Due ori-
marily to record harves's of olives and cereals, agricultural output
.ncreased 90'" in 1971, to an all-time high of D 120 million.  Agri-
culture emoloys nearly half the labor force, while industry employs
30,. of all non-agricultural workers in T'unisia. 'Ithough tourism
only accounte-  for  ' of GDP in 1971, it became the largest source
of foreign exchange earnings, provided subst'ntial dire^t and indirect
employment, ind increased its contribution to GDP by 51A over the
previous year.
?.03      The balance of payments oosition was strengthened consider-
ably in 19?1, due mainly to much higher %gricult-rnl exmorts, the
expansion of tourt-i and emigrant workers' remittancec, and the in-
crease in external cipital flow   The ertimated total napit-il inflow
in 1971 was .; 75.- million -- D '    million in public capital and
n ??,.8 aillion in private,  Foreign exch;nge hold:ngs of the Central
tlank at end 1Q71 exceeded five months of corliodity iinports, an -zi-
precedented Level for Tunisia.  1)ue to this rem,rkable improvement,
debt serviee dropped from  2'- in 1970 to 1F3, in 1971.  In 1971 the
authorities  -   njtm  their t  li ,L' :t thl tore L'n txc'Korn-,L

geographical pcsition, its association with the ESC,-  and the avail-
ability of relatively cheap and trainable labor provide a favorable
environment for export-oriented industries. As a result of admini-
strative -1easuren taken and the new legislation, 440 private industri2al
projects, amounting to an investment of D 25.)! million, ware appruved
in 197i, compared to 270 projects of D 8.1 million in 19?0.  The Govern-
ment is now defining thc statutes for an investment promotion agency to
centralize this ar.tirity and expedi9e investment approvals.  Once esta-
blished, this agency will focus, in particular, on promoting investment
in exnort-oriented and labor intensive projects which will take advant-
age o:' Tunisia's -sso.-iation with the EEC.
2.08      Tourism.  Annex 1 gives basic statistics on recenttrends in tourism
development.  International tourism has developed impressively in
Tuni:`.- in the last decade. Foreign visitor arrivals have incieased
at an innual rate of 30%, rising from  .6,0OG  in 1961 to 608,000 in
1971. During the same !eriod, gross foreign exchange earnings from
tourism increased from 'JS$3 million to an estimated US$112 million and
is now the largcst revenue item in Tunisia's balance of payments.Given
the low wages and prices prevailing in the ccuntryy,vth yearly bed
occupancy rates being generally high, the TuniFi-n hotel industry is in a
good position t9o compete with its Mediterranean :,Ialz.
?.09      Tourism Policies.  The (Government actively supported tourism
developnent durLng the 1960's with such measures as a five year tax
holiday for new hotels, a rebate of up to 3, on interest Faid by hotel
borrowers, and azsistance to investors in obtaining hotel sites.?v In
the light of the tourism boom oaring the past three years, it has be-
come apparent, however, that Tunisia's various incentives are not
commensurate w~ith actuaL nec;, are granted too indiscriminately, and
involve a mu)tinlicity- of laws and regulatiorns which are difficult to
administer -and unclear to investors. The Government, through the
Office Nationale du Tourism and Thermalisme (ON-T), is undertaking a
szudy assessing the tourism incentive scheme and possibilities for
its reorganization.  The Government is projecting a doubling of Tunisia's
income from tourism by 1977 and has advanced to 1981 the 1,500,000
foreign visitor arrivals target, originally set for 1985. This target,
which imDlies an average a,nnual tourism growth rate of about 9%, seems
reasonable in light of past trends, outlook for the development of the
potential marlket, and Tunisia's comparative co:;t advantages over sone
of its Mediterranean ccmpetitors.
-inancial Environment
'.10      Besides Governmertal institutions, Tunisia's
1/ Tunisia's current agreement with the EEC is effective untiL l7b. at
which time renegotiation is anticipated. The EEC grants Tunisia
duty free entry for most industrial prolitcts, and reductions ranging
fron 50 to 100',0 on some agricultural products.   linisia, in turn,
gives the EEC tariff and quota conceo-1ius.
V/ The incentives are descr.bed in det.iil in 'pspraisa2 of the
Tourism Infrastructure Project - Tanisia" (R-72-13'-A, IDA/R-72-55-A),

financial community is composed of 12 commercial banks, two investment
banks, two development finance companies, h5 local mutual credit banks,
and several insurance companies.  Of the 12 commercial banks, there are
nine which are Tunisian owned and three which are branches of foreign
baLncs.  The Government-controlled Societe Tunisierne de Banque (ST3) end
Banque NTationale Tunisienne (ONT) are by far the biggest banks in the
country, accounting for about two-thirds of total credit to the economy
and about half of total deposits. BNT specializes in the agricultural
sector while STS is involved with all other sectors of the economy;
both banks are closely involved with public sector enterprises and both
also make term loans. The ten smaller commercial banks in Tunisia are
primarily occupied with short- and medium-term lending (up to a maximum
of five years). The two institutions classed as investment bankls are
S5I and the newly formed Banque Generale d'Investissement (2(1I). Of the
two development finance companies, one -- Compagnie Financiere et
Touristique (COFITOUR) -- specializes in financing tourism; 16.5Z of
its shares are held by SN'I and 208 by IFJ.
2.11      Total rezources of the banking system increased by about 21'
during 1971, rising from D 365 million to D L38 million.  Economic
growth and an increase in foreign exchange earnings, foreign aid inflows
and the Government budget all contributed to this rapid growth in de-
posits. Interest rates paid on deposits range from 15, on demand deposits
to 5.5 on time deposlts.  The Central Rank rediscount rate varies fron
on export paper to 8' on rediscounts above a bank's particular ceiling;
the normal rediscount rate is 5%.
2.1?      Total bank credit rose by 15$  in 197i, as indicated below

The Central Bark believes that, after ad.usting for the large volunc
of short-term credits which are rolled over, contractual and de facto
medium- and long-term credits in 1971 could be estimated st about half
of all credit extended.
2.13      The interest rates presently charged by the commercial banks
for loans and advances range from 4.75% to d.0% for operations in-
volving rediscountable paper. In the case of nonrediscountable paper,
the rates may exceed 8%. The interest rates ire lowest, 4.75% - 5.75%,
for financing of exports, rediscount of which is at a preferential
Cnetral Bank rate. Rates for seasonal crpp financing range between
b% and 6.75%. Agricultural and industrial medium-term loans carry
rates varying between 6.25% and 7.25%, provided they meet the redis-
count criteria of the 'entral Bank. riost other medium-term loans that
are rediscountable are subject to rates varying between 7.25% and 8%.
For non-rediscountable medium-term loans, the banks are free to charge
rates on the basis of negotiatiot with the client. Long-term loans
(of five year3 or more) cost 8-9%.  lus a commitment fee, and are not
no rmmIly rediscountable.

2.1L      ,The Stock Exchanpe.  The Tunisian stock exchange was created
in 1969 and began functioning in 1970. All share transactions of in-
corporated companies must, by law, be handled by the stock exchange.
Instruments zarketed in the exchange as of June, 1972, included Govern-
ment bonds, bonds bearing the guarantee of Government-controlled in-
stitutions, the shares of Tunisian companies, foreign bonds or shares
offered to Tunisian buyers, and foreign exchange contracts.  Nineteen
Tunisian cormpanies are quoted while all other shares are traded over-
the-counter on a bid/asked basis. SNI is one of the ten brokers
authorized t.c operate on the stock exchange.  Because of the profits
generated in the econony during 1971 and the high liquidity of the
banking systen, the demand for shares has recently been much greater
than the supply (demand can only be satisfied for 19 quoted stocks
which consequently rise in price; all other stocks are traded on a
bid/asked basis).  There is a lack of sellers in the market because
many Tunisian companies, whether family-owned or Government-controlled,
wish to avoid the risk of outsiders acquiring enough shares to assert
influence or gain control. Although the market is thin and the stock
exchange sti-l in i ts infancy, the institution is definitely developing.

with the .entral Sank a-nd the appropriate Goverrnent ministries (r-inance,
Planninn, and  iaticnal Econoay) are satisfactory.  The Government is
ready to continue helping StI in obtaining financial assistance from
foreign bilateral and multi-lateral sourcer.

from  the rublic sectcr and, throug  .the intermedi-try of 'Government

estimc.ted :t .bout `d p.a#J while SNI's cost averages out to t>> - 7T.
Thus, there is _- 2;' differentia1 which gives ST!3 2 markecd advantage
over SNI.  ST'-. can charge a medium- or long-term borrowe.r  % and still
have - greater spread than SNI, which charges 9".  CCFICUM  has received
about D 1.3 million in a Government grant and long term-loan, which
results in in average cost of ftLncs much lower than S;JI5's and perrLiti
COFITOU.I to charge '4; on its loans.  The (loverna-ent has recently in-
dicated that it is reviewing the lnterest I-ate fitructure in Tunisia.

borrowings, the Government 'unds deposited writh it at liiv.tie or

This rev4ew which will be completed in the first half of 1973 is
likely to result in changes in Ute banking regulations anI the interest
rate structares.  This may have an important effect on SNI and on its
relationship to its competitors. iBut it is too soon to prognosAicate
w-hat the changes or their effect will be.  This matter will be dis-
cussed between the Rank and the Go-vernment within the framework of
tile Bank's economic work in Tunisia.
2.17       SNI c'c'asiona1ly engages in Joint lendinr, operatioits with
ST3, COF=7tO'JR, and other ban,.s. The mntber of these operations in-
creased during 1971.  Hoiowever, SNI's ligher -interest rate and more
stringent proJect evaluation procedu ve  some times create problems
for joint financing.  SNIfs most not.'6!c examples of joint lending

between the terms of its resources, and since time deposits in
Tzdsia are not blocked and can be withdrawn, SNI needs to have resort
to the rediscounting facilities of the Central Bank. SNI is now
seeking approval from the Central Bank to rediscount maturities of
up to 5, or even 7 years out of its term loans.
Pesource Allocation
3.03      SNI's contribution to total investments (on a disbursement
basis) in Tunisia's industry has doubled in three years, from 5% in
1969 to 10% in 1971; the estimate for 1972 is 22% of the total (see
Annex 3). The principal causes of this doubling in SNI's share of
the financing were the increased availability of resources to SNI
(Bank and SIDA loans) and a relative decline in total industrial in-
vestment (manufacturing excepted) since 1969 due to a slowdown of
public sector investments, thereby making SNI's share of industrial
financing relatively larger. Also. SNI obtained more new business
because prospective clients are attracted by the untied foreign ex-
change which SNI makes available.  Finally, SNI's principal com-
petitors, BNT and STB, were so heavily committed to public sector
indlustries that the new and growing private sector manufacturers
more or less had to gravitate to SNI; until very recently SNI focused
on private sector industry, leaving public sector enterprises to STB
and MNT. In tourism despite a 60% increase in SNI's investments
projected for 1972 over 1969, SNI will only have enlarged its share
of tota-l tourism investment from 15% to an estimated 20%. Since
tourism investment is at least 40% self-financed and considering
that COFITOUR has been in this field for three years, SNI's 20%
share is consequently a significant contribution.
3.0114    SI Financing of Industr . A summation of SII's outstanding
loans and equity investments as of December 31, 1971, totaling D 13.6
million, is shown in Annex L. About 11% of SNI's portfolio investments
are in textiles and clothing. Transportation comes next with 7%, of
which half represents medium-term credit and constitutes the major part
of SNI's total medium-term loans. The third category of major SNI in-
vestments comprises five fields of activity - construction, foodstuffs,
metals and machinery, wood and cork, and press and publishing - each
having 3 - 4% of toal portfolio (D 400,000 to D 600,000). Except for
transportation, these investment categoiies receiving  SNI's major
assistance are either established as profitable industrial activities
or viewed by the Government as growth industries. The dispersion of
SNI's investments in a large number of fields is a sound practice and
in accordance with SNI's policy.
3.05      SNI did not lend to the public sector until 1969.  Hfowever,
by 1971, public sector enterprises were receiving 32". of SNI's loans
to industry; for 1972, the percentage will decline slightly. SNI's
policy statement (a) limits the amount of assistance which can be
extended to public enterprises to 25" of SNI's total outstanding
commitments, and (b) requires that SNI Board approval be unanimous
when approving loans to or investments in public sector companies.



-8-
This trend in lending to public sector enterprises deserves parti-
cular attention.  Publicly owned industries in Tunisia are, in general,
heavily indebted, have operational problems, and are not profitable.
It is the Government's intention to reorganize many of these enter-
prises and to have SNI and other banks share the credit burden which,
heretofore, has been borne by STB and BNT. Although SNI's policy
constraints are important safeguards, SNI should nevertheless continue,
as it has been doing so far, to lend to public sector ente-nrises
only when the borrower is as creditworthy as clients in the private
sector. SNI's character as an institution primarily for private
sector lending should not be diluted.
3.06      SKI Financin  of Tourism.  Annex 3 shows SNI's contribution
(disbursements) to tourism investment in Tunisia since 1969. SNI pro-
vided an average oi 17% a year of total tourism in-sstment over the
four-year period, 1969-1972. At the end of 1971, SNI's 17 loans and
9 participations in hotels and tourism amounted to D 6.5 million, or
48% of its total portfolio.!/ The other major lenders in tourism are
COFITOUR and ST3, the latter often financing short-term suppl"e.s'
credits and construction, some of which is subsequently converted
into term loans.  COFlTOUR's outstanding loans and investments to
tourism at end 1971 were n b.2 million, with iuother D 3.8 million
committed but undisbursed.
3.07      SNI and the other institutions financing tourism have not
had enough experience in lending to this sector. Many of the hotel
owners are new to the toiurism business and  vn-w little about
designing hotel projects. As a result, of the SNI loans over three
months in arrears, 85% represent late payments of interest and prin-
cipal on hotel loans. There are two aspects to this problem: the
start-up difficulties usually encountered by hotel projects during
the first few years of operations, and the repayment schedule on
-%I's hotel loans which is too short. SNI is now more qualified
to give advice on hotel operatimns; for example, it recommends that
hotel borrowers book tour groups during the first few years of
operations in order to ensure occupancy. As for the repayment sche-
dule, SNI is planning to extend the terms of some of its hotel loans (see
para. LL.C2)- To chec. hotel design. SNI will strengthen its staff o. engineers.
Characteristics
3.08      Size and Location.  Details on the geographical distribution
ar.m a-Ize of SNI's commitments over the past three years are given in
Annex 5. The geography of Tunisia and the pattern of its economic
growth are such that the industry SNI finances will continue to be
centered around Tunis and Sfax, Gabes, and other towns having secon-
dary importance. About 1:3% of the projects in 1971 were for less
than D50,000, versus 25% in 1970 and 35% in 1969; with few exceptions
these loans were all extended to industries, not hotels. The growing
importance of small- to medium-size companies owned by Tunisian
entrepreneurs explains the increase in SNI's lending to such enter-

-9-
less than D 50,000; in 1971, over half of SNI's loans were also for
amounts under D 50,000.
3.09      Foreign Exchange.  The percentage of import financing (dis-
bursement basis) in SNI's lending activities is as f3llows:
To June 30,
-1970                  1        972
Foreign         Foreign        Foreign
Rxchange Dinars Exchange Dinars Exchange Dinars
Industry         91%       9%    83%     17%       58%     42%
Tourism          62%      3              29%       37% 6l
of Total     79%      21%    78%     22%       48e     52%
Although the ratio for 1972 is skewed because the figures are for only
six months, there is in fact a general trend in Tunisia towards a re-
duction  in the foreign exchange requirements of industrial and hotel
investments because, as the nascent manufacturing sector grows, local
procurement of equipment and material becomes possible. The comDosition
of SNI's existing resource base, reflecting action on earlier pro-
jections of investment requirements in Tunisia, gives z. lending ratio
of 20 - 25% local currency and 75 - 80% foreign exchange.  In the
future, however, SNI expects to increase the proportion of its Dinar
resources in order to m,eet the changing financial requirements of
its borrowers.
3.10      As for the foreign exchange earnings of projects financed
by SNI, for the 1965-1970 period about 20C  (by amount) of SNI's loans
to the industrial sector were for tro`ects that were predominantly
export-oriented, i.e. projects that export over half of their pro-
duction.  In 1971, export-oriented industries' share of SNI'stotal
financing rose to 30/.  In tourism, each hotel bed financed by SNI
earns an average of at leact D 1,300 per year in foreign exchange.
SNI participated in financing hotel projects with about 12,000 beds.
3.11      Employment.  SNI estimates that the industrial projects
it has financed since 1970, having a total cost of D 19.9 million
and receiving S14I loans to-.aling D 10.1 million, have added about
2,875 jobs to the Tunisian econoMy -- at a cost of about  ALl,300
per Job.    The same figures since 1970 for tourism are D 28.5
million in total investment, D 5.9 million in SNI financing, and
4,388 jobs created at a cost of about $13,500 per job. Sll is aware
of the Government's target of creating 30,000 new jobs each year
and SNI3s appraisal of projects takes this po'icy into account.
3.12      Economic Benefits.  Pursuant to understandings reached
during negotiations for the last Bank loan, and starting in 1972,
SNI began to collect and analyze, more systematically than in the
past, data on the contribution made by its projects on the Tunisian
economy, especially as it regards the effective protection enicyed
by the enterprises it finances. Although the sanple of projects
subjected to this type of analysi3 i3 still small, tht!,r i-ndicate

that SNK's financing, has considerable economic merit.  eut a more substantial
data base in characteristics o' induAtrial project.s is reLuLred to confirm this
judc;rent.  Certiin  .-r3pects are clesr, however: hotel projects qre substantial
foreign exchange exirners and create employment At the ratio of about one job for
every two beds.  A.- regeards indu,itr:LI projects, the Bank is currently reviewing

Ownership
h.Ch      There has been no significant change in ownership since
the previous 9ank loan was appraised. Annex 7 shows tlb ownership
structure as of June 30, 1972. About two-thirds of the shares are
owned by Tunisians, including the 2'?  by the public sector.  SNI
is widely held with about 35,000 shareholders.  IFC owns 20`Z of the
shares and 15  are in the hands of several foreign shareholders,
the largest being Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
with 6%  f SNI's capital.
Board and Executive Committee
h.u5      The composition of SNI's lb-member Board of Directors is
given in Annex R. Mr. Hlabib Bourguiba Jr., SNI's President and
Director General, is the Chairman and represents the lovernmnent.
At the June, 1972 General Assembly the following changes were made
in the Board: four direct;rs, instead of three, were elected to
represent SNI's private shareholders, while the number of directors
representing the Government and public sector institutions was
decreased from six to five. Dr. A.A. Khosr'pur has represented
FC on SNI's Boari since 1969.

efforts in th4E re;gardi and has agreed to rr vide  ts Bo;t l i 'rers

Manage:Aent and Staff
4.C7     SNI's chief executive, Mr. Habib Bourguiba Jr., was appointed
on March 8, 1971. During his first nine months on the job he initiated
changes aimed at improving coordination within SNI and carrying through
the reorganization which had first been proposed in 1970. Tn December
1971, Mr. Bourguiba was incapacitated by a stroke. He is recovering
slowly and has not yet been able to assume fully his responsibilities.
Mr. Moncef Belkhodja, SNI's previous President, and Mr. Fakfak, who
was appointed SNI's Deputy Director General in June 1971, have been
in e-'fect co-nanaging SNI in the absence of Mr. Bourguiba.  '4r. Fakfak
appears to be coping adequately with SNI's operations, but his ability
to run SNI alone has still to be tested.
4.A.      Of SNI's 96 employees, 36 are professionals.  The division
of work was modified in January 1972 when 1i.t was reorganized (the
new organiziation chart is given in jnnex 9). There are now four
Departments- Promotion and Control, Appraisals, Treasury, Md Secu7ities.
Overall, the new organizational set-up seems to be having beneficial



- 12 -
results. Except in one case (Promotion and .ontrol), Department
Directors' responsibilities are more in line with their capabilities,
tasks are  more homogeneously structured and, consequently, efficiency
and quality of work has improved. The implementation of the reorganiza-
tion, which has the full attention of SNI's management, is still going
on and should be effectively completed by mid-1973. SNI management
recognizes that even though a new system has been established, con-
siderable effort is still needed to carry through on the details re-
lating to operations, such as defining tasks, establishing guidelines,
and improving the nanagement information system. To help SNI in this
effort, the CCCE is currently providing technical assistance, parti-
cularly in organizing the Treasury Department and the Follow-up
Division.
SNI's Technical Advisor, a senior engineer, has been respon-
sible for project appraisal since January 1972. His contribution has
already been noticeable and should bring further improvements when
sufficient staff, engineers in particular, have been hired for this
work.
4.10      On& of SNI's major problems was attracting and retaining
promising staff.  SNI's salary scale wasnot competitive with private
industry.  SNI management is now making efforts to offer itz employees
better conditions and to emphasize promotion opportunities based on
merit.
Procedures
4.11      Project Appraisal.  SNI's project appraisals have improved
considerably since the beginning of 1972 as a result of iinproved staff
and of understandings reached with the 3ank on the content of appraisal
reports. SNI's analyses now deal more fully with a project's manage-
nent, past financial history, and market prospects as well as dealing
specifically with the financial rate of return, economic rate of return,
and degree of protection provided. Sometimes there are lapses or
small errors in the appraisals, and cortinued care in reviewing them
is needed. Technical analysis are also weak at times, especially on
tourism projects for which SNI lacks suificient expertise. Continued
improvements are expected in SNI's appraisal work as a result of SNI's
reorganization and of its plan to hire an adequate staff to review
the technical aspects of projects; it is planning to hire one or two
engineers specialized in hotel construction in 1973. SNI recently
started to collaborate with COFITOUR on all tourism projects they
would finance jointly.
4.12      Given the increase in the size of hotels in Tunisia (up to
n.i1 over 1,500 beds), it is essential that technical experts scruti-
nize these large investments. However, at present there are no
architectural-engineering consultant firns ("control bureaus") in
Punisia, although the need for their services is becoming pressing.
For this reason. the Bank urged SNI and the tourism authorities to
contract when necessary the services of foreign control bureaus to
review the architecture, engineering, and conceptualization of large
hotel proJects and to supervise their construction. SNI has agreed
tc investigate this possibility.

h.13       ProJect 3upervision.  Until Lecently, SNI's follow-up
-ctivities were inadequate. Following the understanding reached
with the Bank during negotiations for the Fourth Loann, 3NI set out
to improve its supervision of borrowers by establishing a separ4te
division in the Promotion and Control Department to deal with this
function. The division head is experienced and, with the techni^al
assistance of CCCE, is currently implementing improved methods.
SNI has given priority to collec'ions qnd to foliowing up on clients
who are In Jifficulty.  It is visitinZ all clients in arrear,3 and,
as a consequence, is establisring i plan of action for each one with
whom an arrangement has not already been worked out.  Recently the
staff ias increased from 3 to 5 and an engineer will 'e added soon.
The consultant from IESC (paragraph 3.12) is also expected to assist
S!I in its supervision of borrowers.
4.14       Promotion.  SNI did not systematically undertake Lny pro-
motional activity in the past, primarily because it wa_n't necessary.
The prospective borrowers in the private sector often had few alter-
native sourzes for tenin money and so S1I, which was Appealing because
of its source of freely usable forei.n exchange, attracted business
with little or no effort.  In the reorganization implemented in 19??,
a department desling with promotir,n was establi:ied, but so far its
contribution has been slight since qualified personi!l to do the Job
have yet .o be employed.  Since January of 1272, there ha.- been a
noticeable 'improvement in 6'NI's woricndj relations.-ip with t`ie  entre
'ntionil d'Etudes InJustrielles (CN-I), a Government rcsearcrh agency

types of industries which Tunioii woulb4 .ielcome anSi on the problems
such industries would encounter when establislin- themselvea.  At
present, PII does not yet have the expertise to assume this role.
SNI's management recognizes this and the difliculty to implerent a
good promotion section.  As a first step SNI hao requestedi TtNIDO's
assistance for advice in methods and to get senior staff nble to
organize SUI's action in this respect.  This rri-tter would h-:ve to
be followed up. The Bank should be re-aidy to assist when it can.

The decline in loan activity during 1971 compared to 1970 W3a due
to the excellent harvests and the tourism boom which generated the
needed funds for some of SKI's potential borrowers; there arc also
indications tha-t some borrowers turned to short-term credit, because
they wanted to wait until the end of the year before calculating
long-term credit requirements. The postponement of credit requests
until 1972 by several large prospective borrowers shows up in the
sharp increase in che smount of SNI's loan approvals during 1972.
5.03      SNI's equity portfolio contained, at the end of 1971, holdings
in 35 Tunisian companies with the value of the investments, at cost,
being D 2.0 million. Daring the first nir.e months of 1972, holdings
in eight companies were sold and new. anares purchased in seven conpanies,
resulting in little change in the total cost of the portfolio. The
..w.st important single equity investment is SNI's D 800,000 capital sub-
scription to COFITOUR, of which D 400,000 has been paid in; the halance
is expected to be called in 1973.
i3valuation of Loan and Equity Portfolio
5.04  R  Auditors' Views.  SNI's auditors, Peat., Marwick, Mitchell
and Co., concluded that the financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 1971 presented fairly the financial position of SNI, sub-
ject to the collectability of certain loans and the realization of
certain investments. As in the previous year, the auditors pointed
out that in Tunisia companies are not legally obligated to prepare
financial statments prior to completion of the first fiscal period of
their operations.  The result of this practice is that the auditors
were not able to obtain financial data on 12 loans and five equity invest-
ments in projects which had Just recently started or not yet commenced
operations; these loans and investments totaled D 1.2 million (10% of
SNI's plrtfolio). On the basis of SNI's follow-up, the operations of
most of these companies are getting under way according to plans.  In
negotiations for the proposed loan, SNI has confirmed   that it will
continue to put all needed pressure on its clients to have in time adequate
financial information on their ope iations. The Government has also indi-
cIte'! it , U  's-,t S3", in tAln i      where ;3icounting regulations could

with tie ,-clicy of SNI's boirc6 whiich liits SNt's tourism  fenuini. to no
rore than - 0  of portfolio.  The arerage loan portfolio outstandiN: during
1971 %as D 10.0 million compared to £ 7.7 zilliozi in 1970; the .vercWe
ci tc of return on the port.folio was 8.3;.1   In the first 10 months *;
'1974, S;i's loan portfolio increased by 19/ to D 13.8 mil1_ oIL.
5.06       S'.:'s loan arre4,r., exdmiined yecr by year, are primaril; a
reflection of the startinC up difficulties experienced in Iunisia's tourism
in(luztry. Principal and interest overdue three months ar nore amounted tc
L} 373,707 (3.2% of loan portfolic) as of December 31, 1911.  Bleven nonths
l-ter, t..e tctal principa' and interest overdue three months or meore had
droppe6 slightly to D 365,j61 (2.6! of loan portfolio), with the out tpndint
rrincip_7l due on these loans being; D 2.3 mill-on (16-; oI: loan portfolio).
Out of this D 2.3 rillion, irf outstanding p-- .ncipal, 93; of the amou-t
represented loans to hotel protects.  The improve.ment in the ;rrears ,itua-
tion during the first eleven nonths of 1572 was due to two factors: the
hotels prospered from the tourism boom, and the increased efforts by SNI to
collect past dues and closely supervise borrower_. began tc bring results.
The economics of hotel investment (see par<.. 3.07), _YI's terms
on hotel loa.ns, and the inexperience of Tunisian entrepreneurs are Frimarily
re^jonriib1e for this arrear_ situation.  The existence of arrears does not
mean, however, that the investments are unwise or the hotels unprofitable
n the longer run.  Rescheduling hotel loans2! with longer gr-ce periocis and
the expeci1ed continuation of the tourism boor., aro factors which should
contribute to a further reductiorn in the airrears of hotel borrowers in 1973.
In addition, SNI ha6 adopted the policy of instituting litigation zgr-inst
certain borrovers as soon as loan principal is six montlhs in arrears, or
interest 12 months in arrears. This new procedure is already bringing 'quicker
results thnn SNI's previouS practice of slow negotiation and prescure w±thout
1 ti6ation.
1/  Although  NI's long-term lending rate is 9s, it ha. snme long-tenr
loans on the books, from an earlier period, at 8Zj; in -ddition,
about 71 of the portfolio is in mediunm-term loans that bear interest
^f 5 - 6%.
/  Resched'ilinr  of loan maturitiec, can be done by SNI's managemeiit,
i.ithout i-: rd approva1, if it does not alter the date of the final
nAturity; any exteans-cn of the amount or the final maturity of a lu.3n
require Buardi sr Dcecutive Cormittee approval.

214I heldi a mortgage cormnitment from the borrover but the nortgage itself
was not yet valid because of lega' complexitles.1/ At the time of nego-
tiati.one (recember, 1971) for the previous Bank loan, SNI ind the Govern-
went agreed to 2oin in an effort to improve the situation.  Since then,
they have .ide considerable progress.  By UIovember 33, 1972, the number
of loans witih inviJid mortgages had decreased to 23 cnd constituted about
2o Of the loan portfolio. Durinr ne:-t-itions for the proposed '.oan, the
cituation wzs reviewed and the Governnent indicated tLat it is giving its
f'ull support to SNI in the validatiori effort.  bNI has adopted a new policy
uherei'y it *.-ill not disburse against new loans until SWI has received copy
of the deec of sale of the land to be mortgaged by its borrower.
5.09      The validation of mortgages is particularly pressing in
the case of aJI's loan to a hotel  (hereafter named hotel A), whose
total arrears of D 12?,000 and outstanding principal of D ?66,000
.amounts to 3" of SNI's portfolio.  Financially, MiI's risk on this
loan would be wel1 covered if the mortgage were valid, which is not
yet the case although 311 has taken appropriate legal action 'o re-
medy this.  SNI also expects the client to ert/er into a management
contr ct with an experienced hotel company. / There is another hotel,
(hereafter called hotel 3), which is in difficulty and has arrears
of D 53,000 and outstanding principal of D 270,000, amounting in
total exposure to ?,. of SNI's portfolio.  As with hotel A, the nort-
gage on hotel 3 is not yet valid, but the Government has indicated
that it is giving full support to SNI 's efforts to obtain valid se-
curity.  To improve the financial conditicn of hotel 2, the borrower
intends to double the capital by December 31, 1972.  The 3ark has
reached an iunderstanding with SNI on measures to be taken in the
fu~ure on both of these troublesome loans.
5.10      Prcvisiors on Loan Portfolic.  At the end of 1971, SINN had
provisiins t.otelming D 67,000 on its lo..ns (D `7,000 for possible un-
recoverable interest and D l,0,000 for doubtfUl toans).  After . cOStl
by ca:, vxuxrnntion of loans in arre:-rs, the .uditors concideredi the:e
provisions to be adequate with the qualific'oTon, however, that  no
ev.iluation on Hotel A (see above par:.graph) could be made due to the
un:-vailability of the necessar7 financial information.  In a supple-
mentary report on SNI's end-1971 accounts (dated June 9, 1972é), the
1/  Most of these loans however were Partly securer by other guarantees
(e.g. chattel r.urtg,ie) but it is e.tir,nted that these gu^rantees,
p-rticulariy with respect to hotel loans, would not cover SNI's ri:.
as well as straieht aiortgagec.

wl...ingness c: the Government to assist SNI in getting an adequa.e security is
encouraging.
5.12      E;.uity Portfolio.  Annex 1, gives details of S!II's equity
holdings in 3  companies as of December :1, 1971.  The actual cost
of these investments to SNI was D 2.0 million; par value is much
hiofrher, at D 2.? million, while the estin.-ted current value is D L.9
million.  The estimate of the current valiue of D >o million was
rate on the basis of the company's stock rtarkef. quotation or unaudited
firancial statement seen by SNI's auditors, except for D 100,000,
which was !ased on the opinion of 3:IT managerent.  Four of the com-
par.es in  NJI's portfolio are listed on the Thnisi&n stock exchange
-nd "Li of them operated profitably in 1971.  SNI actively trades on
its portfolio, the net results in 1971 having been the acquisition of
sh--res in 10 companies and the sale of sh-res in 5 co:mpanies. Cash
dividends declared on the investments held amountej to D 55,738 during
1971, giving an average dividend yield on the portfolio of 2.8-, com-
pared to 2.3< in 1970.  Excluding from this yield celculation the
seven conmpnies started up within the past two years (conprising 14%
of S.1I's equity holdings), the average dividend yield on investments
was L.8'.  It is expected that the return on investments will continue
to rise because of expected returns from hotel enterprises which be-
come more profitable after the first few years of operation.  As of
November 30, 197?1, dividends amounting to D 110,000 had already been
received on SNI's shareholdings, i.e., twice the dividends declared
during all of 1971.
7 T e 'cornmendations can be summnarized as follows: greater efforts
a. ccIl1ection. legal action to obtain r-iabursement. an increase in
caI.talLzat-on of the borrower ar.- a vigcrous aFproach to authorities
in order to get unsecured mortgages properly registered.

5.13       Provisions onE9uitl ?ortlolio.  At the end of 1971, six out
of the 35 companies in SNI's investment portfolio operated at a loss, or
were in fin-nci:U or technical difficulties and bea.r watchint;. The cost
of AVI's holdings in these six companies was D 201,200; the auditors
estimated the value of these shares at D 97,C00  so thiere _s a potential
loss nf D 104,200. There are alsc three equity ir.vestments whose esti-
mated value is D 27,000 beliw SNIts cost, although these three cmrpznies
are now operating profitably.  The net asset value of these nine inves'-
meents is D 128,000 below SNIPs cost, and the auditors recommended that
provicions be made accordingly. SNI management thinks this is not reces-
car- since the par value of its total equity portfolio, as of December 31,
1971, was D 670,000 above SN:t's cost.  As of November 30, 1972, the net
asset value of the aforementioned companies had improved and was D 94,000
below S7!I's cost; simultaneously, the par value of ∞NI total equity port-
folio increased avove the D 670,000 surplus alreidy noted as of Decegber 31,
1971.  rTiven this goo( portfolio performance, SNI's reasons are persuasive
'or not having constituted specific provisions in this res;ect. But since
the situation may change, SNI has agreed to keep the Bank. fully and regu-
'arly inforned3 about the status of its equity holdings.
5.11i    Sunmary Evaluation of Portfolio. At the end of *i71, SNI's
aggregatc equity investments were sWund. profitable and had a total
market value well above the amount shown in SNI's balance sheet.
Th_s assessment has  remained  unchanged in light of the dis Cissions during
negotiati ns vitt; the  Bank in mid-December l'72. In the loan
portfo.lo, the :ndustrial loans are generally secured, but the large
arrear; fr m scrre hotel borrowers require close supervision.
,.15'     It shoulJ be recognized  that SNI has a comfortable cushion
of reserves and surplus qmounting to D 1.1 million, of which D 800,000
are free reserves; in addition, there is a Government grant of D500,000.
Although this cushion is part of SNI's net worth and cannot be con-
sidered as provision against potential losses, the amounts nevertheless
indicate that SNI is in a strong overall financial position and is
creditworthy.
Profitability and Financial Position
5.16      Income.   Annex 10 shows audited income statements for
1969, 1970 and 1971, and the provisional figures for the first half
of 197?. In 1971, profits before taxes were D 342,C0, compared to
D 180,000 in 1970 and D 198,000 in 1969. The 90z. increase in profits
before taxes was due to (a) the low profits of 1970, which are used for
comparison; (b) a one-third inciease in loan interes' earned, while
interest expense on long-term debt increased by only one-fifth; (c)



- 20 -
a 11&. increase in interest earned on short-term  deposit3 j/; and (d)
a D 35,OCC reduction of the allowance for recoverable interest which
was transferred to income, because overdue payments overed by this
allowance were received during 1971 g/. The 1971 profits after taxes
equalled -.6, of share capital and 7.OA of net worth. Because share capital
was douiibled during 1'971, the earnings per weighted average share outstanding
during the year increased only slightly, to D O,465 (9.3, of par) compared
to D o,4h. in 1',70. The after-tax profit was almost double that of lY70)
and was equivalent to 0.6j; of share capital and 5.7,o of net worth. Although
share capital doubled in 1i/71, resulting in a 63,b increase in net worth,
these returns are modest as a result of the relatively small interest
srread SNI has between its borrowing and lending.
5.17      Expenses.  Total expenses increased by 19% over 1970. Cost
of financial resources rose from D 391,000 to D 562,000, followed by
general and administrative expenses which were up about 25% due to a
one-third increase in the number of employees, as well as the upgrading
of certain positions. For 1971, an income tax of D 85,224 was levied
against net earnings of D 3L2s817.
5.18      Dividends. A o% dividend (D 180,000) on 1971 results was
declared by the Board, the same percentage as declared on the opera-
tions of 1970; in 1971 the pay-out ratio was 69.8%. The shareholders
are satisfied with dividends of this order since the income, combined
with the market value of SNI shares which varies from 10% to 20, above
par value, is attractive compared to investment alternatives available
in Tunisia.
5.19      Balance Sheets. Anne"  llshow6 SIt's audited balance sheets
from 1969 to 1971. The financial position at the end of 1971 was sound.
The long-term debt/equity ratio was about 2.3:1 and the debt/equity
ratio as defined in contracts with the Bank was 2.1:1 against a limit
of 4:1. SNI's liquidity position is strong, with a net working capital
of just over D 1.0 million.  Maturities of SNI's long-term liabilities
are balanced with loan maturities.  Government grant, provisions, reservea
and surplus were D 1.7 million (13% of long-term portfolio). The par
value of a share is D 5.0 while book value at end 1971 was D 7.6. The
capital increase effected during 1971 saw SNI's shares (par of n 5.0)
being purchased at a 10% premium. Recently, the shares have been selling
cn a bid/asked basis at D 5.5 per share.
1/ SNI's  epos its with other banks were greatly increased because or
riacements of .rcceeds from SNI's capital stock issuance of t ',ruary,
1y71, and an increase in the amount of funds temporarily managed by SNI for
the Government.
j Thus, SNI reduce,i its total .rovisions on loans froO D 102,cY'0 to D 67,(O.
The transfer to inccme resulted in net Frofits which were sufficient to
meet legal reserve requiirements. ray a 6, dividend, and allocate D 12,500 t,
an employee benefits fund.

VI. FUTURE OPIMATIONS
Economic Outlook
6.01      The current Government forecast for GDM growth in 1972 is
19% at constant prices. Agricultural output is expected to riae by
35% due to favorable weather. Food processing industries will further
expand and contribute, together with agriculture, about 33% of the
total growth.  Output of other ranufacturing industries is alao expected
to accelerate somewhat due to the maturation of large projects in
metal and chemical industries and to larger production capacities in
textile and construction materials. Tourism ehould expand by about
20%, a rate in line with hotel capacity. The increase in mining output
could reach 9% and would depend on progress in the modernization of
phosphate production. Given developaentw in the earlier part of this
year, the Government's 1972 forecasts have a good chance of being
achieved. If thie is so, then the objectives of the Third Development
Plan will also have been achieved and, in some cases, exceeded; for
example, average growth for the 1969-1972 period is likely to be
close to or slightly higher than the Plan's target of 6.5,.
6.am      The next Development Plan, for 1973-76, is in the final
stages of preparation and the main quanLitative obJectives have only
been outlined in a preliminary manner. If the Government adopts the
policies envisaged, the Bank's latest economic mission considers the
Plan to be fairly realistic.  The Government's prl,ary objectives are
a growth rate of 5%, with 1972 as the base year       an aggregate invest-
ment of some D 1 ,000 million, and the creaton of 30,000 jobs per year.
The non-agricultural production sector is regarded as the prine source
of future growth and job creaton, while agricultural growth is expected
to be somewhere between L% and 5% per year.
6.03      In induatry the development strategy initiated in 1970 should
open the door to new prospects based on private initiative and foreign
investment. In the next four years,industrial invest.ents are expected
to contribute 37% of total investments in Tunisia. Almost half of them
would be mde in private enterprises.  Tho main  areas of growth are
likely to be the expansion of petroleum output and, providing the
phosphate industry is reorganized on a competitive basiJ, the increase
Of phosphate output to 5 million tone per year by 1976. On the basis
of preeent proposals for developing manufacturing, it is unlikely
that its growth would exceed 5.5% per year.  However, subJect to an
energetic effort on the part Of the Government to irite-_fy promotional
activities and to implement its new policies, a growth  rate somewhat
over 7% would seem poessble.  The new Plan would become effective at
a point in time when TTnisis is progressing by departing from an era
o  import  ubstitution to  ne where the emphasis is on export and more
1/ 1972 was a year Of exceptional growth; setting this aside, the Plan
target would be equivalent to a Crowth rate of &S' per year.



_ 22 -
6.o4      In tourism, besides projecting a doubling of Tunisia 'a
income from tourism (to $225 million) by the end of the Plan period,
the Government is also forecasting an average annual increase of
b7,400 foreign visitor arrivals--only slightly higher than the 79,500
average experienced from 1965 through 1971. Current and prospective
per capita income levels and income distribution in Europe, Tunisia's
zujor tcurism supply market, should grow rapidly in the coming years,
so the demand for Tunisia's tourism servi.ces seems assured.  Tunisia
is at present the least expensive tourist. destination among North
African and Middle East countries for organized travellers departing
from Europe.  The implementation of the 'ourism infrastructure project
(IBRD $14 million, IDA $30 million) should further improve the coun-
try's competitiveness in terms of servicas. The average annual growth
rate of tourist traffic during this decade is therefore projected at
9-10%.
SNIts O(erationrl Forecsst
6.05      Estimates of SNI's projected operations in the next five
years could vary considerably depending on whether or not SNI actively
promotes new business in industry and tourism. The forecast of
operations for 1973-77 shown in Annex 12 is based on the assumption
that there will be a modest improvement in SNI's capacity in promoting
investments. The 1973-7t projections are mostly based on projects in
the pipeline (total approvals for 1973-7 4 are projected at D 15.h million,
while projects now in SNI's pipeline for study already amount to
D 13.9 million). The projections for 19?4-77 are well-supported by
general prospects for industrial and tourism investments. They are
also in line with the Government's object.ives during the Plan period.
SNI estimates that its approvals of manufacturing projects will grow
over the next five years at about 5% p.a. With regard to tourism, the
1972 volume of SNI's approvals of hotel pro,iects was unusually high,
and this is explained by the financing of several particularly large
projects. For 1973-77 SNI's hotel lending projecaions are extrapolated from
developments envisaged in the tourism sector (see para. 6.0.) as
well as certain big projects already being planned, given the long
lead time needed for hotel investmert.
Resource Needs
6.06      Over the 1973-77 period, SNI projects commitments of 41.2
million, including D 26.1 million (63%) for import financing. To carry
out the business, SNI would need fresh resources of D 39.0 million Lo
supplement resources already available (D2.2 million as of December 31. 1'72'.
Of the D 3e .' million in new resources, D 24.> million of the new funds
wuuld relate to import financcing. Looking at the overall figures,
it is evident  that SNI's  foreien   exchange  financing.  which



- 23 -
has been 75-80' of loans nade up until now, will decline to about 65%.
The reasons are discussed in para. 3.09.
6.07       Dinar Resources.  Regarding the need for Dinur resources during
1973/74 (see Annex 14), SNI does not foresee any particular difficulty in
raising the needed Dinars through the issuance of bonds, a capital increase,
and nelf-generated funds.  SNI has received approval from the Goverment to
issue, early in 1973, D 1.0 million in 10-year bonds probably at a total
cost of about 5 3/4%, and the preliminary indications are that there will
be no problem marketirig the bonds. SNI's need to meet further resource
requirements would probably not arise until 1974 wher. it plans for a capital
increas.e of D 2.0 million.  SNT expects to obtain a third SIDA loan of D 1.25
million in 1973, half of which would be, as in previous SIDA credits, avail-
able for local cost financing; the Government is currently negotiating for
this loan u-ith SIDA.1/ The sum of these sources would be about D 1.2 million
short of local currency requirements. This gap could be covered by a second
bond issue, in increase in S1r's deposits, and greater use of the rediscount
facilities of the Central Bank (see para. 3.02). If the forecast of opera-
tions shown in Annex 14 turns out to be too conservative, thus making the
Dinar re30orce gap larger, SNI expects to be able to raise the needed funds
on the local market (para. 2.16).
6.08      Foreign Exchange Resources.  SNI's resources presently
available to finance imports are the balance of the fourth Bank loan
(estimated at 1.2 million at the end of December 1972). On the basis
of its projections, which are supported by the pipeline of projects
under consideration, SNI will have fully committed this loan by
February, 1973. To reet import financing commitments through the end
of 197L, SNI needs an additional D 8.6 million ($17.9 million).  SNI
is pre.:ently negotiating with the Government for a share in the bilateral
aid available to Tunisia from Swed-n (SIDA) and Germany (KfW). Half
of the D 1.25 million SIDA credit, mentioned in the above paragraph
would be available to finance imports.1/  SNI has received rrelirminary
indication from the Government that it may receive an allocation of
D 1.4 million from a first loan of KfW (DM 10 million). Subject to
conclusion of the bilateral negotiations and to confirmation by the
donors, the KfW funds could become available in April-May, 1973 and
the SIDA money by July-August, 1973. On the hasis of projected
operations during 1973/74, and assuming SNI will obtain funds from SIDA and
KfW, the resource gap to finance imports over the 2-year period would amount to
D 6.5 miilion, i.e .$13.5 million.  For this amount (rounded to $14 million)
SNI looks to the Bank for a fifth loan.
6.09      SNI would like to diversify further its   sources of foreign
exchange by borrowing directly, without Tunisian Government guarantee,
from financial institutions in countries where SNI's clients direct
most of their procurement. To this end, SNI management has recently
talked with banks in France, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and Japan about
the possibility of obtaining lines of credit. So far, however, SNI has not

would not be realistic at this stage to consider this possibility
in the projections.



-24 -
been   successful in its search for long-term  funds,  as such re-
sources are either with floating interest rates, based on the Euro-dollar
rate, or are at fixed rates which are substantially higher than what
SNI pays for its present resources. SNI fears that given the fact
that it cannot pass on to its borrowers the floating interest rate,
such resources would be too risky. It considers resources at a fixed
interest rate in the neighborhood of 9% as too expensive, since this
could lead to a negative spread. To apply for such resources, SNI
must obtain Government and Central Bank approval, but such approval
is not expected to be granted in the near future,at least until the
review of the banking and interest rate structures undertaken by
the Government is completed. The Government has nevertheless indicated
it will give SNI full support in raising from suitab±L channels
(including bilaterial aid te Tunisia) the foreign exchange resources
needed for SNI to fulfill the major role the Government accords to it.
Financial Projections
6.10      Profitability.  Projected income statements for the years
1972 through 1977 are given in Annex 15. SNI's net profits after taxes
are expected to grow from D 0.26 million in 1972 (5% of average net
worth) to D 0.60 million in 1977 (B% of average net worth). SNI intends
in the coming year to make systematic provision for possible losses,
that is, to provide for realistically estimatea ioss risKs. Better
follow-up with borrowers and improvements in the value of the security
obtained lead SNI to project a moderate increase in provisions of r 50,0CO
,er year from 1:73 through 1,77, but the situation will have to be watched
carefully in view af current arrears and certain doubtful loans. SNI's
rprofitability is approLching a reasonable level. Administrative expenses, while
increasing at an average of approximately 141 a year in absolute terms, should
iecline as a percentage of average total assets from 1.5% in 1972 to
about 1.5  in 1,77.
6.11      Debt Service Coverage.  Projected cash flow statements are
given in Annex  16  Theseand the projected income statements (Annex l)
show that debt service would be adequately covered frr the forecast
period. Annual interest payments through 1977 range from 60-65% of
SN'I's annual interest income. Principal repayments by SNI in any one
year will, at the most, amount to 68% of loan maturities received
from clients during the same year. If SNI continues its policy of
matchinp maturi ties on its borrowings in dinars and. foreign exchange
with the terms of its loans, then debt service coverage should remain
comfortable over the life of the proposed Bank loan.
6.12       Projected Balance Sheets.  Projected Balance Sheets through 1977
are showm in Annex 17. SNI's total assets should double over the next four
yc%r:, meaning SNI would become equivt lent to a US$60-70 million concern.
.'s debt/equity ratio, as defined in agreement with the Bank, would
-:6:in within the agreed limit of 4:1 over the next five years.  SNI
e-t.s to maintarin its present level of liquidity over the coming years.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMflATT0TNS
ConTlihsions
7.01      SNI has increased its importance as the leading source of
term lending to private sector indlstry in Tunisia; it is also starting
to lend substantial amounts to public sector enterprises.  SIl's
operations in induhstry are primari-ly a reflection of the growth in
manufacturing companies owned by private entrepreneurs.  In tourism,
even with the expanding role played by CUFITOUR, SNI continues to
provide a substantial amount Of financing for hotils. Although SNI
has benefited  from the boom in Tunisia's tourism industry, it also
has to cope with the difficuilties experienced by its hotel borrowers.
StJI has good relations with the Government, other financial institutions
in TunisLa and official sources of foreign aid.
7.02      S1J relies on the 3ank for r5` of its resources, compared
to 36,' which came from equity and Governnent loans.  Share capital
was doubled (to D 3.0 million)rin 197'. and further steps to raise
funds locally are now being planned.  Although SNII will contimne to
rely on the rank and SIDA for untied f-)reign exchange sources, it also
expects to rezeive a first loan fron UWI in 1973. In order to further
diversify its sources, 3NI management has recently been talking with
banks in Enrope and els ewhere about lines of credit, though no results
are expected imamediately, principally because of the Government's tight
control on foreign borrowing.  SNI's efforts should be encouraged.
Tunisia's balance of payments has been improving, and direct foreign
borrowing by 3NI is a posb bility in about a year or so.
7.03      D>xrinE the past year SNI has made substantial progress in
reor-anizing its internal structure and the job should be essentially
completed in 1973. The evaluation or projects has improved markedly
although more still needs to be done to bring SNI's appraisals up to
the desired standards. A start has been made in systematizing and
strengthening follow-up activities and more staff will be allocated
to this flunction. Although investment promotion is weak, management
recognizes the needs 'or improvement and is making plans to correct
the situation. SINI's President, Mr. Bo-arguiba Jr., is still not able
to carry out his responsibilities on a full-time basis, and this puts
extra pressure on "r. Belkhodja, who is, effectively, in charge of
running 37I along with ifr.  'akfak.
7.0k      Ln 1971, SNI's profits were almost double those of 1970.
Profit projections on the next few years are also favorable.  Dividends
of 6& were paid in 1970 and 1971. SNI's shares are traded at a premium
on Tunisia's stock exchange. The loan and equity portfolio is generally
sound and proritable, although additional provisions could be made
on several eouity investnents and probably on certain hotel loans.
The problen remains with regard to validating mortgage security on a
number of loans, but progress has been made and the Government is
giving its cooPeration to cleaning up the situation. The overall
financial  F. _s'tj.cn O1 SNI is strong.

7.0';       The economic outlook for Tunisia iE good. GNP growrth is
targeted at 6.5% per annum over the 1973-76 period, with industry (primarily
public sector enterprises) expected to grow between % and 7j, and tourism
at a minimum o  9% per annum.  SNI iQ conservetively estimatine an increase
in its commitments of 5p.% per annum over this period, including a larger
proportion of dinar financing than heretofore.  SNI expects no problem in
raising, on the local capital market, whatever additional dinar resources
might be needed, but it needs help to replenish its resources ;or import
financing.  SNI would continue to be the primary source of term financing
for private sector industry.  In tourism, moire joint fialncing by .;NI and
COFITOUR can be expected, though it is recognized that COFITLUR's relatIvc
share of total financing in Tunisia will increase at a rate faster than '?NI's.
Reccmmendations
7.06        Given its sound portfolio and recent organizational improvements,
SNI continues to be a suitable and creditworthy borrower fron the Bank.  It
has good business prospects.  In addition to other foreign resources being
mobilized, SNI seeks a Bank loan of $1L million to cover import financing
commitments during the 1973-7h period.  This is the amount recommended for
the fifth Bank loan to SNI.  It would be disbursed as shown in Annex 13.
7.07        The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally applied
to Bank loans to development finance compzuies, including the standard
commitment charge.  ITnder the last Bank loin, SNI's debt/equity limit to be
observed was h:1, the free limit was $200,00, and the aggregate free limit
was set at 2S  of the loan.  The 14:1 debt equity linit should be retained;
the  iggregate free limit should be $4.0 million in the proposed $1,4 million
loan. Given the increase in the size of SNl's projects, the improvement of
SNI'3 apDraisals, and the rise in costs iue to inflation and dollar devaluation,
the free limit :bove which Bank approval oi a sub-project is re(juired should
be raised from P'200,000 to $400,CCO. Mhe term loans to hotel projects financed
out of Bank funds should be available up to L0 years (para. 14.02).  Financing
of industrial investjment projects should remain limited, as in previous loans,
to 15 years.  Contrary to the last Bank lorn, no restriction need be imposed
on the use of  ank funds for loans and investments in public sector enter-
prises, provided there is no change in OTT's policy which limits its public
sector assistance to 25  of total portfolio (para. 3.05).  The proceeds of
the :.oan should be used to finance direct imports, plus the equivalent of 70%
of' o:f-the-shelf procurements, representirn t'he estimated import element of
theses costs.
7.09        Arrangements have been made for the Bank to review, by the middle
of 1273, progress SNI has accomplished on its reorganization, particularly
in collection, technical appraisal and follo;,-up. The methodologr to be used
by TlI in the economic justification of its project3would also oe reviewed
at that time, in the light of the findingFs of the mission from the Operations
Evaluation Division of the Bank, now in the field.

The 1973 comrl,itment and disbursement estimates include slippage (cancellations and decreases)
from approvals made in 1971 and 1972.  No such slippage, however, is included in estimates for
1974 and subsequent years because the approvalsare projected net of any cancellations and
decreases in amount which might occur at the comnitment or disbursement stage.
