The project will support a\n            comprehensive land registration in Russia. It will also\n            support the development of an automated land registration\n            system, a supplemental land registration program,\n            development of appropriate land cadastre mapping and\n            provision of training and technical assistance for land\n            valuation. An automated land registration system will be\n            implemented in ten oblasts with superior implementation\n            capabilities. Land cadastre mapping will cover these\n            selected ten oblasts. Supplemental land registration support\n            will be provided to a maximum of 500 selected rayons."}, "docdt": "1994-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
