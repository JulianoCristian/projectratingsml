Excellency: 
 
We refer to the Loan Agreement, dated June 22, 1994, between the Russian Federation (the 
Borrower) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank), as amended by 
letters dated October 19, 2000, and May 7, 2003, in respect of the above referenced Project.  We also 
refer to your letter, dated July 11, 2003, addressed to the Bank and requesting certain amendments in the 
Loan Agreement in order to reflect changes made by the Borrower in respect of the administrative 
arrangements for the Project. 
 
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to amend the Loan Agreement as follows: 
 
1. 
All references in the Loan Agreement to “LARIS Center” or the “PDU” are substituted by 
“ANO Registration Cadastre Project”. 
2. 
Section 1.02 (c) is amended to read: 
 
“(c) 
‘ANO Registration Cadastre Project’ means the autonomous non-commercial 
organization established pursuant to an agreement of founders and statutes dated May 27, 2003, 
and registered on June 17, 2003 (State Registration No. 1037706041614), operating pursuant to 
the legislation of the Borrower pertaining to noncommercial organizations;” 
3. 
In Section 1.02, a new sub-section (g) is added to read:

into between MOF and SLC and ANO Registration Cadastre Project pursuant to the provisions 
of paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 to this Agreement, as the same may be amended from time to time, 
and such term includes all schedules and agreements supplemental to the Agency Agreement.” 
4. 
Section 5.01 (Remedies of the Bank) shall be amended to read as follows:

action for the dissolution or disestablishment of the ANO Registration Cadastre Project or for 
the suspension of its operations.”  
5. 
Paragraph 1 of Schedule 5 (Implementation Program) is revised to read as follows:  
 
“1. 
SLC shall be responsible for overall project implementation, with the assistance 
of ANO Registration Cadastre Project in the coordination and management of day-to-day 
aspects of project implementation in accordance with an Agency Agreement (the Agency 
Agreement) to be concluded between SLC and ANO Registration Cadastre Project acceptable to 
the Bank. The Borrower shall cause ANO Registration Cadastre Project to perform in 
accordance with the Agency Agreement all the obligations of ANO Registration Cadastre 
Project in respect of overall Project implementation with due diligence and efficiency and in 
accordance with appropriate administrative, financial and technical practices, and shall provide, 
promptly as needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for the Project. 
The Borrower shall exercise its rights under the Agency Agreement in such manner as to protect 
the interests of the Borrower and the Bank and to accomplish the purposes of the Loan, and, 
except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, the Borrower shall not assign, amend, abrogate or 
waive the Agency Agreement or any provision thereof.” 
Please confirm your agreement to the foregoing by signing and dating the form of confirmation
