The lessons learned indicate that the\n            greatest successes of Land Reform Implementation Support\n            (LARIS) came about through a well designed and delivered\n            training program, much of it abroad, that gave highly\n            qualified experts insights into the practices in modern\n            systems, procedures and technologies used in successful\n            economies. The institutional structures for the registration\n            of property rights are more complicated now than they were\n            when the Project started and transactions are, as a result,\n            more difficult and expensive. In the first three years\n            following Board approval, there were many problems relating\n            to fundamental issues of institutional responsibility, law,\n            land policy, government counterpart funding, slow\n            procurement and sub-loan agreements with Subjects of the\n            Federation. Requirements for participation of regions in\n            projects need to be spelled out and agreed prior to Board\n            presentation. Practical solutions need to be found to the\n            procurement of complex information systems for Bank\n            projects. When working at a headquarters and planning it is\n            necessary to make some assumptions, but when actually\n            purchasing it is necessary to make visits, assess the\n            situation and wish-list of the local offices and then make\n            judgments accordingly. The impact of an efficient and\n            equitable cadastre system for land taxes has a huge and\n            fundamental benefit. Having multiple agencies responsible\n            for various aspects of transactions in land and real estate\n            is inefficient and creates problems, expense and time delays\n            for market participants, thus discouraging economic development."}, "docdt": "2004-04-12T00:00:00Z"}
