MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LAND REFORM IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT PROJECT
TO THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
1.     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendations on a proposed loan
to the Russian Federation for an amount equivalent to US$80 million to finance the implementation of
the Government's land reform program by creating and strengthening infrastructure and institutional
capacity for land registration. The Land Reform Implementation Support (LARIS) Loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including a five-year grace period.
A. SECTOR BACKGROUND
2.      The total surface area of Russia is 1.71 billion hectares, of which 222 million hectares are
agricultural land, the remainder being covered by forests (I billion hectares), water, marshes, towns,
cities and wastes. Almost 60 percent (132 million hectares) of the agricultural land is arable and 30
percent (65 million hectares) is pastures. Prior to reform, private sector agriculture was permitted on
the household plots of collective members, farm employees and urban residents. Gross agricultural
production on these plots, which accounted for about 3 percent of the arable land, was disproportionately
large (25 percent) by comparison with the state sector. Plot size generally varied between 0.2 and 0.5
hectares. Individuals did not own these plots but were granted use rights by local government councils.
Use rights were, in practice, irnheritable.
3.      Beginmng in late 1990, a set of laws, decrees, and resolutions was issued which represented
a major shift in Russian land policies. First, the right to private ownership of land was established.
Second, a framework was put in place whereby restructuring of state and collective farms and the
establishrnent of private family farms were encouraged. These maJG. legal and policy changes have
introduced tremendous burdens on the state in the area of land administration. A land registration system
needs to be established to record property rights in land and facilitate the establishment of a land market.
As land markets begin to function, demands on the land registration system will continue to increase.
4.      Current processes for the first registration and subsequent dealings in land are the responsibility
of the rayon offices of the Russian Federation Committee for Land Resources and Land Management (or
Russian Land Committee). The Russian Land Committee has a comprehensive network of offices at the
oblast and rayon levels which are responsible for recording the issuance of land title documents. Other
state agencies, including GKI, have responsibility for registration of rights in structures. These offices
receive applications from individuals and enterprises to register land. Following the issuance of a major
Presidential Decree on the regulations of land relations in October 1993, new procedures for registration
of ownership and issuance of title certificates have come into place. in most instances all that is required
is an initial application by the owner to the local administration with or without an accompanying survey
description. Upon approval of the local administration, the rayon Land Committee should issue a
certificate, normally within 10 days. The iieed to eventually provide some sort of survey description of
land parcels is fully recognized.
5.      Progress has been slow in developing the legal and technical infrastructure necessary for land
sales, leasing and mortgaging, and the procedures for land valuation remain primitive. The existing
system of recording issuance of land documents is inadequate for supporting land transactions, recording
mortgages and other servitudes, and for land valuation and taxing purposes. As title documents are



- 2 -
issued, they are recorded in chronological order with identification of the owner(s), location of holding,
and size of holding broken out by form of land tenure. There is no systematic way to track mortgages
and other easements. Furthermore, the method of parcel identification (oblast name, rayon name,
chronological order of title issue) will be inadequate as the land reform progresses. The recording of title
documents takes place in an environment without clear legal guidelines and without full orientation toward
the neeca and interests of end sers. Adjudication procedures are vague, and eventual survey procedures
could prove very costly.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.      The primary objectives of the LARIS project are to accelerate the implementation of on-going
and future land reforms by introducing a uniform land registration system consistent with the de 'elopment
of markets in land and real estate and recognition of the right to priv.lte ownership of land and by
strengthening the Russian Land Committee'. capacity to implement such a system and to issue titles to
property owners. This project would thus lay the foundation for an efficient agricultural sector based on
private ownership of land and market principles determining land transactions and strengthen property
rights for non-agricultural land owners as well. The LARIS project will enable the Russian Federation
to: (a) upgrade existing cadastral mapping capability; (b) standardize land registration procedures and
documentation to facilitate title issuance and market transactions in land; (c) immediately bolster
registration capabilitv in rayons likely to experience high levels of market activity; and (d) provide
institutional support to develop the skills necessary to administer a land registry and to assist in the further
evolution of the Russian land registration system.
C. PROJECT DEsCRIPTION
7.      The LARIS project will focus on the juridical cadastre so as tc provide clarity to property rights
in land; support for the processes of land buying, selling, leasing and mortgaging; and an improved
information base in support of the determination and collection of land taxes. The juridical cadastre
developed under the LARIS project will be the basis for a national system, incorporating urban as well
as rural land, for use by all Government agencies dealing with property registration or other legal issues
associated with land.
8.      The LARIS project consists of three components: (i) upgrading of land cadastre mapping; (ii)
establishment of the land registration system; and (iii) institutional development, including training and
technical assistance. In addition, a Project Development Unit (PDU) will be established to implement
the LARIS project and develop analytical capacity to prepare future projects for financing by international
financial institutions.
9.       The cadastre mapping component will reverse the long-term decline in cadastral mapping
capability in Russia and introduce digital mapping technology on a modest scale as a first step to eventual
national coverage. Digital mapping will be both quicker to produce and easier to revise and update than
traditional paper maps. This is particularly important in Russia, where land markets are developing after
decades of tight state control where extensive restructuring of existing large farms is expected. Six
mapping enterprises, subordinate to the Russian Land Committee, will be equipped; five existing locations
(Moscow, St. Petersburg, Perm, Omsk, and Novocherkassk) plus an enterprise to be established in
Nizhny Novgorod.
10.     The Land registration component will support the development of a juridical cadastre combined
with basic fiscal information and establish an automated system of land registration. Textual data will
be linked with a graphic component in digital form, illustrating location, boundaries, and relevant



- 3 -
servitudes. The system will enable the staff of a rayon land committee office to speed up the processing
of land titling applications and ensure that all details required from an applicant are obtained and validated
before documents are issued. The system will also ensure consistency of production of the standard
letters and forms as well as the final certificates. It will alert staff to outstanding actions and enable local
management to perform other administrative functions more effectively.
II.    The Russian Land Committee is faced with a broad range of extremely demanding tasks. For
some of these, there is little prior institutional experience. The project will provide a core of training
and technical assistance in the areas of mapping and land registration, as well as adjudication of land
disputes, land valuation, land mortgaging, land taxation and economic management of state lands, cost
recovery mechanisms, developmental control and environmental monitoring.
12.      The LARIS project will complement the IFC's ongoing Land Privatization and Farm
Reorganization Project in Nizhnv Novgorod. This project has developed an approach to restructure large
state and collective farms into more economically viable units, including private family farms. In order
to accelerate the process of farm restructuring, existing mapping capabilities must be upgraded, an
appropriate land registration system must be implemented and ownership certificates must be issued. In
this context, the LARIS project will develop and implement critical elements of the farm restructuring
process.
13.    Total project cost is estimated to be US$115 million, of which 70 percent is expected to be in
foreign exchange cost. The rcspective shares of the project components in total project cost (excluding
contingencies) are 36 percent for land cadastre mapping, 41 percent for land registration program, 4
percent for institutional development and 4 percent for the Project Development Unit. The proposed
Bank loan of US$80 million would finance 100 percent of foreign exchange costs of the project. The
Federal government, through the Russian Land Committee, would finance all local costs, including any
payments of import duties and taxes. Summary of project cost estimates and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and method of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events is giver. in Schedule C.
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
14.     The Russian Land Conmmittee will have the overall responsibility for implementation of the
LARIS project. A PDU will be established within the Russian Land Committee, as part of its Land
Reform Center, to coordinate all the work related to budgeting, procurement, disbursement, audit,
reporting, monitoring and evaluation. Within the PDU, a Project Implementation Department will
coordinate the day to day operations of the LARIS project and will contain specialists in project
management, procurement, and disbursement and accounting. Two project groups will be established
within the Land Reformn Center. These groups will be responsible for implementation of the land
registration and cadastre mapping components and report directly to the Project Implementation
Department. The Project will utilize the existing network of the Russian Land Committee at the oblast
and rayon levels for implementation. Ten oblast project groups will be established to assist these units
in assimilating new technology, operating procedures and principles contained in the project.
E. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
15.     The sustainability of the project depends on: (a) availability of counterpart funds; (b) trained
staff; and (c) commitment of the Government to continue project activities. The project is designed to
assist in removing the resource and skill constraints, thereby making it possible to sustain the project after
five years. The project will support the Government's plan to establish a "fund" to support the costs of



- 4 -
the land registration groups. In addition to the fees generated directly from registration activities, the
fund will be sunplied by revenues generated as a result of any breach of land use regulations and from
the leasing and sale of state-owned lands.  Agreement was reached with the government during
negotiations on the following three cost recovery principles: (a) the establishment of a service tee
schedule for various activities in 1995; (b) introduction of "fee for service" and other appropriate cost
recovery measures in 1996; and (c) the establishment, operation and use of a "fund" in 1996 from
resources collected through fees or other cost recovery measures. The details would be worked out
during project implementaticn. Progress and plans for cost recovery would be part of a mid-term review
of the project. The Bank will work with the Government to design a cost recovery strategy in order to
generate adequate resources to sustain the project work.
F. LESSONS FROM PREvIous BANK EXPERIENCE
16.     Successful land cadastre and land titling projects have incorporated the following elements in
their design and implementation. First, project perfornance has been most satisfactory where a single
agency has been responsible for project implementation and it has clear and well-functioning management
links at the regional or provincial level. The implementation units must have adequate staffing, funding,
training, and legal authority to coordinate project activities. Second, these projects are designed on the
basis of existing human skills and institutional arrangements to successfully assimilate technological
advances. These capabilities need to be further enhanced through institutional development, including
training and technical assistance. Third, projects which focus on the registration of existing land rights
have proven much more successful than those addressing a reallocation of existing rights. More
crucially, a project must be consistent with the Government's own plans to address land use questions.
Finally, land cadastre and land titling costs can greatly exceed appraisal estimates where due attention is
not paid to procedures for adjudication, survey, and dispute settlement.   Maximum  use of
photogrammetric means, as opposed to field work for existing parcels, has also proven to be economically
expedient.
17.     The proposed LARIS project is the first Bank project which deals with land cadastre and land
registration in the former Soviet Union. The Bank has no relevant past experience dealing with the
introduction of land markets in transition economies, such as that of the Russian Federation, where land
was previously held exclusively by the state. Given serious legal, institutional, political and economic
problems faced by Russia, the proposed LARIS project may encounter serious difficulties. However, the
design of the LARIS project has incorporated the relevant lessons which are available under the current
operating environment in order to improve chances for successfuil implementation.
G. RATIONALE FOR BANK PARTICIPATION
18.     Since 1990, the Federal Government has introduced unprecedented land, price, trade and
enterprise reforms designed to accelerate transition to a market economy and has made considerable
progress. Nevertheless much remains to be done to develop an overall policy frarnework for reform.
There are also critical institutional constraints to the reform process, including an insufficient
systematization of the land registration process. The Bank's involvement in land reform is essential to
continue the dialogue with the Government which was initiated through the 1992 Food Sector Study work.
The Bank's support for this project would: (a) help develop key institutions necessary to implement land
reform; (b) enhance the start that has been made in Russia to develop private sector farming; and (c)
maintain the policy dialogue and contribute to the prospects for continuing policy reform. The possibility
exists for Russia to put in place an effective and self-sustaining system of land registration, but initial
investment costs are large. Furthermore, a comprehensive package of training and technical assistance



is necessary to implement the land registration program. The Bank is in a unique position to support
these activities.
19.    The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed with the Executive Directors on May 19,
1994. The CAS identified three basic objectives for Bank assistance in Russia: (a) to support the
development of a market-oriented economy based on private sector initiatives; (b) to encourage the
redirection of public sector involvement toward the establishment of open and competitive markets and
public infrastructure; and (c) to establish the Bank as a trusted and reliable development partner through
the financing of high prioi-ity public sector investments and policy advice on key economic and sectoral
issues. A commensurate lending program (the intermediate case) for FY95 would aim to deliver 7 or
more projects in the range of US$1.0 - 1.5 billion (not including quick disbursing adjustment lending).
The proposed project, along with the proposed Agricultural Reform Implementation Support (ARIS)
Project, would foster these objectives by laying the foundation for an efficient land market which, in turn,
is essential for increased production incentives in agriculture and improved land use decisions elsewhere
in the economy. The project will strengthen private property rights, accelerate the process of farm
restructuring and contribute to the economic recovery of the agricultural sector which, in turn, would
contribute to macroeconomic stability. The proposed project is, therefore, fully consistent with the
Bank's strategy for assistance to Russia. The status of Bank Group operations is given in Schedule D.
H. ACrloNS AGREED
20.      The following agreements were reached during negotiations: (i) agreement on detailed
procedures to be followed in adjudication, demarcation and survey of land parcels and their timing; (ii)
agreement on cost recovery principles; (iii) agreement on principles for scheduling aerial photography
of rayons selccted for automated registration; (iv) agreement on the organization, staffing, functions and
financing of the PDU and central project groups; (v) agreement on provision of periodic reports on
project progress, accounts for the project, audit requirements and financial statements; (vi) agreement on
the first phase of rayons for the supplemental registration program ; (vii) agreement on selection
procedures for procurement agents; (viii) agreement 'on selection procedures for a commercial bank to
manage the Special Account; (ix) agreement on guidelines for oblast participation in the project; (x)
agreement on project output in terms of maps and certificates; (xi) agreement on information contained
in the land registration system ; and (xii) agreement on retroactive financing.
21.     The following are the conditions of loan effectiveness: (i) issuance of the procedures for
registration of land and other real estate, acceptable to the Bank; (ii) appointment of key staff of the PDU
(accountant, procurement specialist) and the central project groups (technical specialists); (iii)
establishment of oblast project implementation groups for first phase oblasts; and (iv) establishment of
the Project Account and an initial deposit of US$0.5 million equivalent in a commercial bank acceptable
to the Bank.
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
22.    The project is expected to have a positive impact on the environment. The move toward private
land ownership promoted by this project is expected to foster more prudent use of land and other natural
resources. However, any environmental concerns will be addressed during implementation of the project
by applying Bank's and country's environmental requirements and guidelines. In addition, public
awareness on any environmental issues will be created through appropriately designed environmental
information monitoring, information dissemination, technical assistance and training programs. Any
environmentally based limitations associated with a given land parcel will be noted on the land
certificates issued under the LARIS project. The project has a "C" environmental assessment category.



- 6 -
J. PROGRAM OBJECTrIVE CATEGORIES
23.     The LARIS Project supports (i) private sector development through strengthening private land
and property ownership; (ii) improved public sector management by developing the institutional capacity
of the SLC, Land .eform Center and mapping enterprises; and (iii) development of a policy, legal and
institutional framework for land and farm restructuring.
K. PROJECT BENEFITS
24.     The project is expected to have substantial direct and indirect financial and economic benefits.
The potential project benefits include enhanced economic incentives and agricultural productivity.
Accelerating the pace of land reforms will lead to an efficient agricultural sector based on private
ownership of land and market principles determining land transactions. Land title registration and the
underlying cadastral information base that this project will provide are critical for developing a land
market, improving the system for land taxation and establishing land as security for commercial credit.
With the concept of private property in land just recently reinstated, Russia has the opportunity to put
in place a coherent unified system of land registration that will minimize costs and facilitate the conduct
of land transactions and the development of a land market. The project will lay the foundation for future
policy reforms for land and the agricultural sector. rhe project will also train a large number of Russian
experts to develop analytical capacity to prepare and implement land reform and future agricultural
projects (land reform, land conservation and agricultural resource development and farm restructuring
projects) to be financed by international financial institutions.
L. PROJECT RISKS
25.     The main risk is that the project may face delays in implementation. Factors that could cause
problems in project implementation are: the current unstable macroeconomic environment and its possible
further deterioration, lack of political consensus on land reform and development of a land market, lack
of counterpart funds, lack of trained personnel, and lack of experience iiP implementing Worle Bank
projects. With respect to the commitment to land reform and a land market, these issues are a key part
of an overall policy dialogue with the Government and the proposed project would provide more specific
opportunities to address these issues. With respect to implementation, the project would introduce
necessary measures in the form of legal covenants, training and technical assistance to minimize these
risks.  The establishment of a strong Project Development Unit, with appropriate support for
procurement, disbursement, accounting, project management and technical aspects, is also expected to
mitigate some of the potential project risks. The project would be intensively supervised (including a
project launch workshop, annual reviews and a comprehensive mid-term re- Mw) so that appropriate and
timely actions are taken to avoid and overcome implementation problems.
M. RECOMMENDATION
26.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the loan.
