                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Customs Modernization Project (CMP) was terminated on April 4, 2011 at the client#s request having disbursed US$1.8 million, or 2.6 percent of the allocated credit amount. In
                         contrast to slow disbursement due to significant consultant recruitment delays leading to procurement delays for Vietnam Customs Information System (VCIS) and control equipment
                         components, the institutional development components of the project showed good implementation progress. Results achieved against institutional development performance
                         indicators have been extremely positive. All covenants and conditions had been complied with, except for one covenant (out of 22 covenants and conditions) that had been partially

                         A significant portion of the technical assistance included in the project design has been delivered to good effect. Importantly, a comprehensive analysis and re-engineering of
                         business processes (BPR) based on the implementation of globally agreed standards has been completed and draft bidding documents for the procurement of the VCIS prepared.
                         Initial progress in operational modernization was strengthened by a completed legal assessment and project activities focused on organizational restructuring and strengthening. The
                         preparation of a comprehensive training strategy was completed and is being used to good effect by the GDVC. The Mid-term Review (MTR) mission held during September 6-16,
                         2010 assessed that the bidding for procurements amounting to approximately US$ 52 million (or about 75% of the credit proceeds) was on schedule to proceed within six months but
                         that full implementation would require a project extension.

                         However, around the time of the MTR key counterparts including GDVC and MOF became concerned about the possibility that the GDVC could not complete the procurement and
                         achieve full implementation process for the VCIS within an allowable extension of the closing date and began exploring alternative options that could accelerate VCIS implementation
                         and increase long term sustainability. The GDVC informally advised that it was considering a number of options including the possibility of directly acquiring a suitable operational
                         VCIS from a neighboring country as part of a possible bilateral cooperation arrangement. The MTR mission advised the GDVC that the Bank#s procurement rules would not allow
                         the IDA credit to be used to support direct contracting of a major IT system such as the VCIS. The mission also stressed that experience elsewhere suggested such an approach
                         might take considerable time to finalize and could incur a number of other risks that might ultimately delay implementation significantly.

                         Given the above context, and based on a review of various project restructuring options with key counterparts, the MTR mission recommended that counterparts consider two options
                         for the project's future: (a) continuing implementation through extending the project by another 3-5 years to ensure sufficient time for full and effective deployment by either (i) direct

                         acquisition using state budget or bilateral donor funds of an operational VCIS as part of or separately from CMP; or (ii) procuring VCIS through an International Competitive Bidding
                         process as part of a simplified CMP; or (b) terminating the project as implemented to date. In the event that the Borrower opted to finance the VCIS separately from CMP , a further
                         option involved restructuring the project to apply the resulting savings to alternative productive activities was considered but rejected due to insufficient work being completed on the
                         identification and development of well articulated and prioritized alternative investment options. . On December 6, 2010, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), on behalf of the Borrower,
                         notified the Bank of its intention to terminate the project. Following the SBV's formal request dated March 15, 2011, the remaining credit was cancelled through the Bank's
                         Cancellation Notice dated April 4, 2011. The termination occurred before the due credit closing date of June 30, 2011 thus allowing the cancelled funds to revert to the Vietnam IDA
                         program.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
