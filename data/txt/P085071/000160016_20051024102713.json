The project is\n            expected to meet these objectives by: (1) introducing modern\n            Customs systems and procedures based on internationally\n            agreed standards and best practice; (2) improving the\n            organizational structure and strengthening the human,\n            financial and physical resource capacity o f the Customs\n            Department; and (3) introducing appropriate information and\n            communication technology to improve effectiveness, increase\n            transparency, and lower transaction costs. The project\n            provides consulting services, training, technical assistance\n            and appropriate infrastructure to support three key\n            operational components, and one support component: Component\n            one deals with the core technical systems, and procedural\n            aspects of the reform program. Component two improves the\n            organizational and resource management of the new systems.\n            Component three provides the information and communication\n            technology (ICT) support to achieve world class standards of\n            performance in Customs administration. Component four\n            provides the technical and managerial support required to\n            achieve effective implementation and long term\n            sustainability of project objectives."}, "docdt": "2005-10-17T00:00:00Z"}
