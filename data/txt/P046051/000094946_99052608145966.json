There are three project components. The first\n            a) renews and restructures the science and engineering\n            disciplines by reducing narrow specializations,\n            restructuring academic programs of study, and introducing\n            new integrative science and engineering courses; b) adopts\n            student-centered learning strategies, updates textbooks,\n            makes laboratories, computer facilities, and library\n            resources more readily accessible; and establishes\n            well-equipped integrated laboratory centers and c) upgrades\n            teachers and staff in support of reforms such as providing\n            continuous training and promoting information exchange among\n            staff.
