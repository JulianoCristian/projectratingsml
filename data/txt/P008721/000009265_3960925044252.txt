ORCRARDS PROJECT (UOAN 1876-10):
FOURTH LIrVSTOCK PROJECT (LOAN 1937-R0):
NOLDOVA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (2077-10)
PROJECT COMPLETION RPRT
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of three agricultural
projects for which loans were made to Romania from September 1980 to August
1982 for a total amount of US$ 225.0 million. The loans were closed
respectively; Loan 1876-RO, on June 30, 1986; Loan 1937-RO, on June 30, 1986
and Loan 2007-RO, on December 31, 1986. The loans were almost fully
disbursed. The only exception was the Livestock loan for which a residual of
US$120,000 was cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office. Romania suspended Bank borrowing in 1982. From May 1988 to
November 1989 it paid back in advance all outstanding loan amounts including
the three loans object of the present PCR. The last supervision mission to
assess progress in project implementation visited Romania in November 1986.
No official contacts after that date were maintained with the project
executing agencies. The present PCR is a desk work exercise based in part on
a review of the staff appra sal reports; the loan agreements; the economic
memorandum (No. 5832-RO) dated May 6, 1986, internal Bank memoranda on project
issues as contained in relevant Bank files, minutes of the Board discussions,
Bank supervision reports, quarterly and annual progress reports, prepared by
the borrower, as well as interviews with Bank staff who have been associated
with the project. With regard to project implementation the PCR is mainly
based on information contained in supervision and progress reports up to
December 1986, the time of the last Bank supervision report.
The three projects were the following: (i) the Orchard Project,
for which Loan 1876-RO, in the amount of US$ 50.0 m. was approved on June 24,
1980; (ii) the Livestock Project for which Loan 1937-RO, in the amount of
US$80.0 m. was approved on December 23,1980; and (iii) the Moldova
Agricultural Credit Project for vhich Loan 2077-RO in the amount of USS 95 m.
was approved on January 5, 1982.

PROJECT COUPItRION REPORT
Introduetion
The three projects which are the object of this completion report
were the thirteenth, fourteenth, and the seventeenth, Bank assisted projects,
in the agricultural sector in Romania, to increase agricultural and livestock
production, by addressing problems of production instability and low
productivity.
Dhjenties
The main objectives of the projects respectively were: (i) under
the Orchards Project the increase of production of earlier commercial fruits
and the increase of domestic consumption and export of such fruits; (1$) under
the Livestock Project the improvement of high protein animal intake, a more
rational resource use and an increase in foreign exchange earnings through
export; (iii) under the Moldova Agricultural Credit Project the modernization
of farms, the upgrading of agricultural technology and the increase in storage
facilities, especially for sugar, grain and maize to diminish winter losses
due to the lack of sufficient storage capacity.
Xmplementation Exneriene
Under the three projects most investment activities took place as
scheduled at appraisal. By the time of the last supervision mission (11/86)
under the orchards project, the plantation component had been satisfactorily
completed, and the building of the fruit packing facilities was well under
way. The livestock project had been completed as well, with more than twice
as many loans as estimated at appraisal, extended to individual farmers.
Under the Moldova Agricultural Credit Project all components had been
completed satisfactorily, despite some minor changes in design and in the
allocation of resources during project  implementatiL:.  It is impossible to
assess the full development benefits of the three projects due to lack of
factual information on the output and revenue generated by the projects, since
November 1986.



- vi -
The estimated total cost of the projects was the same as the appraisal
estimate (USS 1,026.1 m) (Annex I). In Lei terms, the actual cost is 5.5%
less than the appraisal estimate due in part to the appreclation of the Lei
via-vis the US$ during project impleAentation, and in part to reduced
budgetary allocation in domestic cvcrency. The aggregate Bank loan amount was
almost completely disbursed, except for US$ 120,000 under the Livestock
Project.
Results
Evidence available In the files indicates that the three projects,
by and large, were satisfactorily accomplishing their objectives.
Calculations of the ERR and FR and the assessment of the overall impact of
the projects on the sector and the economy, however, will on'y be possible if
and when the Romanlan authoritles make more recent data avallable on project
performance.
Sustainability
Under the preceding projects in the subsector assisted by the
World Bank, Romania has been able to demonstrate suitable capability for
operating and maintaining similar projects and sustainLng the agricultural
benefits at or above the antLcipated levels. The. organizatlonal changes
intrcauced in the recent past have enabled MAFI to operate and maintain these
projects more efficiently and responsively to local conditions than it had
been capable in the past.
Flndinis and lessons learned
The projects benefitted from lessons learned in the design and
preparation of previous projects. They were based on least cost alternatlves
and more efficient deslgns made possible by experience learned fr-nm former
projects.
Large imbalances between loan dlsbursements and physical
Implementation vere only experienced in the case of the Moldova Agricultural
Credit Project. In the future, a stronger link should be sought tetween loan
disbursements planning and execution of works.
DespLte substantial improvement in the ttdding documents used for
ICB to increase competition and foreign particlpation, only about 5% of
contracts awarded after ICB were asslgned to foreign firms. In the future,
more opportunities for equipment of more advanced technology, increased cost
effectiveness and energy efficiency should be encouraged. To avoid almost
exclusive award of contracts under ICB to the domestic industry, as in the
present projects and to avold suspiclon of under-bidding by domestic bldders
or other irregularities, as expressed by foreign bidders on some occasions.
the Bank should: (i) require the preparatlon of technlcal speclfications
implying the use of technologically advanced equipment, requiring direct
foreign exchange financing; and (ii) prefer financing of projects where a high
level ef direct foreign exchange financing would be required.

ORCHARDS PROJECT (LOAN 1876):
FOURTH UVESTOCK PROJECT   A  1J7-RO:
MOLDOVA AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (Lq7-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. lb TRODUCTIO
1.01        The Agricultural Sector.  Agriculture represents an important
share of the economy of Romania contributiag in 1987 about 27X of GDP and with
3 million people employed in the sector, providing about 281 of total
employment. Agriculture's share in total export earnings is about 12X. More
than 50% of agricultural export is in convertible currency.  Since 1977,
Rolmania has maintained an agricultural trade surplus.  About 63% of 15 million
hectares of Romania's land is under agriculture, of which 10 million arable.
Future sectoral growth depends heavily on irrigation and drainage in the
fertile Danube basin, and on upgrading of technology for both primary
produotion and agroindustry to make the sector competitive in the world
markets.
1.02        The agricultural sector is organized in primarily two field
categories: (i) cooperatives for agricultural production (CAP) and (ii) state
agricultural farms (IAS). The former produce about one third of agricultural
output and the latter one fourth. A small part - 131 of the arable land is
cultivated in small individual plots, primarily for vegetable, fruit and
livestock production. The rest is cultivated by farmers f.,r subsistence.
1.03        The projects were conceived within the framework of the guidelines
of the 1981-85 National Development Plan whose most important targets, over
the five year period, were to increase GDP at about 6-7X p.a. and Gross
Agricultural Production at about 4-5% p.a. The main thrust of the
agricultural development strategy was to; increase crops and livestock yields
by using more efficient techniques, especially improved mechanization, and
increased use of fertilizers and other inputs, and undertake large investments
in irrigation. The strategy also aimed at increasing export to convertible
currency areas and at the improvement of farm management. The following were
the projects' main investment features: Under the orchards project investment
was provided for (a) the plantation of new orchards over an area of 30,000 ha.
including provision of irrigation, mechanization, and access roads; (b) the
construction of 20 fruit packing and cold storage facilities with provision of
specialized equipment and training in fruit handling, processing and storage.
Under the livestock proiect the investment was aimed at establishing
rew.modern dairy farms, mainly cooperatives (CAP) and state farms (IAS) to
expand production, processing and storage of milk and beef. Provision of
credit for individual producers, forage quality improvement, maintenance and
research in cattle nutrition, were also included. The Moldova Agricultural
Credit Project aimed at production efficiency improvements through BAFI
subloans for farm me,.hanization, agroindustries, credit to individual
producers for soil erosion control, pasture improvement, and restructuring of
vineyard. The projects were expected to increase and improve the quality of



-2-
animal, crop and orchards production, and have a positive impact on commercial
activities and export.
The BaEk Involvement in AaViculture
1.04        Bank total lending to Romania for 33 projects amounts to about
US$2,184 m. Of these projects 17 were in the agricultural sector, out of
which, in turn, those which are covered in the present PCR were the thirteenth
fourteenth and seventeenth. The main objective of the Bank involvement was to
address problems of production instability and low productivity as the country
was known to operate well below its productive and competitive potential. The
Bank through the agricultural projects brought about improvements in project
concepts and design, such as the inclusion under the loan financing, of
private plots of member cooperatives and the introduction of subloans to
individual producers, especially for livestock production.   The Bank's
emphasis on individual sector development and the important role it could play
in achieving Romania's food production objectives should become even more
important now after the change of regime in December, 1989.
II. PROJECT PROCESSING
2.01        Project Identification and Preparation.  The three projects were
identified and prepared by HAFI and BAWI with Bank assistance within the
framework of the National Development Plan in 19'1-1985. Identification
missions for the three projects visited Romania between October 1978 and
December 1979, advising the Romanian institutions as to the inputs relating to
technical innovation and cost efficiency and to information on export market
potential and training of high skilled personnel, needed for project
preparation. The project reports were prepared by MAFI and NAFI.
2.02        Apraisal. Negotiations. and Effectiveness.  Appraisal of the
three projects, based on the preparation reports, were carried out in the
following order: The Orchards Project in November 1979, the Fourth Livestock
Project in November, 1980. and the Moldova Agricultural Credit Project in
June, 1981. Negotiations of the three projects were carried out between Yay
1980 and December 1981. No major issues were raised except for the training
of technicians abroad, under the livestock project, which the Romanian
delegation reluctantly accepted. The projects were brought to the Board in
the following sequence: (i) the Orchards Project (US$ 50.0 m) in June 1980;
(Ui) the Fourth Livestock Project (US$ 80.0 m) in December 1980; and (iii) the
Moldova Agricultural Credit Project (US$ 95.0 m) in January 1982. On the
average, they became effective four months after Board presentation.

1II.  PROJECTgLW      hMION
3.01        The Orchards Project.  The plantation started in earnest soon
after effectiveness (09/80). The establishment of the entire 30,000 ha.
program was completed by the spring of 1984, just about six months behind the
SAR schedule. The program involved a total of 206 investors equally divided
among cooperatives (CAPs) and state research farms (IAS). Despite an initial
tendency to plant orchards in good cereals lands, by and large BAFI
successfully implemented the Bank recommendations to restrict apple and pear
tree planting to marginal lands such as those where degraded hill pastures
existed, or where replacement of deteriorated orchards was needed or in the
low yielding cereal lands.  In general due to the expertise of the Orchards
Trust and BAFI's supervision the orchards' technology applied during the first
two years of establishment was satisfactory. Specially with regard to
applications of active substance, (500 kg/ha) and manure (30t/ha), at planting
time. The delivery and application of pesticide was also timely and
successful. Orchard tree densities actually employed compared well with SAR's
recommendations. Delays were experienced in the construction of 20 fruit
packing and controlled atmosphere cold-storage facilities. They were mainly
due to budgetary constraints and to the introduction of design changes to
reduce local investment. By the project closing date, which occurred with a
six months delay (06/86), 8 facilities or 40X of the total had been completed
and were operational. By the time of last supervision (11/86), the remaining
12 were half completed. However, works were progressing satisfactorily and
were expected to be finished by June 1987, six months ahead of the established
cor.pletion deadline. All specialized equipment had been procured with
training being provided by the suppliers.
3.02        The estimated final cost of the project is US$ 323.9 m.   The same
as the appraisal estimate. In Lei terms the estimated final cost of the
project was 10 less than the appraisal estimate, due partially to the
official revaluation of the Lei vis-vis the US$ during implementation.
3.03        The Fourth Livestock Project.  Since inception, at government
initiative, the pro.4.ct changed investment emphasis, from construction of new
dairy farms and full modernization of a limited number of dairy farms, to
pasture improvement, individual sector development and modernization of a
large number of dairy farms. This change benefitted a larger number of
individual farmers, who became direct beneficiaries of pasture improvements,
as well as agricultural cooperatives through provision, to a larger number of
farms, of agricultural machinery and equipment,storage facilities for wil.ter
feed, automatic watering facilities, improvement of the existing milking
systems, with the introduction, side by side, of milking parlors, and
installation of mechanical manure removal facilities.On a number of occasions
Bank missions provided advice on improvement of genetic potential of dairy
cattle, recommending the import of semen and related chemical equipment
together with provision of sufficient winterfeed. The advice was much
appreciated. At closing date, however, though the project physical
implementation was satisfactorily completed, the project financial and



-4
economic benefits were assessed as being less than those estimated at
appraisal, because of the deficiencies in the application of fertilizers,
especially  -.ie, and the shortage in protein seed provision in feeding for
cattle. Implementation of the research component of the project was
satisfactory.   Research programs were carried out along the lines detailed in
the cattle sector report, the SAR for Livestock IV (cattle) project, the Pigs
II SAR. Technical services financed under the project and the provision of
milking equipment were also satisfactory, as were the implementation and
performance of the agroindustry facilities such as the milk processing plant
in Brasov. With regard to external technical training considered as essential
by the appraisal mission, the authorities, who had been reluctant at
negotiations to accept it, eventually asked the Bank authorization, and
received it, to use the US$ 250,000 allocated under the project for technical
assistance services and research.
3.04        The estimated final cost of the project was the same as the SAR's
estimate of US$ 412.0 m. Because of the devaluation of the US$ vis-vis the
Lei during project implementation, the actual cost in Lei was about 91X of the
SAR estimate.
3.05        The Moldova Agricultural Credit Prgject.   Project implementation
started quickly after effecti-eness (08/82). By December 1983 about 40X of
loans to individual producers had been extended. Also all ICB procurement had
been completed with all contracts awarded to Romanian firms. As of September
1985, 15 months ahead of the official closing date, the credit component had
been completely disbursed. The number of subloans (23,678) was more than
twice as much as estimated during appraisal, though the average cost per
subloan was smaller. Loans had been mainly given for livestock production,
including pasture improvement and for orchards, especially vineyards
replanting. As of September 1985 the entire farm mechanization component
(Part A of the project) had been completely disbursed. Also under Part B of
the project almost all of the agroindustrial component had been completed.
Only the construction of the sugar mill, found not viable as a result of the
deterioration of the world sugar prices, was not carried out. The loan funds
of this components were reallocated to finance mechanization. Under the
pasture improvement component (Part E of the project), because of the lack of
convertible foreign exchange there were not significant improvements, as
fertilizer maintenance application per ha. were less than the 400 kg. ammonium
nitrate, the 400 kg. of super phosphate and the 100 kg. murate of potash
recommended at appraisal. However, according to data provided by BAFI at the
time of last supervision (11/86) fertilizers application improved in 1985 and
1986 and were in line with SAR'& recommendations, though cattle liveweight
gains were still below those estimated at appraisal. The impact of the
various project components needs to be further investigated in the field
possibly by future Bank missions, before project contribution to improvement
of farm works and farm management can be determined.
3.06        The final cost of the project was the same as the SAR's estimate
(US$ 209.2 m). The final cost in Lei currency due to currency fluctuation
during project implementation was slightly higher (106X) than SAR's estimates.

3.07        Disbursement and Procurement.  For two of the three projects, the
actual closing dates were in line with the SAR's estimates. The exception was
the Orchards Project, that closed six months behind schedule. In all cases
completion dates were in line with SAR's estimates.  Disbursements in the case
of the Livestock and the Orchards Projects where investment was to be made
gradually because of the nature of the projects, were in line with the SAR's
estimates.  In the case of the Moldova Agricultural Credit Project under which
all ICB contracts, mainly for agriculture machinery and equipment, were
awarded to Romanian firms the bulk of loan disbursement (901) took place by
FY84, 30 months before the closing date. There were no major issues about
procurement, although about 951 of ICB contracts were awarded to Romanian
tirms, and there is evidence in the files that the Bank was never happy about
this situation.
3.08        BAFI's accounts were audited regularly by its internal auditing
department and by inspectors of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance to
Romanian law which was found to satisfy Bank auditing requirements. BAFI has
also regularly furnished quarterly progress reports up to December 1986 in
accordance with the formats agreed at negotiations and periodically improved
in agreement between the Bank and the Borrower.
IV. AGRICULTURAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
4.01        A, assessment of the agricultural and economic and financial
impact of the chree projects object of the present PCR is not possible at this
stage, as no informationt is available after the end of 12/86 and no PCR of
this projects has been made available to the Bank by the borrower.
Information contained in the last supervision reports, however, already
contained some relevant indication regarding some positive impact that the
projects were having in the sector. Under the Livestock Project, dairy farm
modernization and pasture improvement had been done in more farms than
expected at appraisal. This improved the overall return for project
investment. The economic impact at farm level or for individual producers was
expected to be less than the appraisal estimate because of the deficiencies in
the application of the fertilizers to pastures and of shortage of protein seed
for cattle fattening. Under the Moldova Credit Project the most evident sign
of project success, was the positive impact of mechanization on agricultural
production, due to better and more efficient ploughing and silage operations,
more timely and shorter period for seeding, and more efficient plant
protection. Further, project financing of more modern machinery and
equipment, lead to significant improvement in the timeliness of planting,
harvesting and other agricultural operation, and hence to significance
reduction in grain losses.
4.02        Performance of the Bank.  The frequency of supervision (1.4 pa)
was less than the (2.0 pa) average, for the Orchards and Agricultural Credit
Projects. For the Livestock Project the frequency was higher or about (2.0
pa). The composition of the missions was reasonable. The superrision of the
orchards projects was mostly done by economists and agriculturists, while the



- 6 -
supervision of the livestock and of the agricultural credit project which had
a large livestock component, was mainly done by livestock specialists. There
is substantial evidence in the files that the technical advice provided by the
Bank in all the three projects was much appreciated by the borrower.
Supervision reports fairly reflect the progress of execution and the problems
encountered.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No further supervision of the projects was undertaken after
November 1986. Thus no relevant information is available after that date with
regard to project implementation. However, contrary to the case of the four
irrigation projects under implemencation at about the same time and for which
a PCR is also being prepared, all the physical components of the Livestock and
the Moldova Agricultural Credit Projects had been completed at that time.
Under the Orchards Project all the plantation work had also been completed.
The construction of the fruit packaging plant was well under way. There is no
possibility at present to assess the agricultural and economic impact of the
three projects. Further information will eventually have to be made available
for this purpose by the authorities, or a direct assessment would have to be
done during a visit to Romania. No substantive and relevant ex-post
assessment of these projects can be done only through a desk exercise. As in
the case of the irrigation projects, while resuming lending to Romania, should
this possibility materialize, a Bank mission would have to visit the country
to review with the local authorities and technicians the findings of the PCR
and to assess more directly progress in project implementation and impact on
agriculture, institutions, and the economy.
