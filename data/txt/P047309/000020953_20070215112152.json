(Electrobras) Energy Efficiency Project in\n            Brazil were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            the Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and the\n            borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned were: 1) Demand-side management (DSM) programs can\n            be successful only if the underlying incentives of the\n            regulatory framework are in place and correct; 2) The\n            rationing program that was put in place in 2002 to deal with\n            severe cuts in electricity supply was effective in reducing\n            consumption, but also resulted in large financial losses to\n            the distribution utilities that have been being made up\n            through utility bills since the crisis; 3) The rate of\n            return on many energy efficiency projects will be reduced\n            where interest rates for credit are high, as has been the\n            case in Brazil for the past fifteen years; 4) Development of\n            an energy efficiency industry -- including true Energy\n            Service Companies that enter into shared-savings or\n            performance contracts and provide financing for energy\n            efficiency investments -- takes time and a conducive\n            regulatory and financial environment; 5) The\n            post-procurement audit identified weaknesses in the\n            procurement process for the project that was handled by\n            UNDP. Some deals were unable to conclude because UNDP could\n            not issue letters of credit; 6) Project indicators should be\n            flexible and be adapted during implementation as conditions\n            change and the project develops; and 7) The new ICR template\n            is problematic. The structure of the sections is\n            disorganized making it difficult to read and get an overall\n            concept of project implementation. This was made clear by\n            reviewers at the ICR meeting."}, "docdt": "2007-01-25T00:00:00Z"}
