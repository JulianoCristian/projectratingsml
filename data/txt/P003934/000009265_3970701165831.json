The main objective of the ARM Project\n            was to increase the efficiency and relevance of the\n            agricultural research system for continued and sustained\n            agricultural development. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. The Borrower's performance was\n            satisfactory. The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) a\n            focus on improving the management of the research system, in\n            addition to the technical aspects of the research process,\n            ensures that the approach is systematic and reduces the lag\n            time between technology generation and transfer and eventual\n            adoption by farmers; (ii) decentralized planning would\n            ensure participation of farmers and other stakeholder in the\n            research process; (iii) the research management procedures\n            and tools adopted by Agency for Agricultural Research and\n            Development (AARD) through this Project need to be further\n            fine-tuned to meet the specific needs of its work units; and\n            (iv) to improve the monitoring of project activities and\n            their outputs, the key performance indicators must be set up\n            at the beginning of the project to measure the impact over time."}, "docdt": "1996-10-25T00:00:00Z"}
