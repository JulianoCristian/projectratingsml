to increase the efficiency\n            and relevence of the agricultural research system for\n            continued, sustained agricultural development. Specifically,\n            the project will: (i) improve the data base and planning\n            mechanism, including preparation of a rolling national\n            agricultural research master plan (RMP) for improved\n            research programming; (ii) reform research management by\n            establishing a network of management information systems\n            (MIS), and by introducing improved accounting practices and\n            regular monitoring and external research reviews; (iii)\n            improve integration of research through fostering the Agency\n            for Agricultural Research and Development (AARD) links with\n            universities and private enterprise, and facilitating rapid\n            technological diffusion; (iv) ensure adequate research\n            financing by providing a minimum targeted growth in\n            operational expenditures; and (v) improve resource\n            allocation for research in accordance with the Agricultural\n            Research Policy Statement."}, "docdt": "1989-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
