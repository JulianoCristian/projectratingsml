uncertain, Bank\n            performance was highly satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the policy conditions of the program remain appropriate for\n            the problems they were intended to address. In that sense,\n            the loan was well-designed. However, the final objectives of\n            the operation were not reached because this loan should been\n            the first in a series of adjustment operations, with\n            overlapping and reinforcing policy conditions. The most\n            important finding of the project implementation experience\n            is that a one-tranche rehabilitation loan, designed as a\n            compromise between a rehabilitation loan and an adjustment\n            operation, creates its own risks. If the momentum of reform\n            slackens so that the prospect of future operations recedes,\n            the Bank is left with little ability to follow through on\n            outstanding policy conditions. During preparation and\n            implementation of the Rehabilitation Loan, it also became\n            apparent that continuous support and involvement from the\n            most senior government officials in Uzbekistan is required\n            for every significant action."}, "docdt": "1997-05-12T00:00:00Z"}
