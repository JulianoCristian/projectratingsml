satisfactory,\n            sustainability is likely, as is the institutional\n            development impact. Although the project bears similar\n            general lessons from those drawn from countries in economic\n            transition, it illustrates the need for flexibility in\n            design, and during implementation, which could have been\n            achieved through detailed project goals, instead of the very\n            complex project structure. Furthermore, specific lessons\n            suggest that investments in physical infrastructure were at\n            risk of under-utilization, even degradation, with no\n            adequate commitment from operating staff. Initial tests of\n            commitment by staff, and the community should be ensured,\n            prior to allocation of investments, through training\n            participation, and co-financing of works. Furthermore,\n            investment decisions need to be based on stable strategies,\n            agreed for more than just project requirements. In addition,\n            ownership of reform initiatives need to be shared among\n            major stakeholders, through balanced implementation\n            responsibilities between organizations, with both formal,\n            and expert authority, so as not to risk an insufficient\n            technical assistance to the formal authority, which may\n            result in decreased impact of technical recommendations on\n            the decision-making process. Consultation with stakeholders\n            at large, is essential to prevent health management\n            information systems from covering only a small part of the\n            health sector."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
