primary\n            health care delivery system which is collapsing through want\n            of equipment, spare parts, drugs and medical supplies; and\n            (b) to support the first steps of a major restructuring of\n            health sector financing and management to ensure a\n            sustainable, cost-effective health care system in the medium\n            term. These objectives will be achieved by: (1) upgrading\n            rural dispensaries; (2) improving reproductive health care\n            services; (3) strengthening training for nurses and\n            physicians; (4) introducing a health promotion program; (5)\n            ensuring the supply of essential drugs; and (6) upgrading\n            the communication/transport system for emergencies. The\n            project's major policy actions will include: (a)\n            restructuring of health care finance and management; (b)\n            increasing attention to preventive, rather than curative\n            medicine; and (c) shifting the emphasis of contraception\n            from abortion to modern methods of family planning."}, "docdt": "1991-09-04T00:00:00Z"}
