These objectives will be achieved by: (1) upgrading\n            rural dispensaries; (2) improving reproductive health care\n            services; (3) strengthening training for nurses and\n            physicians; (4) introducing a health promotion program; (5)\n            ensuring the supply of essential drugs; and (6) upgrading\n            the communication/transport system for emergencies.
