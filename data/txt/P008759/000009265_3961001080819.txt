1.         The following memorandum and recommendatlon on a r-oposed loan to
Romania for USSSO.0 million io submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would rehabilitate the prima-.w health care system and prepare and implement a
first phase restructuring of health care finance and management. The loan
would have a maturity of fifteen years, including a five years grace period,
at the standard variable rate.
2.          Awrom  4:  The Romanian Governme7t has accorded high priority
to improving the harsh social conditions imposed by the Ceaucescu regime.
Amongst these, inadequate health services and unhealthy lLving conditions have
left a serious legacy. The ban on contraception and consequent reliance on
illegal abortion resulted in high maternal =-r.tality and morbidity. Life
expectancy has declined oror the last decade; infant mortality has risen and
infectious diseases are widespread. Drugs and medical consumables are in
*hort supply and much equipment is obsolete or stands idle for lack of spares.
Further, medical staff and policy makers have been isolated from external
developments and there are now serious technical and institutional weaknesses.
3.         Attempts to improve the population's health status are taking
place against a background of economic crisis. GDP is estimated to have
fallen by 10% in 1990, following a 6% decline in 1989. Industrial production
fell by over 2S% and inflation rose to St, from It in 1989. The combined
effect of the decline in domestic output, the diversion of exports to the
domestic market to ease severe consumer shortages, and the Gulf crisis has led
to a 41% decline in convertible ;.urrency exports and a resulting convertible
currency deficit of about 5 of GDP. Since pharmaceutical and medical
supplies are heavily import dependant, the health sector has been badly
affected. At the same tlme, the economic crisis has given added emphasis to
reforms which can improve targeting and resource utilization in the sector.
4.         Rationale for Dank Involvem_t. The Government is placing high
priority on two key areas of human resource development during the early phase
of the transition to a market economys improved health care is vital to
reverse the deterioration in the popul tion's health over the last decade; and
an adequate social safety net is essencial to protect from poverty those most
adversely affected by inflation and unemployment. The Bank is assisting the
development of the social safety net through Economic and Sector Work and the
FY91 Technical Assistance-Critical Imports loan (Report No. P-5584-RO).
I/    A recmt B* rport (9577-RO) provides recauendmtfons for ehe social safety net, health,
education end training. A study of the fncfdnce of poverty an tareting of benfits is planned for FY92.

5.         nA the health sector, the Bank has assicted the Government
articulate its prioritLes over the next 3-5 years. Thea. includes (a)
rehabilLtating primary health care to provide a cost-effectlve means of
retducing mortality and morbLdityl (b) restructuring the fLnaneLng and
maIUageent of health care to improve access and dellvery; and (0) rehabili-
tating the tertiary health care system. The proposed Bank loan would focus on
items (a) and (b), which are the top prLoritLes and the most attainable in the
current economic sltuatlon. A major justification and result of the loan
would be the development of a health strategy and program to ensure a
sustaLnable, cost-effective health care system in the medLum-term. The
project would also support a number of important changes in strategy and
policys assistance for the restructuring of the Rommnian pharmaceutlcal
industry; shifting som of the patient load from the tertiary hospitals to the
primary care structure, thereby lowering unit costs of health carel shlfting
the emphasis of contraception from abortion to modern methods of family
planning, thus improving the health of womenp renewing emphasis on continuing
educatlon for medical staffp and increasLng attention to preventive, rather
than curative medicine as a more cost-effective method to address the
country's high morbldlty and mortallty rates.
6.         To lmprove the supply response, the country*a primary needs are
for forelgn exchange to import raw materials and spare parts. Within the
health sector, foreign exchange shortages have resulted in acute scarcltLes of
essentlal drugs, medical consumables such as dLiposable yringes (vital to
address the spread of AIDS) and spare parts for equLpment, to the extent that
primary health care is now collapsing. The proposed loan would therefore
finance imports of these itom as well as equipment for primary health care,
technical assistance and traniLng.
7.         Given the neglect over the last decade, the health sector will
need considerable assistance and the proposed project is Lntended as a first
hase of BSank support. A second operation would support the structural
changes begun in the proposed project. Other Bank operations in the human
resources sector would provlde further support to the social safety net, as
well as assistance for education and training. Xn preparing the project, the
Bank has collaborated closely wlth other donors and HGOs which are assistlng
the health sector Ln Romania.

8.         Po4et ablectives. The project would have two princlpal
objectLvesa (a) to rehabllitate and upgrade the primary health care delivery
system whlch has deteriorated sharply during the last decade through lack of
adeVate equiment, spare parts, drugs and medical supplies; and (b) to
support the flrst steps of a major restructuring of the health sector, leading
towards a sustainable, cost-effective health care system ln the medLum term.
9.         Rrajo& DctiM&M. Reb"ilitating and upgrading primry bhaltb
cars would be achieved bys (a) upgrading rural dispensarLes according to
criteria of demographic coverage, local needs, community support and
availabllity of medical staff, (b) improving reproductive health care

*ervice, focussing on maternal and child health and increasing access and
choice in family planning# (e) strengthening training for nurses and
physicians in key aepects of primary health care; (d) introducing a health
promotion program to provide a greater focus on preventive, rather than
curative, medicine; (5) enisuzing the supply of essential drugs, consumables,
vaccines and blood products (including preparation of a restructuring plan for
the Romanian pharmaceutical industry)l and (f) tpgrading the communica-
tion/transport system for emrgencies. Restructuring of healtb sctor
financing and naagesaat would be facilitated by: (a) preparing and
implementing the first phase of a major reform of health sector finance and
management, including the roles of the public and private sector in financing
and delivery of health care, the legal framework, organization and management,
and institutional development. In addition, a pilot project to decentralize
health care management and improve resource allocation would be supported; (b)
developing a Health Information System to assist managers set objectives,
allocate resources, anticipate needs and monitor performancel and (c)
developing the Health Services Management Institute as a high level tralning
and research institute for health sector policy and management.
10.         Amman ft eW: During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that it would: (a) provide a total of five additional qualified
staff for the Family Planning and Sex Education Unit, the Bucharest
Reproductive Health Center and the Directorate of Human Resoirces by December
31, 1991; (b) by September 30, 1992, prepare and review with the Bank a
contraceptive marketing and distribution plan for the years 1993-95; (c)
continue to adjust annually prices of reproductive health interventions to
encourage the use of contraceptiveos (d) prepare for Dank review by July 1,
1992 a career plan for nurses to reward improved qualifications and standards
and begin to implement the agreed plan by January 1, 1993; (e) sell drugs
procured through the project to health institutions at least at the CIF price
converted into Lei at the market exchange rate, plua a suitable distribution
margin2; (f) prepare and review witL the Bank a restructuring and privati-
zation plan for the pharmaceutical industry by December 31, 1992 and begin
implementation shortly thereafter; (g) by December 31, 1991: (i) set up and
staff to agreed standards the National Council for Health promotion and
Education; and (ii) prepar and review with the Bank for iunudiate
implementation a development plan for health promotion and public
participation for the years 1992-94.
11.         During negotLations, the Government also provided assurances that
it would: (a) carry out preparatory studies for a new national health
strategy, review them with the Bank by December 31, 1992 and begin imple-
mentation of the new strategy by July 1, 1993; (b) by January 1, 1992,
Introduce new regulations to decentralize health care management and begin
implementation of pilot decentralization programs, and by December 31, 1993,
Introduce successful decentralization actions on a country-wide basis; and (c)
by March 1, 1992, ensure the necessary academic cortification of the programs

of the School of Health Systems and Management, and introduce incentives which
will make specialization 'n health services management an attractive career in
Romnia.
12.         The Government also agreed tot (a) submit semi-annual progress
reports mad an annual report on project impactl (b) carry out annual audits of
acceptable quality by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank in
accordance with the March 1982 Bank "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and
AuAiting of Projects Financed by the World Bank"; (c) make available to the
Bank annual audit reports for the preceding fiscal year no later than June
30th each year; and (d) carry out jointly with the Bank a mid-term review of
the project's progress no later than June 30, 1993.
13.         G9iWJ    e of EffoZtlvenaeuss  Loan effectiveness would be
conditional on adequate staffing of the Project Coordination Unit in the
Ministry of Health.
14.         hafZAss  The major benefits from Improved primary health care
would includes (a) a reduction in morbidity and mortality in infants and
children under five years of agel (b) improved access and choice for women in
the field of reproductive health services, leading to a reduction in maternal
mortality and morbidity and improved reproductive healtht (c) reduced
mortality and morbidity from such causes as cardio-vascular dlsease and
accidents; and (d) reduced unit costs of health care through improved
utilization of lower cost health services. In addition, better blood products
and ensured supplies of vaccines would help reduce the incidence of AIDS and
Hepatitis 3, and morbidity from infectious diseases. Strengthening health
promotion and participation would encourage a switch in focus from curative to
preventive medicine, with major benefits to the population and to the cost-
effectivenes  of health care delivery. Restructurig health care finane  nd
managment and the pharmceutical industry would provide the framework for a
sustainable, cost-effective health care delivery system in the medium-term.
15.         tisks. The major risk concerns the institutional weaknesses in
the sector which could constrain implementation and meaningful reform.
Romania's isolation from the outside world has left a dearth of skilled staff
in the sector, particularly in management, finance and policy analysis. The
project's structure (investments to improve PHC and providing the institu-
tional basis to carry out a medium-term reform program) is designed to
minimise this risk by providing immediate assistance for critically affected
pFrts of the health sector, and at the same time building the institutional
base for meaningful reform. The second risk concerns Government capacity to
provide the necessary local resources during a time of economic crisis. To
reduce this risk, the project has been designed to minimise incremental
recurrent costs as a result of new investments. In addition, the restructuring
studies will point to diversified sources of financing and propose efficiency
gains which will alleviate the pressure on tha central budget.
