       increase the capacity of RNTP to carry out efficient road\n            rehabilitation and maintenance operations as required and\n            thereby help to increase economic activity in two pilot\n            regions of Congo by improving highway access and reducing\n            transport costs as rapidly as possible. Over a 3-1/2 year\n            period the project involves: (i) road maintenance equipment\n            and workshop improvements to support a highway\n            rehabilitation and maintenance program for unpaved roads in\n            the two pilot regions; (ii) technical assistance for the\n            training of training instructors, management, maintenance\n            and workshop personnel; and (iii) technical assistance to\n            help improve highway planning and to develop the local\n            construction industry. The main benefits of the project\n            would be to increase Congo's road maintenance\n            management capacity, and help increase agricultural\n            production in two important regions of the country by\n            reducing transport costs to road users."}, "docdt": "1982-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
