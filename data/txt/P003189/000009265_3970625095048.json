increase the supply of manufactured goods for both the\n            domestic and export markets. It would support policy and\n            institutional reforms designed to increase the efficiency\n            and productivity of industrial firms and to reorient the\n            industrial sector towards greater use of domestic inputs and\n            towards export markets. The Project would finance: a)\n            imports of spare parts, raw materials, intermediate goods\n            and other inputs, and (b) technical assistance, equipment\n            and training to help improve INDECO's capacity to\n            evaluate investment projects and improve the operation of\n            existing public enterprises, to enhance the Bank of\n            Zambia's capacity to forecast and budget foreign\n            exchange, to establish a tariff commission in the Ministry\n            of Finance, to prepare a program to simplify the duty\n            drawback system, to identify areas for expansion of the\n            sales tax base and to set up an export promotion board in\n            the Ministry of Commerce and Industry."}, "docdt": "1985-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
