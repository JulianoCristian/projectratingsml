It was\n            developed in response to the 1976 crop failure and to\n            Government's decision to allocate investments more\n            equitably between the cotton and Sahelian zones. The project\n            was intended as a two-year non-renewal operation composed of\n            14 subprojects. Owing to delays in project implementation\n            and the rapidly changing political and security situation in\n            Chad, the project accomplished very little. Only about 8\n            percent of the originally estimated project cost was paid\n            out. The vaccination campaign, an on-going activity from the\n            first drought relief project, was the only subproject for\n            which activities were to some extent successfully\n            undertaken. Although expenses were incurred for 4 other\n            subprojects, no activities were completed. The overall\n            performance of IDA was fully satisfactory particularly in\n            view of the constantly changing political circumstances in\n            which it had to operate. One general lesson of this project\n            is that IDA should have considered more carefully the risk\n            of including a bilateral aid agency, which might become\n            subject to substantial organizational constraints, in a\n            co-financing arrangement for a project which was for a small\n            amount, short time period and for which the processing was\n            well advanced."}, "docdt": "1984-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
