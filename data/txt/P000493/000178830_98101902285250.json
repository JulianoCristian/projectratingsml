project is designed to\n            finance drought-alleviating activities in the Sahelian Zone.\n            The project consists of 14 subprojects leading to: i)\n            increased development of crop farming; ii) sustained and\n            improved animal health services; iii) maintenance of water\n            supply; iv) expansion of forestry activities; and v)\n            increase in the Government's capacity to deliver\n            transport services. Benefits from the vaccination\n            subproject, which is by far the largest subproject, at 27\n            percent of total base cost, would accrue to some 250,000\n            families. Increases in output under seven other subprojects\n            would benefit about 20,000 families or 75,000 people. The\n            remaining subprojects are aimed at improving the\n            region's productive base, facilitating access to remote\n            areas and saving costs."}, "docdt": "1977-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
