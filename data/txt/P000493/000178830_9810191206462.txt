CHAD
SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Background
i.        The Government of Chad has requested IDA assistance in financing
a Sahelian Zone Project which would finance small subprojects.  After the
1976 crop failure, the project concept was identified by IDA in December
1976 and Government subsequently played the major role in project prepara-
tion. This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission that
visited Chad in February/March 1977.
Project Objectives and Description
ii.       The main objective is to initiate quickly actions of a drought-
alleviating nature that could sustain or lead to increased development of the
crop, livestock and forestry resources of the Sahelian Zone. There are two
principal secondary objectives: to help Government put into effect its new
strategy for the rural sector in the zone; and to work through and thereby
strengthen those government agencies that have effectively participated in
project preparation, notably the Committee of War Against Natural Calamities.
The project is intended as a two-year non-renewable operation but subprojects
which prove particularly successful and merit expansion would be considered
for inclusion in future IDA projects. Subprojects were selected by reference
to the five criteria established for the West Africa Drought Relief
Project of 1973. These criteria were that subprojects be of a drought alle-
viating nature, help restore the productive base of areas seriously affected
by the drought, generate benefits quickly, benefit a relatively large number
of people, and be demonstrably needed and supported by a local community
which would be prepared, where feasible, to make a contribution to its
costs through the provision of labor or local materials. A further cri-
terion was adopted for selection of subprojects for the proposed project,
namely that implementation be possible by existing institutions and without
undue recourse to additonal senior staff. The project would finance 14
subprojects, generally located in a 200 km belt north of the 600 mm isohyet,
and would comprise:
(a) increased development of crop farming, through (i) minor
land improvements in bottomlands (about 2,000 ha); (ii)
construction of 28 village warehouses; and (iii) a new ex-
tension and applied research center for flood recession
cultivation at Lake Fitri; and (iv) inputs for increased
vegetable production near N'Djamena;
(b) sustained and improved animal health services, through
(1) a comprehensive vaccination campaign in association
with adequate drug supplies in 1977/78; and (ii) partial
re-equipment of the vaccine production plant;



- ii -
(c) maintenance of pastoral water supplies, through (i) major
repairs to 40 open wells in Kanem; (ii) operation of
12 tubewells in Chari Baguirmi; and (iii) surveys of
groundwater levels and water points;
(d)  expanded forestry activities, through (i) expansion of
forestry management near N'Djamena (about 3,500 ha), (ii)
establishment of four forestry nurseries; and (iii) prospec-
tion for construction wood supplies;
(e)  improved capacity for Government to deliver services,
through (i) the construction and equipment of a garage;
and (ii) rehabilitation of six airstrips.
Parts of four subprojects would be located in areas currently inaccessible to
IDA staff and those subprojects which require on-site supervision would not be
extended beyond the secure areas until their accessibility is assured; in
addition, the rural development center at Lake Fitri would not be started until
accessibility can be assured. During negotiations, Government was informed
that, in accordance with normal Bank Group requirements, disbursements would
be conditional on IDA staff being afforded all necessary facilities to carry
out adequate supervision of subproject activities.
Project Implementation
iii.      No new institutions would be required for the organization and
management of the project. Overall responsibility for management would be
vested in the Technical Committee of War Against Natural Calamities (CWANC).
Financial control would be vested in the Office of Foreign Aid Accountirig
located in the Department of Planning.  Subproject execution would be the
responsibility of the respective in-line executing agencies, which are all
represented on CWANC.
Cost Estimates and Financial Arrangements
iv.       Project costs for the two-year period beginning October 1977 are
estimated at US$4.0 million (net of taxes), with a foreign exchange component
of 58%. It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$1.9 million be made to Gov-
ernment on standard terms covering 48% of project costs, comprising 49% of
foreign exchange costs, estimated at US$1.1 million, and 46% of local costs,
estimated at US$0.8 million. The Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) would also contribute US$1.9 million equivalent as a grauit to be dis-
bursed pari passu with the IDA Credit against 50% of costs. The remaining
project costs estimated at US$0.2 million would be contributed by benefi-
ciaries in the tubewell operation subproject and by Government in the forestry
management and forestry nurseries subprojects.
v.        The IDA Credit would be channelled through an account to be opened in
the name of the project at the Chadian Development Bank. The Office of Foreign
Aid Accounting would authorize disbursement of these funds as grants to the



- iii -
subproject executing agencies. Since Chad is unable to prefinance project
expenditures, IDA and CIDA would each contribute 50% to a revolving fund of
US$250,000 through the project account.
Procurement ard Disbursement
vi.       Procurement of vehicles and equipment (estimated cost US$1.3 mil-
lion) and materials for force account works (estimated cost US$0.2 million)
would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines in the case of contracts over US$50,000. In the case of contracts
of less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000 and of all contracts for
building construction, procurement would be through competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA. Bidders for garage
construction would be prequalified.   For contracts under US$10,000, direct
competitive purchasing would be employed. The services of the short-term
consultant required for the construction wood project preparation subproject
would be obtained following procedures acceptable to IDA.
vii.      Each of the 14 proposed subprojects would constitute a dîsbursement
category; an additional category would provide for audit and reporting. The
proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed: on 50% of expenditures with the
exception of the three subprojects noted below (US$1.5 million); for the
forestry management and forestry nurseries subprojects, 50% of expenditures on
vehicles and equipment, civil works and operating costs (US$0.1 million); for
the tubewell operation subproject, 50% of expenditures in the 12 months fol-
lowing effectiveness, than 25%, the balance not paid by IDA and CIDA being
payable by the beneficiaries (US$0.1 million). An amount of US$0.2 million
would be unallocated. Except for the revolving fund for which ex-post cer-
tification of expenditures would be made available, disbursements would be
made against import documentation, contracts and certified records of expend-
itures. Any remaining undisbursed funds could be made available for new
subprojects to be identified and prepared by CWANC and approved by IDA.
Benefits and Justification
viii.     Benefits from the vaccination campaign and drugs subproject, which
is by far the largest at 27% of total base cost, would accrue to about 250,000
families; it would have a benefit-cost ratio over 12 months of about 3:1,
arising from the heavy sunk costs and the immediate returns. The seven other
subprojects with identifiable direct beneficiaries would reach 18,900 families
or over 75,000 people. For those subprojects for which rates of return can
be calculated, the results are: bottomland development: 21%; vegetable
production: 23%; and open well repairs: about 19%. These three subprojects
constitute 21% of project base costs and their weighted average rate of
return would be 21%. The project would also have important institutional and
on-the-job training benefits by working through the CWIANC and by providing
opportunities for formally-trained staff to gain practical experience.



- iv -
Risks
ix.       The landlocked location and internal security situation entail
problems for all projects in Chad. One risk particular to the proposed
project is that project activities are located in the Sahelian Zone in parts
of which the security problem is pressing. While disbursements would be
conditional on IDA staff being afforded all necessary facilities to carry out
adequate supervision, there is a further safeguard in that, because of the
discrete nature of the subprojects, delay or even failure of one subproject
would not have serious repercussions on the others. An additional risk arises
from the innovative nature of some subprojects in which the executing agencies
have necessarily had little or no opportunity to prove their competence. On
the other hand, these agencies, being represented on the CWANC, fully partici-
pated in project preparation and are keen to execute subprojects entrusted to
them successfully; this is the best possible assurance of sound management al-
though the risk of imperfect execution of innovative works cannot be entirely
eliminated.  Nor can the risk that Government, despite its best intentions,
may be unable to provide recurrent cost financing after project completion be
entirely eliminated. This would, however, affect only three subprojects,
namely forest management, forestry nurseries and airstrips.
x.        With the assurances and conditions indicated in Chapter VI, the
project is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$1.9 million.



CHAD
SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Chad has asked for IDA assistance to help
assuage the effects of the 1976 crop failure in the Sahelian Zone of the
country. The project would finance 14 small subprojects designed to: increase
development of crop farming; sustain and improve animal health services; main-
tain pastoral water supplies; expand forestry activities; and improve Govern-
ment's capacity to deliver services to the zone. The project is not designed
to provide emergency relief nor to diminish substantially the impact of future
droughts. Rather, the project has the intermediate objective of initiating
quickly actions of a drought-alleviating nature that could sustain or lead to
increased development of the crop, livestock and forestry resources of the
zone. The project concept was identified by IDA at Government's request in
December 1976 and Government, through its Committee of War Against Natural
Calamities, subsequently played the major role in project preparation.
1.02      Previous IDA credits for agriculture have been made as follows:
(i) the Livestock Development Project (Credit 309-CD, US$2.2 million) in 1972
which, after initial difficulties, is now nearing completion satisfactorily;
(ii) the Drought Relief Project (Credit 445-CD, US$2.0 million) in 1974 which
is also nearing completion satisfactorily; (iii) the Sategui-Deressia Irriga-
tion Project (Credit 489-CD, US$7.5 million) in 1974, which was followed by a
supplementary credit of US$8.0 million in August 1976 and is progressing
satisfactorily; (iv) the Lake Chad Polders Project (Credit 592-CD, US$5.0
million) in 1975, which is progressing satisfactorily; and (v) the Rural Fund
Project (Credit 664-CD, US$12.0 million) in 1976, which has recently become
effective.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission
comprising Messrs. D. Steeds, M. Dia, K. Meyn, D. Notley and E. Sinodinos
(IDA), which visited Chad in February/March 1977.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Chad has an area of 1.3 million km  and is sparsely populated
with only four million people, of whom 3.5 million live in rural areas.
About half the rural population lives in the southwest or Cotton Zone,
defined as the five provinces generally south of the 1,000 mm isohyet,
which includes only 10% of the country's area and where smallholders
cultivate cereals, legumes and cotton under adequate and reliable rainfall



- 2 -
conditions.. Further north, as rainfall declines and becomes more variable,
rainfed cropping becomes increasingly precarious and transhumant pastorialism
increasingly important. This area is best considered as two zones - the
Transitional and the Sahelian - demarcated by the 600 mm isohyet, with
rural populations of 0.6 million and 1.2 million respectively.
2.02      Chad is among the world's poorest countries; GNP is about US$120
pe- capita; incomes in rural areas are about US$60 per capita. In general,
development is hampered by hostile natural conditions, poor infrastructure
and a bulk freight rate of CFAF 34,000 (US$140)/ton from ocean port. In
recent years, internal rebellion and the worst drought in half a century
have put additional strain on Chad's meager financial resources. Chad's
current budget has shown rising deficits since the early 1970s and, as a
result, Chad was neither able to contribute to new investments nor to cover
all of its existing recurrent costs, budgetary provision for some of which,
notably maintenance, has become increasingly deficient. With the coming to
power in April 1975 of an energetic military Government, however, the deteri-
oration of the internal security situation seems to have been halted. Recent
meetings between heads of state of Chad and neighboring countries suggest that
further improvement might soon be on the way. In addition, efforts are being
made to put Chad's financial house in order and, assuming that they will
continue, a balanced budget by 1982 and some modest current surplus in the
mid-eîghties appear possible in the judgment of the recent economic mission
(Report No. 1340-CD). The discovery of substantial oil deposits, increased
exploration, and prospects of exploitation brighten the hitherto gloomy
picture. Until the public finance situation improves, however, external
assistance will continue to be called upon to finance recurrent expenditures,
particularly maintenance. Since such assistance may not always be available,
projects with low recurrent costs after completion or a quick pay-off merit
high priority.
B. The Rural Sector
2.03      The rural sector contributes about 55% to GDP and about 90% to
exports, of which cotton, livestock and animal products, and fish are the
main commodities. Chad is normally self-sufficient in cereals and leguminous
crops; the only agricultural products imported in any volume in 'normal'
years are wheat (12,000 tons/year) and sugar (20,000 tons/year). Despite
the country's handicaps and problems, two substantial changes in farming
techniques have recently taken place: the application of fertilizer and
insecticide to cotton, and the use of work oxen, have both more than doubled
between 1973/74 and 1976/77 after a decade of slow albeit sustained growth.
Seed cotton production increased from about 100,000 tons/year in the mid-
sixties through 1973/74 to the record 175,000 tons in 1975/76 but, due to
unfavorable rainfall distribution, declined to 150,000 tons in 1976/77. Chad
is now the leading cotton exporter in West Africa. While these encouraging
changes in farming techniques have taken place in the Cotton Zone, there have
been no significant changes in farming techniques or in livestock management



- 3 -
in the Sahelian Zone; nor, however, has there been much official effort to
promote or even research possible changes until quite recently. The past
neglect of the Sahelian Zone affords an opportunity in that, although the
absolute production can never be great, relative increases can be substantial.
2.04      As annual rainfall decreases from the south to the north of the
country, rainfall variability and associated risks increase. In 1976, raqin-
fall was generally 20-30% less than the long-term average and the monthly
distribution was also unfavorable; cereal output in the Sahelian Zone is
estimated at 140,000 tons or only 60% of 'normal' production (Annex 1).
Emergency relief is required once again, although not on the scale of 1973.
While many donors have pledged emergency supplies, none has pledged the kind
of assistance envisaged in the proposed SZF project. Earlier, however, the
European Development Fund (EDF) had committed CFAF 1.7 billon (US$ 7 million)
to be shared equally between the agricultural and livestock subsectors in
the Sahelian Zone; this sum would be used for activities that are complemen-
tory to, and in three cases continuations of, the subprojects in the proposed
project.
The Drought Relief Project
2.05      After the worst drought in the Sahel region in 50 years in 1973,
when cereal output in the Chadian Sahelian Zone fell to 85,000 tons, or only
35% of 'normal' production, many donors participated in emergency food and
other drought-relief activities.  IDA financed the West Africa Drought Relief
Project which found expression as a separate project for each of the six
Sahelian countries concerned. In Chad, the project (Credit 445-CD) is
now almost completed and has been well executed.
2.06      The main project objective was to help re-establish the productive
base of areas particularly stricken by the drought, by helping people to
redevelop their farms and herds. A secondary but still important objective
was to help make the best use of the large volume of financial assistance that
was then forthcoming by setting up appropriate national mechanisms. Little
project preparation had been undertaken at the time of appraisal and the
project, as approved, constituted a line of credit to be used for financing
subprojects for whose selection explicit criteria were established. These
criteria were that the subproject be of a drought alleviating nature, help
restore the productive base of areas seriously affected by the drought,
generate benefits quickly, benefit a relatively large number of people, and be
demonstrably needed and supported by a local community which would be pre-
pared, where feasible, to make a contribution to its costs through the pro-
vision of labor or local materials. High-level National Coordinating
Committees were to be set up, to be responsible for the review and financial
approval of subprojects, to be the link between the disbursement channel and
the implementing agencies, and to review progress.



- 4 -
2.07      In practice, in late 1973 and 1974, Government was sorely stretched,
as in neighboring countries, in coping with the aftermath of the drought and
was unable to devise the innovative kinds of subprojects required to satisfy
the selection criteria. The total credit amount of US$2.0 million was finally
allocated, together with subsequent minor amendments, as follows: 30% for
groundwater development (buildings and tubewell rehabilitation and operation);
25% for warehouses of about 10,000 tons capacity for the emergency national
grain reserve; 10% for vaccines, drugs and construction of two veterinary
posts; 10% for construction of 12 regional farm input supply centers; 5%
for vegetable production near N'Djamena, 5% for studies, and 15% for vehicles,
equipment and supplies for four government departments (Rural Engineering,
Land Use Planning, Water Bureau and Planning). Construction of the grain
reserve warehouses and a soil study were let by contract; all other sub-
projects were executed by government agencies. The subprojects were com-
petently and fairly promptly executed and a satisfactory report was submitted
by the Government Financial Controller who audited the project in April 1976,
when the project was 85% disbursed.
2.08      The National Coordinating Committee did not meet during project
execution, although the Department of Planning did assure review of progress
and provided an effective link between the disbursement channel and the
implementing agencies. In late 1975 a Department of War Against Naturai
Calamities was created to replace the Emergency Relief Office that had
been set up in the wake of the 1973 drought.  At the same time, a National
Committee of War Against Natural Calamities (consisting of Ministers) and
a subordinate Technical Committee (consisting of Heads of Departments and
parastatal agencies) were formed. The latter has played the major rale in
preparation of this project and would, during project implementation, fulfill
the role that had been entrusted to the now defunct Coordinating Committee.
C. Sector Strategy
2.09      Government has declared that it wishes to change the composition
of its agricultural investments from a near-exclusive focus on the Cotton Zone
and the vicinity of Lake Chad, to a more equitable allocation between the
Cotton and Sahelian Zones. Government's thinking on sector strategy in the
Sahelian Zone is evidenced in recent decisions and in informal discussions.
In contrast to previous neglect, Government now intends to: make a substantial
increase in services to the crop and livestock subsectors, supported by the
EDF (para. 2.06); initiate work on variety selection for coarse grains and
leguminous crops (a start has recently been made); take the opportunity
afforded by present low stocking rates to encourage pastoralists to form
grazing associations (operational studies are underway); maintain rather
than expand stock watering points; explore all possibilities whereby bene-
ficiaries can contribute to the cost of specific services rendered (as in the
recently-created animal health groups in the Cotton Zone); and expand work
in the forestry and fishing subsectors. Many of these intentions are new
and, although some have not yet been put to the test, they constitute a
welcome change.



- 5 -
2.10      Government has been re-thinking its approach to marketing and
pricing, and particularly of livestock. A new mixed company is being formed,
which will be responsible for orderly live animal exports and have a monopoly
of exports of chilled meat, and in which Government will hold a 51% share.
Cattle traders have been invited to participate, in exchange for export
licenses and, so far, over CFAF 100 million (US$400,000) has been subscribed.
The prohibition on live animal exports was lifted in February 1977 and normal
trade with Nigeria, policed by the main cattle traders themselves, has now
resumed; livestock producer prices have increased accordingly. This measure
reflects a general tendency to remove arbitrary impediments to internal and
external commerce and to revert to a more market-oriented approach to
pricing.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Summary Description
3.01      The main objective is to initiate quickly actions of a drought-
alleviating nature that could sustain or lead to increased development of the
crop, livestock and forestry resources of the Sahelian Zone. There are two
principal secondary objectives: to help Government put into effect its new
strategy for the rural sector in the zone; and to work through and thereby
strengthen those government agencies that have effectively participated in
project preparation, namely the Committee of War Against Natural Calamities
and its members.
3.02      The project would finance 14 small subprojects. The project is
conceived as a two-year non-renewable operation but those subprojects which
prove to be particularly successful and to merit expansion would be considered
for inclusion in the second phase of the Rural Fund Project scheduled for FY
80. Of the 14 proposed subprojects, only two have not yet been fully prepared.
All subprojects were selected by reference to the criteria at para. 2.06
although only one subproject meets all criteria (para 5.01). A further
criterion was used to determine the scale of the subprojects, namely that
implementation be possible by existing institutions and without undue recourse
to additional senior staff. The project would finance:
-    increased development of crop farming, through (i) minor
land improvements in bottomlands (about 2,000 ha); (ii)
construction of 28 village warehouses; and (iii) a new ex-
tension and applied research center for flood recession
cultivation at Lake Fitri; and (iv) inputs for increased
vegetable production near N'Djamena;



- 6 -
-    sustained and improved animal health services, through (i)
a comprehensive vaccination campaign in association with
adequate drug supplies in 1977/78; and (ii) partial re-
equipment of the vaccine production plant;
-    maintenance of pastoral water supplies, through (i) major
repairs to 40 open wells in Kanem; (ii) operation of 12
tubewells in Chari Baguirmi; and (iii) surveys of ground-
water levels and water points;
-    expanded forestry activities, through (i) expansion of
forestry management near N'Djamena (about 3,500 ha), (ii)
establishment of four forestry nurseries; and (iii) pro-
spection for construction wood supplies;
-    improved capacity for Government to deliver services,
through (i) the construction and equipment of a garage; and
(ii) rehabilitation of six airstrips.
3.03      The project area would be a 200 km belt north of the 600 mm isohyet
(Map 12896). Parts of three subprojects would be located further south: the
vaccination campaign and drugs, groundwater surveys, and two of the airstrips
to be rehabilitated. The whole of one subproject - construction wood supplies
project preparation - would be undertaken south of the project area strictly
defined. Parts of four subprojects would be located in areas which are cur-
rently inaccessible to IDA staff and subprojects which require on-site super-
vision - bottomland development and village warehouses - would not be extended
beyond the secure areas until their accessibility is assured. The other two
subprojects - vaccination campaign and drugs, and tubewell operation - can be
supervised adequately from progress reports and other records.   In addition,
the rural development center at Lake Fitri would not be started until acces-
sibility can be assured and this would be a condition of disbursement for the
subproject. During negotiations, Government was informed that, in accordance
with normal Bank Group requirements, disbursements would be conditional on IDA
staff being afforded all necessary facilities to carry out adequate supervi-
sion of subproject activities.
B. Subproject Features
Increased development of crop farming
3.04      Water availability, and its conservation and management, are key
aspects of crop farming in areas of low and variable rainfall. In the
project area, there are four types of situations in which water is avail-
able in relative abundance. First, the ouadis, isolated deep depressions
of 5-20 ha in which the water table is only a few meters deep, are localised
in the south of Kanem prefecture. They are almost wholly exploited and
their intensification is being promoted in recently-launched projects.
Second, the polders, at the northern shore of Lake Chad, are remarkably



- 7 -
fertile but their drainage and irrigation require detailed preparation and
good management. Third, land adjacent to shallow lakes is watered, and
fertilized, by seasonal fluctuations in lake-level; this land, of which the
largest areas are at Lake Chad and Lake Fitri, is heavily exploited in the dry
season for bo.'. pasture and cropping, mainly sorghum and vegetables. Fourth
shallow depressions or 'bottomlands', well-watered either from accumulated
run-off or by flooding watercourses, are found throughout the Sahelian Z'>nie
where their area was recently estimated at 22,000 ha. Initial exploitation
is difficult in that soils are often heavy and the required labor input sub-
stantial yet, following the 1973 drought, the cropped bottomland area has
tripled to 2,000 ha; dry season sorghum and vegetables are the main crops.
The project would finance the improvement (800 ha) and development (1,200 ha)
of bottomlands (Annex 2), including topographical surveys, mechanical prepa-
ration of contour dykes and field bunds, supervision of dyke and bund cons-
truction by beneficiaries, and initial stocks of crop inputs and animal-drawn
implements. Farmers' participation would be organized by the village headmen.
The project would also finance the construction, equipment and initial opera-
tion of a rural development center at Lake Fitri (Annex 4) for which, as
agreed at negotiations, initial disbursement would be subject to agreement
between Government and IDA that security conditions permit efficient project
execution and access by IDA staff for purposes of supervision.
3.05      Dryland farming, despite its precariousness, is amenable to
modest technical improvement, notably through selected seeds, insecticides
and, in areas of heavier soils, animal traction; the EDF fourth phase will
finance a five-year project with these components.  Meaetime, the project
would finance the construction of 28 warehouses of 72 m , for storage of farm
inputs, implements and grain, in villages that have requested warehouses, that
have undertaken to contribute labor and materials, and that would be serviced
by the EDF-financed program. Construction costs would be CFAF 15,000 (US$60)
per square meter (Annex 3). The project would also provide an initial stock
of 26 tons of millet per warehouse to serve as a modest local reserve for use
in the pre-harvest period; farmers would reimburse in kind at the rate of 120%
of the quantity advanced.
3.06      Vegetable production near N'Djamena, on which successful experi-
mental work had been conducted by UNDP in the early 1970s, was financed under
the previous Drought Relief Project (Credit 445-CD); now, 150 farmers compris-
ing 50 individuals and six associations are cultivating 80 ha under vegetables.
In the light of this experience and in view of requests for input supplies and
extension services from many more people in the area, the project would
finance development of an additional 10 ha, and extension and input supplies
to an additional 70 ha under vegetables, involving 800 producers (Annex 5).
Fertilizer and insecticide would be supplied to producers exclusively on a
cash basis and this was confirmed at negotiations.
Sustained and improved animal health services
3.07      Livestock, despite low productivity, is the main source of cash and
subsistence for the rural population of the project area. The many endemic



- 8 -
diseases, notably rinderpest, pleuropneumonia and blackquarter, are an impor-
tant factor in the low productivity of the herds but are controllable by means
of sustained and effective animal health services. The existing staff of the
Livestock Department is competent to deliver such services; mobile teams
operate in the readily-accessible areas and elsewhere health services are
provided at veterinary sectors and posts. The Department received consi-
derable external financial assistance consequent on the 1973 drought and, in
addition to undertaking comprehensive vaccination campaigns through 1976,
broadened the scope of its work to include free distribution of limited
quantities of mineral licks and supplementary concentrate feeds. For 1977,
however, the remaining funding will not even suffice for a vaccination cam-
paign limited to the main diseases and the renewed drought in 1976 has imposed
abnormal hardship on the livestock producers; for other reasons, too, cost
recovery would not yet be opportune (para. 4.10). Whereas the proposed
IDA/EDF livestock project would finance animal health services beginning in
late 1978, and would include significant cost recovery mechanisms, such as full
cost recovery for drugs, that project would be more effective if such services
were sustained in the 1977/78 campaign. The project would therefore finance one
year's supply of vaccines and drugs, procurement of 18 vehicles and 20 camels
with gear, purchase of four radio receivers/transmitters and other small
equipment, free distribution of 200 tons each of mineral licks and feed
concentrates, vehicle and equipment operating costs and one year's salaries of
35 temporary vaccinators (Annex 6). In view of transhumance and the scope
of the proposed IDA/EDF livestock project, the project area for this sub-
project would include both the Sahelian and Transitional Zones; vaccines
would, moreover, be purchased for the national herd.
3.08      The vaccine production unit at N'Djamena produces about 10 million
doses per year of which about half are exported. Pricing policy adequately
provides for full cost recovery. Costs have not been fully recovered since
1973, however, because of the inability of Chad, and to a much lesser extent
some other countries, to pay for vaccines produced. Maintenance and replace-
ment of equipment has suffered accordingly and there is no prospect of re-
covering the arrears. Given the substantial sunk costs in buildings, equip-
ment and trained local staff, the project would finance the re-equipment re-
quired both for replacement and, in the case of bacterial vaccines, for
modernization and diversification of production (Annex 7). The major items
would be fermenters, a sterilizer, filters, a small lyophilisater and a
freezer.  Future re-equipment would be financed from sales proceeds which,
for Chad, would be funded through 1982 under the proposed IDA/EDF livestock
project.
Maintenance of pastoral water supplies
3.09      Existing pastoral water supplies include shallow wells of up to
25 m depth, which are easily dug by hand in light, sandy soils; lined, open
wells of up to 70 m depth, which have to be constructed and maintained by
skilled teams using power equipment; and a dozen deep tubewells located mainly
on stock routes. Lined open wells have been constructed under various
external aid programs since the early 1950s but, without maintenance, well
screens have become blocked and well linings have deteriorated. The tube-



- 9 -
wells, having been inoperative for several years, were rehabilitated follow-
ing the 1973 drought and equipped with new diesel-generating sets and
electric submersible pumps.
3.10      The Rural Fund Project (Credit 664-CD) will finance the well main-
tenance unit in Batha prefecture through end-1979. The proposed project would
finance, also through end-1979, the pastoral well section of the Kanem pre-
fecture maintenance unit, which would have a capacity of 20 major repairs per
year (Annex 8); the repair cost per well would be CFAF 2.5 million (UJS$10,000)
or about a third of the cost of a new well. These repairs would be undertaken
in Iloussoro subprefecture where, due to the transhumant skills of the pas-
toralists, livestock losses in the 1973 drought were relatively low and there
was little degradation of the natural rangeland. Works would be undertaken
only at sites approved by the Livestock Department. The project would also
finance, as an extension of one of the subprojects financed under the previous
Drought Relief Project (Credit 445-CD), the operation and maintenance of
the twelve tubewells on stock routes (Annex 9). The project would, however,
contribute only 50% to subproject costs in the second project year; the other
half would be contributed by the beneficiaries and this was confirmed at
negotiations. The project would also finance (Annex 10) two mobile teams and
their equipment to make surveys of groundwater levels and water points, both
in the Sahelian Zone and south of N'Djamena.
Expanded forestry activities
3.11      The long-standing need to protect the fragile natural resources
of the Sahelian Zone has been further accentuated by the recent droughts.
Reafforestation prograrms financed by various external aid agencies have,
however, been very costly and, even technically, have yielded disappointing
results. A pilot forest management program, launched in mid-1975 with UNDP
assistance, has by contrast provided encouraging indications of the colla-
boration that can be established with forest users. After construction of
firebreaks and access trails, the pilot program has succeeded in obtaining
strict observance of a forest management plan. A national Tree Week, also
launched in 1975, with the objectives of promoting voluntary planting of
seedlings and of sensitizing people to the importance of forestry, has also
met with an unexpectedly favorable response, and at little cost, in the area
south of N'Djamena where forestry nurseries are operative.  Following these
initiatives, but mindful of the acute lack of trained forestry staff, the
project would finance two small subprojects and one study in forestry. The
forest management program (Annex 11) would be expanded in an area about 80 km
south of N'Djamena by an additional 3,500 ha at a cost of CFAF 12,000 (US$50)
per ha (Annex 11). In order to extend the program to promote ecological
awareness, based on the Tree Week, into the Sahelian Zone, the project would
finance the establishment and initial operation of two forestry nurseries and
the reestablishment of two others, each of 2 ha (Annex 12). In addition, and
following recent project identification work financed by FAC, the project
would finance the preparation of a project in improved management of natural
stands of Borassus palm located 200 km south of N'Djamena (Annex 13); this
would provide an increased alternative source of supply of construction wood.



- 10 -
Detailed terms of reference, mutually acceptable to Government and IDA, would
be prepared and this was confirmed at negotiations; it was also agreed that
the qualifications, experience and conditions of employment of the short-term
consultant would be mutually acceptable.
Increased capacity to deliver services
3.12      In the sparsely-populated project area, land transport conditions
in the predominantly sandy terrain are arduous and slow, and distances are
large; the delivery of government services, emergency and routine, is diffi-
cult and costly. Given the importance of air transport in these conditions,
and that there has been no maintenance of airstrips since 1971, the project
would finance minor rehabilitation works, essentially resurfacing, at six
airstrips in the administrative capitals of prefectures (Annex 15). The
movement of staff for the management and supervision of projects, and the
capacity to air-lift emergency food and other supplies would thereby be as-
sured for about five years. The project would also finance the construction
and equipment of a garage for the Department of War Against Natural Calamities
which now has a fleet of 228 low-mileage or new vehicles, including 138 trucks
(Annex 14). These vehicles were supplied by several external donors after the
1973 drought and, when not required to contend with calamities, are used for
transport of supplies to development projects. IWith such a large fleet, the
department could probably realize significant reductions in vehicle mainte-
nance and repair costs if it operated its own garage. Although a preliminary
design has been made, this subproject is not yet fully prepared and its
justification, although apparent, is not yet documented; nor have any ar-
rangeiments been made to secure adequate working capital. Satisfactory per-
formance of each of these three steps, which are expected to be completed by
December 31, 1977, would be conditions of disbursement for this subproject.
C. Organization and Management
3.13      No new institutions would be required for the organization and
management of the SZF. Responsibility for management, coordination between
subprojects and progress review would be vested in the Committee of War
Against Natural Calamities (CWANC), which would meet semi-annually and report
to IDA. Financial control would be vested in the Office of Foreign Aid
Accounting, located in the Department of Planning, as is customary for IDA
projects. Subproject execution would be the responsibility of the respective
in-line executing agencies, of whom there would be eight:



- il -
Executing Agency                          Subprojects
1.   ONDR - National Rural        Bottomland development; Village warehouses;
Development Board            Rural development center-Lake Fitri;
2.   Agriculture Department       Vegetable production;
3.   Livestock Department         Vaccination campaign and drugs; Vaccine
production equipment;
4.   SERARHY - Rural Water        Open well repairs; Tubewell operation;
Supply Agency
5.   Water Bureau                 Groundwater levels and water points;
6.   Forestry Department          Forestry management; Forestry nurseries;
Prospection for construction wood
supplies;
7.   Department of War Against   Garage construction and equipment;
Natural Calamities
8.   ASECNA - Air Safety Board   Rehabilitation of airstrips.
The first five agencies are already involved in execution of IDA projects
and all have performed satisfactorily. The Forestry Department has recently
launched two successful pilot projects, with UNDP technical assistance in the
case of forestry management; the three proposed subprojects in forestry cons-
titute extensions to the two pilot projects and a project preparation study
arising from a recent identification study. During negotiations, Government
gave an assurance that arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, would be made by
December 31, 1977 to assure continuing technical assistance in forestry
management. The Department of War Against NaturaL Calamities is well managed
and is geared up to play the major role in distribution of emergency food
relief in 1977. The emergence of CWANC as an effective means of project
preparation is due in large measure to the energetic management of the Depart-
ment. ASECNA has a proven record of technical competence in air safety; works
at five of the six airstrips to be rehabilitated would be subcontracted to the
Public Works Department which is involved in execution of two IDA projects and
has performed satisfactorily. A condition of disbursement of the airstrip
rehabilitation subproject would be that Government had entered into an agree-
ment, satisfactory to IDA, providing that ASECNA in cooperation with the
Public Works Department would execute the subproject. Each of the three
agencies that have not previously been involved in execution of IDA projects
would be competent to handle the works envisaged. Lines of authority and the
flow of project funds are indicated on the chart at Annex 16.
Reporting and Monitoring
3.14      Specific monitoring of project results would be required for those
subprojects, including bottomland development and forestry management, where
further investment might subsequently be warranted.   The Management Unit of
the Rural Fund Project (Credit 664-CD) and the Planning Unit of the Ministry
of Rural Development would participate in monitoring and report accordingly to
CWANC. CWANC would introduce, by December 31, 1977 and in agreement with IDA,
a reporting and monitoring system along the lines proposed in Annex 18 and be
responsible for timely reporting thereafter. An assurance in this regard
was obtained during negotiations.

IV.  COST ESTIIIATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
A.  Project Costs
4.01      Total project costs net-of-taxes for the two-year disbursement
period, 1977-79, and excluding farmers voluntary labor contribution, are
estimated at CFAF 970 million (US$4.0 million) with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of 58%. All project goods and services would be imported duty-free
as is customary for IDA-financed projects in Chad. Costs are detailed in
Annexes 2-15, aggregated in Annex 16 and summarized on the following page.
Cost estimates are based on mid-1977 prices and include (a) physical contin-
gencies of 10% of most items other than staff, and vehicles and equipment,
for which specifications and quantities are well established, and (b) expected
price increases compounded at the following annual rates for both local and
foreign costs: civil works 9%; all other items 7.5%. Total expected price
increases amount to 10% of base costs.
B. Proposed Financing
4.02      It is proposed that an IDA credit of US$1.9 million be made to
Government on standard terms to finance 48% of total project costs. The
credit would cover 49% of foreign exchange costs estimated at US$1.1 million
(CFAF 270 million) and 46% of local costs estimated at US$0.8 million (CFAF
196 million). The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) would also
contribute US$1.9 million equivalent as a grant to be disbursed pari passu
against 50% of costs as listed at para. 4.07(a).   A condition of credit
effectiveness would be that conditions precedent to disbursements under the
CIDA grant were fulfilled, save only the condition that the IDA Credit Agree-
ment had become effective. The remaining project costs would be contributed
by beneficiaries in the tubeweil operation subproject US$65,000 (CFAF 16 mil-
lion) and by Government in the forestry management and forestry nurseries
subprojects US$94,000 (CFAF 23 million).
4.03      The IDA Credit would be channelled through an account to be opened
at the Chadian Development Bank (BDT); the opening of this account would be a
condition of effectiveness and this was agreed at negotiations. The Office of
ForeiSg  Aid Accounting would authorize disbursement of these funds as grants
to the subproject executing agencies. The beneficiaries' cash contribution to
tubewell operation would be determined by Government on the basis of proposals
by SERARHY and collected by Government on behalf of SERARHY.

4.05      Experience with previous projects indicates that cash availability
is a major factor limiting the pace of project implementation and consequently
the rate of IDA credit disbursements.  Agreement was reached during negotia-
tions that, immediately after credit effectiveness, an initial disburse-
ment of US$250,000, of which CIDA and IDA would each contribute 50%, would be
made into the project account at BDT which would serve as a revolving fund to
finance project expenditures. This procedure would be similar to that adopted
for the Rural Fund Project (Credit 664-CD). IDA would replenish the revolving
fund on receipt of satisfactory evidence that expenditures were eligible for
financing from the proceeds of the Credit.  Should, however, any disbursement
from the project account fail to meet this condition, Government would be
under the obligation to deposit the corresponding amount into that account.
Ihis was confirmed at negotiations.



- 15 -
C. Procurement
4.06      Procurement of vehicles and equipment (estimated cost US$1.3 mil-
lion) and materials for force account works (estimated cost US$0.2 millionL`
would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA
guidelines in the case of contracts over US$50,000. In the case of contracts
of less than US$50,000 but more than US$10,000 and of all contracts for
building construction, procurement would be through competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures acceptable to IDA. Bidders for garage
construction would be prequalified. For contracts under US$10,000, direct
competitive purchasing would be employed. The services of the short-term
consultant required for the construction wood project preparation subproject
would be obtained following procedures acceptable to IDA.
D. Disbursement
4.07      Each of the 14 proposed subprojects would constitute a disbursement
category; additional categories would provide for the revolving fund, and for
audit and reporting. The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed to
cover:
(a) 50% of expenditures with the exception of the three sub-
projects noted below; total disbursement on these categories:
US$1,510,000;
(b) for the forestry management and forestry nurseries subpro-
jects, 50% of expenditures on vehicles and equipment, civil
works and operating costs; total disbursement US$146,000;
(c) for tubewell operation, 50% of expenditures in the 12
months following effectiveness, then 25%; total disbursement
US$84,000.
An amount of US$160,000 would be unallocated. Estimated quarterly dis-
bursements are shown at Annex 16, Table 3. Any remaining undisbursed funds
could be made available for new subprojects to be identified and prepared
by CWANC and approved by IDA.
4.08      Disbursements would be fully documented; however, disbursements
against staff and operating costs would be made against certificates of
expenditure, the documentation of which would not be submitted for review,
but would be retained by the Borrower and available for inspection by IDA
supervision missions.



- 16 -
E. Accounts and Audit
4.09      The Office of Foreign Aid Accounting would set up an accounting
system which would reflect, in accordance with consistently maintained and
sound practices, a true and fair view of the receipt and disbursement of
funds for the different subprojects. These accounts would be termed the
Sahelian Zone Project (SZP) accounts. The Office would have the respons-
ibility to check that claims from executing agencies were fully in accord with
the terms of the Credit and would have authority to reject claims with which
it was not satisfied. Separate accounts for each subproject would be kept by
the agency responsible for its implementation covering, at a minimum, cash
receipts, payments and balances, records of any stocks held and the identi-
fication of subproject costs, including vehicle operating costs and vehicle
log books. BDT would keep separate accounts for the project and subproject
funds it would handle. The SZP and subproject accounts would be audited
annually; the auditors would also review the proposed accounting and internal
control systems at the start of disbursements. The project would provide for
the fees and expenses of the independent auditors, and travel expenses of the
Government Financial Controller. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Government that: (a) the SZP accounts would be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA; (b) the accounts for each subproject
would be audited by the Government Financial Controller and may, in addition,
be audited by the independent auditors to the extent they judge necessary for
the completeness of their audit of the SZP accounts, and for satisfying
themselves as to the correctness of reimbursement claims made for each sub-
project, and to the end-use of funds; (c) the reports of both the independent
auditors and the Government Financial Controller would be submitted by CWANC
to IDA within four months of the close of each project financial year; (d) the
report of the independent auditors would be of such scope and in such detail
as IDA may reasonably request.
F. Financial Implications for Government
4.10      Of the 14 subprojects, two would become self-financing by project
completion: vegetable production and tubewell operation. Two subprojects
are studies and would entail no recurrent costs: construction wood project
preparation and the inventory of groundwater levels and water points, which
should permit future cost savings by better planning of water supply works
and maintenance. Two subprojects involve works that would be maintained by
the beneficiary communities and would entail no other recurrent costs: bottom-
land development and village warehouses; in both cases, an expansion of the
project-financed works is envisaged under the EDF fourth phase. Four sub-
projects would entail recurrent costs but such costs would be financed
through new projects currently under preparation: animal health services,
vaccines and open well repairs would each be financed under the proposed



- 17 -
IDA/EDF livestock project, which would include significant cost recovery
mechanisms;  the rural development center at Lake Fitri would be financed
for a further three years under the EDF fourth phase, whereupon a regional
development project would be prepared.   Of the four remaining subprojects,
two would entail recurrent costs to be borne by Government, namely forestry
management (CFAF 3 million/year-US$12,000) and forestry nurseries (CFAF 12
million/year-US$49,000). The garage subproject would entail recurrent costs
but would be undertaken only if significant cost savings were to be realized
(para. 3.12). Finally, the airstrip rehabilitation subproject would entail
recurrent maintenance costs of about CFAF 4 million/year (US$16,000) or a
rehabilitation program every five years. In sum, the explicit recurrent costs
to be financed by Government through 1982 would amount to CFAF 19 million/year
(US$77,000). Thereafter, recurrent costs would increase consequent on comple-
tion of the proposed IDA/EDF livestock project and of the agricultural compo-
nent of the EDF fourth phase. At that time, however, the recurrent budget is
expected to be in far better shape (para. 2.02). In addition, whereas Govern-
ment is keen to explore all possibilities for cost recovery (para. 2.09), it
has been critized for its hitherto low development expenditures in the Sahelian
Zone. While it would not be opportune to pursue cost recovery too vigorously
at the inception of a new phase of increased development expenditures, it is
anticipated that Government would be able to make some headway in effecting
cost recovery by the early 1980s. Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that Government would provide for the financing of all recurrent costs
after project completion.
V. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The project would finance 14 subprojects which have been selected by
reference to the five criteria established under the West Africa Drought
Relief Fund Project and one additional criterion (para. 3.02). The extent to
which subprojects meet selection criteria, narrowly interpreted, is detailed
at Annex 17 and summarized below:
No. of subprojects
Criterion                            meeting criterion
Drought alleviating nature                             9
Restore productive base                                8
Generate benefits quickly                             10
Benefit large number of people                         7
Participation by beneficiaries                         6
No additional senior staff                             9
Although only one subproject - bottomland development - meets all six
criteria, the remaining subprojects meet at least one and in most cases
several criteria.



- 18 -
5.02      The vaccination campaign and drugs subproject is by far the
largest, at 27% of total base cost, and would benefit about 250,000
families. The seven other subprojects with identifiable direct benefi-
ciaries would reach 18,900 families or over 75,000 people (Annex 17).
5.03      The vaccination campaign and drugs subproject would have a benefit-
cost ratio over 12 months of about 3:1, arising from the heavy sunk costs
and the immediate returns (Annex 6). The second-largest subproject, the
garage construction and repair, is not yet fully prepared; a mutually accept-
able justification in terms of cost savings would be a condition of disburse-
ment. For those subprojects for which rates of return can be calculated, the
results are: bottomland development - 21% over 10 years; vegetable production
- 23% over 10 years; in addition, the rate of return to the open well repair
subproject would be of the same order as that calculated for the pastoral
wells subproject of the Rural Fund Project (Credit 664-CD) - 19% over 20
years. These three subprojects constitute 21% of project base costs and their
weighted average rate of return would be 21%.
5.04      The project would have an important institutional benefit in that
the CWANC, having emerged as an effective means of project preparation, would
be given a further opportunity, through responsibility for management, to test
its usefulness. The project would also have an important staff training
benefit through acquisition of experience on-the-job; this is what is now
required in Chad where, through lack of funds, formally-trained staff have
little opportunity to gain practical experience.
Risks
5.05      The landlocked location and internal security situation entail
problems for all projects in Chad. One risk particular to the proposed pro-
ject is that project activities are located in the Sahelian Zone in parts of
which the security problem is pressing. While disbursements would be condi-
tional on IDA staff being afforded all necessary facilities to carry out ade-
quate supervision, there is a further safeguard in that, because of the dis-
crete nature of the subprojects, delay or even failure of one subproject would
not have serious repercussions on the others.  An additional risk arises from
the innovative nature of some subprojects in which the executing agencies have
necessarily had little or no opportunity to prove their competence. On the
other hand, these agencies being represented on the CWANC, fully participated
in project preparation and are keen to execute subprojects entrusted to them
successfully; this is the best possible assurance of sound management although
the risk of imperfect execution of innovative works cannot be entirely elimi-
nated. Nor can the risk that Government, despite its best intentions, may be
unable to provide recurrent cost financing after project completion be entirely
eliminated. This would, however, affect only three subprojects, namely forest
management, forestry nurseries and airstrips.

VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations, Government gave assurances that:
(i) CWANC would introduce, by December 31, 1977 and in agree-
ment with IDA, a reporting and monitoring system along the
lines proposed in Annex 18 and be responsible for timely
reporting thereafter (para. 3.14);
(Ii)  for any disbursement out of the revolving fund that
may be found to be ineligible for financing under the
Credit, Government would deposit the corresponding
amount into that account (para. 4.05);
(iii) accounts would be audited as indicated at para. 4.09;
(iv)  Government would provide for the financing of all
recurrent costs after project coiapletion (para. 4.10).
6.02      Conditions of effectiveness would be that:
(i) conditions precedent to disbursements under the CIDA grant
were fulfilled, save only the condition that the IDA Credit
Agreement had become effective (para. 4.02);
(ii)  a project account been opened at the BDT (para. 4.03).
6.03      Conditions for disbursement on particular subprojects would be
that:
(i) for the rural development center at Lake Fitri, an agreement
had been reached between Government and IDA that security
conditions permit efficient project execution and access
by IDA staff for purposes of supervisioin (para 3.04);
(ii)  for garage construction and equipment, a mutually accep-
table final design, justification and provision for working
capital had been made (para. 3.12).
(iii) for the rehabilitation of airstrips subproject, Government
had entered into an agreement, satisfactory to IDA, providing
that ASECNA in cooperation with the Public Works Department
would execute the subproject (para. 3.13).
6.04      With the indicated assurances and conditions, the proposed project
is suitable for a credit on standard terms of US$1.9 million equivalent to
the Government of Chad.






ANNEX 1
SAtiEL- N,î ZONE PRGJECT
RAIUFALL AND AGRIC iLTUP-AL PRODUCTION
Rainf all
1.        The 1976 overall rainfall deficit varied consi'erably within the
Sahelian Zone and, even, within Prefectures in the Zone but it was generally
of the order of 25% (Table 1.1). This is of the same order as the coefficient
of variation of annual rainfall: 23% at N'Djamena (626 mm/year) and 28% at
Abeche (465 mm/year). The distribution of the 1976 rains was, however,
particularly disadvantageous (Table 1.2); the rainfall deficit in August, at
the time of Llowering of millet, was 65-85% and deficits of these magnitudes
will have rendered the flowers infertile. September and October were rela-
tively wet months but the rains came too late to have any remedial effect on
yields, except in some areas in the southern part of the Sahelian Zone. In
addition, the depleted crops suffered from concentrated bird damage.
Cereals
2.        Whereas cereal output in the Sahelian Zone in the "normal year"
is estimated at 240,000 tons, or a little less than estimated demand, output
in the 1976/77 crop season is estimated to have fallen to 140,000 tons, or to
60% of normal production (Table 2). In the severe drought year of 1973/74,
of which the probability is 0.02, 1/ output was estimated to have fallen to
85,000 tons, or only 35% of normal production. These estimates of abnormal
cereal production may both have been understated but the relative order of
magnitude is probably about right. In the absence of any other information on
the variability of crop production, the probability of a crop failure such as
that of 1976 would appear to be about 0.10.
Livestock
3.        Cattle losses in 1973/74 were estimated at about 30%, although
losses of small stock and pack animals were much lower. No abnormal livestock
losses are anticipated during the 1977 dry season, however, partly because the
rangeland is in better condition that in 1974 and partly, too, because the
herd had been substantially reduced and had scarcely begun to be reconstituted.
There will nonetheless be a setback in livestock production both through
higher than average liveweight losses during the dry season and through
reduced birth rates in the following year.

1/ Data for October 1976 were not available to the reconnaissance mission .
2/ The June-September total disguises the severity of the deficit in August, the month in which millet flowers.
October 1976 was unusually wet, with 81 mm at Mao hut, after the severe rainfall deficit in August, too late to
have any remedial effect on yields.

the Sahelian Zone would exclude Guera as well as southern Chari Baguirmi and southern Ouaddai but the data do not permit
distinctions within prefectures.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
BOTTOMLAND DEVELOPMENT
General
1.        Bottomlands are flat depressions along the streambeds of open valleys
and are relatively well-watered either by accumulated run-off (bottomlands per
se) or by flooding watercourses (flood plains). The bottomland soils are
predominantly clayey with low permeability and the flood plains are usually
covered with alluviums deposited during the flood season.  Since the 1973
drought, farmers have progressively shifted to the cultivation of these areas
as a complement to rainfed agriculture. In three years, the bottomland area
under cultivation has tripled to 2,000 ha but this represents only about 10%
of the potential bottomland area; the Soil Service of the Department of
Agriculture estimates that there are about 22,000 ha of bottomlands in the
subproject area (subprefectures of northern Chari Baguirni, southern Batha and
nothern Ouaddai). The purpose of the present subproject is to: assist
farmers in the selection of the bottomland areas most suitable for farming;
and improve the productivity of sorghum cultivation through the use of seed
and fertilizer.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would finance the first two years of a five-year
bottomland development program. The following three years would be financed
by EDF as part of its allocation of CFAF 850 million to agricultural develop-
ment in the Sahelian Zone. The total IDA/EDF program would provide for the
development of 5,000 ha of bottomlands. The IDA subproject would finance all
the equipment and working capital costs of the total IDA/EDF five-year program
(airphoto-restitution, equipment, vehicles, agricultural tools and implements)
and an extension program for 2,000 ha of which 800 ha are already cultivated
areas and 1,200 ha would be new areas. Bottomland development would consist
of minor land improvement works based on a simple topographical plan. Initial
earthmoving for the construction of field bunds would be done by ONDR-operated
tractors. Farmers would participate by providing unpaid labor for moving addi-
tional fill and for forming and compacting field bunds, using small tools pro-
vided under the project. The schedule of work would be as follows: (Table 2)
(a) Project Year 1: 900 ha divided as follows:
(i) 500 ha for already cultivated areas, all in the
prefecture of Chari Baguirmi;



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(ii)  400 ha of newly developed bottomlands of which
300 ha will be in the prefecture of Chari Baguirni
and 100 ha in the prefecture of Batha.
(b)  Project Year 2:  1,100 ha divided as follows:
(i) 300 ha for already cultivated areas of which 200 ha
will be in the prefecture of Chari Baguirni and
100 ha in the prefecture of Batha;
(ii) 800 ha for newly developed bottomlands of which
300 ha will be in the prefecture of Chari-Baguirni,
200 ha in the prefecture of Batha and 300 ha in the
Ouaddai.
The project would also finance the establishment of eight very small forestry
nurseries which would provide the plants for windbreaks to be established in
the bottomlands. Finally, a small applied research component would include
seed testing and soil sampling, and fertilizer trials.
3.        The subproject would be executed by ONDR, whose incremental field
staff would be financed under the project. The Planning Unit of the Ministry
of Rural Development would monitor and evaluate the subproject both during the
first phase (2 years IDA subproject) and at the end of the total IDA/EDF five-
year program.
Subproiect Cost
4.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical contin-
gencies is CFAF 95.2 million (US$389,000) detailed,as follows (Table 1):

Justification
4.        Through the use of bottomlands, the subproject would promote a
complement to rainfed agriculture and thus reduce the effects of crop failure
due to rain deficiency. The use of bottomland would, in addition, contribute
to the extension of the farmers' working period beyond the rainy season. The
subproject would provide technical assistance to 4,000 farm families (one
extension agent per 200 farm families) and improve traditional bottomland
farming methods, thereby preventing and reversing reductions in yield after
the first few years' exploitation.  Under traditional methods, the sorghum
yield would decrease from about 800 kg/ha in the first year to about 600 kg/ha
after the 5th year. The average yield on cultivated bottomlands is less than
700 kg/ha. The effect of the minor land improvement works and modest levels
of improved inputs would be a sustainable yield of about 1,000 kg/ha. The
economic rate of return would be 21% (Table 5).

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
VILLAGE WAREHOUSES
General
1.        After the 1973 drought a dozen warehouses were constructed
in the main towns of the Sahelian Zone, with financing from EEC and IDA
(445-CD). These warehouses, managed by ONDR, serve as regional transit
centers for inputs to be distributed to farmers; the total covered storage
area is only 1,226 m2 (Table 1). Now, Govermnent is keen to respond to
village communities' requests for covered input storage at the village level
and for small-scale local storage of millet. The objective of this subproject
is thus two-fold: to provide covered lockable storage for insecticide and
seed, tools and animal-drawn implements, and millet; and to constitute a
revolving fund whereby millet would be purchased locally and made available
during the pre-harvest period to farmers, who would subsequently reimburse
in-kind with a 20% margin to cover losses and costs.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would finance the construction of 28 village ware-
houses of 72 m2 external dimensions and thus provide 2,016 m2 of additional
storage capacity. Warehouses would be built according to the standard plan of
the Department of Agriculture, in which the foundation is in reinforced con-
crete and the warehouse is divided into three compartments with a total of
58.5 m2 usable capacity: 16.5 m2 for millet, 21 m2 for insecticides, and 21 m2
for tools, implements and other inputs. The millet storage compartment
would have cement, parpen walls while the other compartments would be made
from mud bricks and covered with cement plaster.  The bricks would be supplied
and erected by the village community. Doors and windows would be in steel and
the roof in aluminum sheeting. Construction would be undertaken by force
account. The warehouses would be built in the provinces of Chari-Baguirmi,
Batha and Ouaddai and an indicative schedule of locations is at Table 2.
3.        The subproject would finance the purchase of 728 tons of millet
(26 tons per warehouse) which would constitute the revolving fund. Each
warehouse would serve about 400 farm families or 1,700 people living within
a radius of 10-15 km; millet storage needs are calculated on the basis of
5 kg/head/month for the period June-August.
4.        The subproject would be executed by ONDR through its existing
personnel and in close collaboration with village communities. ONDR would



ANNEX 3
Page 2
own and manage the warehouses although, later, the village communities could
take over tlie management. The Planning Unit of the Ministry of Rural Develop-
ment would monitor the subproject both during the construction and subsequent
phases.
Subproject Costs
5.        The total subproject cost is CFAF 60 million (US$245,000) net-of-
taxes, detailed as follows (Table 4):

Justification
6.        Until very recently, ONDR's extension and input supply activities
have been confined to the Cotton Zone. The 28 warehouses would constitute
a first tranche of covered storage whereby OTDR would expand extension and
input supply services to the Sahelian Zone. The main beneficiaries would
be the 400 farm families living within a 10-15 km radius of each warehouse,
i.e., 11,200 families in total, or 12% of the rural population of the sub-
project area. These people have requested covered input storage at the
village level and would participate in its construction.  The millet stock,
also requested by village communities, would provide a small security reserve
but, more important, in the sparsely-populated and - in the pre-harvest season -
inaccessible, Sahelian Zone, such community stores would provide a new
competitive element in local markets.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
RURAL DEVELOPMENT CENTER: LAKE FITRI
General
1.        Lake Fitri is about 280 km east of N'Djamena and is the center of
a large internal drainage system. Seasonal fluctuations in the level of the
lake provide dry season pasture for the Batha herds as well as cropping
possibilities in the otherwise dead agricultural season. Exploitation of the
land exposed by the receding lake is important, if not critical, to the
regional economy but has never been studied with a view to improving its
management.
2.        Government is now keen to initiate rural development in the vicinity
of Lake Fitri. The proposed subproject would deal exclusively with agricul-
ture; livestock development in the area would be tackled through the proposed
IDA/FED livestock project. In an otherwise sparsely-populated region, there is
nonetheless severe competition between agriculture and livestock for use of
the land at the lakeside. This land is the limiting factor to production and
its increased productivity is the key ta increasing rural incomes in the
region. In particular, increased crop yields would relieve the pressure to
cultivate more land on the lakefront which presently endangers the valuable
swamp grass "Bourgou"-pastures.
The Subproiect
3.        The subproject would finance the construction, equipment and initial
operation of a rural development center. The subsequent three years' opera-
tion, as well as technical assistance costs during the first two-year phase
included in this subproject, would be financed as part of EDF's fourth phase.
The subproject would set up a 10 ha experimental farm to test seeds, fertilizer
response and water use; provide extension services, simple improved inputs on
credit, and animal-drawn implements to farmers; and organise simple land
improvement works to be executed by the beneficiaries on 50-100 ha/year.
After a few years' operation, the activities of the center would provide the
basic agronomic data required for the preparation of a subsequent rural
development project.
Subproject Costs
4.        The total subproject cost net of taxes would be about CFAF 60
million (US$245,000). A sound cost estimate cannot be made, however, until
the work program is more clearly defined and the respective items to be

financed by IDA and EDF clarified. Table 1 shows that some items are already
well-defined but that others, mainly the initial operating costs, require
elaboration. Pending further information, and on the basis of Table 1, the
break-down of subproject costs would be as follows:

Justification
5.        The land adjacent to the lake is necessarily less drought prone
than the rest of the Sahelian Zone, with the sole exceptions of the vicinity
of Lake Chad and the ouadis, mainly in Kanem, where the water table is close
to the surface. Increased land productivity around Lake Fitri is desirable
because of its relative immunity to drought and because it is the limiting
factor to dry season production in the region. Whereas Government has not yet
undertaken any rural development activities in the area, the proposed sub-
project would provide the means to undertake some simple activities on a
modest scale and to test possible future actions to be included in a subse-
quent rural development project. Although not yet fully prepared, the utility
of the kind of work that would be undertaken in this subproject is not in
doubt.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
VEGETABLE PRODUCTION
General
1.        The Drought Relief Project (Credit 445-CD) financed equipment (10
pumps and small tools), working capital (seed and fertilizer stocks), and a
vehicle and office supplies for the extension agents, for a vegetable produc-
tion subproject on the outskirts of N'Djamena. About 80 ha are now under
cultivation by 98 producers grouped into six associations and by 47 individual
producers. The average plot size is about 0.5 ha but experience has shown
that this is too large; it exceeds both the producers' managerial capabilities
and their family labor availabilities. Repayments of credits for pumps, small
tools and on-farm inputs are about 50% in arrears. The subproject was managed
by a subdivision of the Department of Agriculture which was adequately staffed,
technically competent and quick to cease credit to defaulters. It also
rendered useful marketing services by arranging for grouping of produce and
transport to the N'Djamena market, but trial shipments of melons to France and
to Cameroon, despite the apparently high profitability, incurred losses.
N'Djamena is and will have to remain the main outlet but there is still much
scope for increased production at remunerative prices; Department of Agriculture
staff have received requests for input supplies and extension services from
many more people in the area.
The Subproject
2
2.        The subproject would finance construction of two warehouses of 60 m
for storage of farm inputs and tools, the establishment and initial operation
of a 10 ha 'concentrated' plot which would be farmed by producers who choase
to abandon their rainfed cereals farming, and fertilizer and insecticide
stocks for an additional 70 ha. Insecticide and fertilizer would no longer be
supplied on credit but on a cash only basis. The Department of Agriculture
would continue to manage the subproject but would not undertake trial air
exports except through companies represented in N'Djamena.
Subproject Costs
3.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes would be CFAF 27.0 million
(US$110,000) detailed as follows (Table 1):

Department of Agriculture staff would continue to be paid by Government.
Justification
4.        Despite the considerable increase in local production in the last
few years, good quality vegetables are still fetching close to import parity
prices on the N'Djamena market. There remains much scope for local sales of
inceased production at remunerative prices as well as exports, initially of
melons, provided adequate commercial arrangements are made. Not only is the
market situation favorable, there is also much demand from potential producers
for the input supply, extension and marketing services envisaged. The major
shortcomings of the earlier vegetable production subproject would be avoided
by the allocation of smaller plot sizes, of 0.1 ha instead of 0.5 ha, and by
the provision that fertilizer and insecticide would be supplied to producers
exclusively on a cash basis. The economic rate of return would be 23%
(Table 2); a 10% increase in costs would reduce the return to 9% while a 10%
increase in benefits would increase the return to 36%.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
VACCINATION CAMPAIGN AND DRUGS
General
1.        Livestock is the mainstay of the 1.8 million rural people in
the Sahelian and Transitional Zones, based on about 3.0 million cattle, 0.9
million sheep, 1.7 million goats, 0.5 million camels and about 0.5 million
horses and donkeys (Table 1). Livestock producers' main objectives are
subsistence production and insurance against risks through herd build-up.
Traditional, transhumant production techniques are dominant, and these are
characterized by low productivity and wasteful losses. About one-third of the
cattle and about 10% of the other domestic livestock were lost in the severe
drought of 1973.
2.        Services to the livestock sector are poor.  They mainly consist of
annual vaccination campaigns against the major animal diseases (Rinderpest,
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), anthrax, blackquarter, haemorrhagic
septicaemia, poultry diseases and rabies). A small proportion of livestock
producers is being reached by deworming campaigns and has access to trypanocidal
drugs to control diseases transmitted by the tsetse fly. In the aftermath of
the 1973 drought, the scope of the livestock service has been widened to
include the distribution of limited quantities of mineral licks and supplemen-
tary concentrate feeds, with financial assistance from the EDF and Swissaid.
All services eie being rendered free; until 1973 Government collected annual
livestock head taxes which were dropped because of the drought and compensated
for mainly by EDF assistance. Government intends to obtain full cost recovery
for the services rendered from beneficiaries but the renewed drought in
1976/77 means again abnormal hardship for the livestock producers; it would
not be justifiable to aggravate their financial situation through collecting
service chargen now. On the other hand it is important to strengthen the
effectiveness of the livestock service, in order to minimize disease losses,
to alleviate the losses from drought and to permit fast herd reconstitution.
Cost Recovery from livestock producers would be gradually introduced under the
proposed IDA/EDF livestock Project.
3.        In the project area, the Livestock Department is structured into
four veterinary circonscriptions usually headed by a veterinarian: (a)
Centeîï West (N'Djamena); (b) North-West (Mao); (e) Center (Ati); and (d) East
(Abeche). These in turn are subdivided into twelve veterinary sectors
usue2Ay headed by a diploma level livestock officer (Massakory, Bokoro,
Mass-v>ya; Mao, Moussoro, Bol; Ati, Oum-Hadjer, Mongo; Abeche, Biltine, Am
Timar). The 32 veterinary posts, usually manned by veterinary nurses, are the



ANNEX 6
Page 2
lowest level of the service. Mobile terms operate in readily-accessible
areas, but elsewhere livestock services are offered at the veterinary sectors
and posts (Table 1). The service is competent to carry out vaccination
campaigns but lacks means of transport and inputs. Its effectiveness could be
improved substantially through making these means available.
The Subproject
4.        The subproject would finance:  (a) replacement of vehicles and
equipment; (b) the purchase of four receivers/transmitters; (c) the purchase of
20 camels with gear; (d) one year's supply of vaccines for the national herd,
drenches, trypanocidal and other veterinary drugs; (e) the distribution of
about 200 tons each of mineral licks and feed concentrates; (f) the operating
costs of vehicles and equipment; and (g) one year's salaries of 35 temporary
vaccinators. About two thirds of the cattle population would be covered ty
the rinderpest/CBPP vaccination, and other diseases would be handled according
to need.
Subproject Costs
5.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical con-
tingencies is CFAF 240.6 million (US$982,000) detailed as follows (Tables 2

.ANNEX 6
Page 3
Justification
6.        The maintenance of animal health services is the most efficient way
of supporting the livestock subsector in the Sahelian and Transitional Zones
considering the existing infrastructure in the area. Basic staff and infra-
structure exist, but they will not be fully effective unless equipped wlth
vehicles, vaccine-cooling equipment, and consumables such as vaccines, drugs
and medicines, mineral licks and concentrate feeds, as well as gasoline.
Measurable benefits deriving from the strengthened veterinary service would
consist of reduced calf and adult mortality, and deriving from this increased
milk and meat production, and incremental herd numbers (Table 4). Herd
fertility would also be increased somewhat although this is impossible to
quantify over a 12-month period. In addition, livestock producers in the
project area would develop increased confidence in the livestock service which
in turn would increase its usage and prepare the ground for introducing cost
recovery measures. The subproject would have a benefit-cost ratio, over 12
months, of 3.3:1 without shadow pricing of foreign exchange and 3.0:1 by using
a shadow foreign exchange rate of 1.25, assuming that half of the incremental
slaughter cattle would be exported and that the incremental milk production
would be consumed locally. The benefit-cost ratio is calculated using cur-
rent livestock market prices as a proxy for future benefits arising from
deaths prevented; since all benefits so valued are obtained within 12
months of incurring the costs, undiscounted values are used to obtain the
benefit-cost ratio.

VACCINE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT
General
1.        The Farcha Laboratory, established in 1952 on the outskirts of
N'Djamena, operates a livestock research program and a vaccine production unit
serving Chad and several other countries (Table 1). It is presently controlled
by the Institut d'Elevage et de Medecine Veterinaire des Pays Tropicaux
(IEMVT), a French Public Body, headquartered in Paris. It is intended that in
late 1977 control will pass to the Government of Chad.
2.        Research work, which was to have been financed equally by France and
Chad, has been reduced in recent years since budget difficulties have made it
impossible for Chad to maintain its contribution. Allied to the research
program in a financial sense at least, as they are paid for effectively by the
French Government, are valuable diagnostic and educational activities, which
are provided to Chad and other countries without charge. In contrast, the
vaccine production unit is intended to be self-financing, with the prices
charged recovering all expenditures together with, for countries other than
Chad, an additional amount for depreciation of fixed assets. Chad was
exempted from paying this additional amount, as it had provided some of the
original assets. A price increase formula operates to cover cost inflation.
An analysis of receipts and payments of the vaccine production unit for the
years 1963 to 1971 shows that, on average, a small surplus was achieved in
line with the objective that it cover its costs.
3.        The vaccine production unit has subsequently been severely hampered
by the, inability of Chad, and to a lesser extent some other countries, to pay
for vaccines produced. The resultant problems are two-fold. First, production
planning has become very difficult because the "convention" system, whereby
the requirements for the forthcoming season were agreed in advance, enabling
supplies to be ordered, has not been operable in relation to Chad. Secondly,
the cash shortfall affects re-equipment. The costs of vaccines supplied
without payment have been met to a large extent by emergency foreign aid, but
invoices totalling CFAF 72 million remain unpaid at 31 December 1976. Mainte-
nance and replacement of equipment has of necessity been kept to a minimum
whereas, had these amounts been paid, no problem of re-equipment would have
arisen.
The Subproject
4.        The subproject would finance the re-equipment required to ensure
that the vaccine production unit can continue to function smoothly. The



ANNEX 7
Page 2
equipment, listed in detail in Table 2, covers a range of items required
either because existing equipment has or is about to wear out or, in relation
to bacterial vaccines, for desirable modernization and, more important,
diversification of production.
Subproject Costs
5.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes is CFAF 35 million (US$143,000)
with a 100% foreign exchange component. No physical contingency is provided
since specifications and quantities are well established.
Justification
6.        Vaccination campaigns are probably the single most important service
that can be rendered to the livestock sector and an assured supply of good-
quality vaccines adapted to local circumstances is a prerequisite. The Farcha
vaccine production unit has a record of proven technical competence and has
been able to produce vaccines at prices considerably below those charged by
commercial organizations. The current financial difficulty is not due to any
inadequacy in pricing formulae, which fairly recover costs from participating
countries, but to non-payment. Future re-equipment would be met from sales
proceeds which, for Chad, would be funded under the proposed IDA/EDF livestock
project. The subproject would enable full use to be made of the substantial
sunk costs in buildings, equipment and trained local staff.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
OPEN WELL REPAIRS: KANEM
General
1.        In Kanem prefecture, there are over 400 modern lined wells of which
65% were built more than 10 years ago and have never been maintained. To the
west, in Nokou subprefecture, there are 156 modern wells but this area suffered
severe livestock losses and much degradation of the natural rangeland during
the 1973 drought; the rangeland has to be permitted to regenerate prior to any
resumption of livestock activities and repairs to modern wells should not
therefore be initiated until after another few years.  In the center, in Mao
subprefecture, there are only 31 modern wells but, although the area suffered
severe livestock losses in the 1973 drought, there was little degradation of
the natural rangeland; well repairs could therefore be initated in this area
but the need is not pressing since the water table is generally at only 10-12
m, or even less in the shallow depressions (ouadis), and traditional hand-dug
wells can be readily constructed.  In the east, in Moussoro subprefecture,
there are 214 modern wells, livestock losses in the 1973 drought were rela-
tively low owing to the transhumant skills of the pastoralists, and there was
little degradation of the natural rangeland.  In the major depression of Bahr
El Ghazal and to the south of Moussoro town, the water table is at less than
15 meters, but to the east the groundwater depth increases to 30-40 m. This
is the first-priority area for the initiation of well repairs.
2.        The SERARHY base at Mao, built and equipped with FAC financing,
became operative in 1976.  Its work program for 1976/77 includes nine major
repairs and five new wells on the site of existing wells that are beyond
repair, all in Moussoro subprefecture. The pastoral wells section has no
funding after 1977.  The base supervisor is a Chadian who was trained in the
UNDP well-digger training project and who will be assisted for three years by
an expatriate well-digger financed by UNDP.  The base is now working well but,
already, experience has shown that it is insufficiently equipped given the
particular problems of transport in the sandy country of East Kanem.
The Subproject
3.        The subproject would finance major repairs to 20 wells per year for
two years. The work would entail the cleaning of blocked screens or their
extraction and replacement, repairs to cement linings, and reconstruction of
the well-head and cattle troughs. Works would be undertaken only at sites
approved by the Livestock Department.  The subproject would provide a four-
wheel-drive 10-12 ton truck and one crane with engine to be used exclusively

for major repairs in east Kanem. The subproject would be executed by SERARHY,
whose existing supervisory staff can manage the repair program, and whose
headquarters workshop can handle all vehicle and plant repairs.
Subproject Costs
4.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical
contingencies is CFAF 57.1 million (US$233,000) detailed as follows (Table 1):

Justification
5.        The subproject would be executed in that area of Kanem where the
natural rangeland was not severely degraded nor were there important livestock
losses during the 1973 drought, and where the water table is generally too
deep to permit construction of traditional wells. The repair work would
restore the discharge obtainable from 40 lined wells, that are no longer or
only partially used, to be selected from the 140 wells in Moussoro subprefec-
ture that were built more than 10 years ago. The subproject would thereby
reopen areas of natural rangeland to pastoralism and, by the same token,
reduce the pressure for grazing around the wells that are presently operative.
Each well would permit the watering of up to 1,000 cattle per day during the
rainy season, or the herds belonging to about 25 families. Beneficiaries
would contribute, initially and as is customary, by housing and feeding the
well repair teams and, later, through a payment system to be set up through
recognized pastoral groups under the proposed IDA/EDF livestock project. The
rate of return would be similar to that estimated for the pastoral wells
subproject of the Rural Projects Fund (Credit 664-CD):  19% over 20 years.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
TUBEWELL OPERATION: CHARI BAGUIRMI
General
1.        After the 1973 drought, Government obtained finance from various
sources to re-equip twelve disused tubewells in northern Chari Baguirmi. The
tubewells are located within about 150 km from N'Djamena along the two main
stock routes, from Massakory in the north-east, and from Dourbali in the
south-east. Eleven of the twelve wells have been re-equipped with an electric
submersible pump, two diesel-generating sets, a power house and a water reti-
culation system including a 300 m3 reservoir; the twelfth well is presently
being equipped. The value of these investments is about CFAF 25 million
(US$100,000) per tubewell. Except for two wells which operate throughout the
year, located adjacent to the main cattle markets of Massakory and Massaguet,
the wells operate for 9 months, from mid-October to mid-July. The average
discharge for 11,000 hours pumping in 1975/76 was 31 m3/hour and the charac-
teristics of the tubewells are shown at Table 1. Operating costs for 1975/76
and 1976/77 have been financed from the Drought Relief Fund (445-CD), in which
there was no explicit provision for the transfer of the responsibility for
operating costs; nor, however, has the political situation been favorable for
the transfer of operating costs to the beneficiaries for what is, in effect,
one of Government's most visible activities in northern Chari Baguirmi.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would finance the operational staff, spare parts and
fuel, plus the maintenance staff and their transport, required for the opera-
tion of 12 tubewells for two years. In Project Year 2, disbursements would be
made against only 50% of these costs, the balance being paid by the benefici-
aries. This is the direction in which Government wishes to move but requires
time to make a smooth transition to full cost recovery. The subproject would
be executed by SERARHY, whose supervisory staff are capable of ensuring sound
management and whose central workshop can handle all main overhaul work.
Subproject Costs
3.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical con-
tingencies is CFAF 55 million (US$224,000), detailed as follows (Table 2):

Beneficiaries would contribute 25% to subproject costs.
Justification
4.        It is important that the tubewells continue to operate but
that Government be given sufficient time to organize a smooth transition
of responsibility for operating costs to the beneficiaries. With the
exception of the two wells at the markets of Massakory and Massaguet,
the tubewells are presently being used for an average of about 4 hours/day
throughout the dry season, to produce about 120,000 liters/day/well or suffi-
cient to water 3,500 head of cattle per day. The pumping pSak during the
season varies from about 5 hours day at wells yielding 40 m /hour to 10
hoursJday at wells yielding 20 m /hour; in each case, peak pumping suffices
for the watering of about 6,000 head of cattle, or six times more than can be
watered at one open lined well. Cessation of operation of the 12 tubewells
would create a demand for open wells equivalent to 72 of the latter working
full-time or, in practice, more since the livestock would have to be scattered
among watering points that are already in use. Whereas this would have a
favorable environmental impact, it would entail great inconvenience on the
stock routes, which would find expression as increased marketing costs and
liveweight losses. The crux of the matter is the as yet unknown effective
demand for tubewells, at an average operating cost of CFAF 2.3/head/day. The
subproject would enable Government to make a smooth transition to full cost
recovery and to test the effective demand.

GROUNDWATER LEVELS AND WATER POINTS
General
1.        Systematic observation of groundwater levels in the west and south
of the country was undertaken in the period 1963-1968; subsequently, no
observations were made through 1974. Two studies were undertaken in 1975.
The first, a study of "Groundwater levels in the Proximity of Lake Chad"
undertaken by ORSTOM, revealed that the effects of the 1973 drought in Kanem
and northern Chari Baguirmi were quite varied; in two areas, groundwater
levels had, by 1975, regained the levels observed a decade earlier but, in two
other areas, groundwater levels had fallen several meters. The study could
not provide a satisfactory explanation of these phenomena and recommended the
drilling of observation tubewells along selected axes; the total cost of the
proposed program was over CFAF 100 million. The second study, an "Inventory
of Groundwater Resources and Water Points" was undertaken by FAC in southern
Chad. It compared groundwater levels in 1975 with those observed a decade
earlier and produced an incomplete quantitative and qualitative statement of
improved watering points. In sum, the studies revealed a possible problem of
recharge of the shallow aquifers of Kanem and northern Chari Baguirmi and a
general, practical problem of far from complete information on the number and
condition of improved water points.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would finance two mobile groundwater inventory teams
and their equipment. One team would operate in Kanem and northern Chari
Baguirmi, would observe groundwater levels at the beginning and the end of the
rainy season to assess intra-annual fluctuations and to permit comparison with
data collected in the mid-1960s, and would report on the condition of improved
water points. The other team would operate to the south, from N'Djamena
through the Cotton Zone. The subproject would be executed by the Water Bureau
of the Ministry of Natural Resources, whose Chief liydrogeologist, financed by
FAC, would supervise the field work and be responsible for all subsequent data
classification and analysis. The field work would be undertaken by the
existing technical staff on the Water Bureau.
Subproject Costs
3.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical con-
tingency is CFAF 12.6 million (US$51,000), detailed as follows (Table 1):

The Chief Hydrogeologist (financed by RAC) and the two technicians (financed
by Governnent) are not included in subproject costs, except for their respec-
tive field allowances.
Justification
4.        By assuring regular observation of groundwater levels in Kanem
and northern Chari Baguirmi for two years, the subproject would yield a
significant amount of new information relevant to the problem of recharge of
shallow aquifers and to the broad question of water-use policy. Both in this
area, where many of the activities envisaged in the proposed IDA/EDF livestock
project would be located, and in the south, where the village water supplies
component of the Rural Projects Fund (664-CD) is located, the inventory of
water points would provide a sound basis for the planning of well repairs and
site selection for new wells.

FORESTRY MANAGEMENT
General
1.        After the severe drought of 1973, the rate of destruction of the
natural forest stands around N'Djamena has quickened. The increased population
of the Capital (in part due to exodus from rural areas) created higher demand
for firewood and construction wood and therefore accentuated the woodcutting.
The depletion of pastures encouraged the cutting of young branches by herdsmen
to feed their cattle.  These factors combined with the frequent forest fires
have contributed to the increasing deforestation around N'Djamena. The
purpose of the present subproject is to arrest and reverse this trend through
the protection of natural forestry stands and the coordination of existing
forestry areas between users (herdsmen, farmers, households). The subproject
would extend an ongoing forestry management pilot project financed by UNDP
(Dougui Project), which has created fire-breaks and access trails and succeeded
in obtaining the support of the people for observance fo a forest management
plan.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would provide for a survey and classification of
natural forest stands according to their potential use in rotation (charcoal,
construction wood, pasture, farming) in an area of 3,500 ha located 80 km
south of N'Djamena. Subsequently the subproject would finance the creation of
firebreaks and the opening of access trials which would give to charcoal and
wood merchants access to selected areas. Exploitation by rotation would be
initiated, on the basis of 300 ha/year to be cut. The subproject would be
managed by the Forestry Department and implemented by its Forest Management
Unit which was set up under the UNDP pilot project.
Subproject Costs
3.        The total subproject cost, net-of-taxes, would be CFAF 41.9 million

Justification
4.        Elementary forestry management, in which the forest communities
become involved in the protection and systematic exploitation of their forests,
is certainly the cheapest and probably the most efficient means of arresting
and even reversing deforestation. This simple idea has, however, hardly begun
to be implemented. The success of the UNDP pilot project, in which the con-
flicting interests of the different forest users have been resolved, suggests
that expansion is now warranted.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
FORESTRY NURSERIES
General
1.        A national Tree Week was initiated in 1975 with the objectives of
promoting voluntary planting of seedlings and of sensitizing people to the
importance of forestry. The response to the Tree Week in N'Djamena and
further south was far better than even the Forestry Department had antici-
pated; Government now wishes to establish forestry nurseries in four Sahelian
Zone towns - Mao, Massakory, Ati and Abeche - because it is considered that
the Tree Week would be equally successful there provided the seedlings were
available locally. The Forestry Department has technical staff at Ati and
Abeche, where old nurseries have fallen into disuse. It has no staff at Mao
or Massakory, nor did it ever operate nurseries in these centers.
2.        Since 1955, the Forestry Department has undertaken variety observa-
tion work at Abeche (average annual fainfall: 465 mm/year; coefficient of
variation: 28%). For almost all species, the plant survival rate after ten
years has been less than 20%. Only three species have performed well:
Eucalyptus microtheca, Dalbergia Sisoo and Azadiractha indica, with survival
rates in excess of 80% and good growth. The latter, in view of its less
demanding soil requirements, is the best suited of the foreign species.
The Subproject
3.        The subproject would finance the establishment and initial operation
at Mao and Massakory, and the rehabilitation at Ati and Abeche, of forestry
nurseries of 2 ha each. The nurseries would produce seedlings of the better-
adapted local thorn-tree species as well as Azadiractha indica and, in smaller
quantities, Eucalyptus microtheca and Dalbergia sissoo. No further variety
observation work would be undertaken. The subproject would be managed by the
Forestry Department which would also be responsible for distribution of seed-
lings to volunteer planters.
Subproject Costs
4.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical
contingencies would be CFAF 50.1 million (US$204,000) detailed as follows

Incremental technical staff (CFAF 4.8 million/year) would be financed by
Governnent.
Justification
5.        The subproject would provide Government with the means to extend its
effort to promote ecological awareness, through the Tree Week and related
educational programs, to the vicinity of four Sahelian Zone towns. This, for
Government, is the main purpose of the subproject. The seedlings produced by
the nurseries would be planted in villages and schoolyards as well as in the
small towns. There would ultimately be a small firewood benefit but this is
secondary.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
CONSTRUCTION WOOD SUPPLIES PROJECT PREPARATION
General
1.        The "Identification Report on Wood Production for the N'Djamena
Market", financed by FAC and undertaken by CTFT, concluded that development of
new sources of construction wood - rather than firewood or charcoal - deserves
high priority in the next few years. Three possible construction wood projects
were examined: a eucalyptus plantation in the Cotton Zone, a saw-mill near
Sarh, and improved management of Borassus palm stands located between the
Logone and Chari Rivers near Ngam. Despite the low priority accorded to
firewood and charcoal, the report argued that deforestation around N'Dj'amena
had reached the stage at which natural forest manageMent was desirable, and
recommended a program similar to that outlined at Annex 11 above. Moreover,
development of new sources of construction wood would ease demand on the
natural forest around N'Djamena and facilitate its improved management. The
identification report concluded that a eucalyptus plantation would have low
profitability, but that the saw-mill and Borassus palm stands merited detailed
study.
The Subproiect
2.        The subproject would finance a study of the Borassus palm stands
near Ngam to determine how their existing management could be improved and the
utility of doing so. Although detailed terms of reference have not yet been
worked out, the study would require about four man-months of a consultant who
would spend two periods of about two months in Chad. During the first period,
he would specify the data-gathering field work to be undertaken by staff of
the Forestry Department. Towards the end of his second period, he would
specify what work, if any, could usefully be undertaken during the interval
between completion of his report and the decision on a subsequent borassus palm
management project.
Subproject Costs
3.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes would be CFAF 12.3 million
(US$50,000) detailed as follows (Table 1):

Forestry Department staff stationed at Bongor - a Technical Officer, six
Junior Technical Officers, and a driver - would continue to be paid by Govern-
ment, although their field allowances are included in subproject costs.
Justification
4.        The natural forest around N'Djamena is being degraded by excessive
cutting of young trees for extraction of poles of 8-10 cm diameter required
for traditional housing construction. Prices of construction wood continue to
increase rapidly and examination of alternative sources of building timber is
now opportune. The borassus palm stands near Ngam are presently being ex-
ploited on a modest scale even though the main Borassus area is 20-30 km
from the Chari River. Although the area has only been examined as part of a
reconnaissance survey, there is certainly scope for more intensive exploita-
tion; the proposed study would prepare a project to that end.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
GARAGE CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT
General
1.        In the wake of the 1973 drought, an Emergency Relief Office was set
up to coordinate the assistance provided from numerous sources. This Office
was replaced in 1975 by a Department of War Against Natural Calamities. The
Department acquired the assets of its predecessor as well as the pledges of
assistance that had not yet been honored. Now, the Department has a fleet of
228 vehicles of which 138 are trucks, manufactured by five different companies,
and 90 are light vehicles, including four-wheel-drive vehicles, 3/4 ton pick-
ups and small cars. A priori, the existing fleet of fairly new vehicles
exceeds the critical minimum required to operate a garage capable of handling
all work except main engine overhauls and specialized jobs. At present, the
Department has no garage facilities and all works, even of the most routine
nature, are undertaken by private garages; costs are high and vehicles are
immobilized for long periods.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would finance the construction of a garage of 1,020 m2,
divided into 10 work-bays, and including spare part storage space, offices
and classroom facilities. The initial design, for which a detailed cost
estimate amounting to CFAF 38.6 million (US$158,000) has been prepared, is
presently being reviewed and it is likely that a somewhat smaller design,
possibly of about 770 m2, will be adopted; the construction cost would then
be about CFAF 30 million (US$122,000).
3.        The subproject would also finance the basic equipment required for
the garage, including welding machines, hydraulic presses, a crane, a compres-
sor and a mobile workshop. A detailed list of 45 items has been sent to
potential suppliers in order to obtain an indication of the order of magnitude
of financing required. Similarly, a list of small tools, comprising 90 items,
has been sent to potential suppliers. The subproject would also finance a
stock of basic spare parts for the existing fleet; again, a list comprising 85
items has been sent to potential suppliers.
4.        The financing required for basic equipment, small tools and spare
parts would be of the order of CFAF 80 million (US$326,000) whence the total
cost including garage construction would be about CFAF 110 million (US$450,000).



ANNEX 14
Page 2
The foreign exchange component, at 100% of equipment, tools and parts and 33%
of construction, would be about CFAF 90 million (US$370,000), or 82%. The
optimal size of the garage, equipment, small tools and spare parts' stock has
yet to be finalized and a multi-disciplinary team is presently at work on this
problem in N'Djamena.
Justification
5.        There are presently three large private garages in N'Djamena; entry
is not free and those who might enter are deterred for many reasons. The
existing garages are the only suppliers of vehicle repair facilities and
their unit costs are high. There are sound a priori grounds for supposing
that the DWANC, with 228 vehicles, could achieve significant reductions in
repair costs from operating its own garage/repair shop. It is not yet possible,
however, to make a detailed comparison of vehicle maintenance and repair costs
of the proposed garage and the existing private garages. In sum, this sub-
project is not yet fully prepared and its justification, although apparent, is
not yet documented; both these steps would be conditions of disbursement for
this subproject.

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
REHABILITATION OF AIRSTRIPS
General
1.        Through 1971, Government financed and ASECNA executed the maintenance
of airstrips. Since then, no maintenance work has been done even though, and
particularly in 1974, there has been much food-relief traffic in heavy cargo
planes. In the last few years, many requests for substantial improvements to
the main airstrips have been presented to foreign financiers; all were re-
jected. The airstrips have continued to deteriorate and some minor rehabili-
tation works are now urgent.
The Subproject
2.        The subproject would finance minor rehabilitation works, essentially
re-surfacing, at the airstrips of Abeche, Am-Timan, Ati, Faya, Mao and Mongo;
all are administrative capitals of prefectures. The subproject executing
agency would be ASECNA which would undertake the works at Faya, where it has
permanent staff and some equipment, but in all other cases would supervise the
works executed by the Public Works Department. The latter has staff and some
equipment in each of the other towns and would organize its interventions in
the airstrips as part of its normal force account work program.
Subproject Costs
3.        The total subproject cost net-of-taxes and including physical con-
tingencies is CFAF 20.3 million (US$83,000) detailed as follows (Table 1):

ANNEX 15
Page 2
Justification
4.        Chad is very sparsely populated, with an average density of 3/km  in
the main Sahelian Zone, land transport conditions are difficult, and distances
are large; the air distances from N'Djamena are: Abeche 640 km; Am Timan 600
km; Ati 360 km; Mao 240 km; Faya 800 km; and Mongo 400 km. Air transport is
the usual means of travel for officials and urgently-needed supplies. In the
aftermath of the 1973 drought, food relief was flown into each of the above
airstrips, by heavy cargo planes to Abeche, Faya and Mongo, and by DC3 to Am
Timan, Ati and Mao.  The lack of maintenance for six years has rendered
Abeche, Faya and Mongo unfit for heavy transports; moreover, at Ati and Mao,
movements of DC3s are now subject to restrictions during the rainy season.
Again in 1977, some of these airstrips are required for distribution of
emergency food relief. The subproject would restore the six airstrips to
their previous capacities for a period of 5-6 years during which the manage-
ment and supervision of development projects would be facilitated and the
capacity to air-lift emergency food and other supplies would be assured.

ANNEX 18

SAHELIAN ZONE PROJECT
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
1.        Because of the disparate nature of the 13 subprojects, five forms
will be designed as a framework of a reporting system, and of a scheduling
and management control system. Some of the executing agencies already pre-
pare routine reports which are fully adequate for subproject purposes and it
is not the intention to replace these. Indeed it would be intended that all
reports should be a by-product of normal management activities and not dupli-
cation of other procedures.
Framework Forms
2.        The five framework forms are:
Form 1    Disbursement Schedule - to report progress of actual
disbursements for each subproject against appraisal
estimates, adjusted for price increases, and to allow
for revised forecasts. A summary would also be
prepared for the project as a whole.
Form 2    Program Schedule - to assist planning and scheduling
of activities, with a limited capacity to quantify
performance. The general layout will be along the
lines of the implementation schedule shown at Annex
16. Notes on the reverse would indicate conventions
to be adopted when completing the form, so that each
subproject adopts the same usage.
Form 3    Performance Schedule - to enable reporting where
necessary of more detailed performance figures--with
time across the horizontal axis and items subdivided
into appraisal, latest forecast, and actual, on the
vertical axis.
Form 4    Key Tasks Schedule - an adjunct to the program
schedule to help control the timely performance
of key activities. This will be a simple form,
with columns to identify tasks, allocate responsi-
bilities for action with completion data, and to
report on the current status of the action. This
form is intended to serve as a periodical (at least
monthly) problem identification and review document,
with completed actions dropping off, and new actions
being added as necessary.



ANNEX 18
Pg  2
Form 5    Vehicle Operation Report - a form to assist manage-
ment to control the heavy expenses on this item. The
form will be completed monthly for each vehicle
operated, and will cover such items as:
Description of Vehicle and Accessories
Date Purchased and Cost
Kilometre readings
Analysis of running by type of road,
and by trip purpose
Fuel and Oil consumption
Tire record
Regular Service - work and cost
Breakdowns, repairs - work and cost
The basic source of this information
will be a vehicle log book similar to that
already used by Office de Mise en valeur
de Sategui-Deressia (Sategui Deressia
Irrigation Project - Credit 489-CD).
CWANC
3.        CWANC will receive copies of subproject reports as frequently as
it shall determine, but no less frequently than six-monthly, and will have
summaries prepared as necessary for the project as a whole; e.g., OFAA will
summarize the overall disbursement position. The six-monthly IDA supervision
missions will use the latest of the reports to CWANC.
Individual Subprojects
4.        The following paragraphs indicate special reporting requirements
of the individual subprojects.
Bottomland Development
5.        For physical improvement at each site, the various stages of planned
work--initial contact, topographical survey, etc.--should be scheduled, and
area of improved land noted. Cultivated bottomlands should be distinguished
from new bottomlands. Monitoring measures should be scheduled to enable a
report on yields of sorghum in each area to be prepared.
6.        The warehouse program schedule will report on the planned construc-
tion of each warehouse, and performance against plan, and the actual cost of
each warehouse.
7.        The input supplies (fertilizer and seed stocks) would be managed
on a revolving fund basis. Regular reports would be prepared reconciling
monetary value of stocks held as verified by physical check, amounts owed,
and the balance of the revolving fund.



ANNEX 18
Page 3
8.        The main output of the trials activity (seed testing, soil sampling,
and fertilizer trials) would be the special reports designed for such trials.
Village Warehouses
9.        The program schedule will report on the planned construction of
each warehouse, and performance against plan, and the actual cost of each
warehouse. A qualitative assessment should also be made of the extent of
beneficiary participation in the construction of each warehouse, and the
perceived reasons for the degree of cooperation achieved. No performance
schedule with detailed figures will be necessary.
Rural Development Center - Lake Fitri
10.       Reporting requirements will be dealt with when the subproject itself
is fully prepared.
Vegetable Production
11.       The program will cover warehouse construction, and other activities
as necessary, including specific monitoring activities designed to measure
yields of various vegetables in the 'concentrated' plot, the existing area,
and on land outside the subproject area. To the extent possible, estimates
would be made of output of each type of vegetable and prices, at least for
vegetables passing through the Department's marketing services.
12.       The supply of insecticide and fertilizer would be managed on an
imprest type basis, with a regular report reconciling the value of physical
stock count, and reconciling the amount against the imprest account.
Vaccination Campaign and Drugs
13.       The current Livestock Department annual report will suffice.  How-
ever, use of vehicle log books, and completion of the Vehicle Operations
Schedules should commence as soon as possible, as vehicle operating expenses
constitute a large proportion of the Department's total expenditure.
Vaccination Production Equipment
14.       There will be no special reporting requirements.
Open Well Repairs - Kanem
15.       A program schedule should be prepared, to which the standard
SERARHY well completion reports can be attached.
Tubewell Operation: Chari Baguirmi
16.       SERARHY's standard records and/or reports will be used to produce
a report similar to Annex 9, Table 1 which should be expanded to provide
details of repairs effected at each site and their cost.



ANNEX 18
Page 4
Groundwater levels and Water Points
17.       Forms 1,2,4, and 5 will be used.  Other reports will be established
as the main output of the project itself.
Forestry Management
18.       A special report should be made on seedlings planted, by variety,
in each nursery, together with a record of their growth and subsequent distri-
bution.
Prospection for Construction Well Supplies
19.       Forms 1,2,4, and 5 will be used.  Other records and reports will be
established as the main output of the subproject itself.
Garage Construction and Equipment
20.       To be defined when the subproject is fully prepared.
Rehabilitation of Airstrips
21.       Forms 1,2,4, and 5 to be used.
Audits
22.       Form 2 should show planned completion dates for final accounts of
each subproject separately, planned dates for Government Financial Controller's
