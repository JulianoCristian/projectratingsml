a high percentage of poverty,\n            amounting to 88 percent in rural areas. The\n            government's revenue and GDP has declined, with the\n            lowest government allocation for education and training in\n            Africa. Needless to say, education is inadequate, student\n            enrollment has stagnated, and standard performance is poor.\n            Within the objectives of the Basic Education Sub-Sector\n            Investment Program (BESSIP) Project, improvement in the\n            quality of basic education will be paramount, with an\n            emphasis towards student enrollment increase, in particular\n            for disadvantaged groups. A discretionary budget allocation\n            of at least 20 percent will be devoted to the Ministry of\n            Education (MOE), to include school construction and\n            bursaries schemes for poor children. Teacher training will\n            be supported, particularly for those teachers serving rural\n            schools. The monitoring capacity of MOE will be\n            strengthened, to develop quantitative frameworks for policy\n            analysis. In addition, the establishment and operation of\n            the District Education Boards, will support education\n            policies in 60 percent of districts nationwide. Finally, a\n            Joint Steering Committee will be established to monitor the\n            overall achievement of the project."}, "docdt": "1999-03-05T00:00:00Z"}
