Subsector Investment Program were as follows: outcomes were\n            moderately satisfactory, risk to development outcome was\n            moderate, Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Lessons\n            learned included: (a) Conducive policy environment is\n            critical in ensuring the success of a sector program. (b)\n            Extension of a project only for narrowly focused\n            component(s) may bear the cost of reduced strategic\n            relevance. (c) Development Policy Lending (DPL) may be a\n            better instrument to support sector policies when\n            expenditure items are not completely identified. (d)\n            Community-driven school construction and rehabilitation has\n            been proved advantageous when there is adequate management\n            arrangement and capacity. (e) Decentralized fund utilization\n            for service delivery can largely improve absorption\n            capacity. (f) Investment focusing on one sub-sector needs to\n            be complemented by policy reforms in other sub-sectors. (g)\n            Strengthening the technical capacity of the infrastructure\n            team within the Ministry of Education will be crucial for\n            the continued expansion of school places."}, "docdt": "2007-01-12T00:00:00Z"}
