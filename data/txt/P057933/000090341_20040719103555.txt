A. Project DevelopmentObjective

1. Projectdevelopmentobjective: (see Annex 1)
The Government's objective for the proposedTai Basin UrbanEnvironment Project (TBUEP) is to
improve the quality of life of the rapidly increasingurbanpopulation and enhance economic
competitiveness inWuxi and Suzhou, keymunicipalities inthe Tai Basinandthe Yangtze RiverDelta
economic region, by alleviating degradationo fwater resources andimprovingthe quality of the urban
environment.

To meetthis objective, the project is designedto increase the captureandtreatmentof wastewaterincore
cities andthe rapidly hdustrializing suburbandistricts through physical investments andinstitutionaland
financial reforms that will enhance the viability andsustainability of wastewater systems, particularly in
these rapidly developing districts. The project will support rehabilitation andwater quality improvement in
severalurbananddistrict canal andriver systems through physical investmentsandimproved water
management. Inaddition, the project will supportlakeshorerehabilitation aroundWuli Lake as a new
development andamenity area for Wuxi City. Finally, the project will seek to strengthenwater resource
protection inthe Tai Basinthrough improvedandintegratedplanning, water quality monitoringand
environmental management. The project designthereforereflects the core elements ofthe Bank'sUrban
Strategy-livability, good governance, competitivenessandbankability.

2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
For the wastewatercomponents, keyperformance indicators (summarizedinAnnex 1) will include specific
targets for: reducingthe proportionofuntreated wastewaterdischargesinWuxi and Suzhou'
Municipalities; cost-effective and autonomousoperation of wastewater treatment systemsandcapacity
utilization for wastewater treatment plants under the project; andcost recovery bywastewater enterprises
to ensure sustainability. Monitoring datawill also berecordedinperiodic progressreports on measures
underJiangsu's CleanerProduction (CP) Programto reducepollutingdischargesbyindustries discharging
into project financed wastewater systems. For the lakeshore, riverrehabilitation andwater quality
improvement components, key performance indicators will includetargets relatingto improvedwater
quality at key locations inthe rivernetwork, improvedlakeshoreconditions at Wuli Lake andfor enhanced
water circulationinthe canal network.

B. Strategic Context
1.Sector-relatedCountryAssistanceStrategy (CAS) goalsupportedbythe project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: Report No. 25141          Dateof latestCAS discussion: December 19,2002
The project will support severalkey CAS themes, including: improving water resourcesmanagement;
ensuringenvironmentally sustainableurbandevelopment; andexpandinglivelihood opportunities duringthe
rural-urban transition, including for surplus rural labor. The project will support the Bank's UrbanSector
Strategywhich emphasizes improvedlivabilityandeconomic competitiveness, as well as the Bank's Water
Sector Strategywhich promotes sustainable wastewater and water resourcesmanagement.

2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
TheLake Tai Bashforms an integralpart o f the YangtzeRiver Deltaeconomic region, which is China's
most important industrial base andone of the most heavily populated areas o f China. In2000, over half of
the Basin's residentslivedincities andperi-urban towns, andurbanization continues to increase. Driven
byhighlevels of foreign direct investment, total gross domestic product (GDP) inthe Basinhas been

growingat over 10percentperyear on averageandpresently stands at Renminbi (RMB) 1trillion-
approximately 11percent of the national total. In 1999, Suzhou(RMB 136billion) andWuxi (RMB 114
billion) together accounted for almostthree quartersof the GDP.

The Tai Basin is also one of China's most important water resources. Lake Tai and its dense network of
rivers and canals provide water supply for the majority ofthe Basin's 36.3 millionresidentsincludingthose
who live in the large andgrowingurbaneconomies of Wuxi and SuzhouinJiangsuProvince. Lake Tai is
also the source o fwell over halfofthe domestic water supply for ShanghaiMunicipality,
                                                                                             ,




Despite the region's dependence on the water resourceso fthe Basinfor water supply, the provisiono f
environmental infrastructure and services, including the collection andtreatment o fwastewater, has failed
to keep pacewith the rapidly growingeconomy of the region. Increasingflows o funtreateddomestic,
industrial and agriculturalwastewater intothe Basin's rivers andlakes have put the region's water
resources under severeenvironmental pressure. The consequences o fcontinued rapidgrowth and
urbanization have become increasingly apparent.

Government reports indicate that the water quality inover 85 percento fthe mainwater bodies inthe Basin
is Class N or worse (unsuitable for domestic supply) and deteriorating. The canals withinSuzhou and
Wuxicities are reportedly worse thanClassV, the lowest classification accordingto Chinesewater quality
standards. Water quality inthe upper HuangpuRiver, which is fedby Lake Tai and is the main source of
drinkingwater for the Shanghaimetropolis, hasbecomeincreasingly pollutedover the lastfive years andis
now only marginally acceptableas a drinkingwater source. Urbanenvironmental conditions as poor as
these have significant negative impact on citizens'health andthe livability andeconomic prospectsofurban
areas.

Recognition o fthe needfor urgentaction to protect the health andeconomic well-being o fcommunities
relyingonthis increasingly pollutedlake andrivernetwork ledthe State Council to establishthe Lake Tai
BasinWater ResourceProtection LeadingGroup in 1996 anda pollutioncontrol programwith the goal of
resolving the region's water pollutionproblems by2010.

The first stage of the programwas conductedunder the NinthFive-Year Plan (1996 -2000). The National
NinthFive-Year PlanandLong-TermProgramonWater PollutionPrevention andControlto theYear
2010 for the Taihu Lake Basinwas issuedby the State Council onJanuary 6,1998 andfocused almost
entirely on industrial and domestic pollutionpoint source control. Itlisted 54 domestic wastewater
treatmentplantsplanned to be builtinthe Tai Basinprior to the year 2000. Industrial PollutionControl
Action Planswere also developedand some progresswas made to bringkey polluting enterprises
(particularly incore city areas) into compliance with environmental regulations.

However, the success of the NinthFive-Yearplanwas limitedfor several reasons. First, vast numbersof
enterprises, particularly inthe heavily industrializingdistricts andcounties surrounding the core cities
within the Basin, were generally not brought intocompliance with the targets duringthe planperiod. In
addition, progresswas slow onthe collectionandtreatment o f domestic sewage; only 29 o fthe proposed54
domestic treatment plantswere completed or partially finished bythe end o f 2000. The Government
attributedthe lack of implementation success to the scarcity o flocal government fimds for investment inthe
wastewatersector, andto poor enforcement of environmental regulations at enterprises.

Followingthe NinthFive-YearPlan, which concluded in2000, the Government has continued to identify
improvement o fwater quality inthe lake andriver system o fthe Tai Basinas a nationalpriority and
municipalities are aimingto collect andtreat 50 percent o f wastewater in smaller cities and 70 percentin

larger cities by 2010. However, the Government's strategywas modifiedsomewhatinthe TenthFive-Year
Action Plan for Lake Tai PollutionControl (2001-2005). Whilst this plancontinues to emphasize
collection andtreatment ofpoint source pollution, it also seeks to enhance the results o f pollutioncontrol
activities by increasing circulation inthe Basin's rivers andlakes throughwater transfersfrom the Yangtze
River. Insummary,this planunderwhichthe current project is proposed, placespriority on: (a)
improving wastewater management, particularlycollection andtreatmento f domestic sewage; (b)
improving water quality byreducing Total Phosphorus(TP) dischargesinto heavily pollutedwater bodies
suchas MeiliangandWuli Lakes inWuxiMunicipality andbytransferring higherquality water from the
Yangtze Riverto increasecirculation andimprove water quality inthe lake andcanal system; and(c)
strengthening local capacity for water environment monitoring andmanagement. The Tai BasinAuthority
(TBA)is planningandconstructing infrastructure to facilitate these transfers, including gatesandpumping
systems. Pilot transfer activities havebeenundertakenbyTBA duringthe last few years to determine the
viability o fthe key transfer schemes, such as that through the WangYu River.

Inresponseto the NinthandTenthFive-Year Plans, inZhejiangProvince, wastewater captureand
treatment capacity has beensubstantially increasedandadditional facilities andnetworks are under
construction and planned (e.g. inJiaxin City, which lies on a major tributary of Shanghai's Huangpu
River). JiangsuandZhejiang Provinceshavealso introducedbanson the productionandsale of
phosphorous-baseddetergentsinthe Basin, which were estimatedto contribute upto 15 percent of TP in
the lakesandrivers andJiangsuis enhancingits water qualitymonitoring capability. Shanghai
Municipality andits districts continue to make substantialinvestmentsinwastewaternetworks and
facilities, manywithBanksupport, and Shanghaihas shown leadershipinradically restructuring the
institutional framework to improve planning, financing anddelivery ofwater andwastewater services.

Whilst considerable strategy work for environmental improvement inthe Basinlyingwithin Jiangsu
Province has already beencompletedby TBA andprovincial agencies, less progress has beenachievedin
translating these strategies intowell coordinated, operational plans for the mainimplementers within the
Basin's municipal anddistrict governments.

InWuxiandSuzhoufor example, selectedkeypollutingindustrialenterprises arebeingmoreclosely
monitored usingautomatic equipment, thoughthis remains a relatively small proportiono ftotal existing
industries. For some industrial sectors (e.g. dyeing), discharge standards are being tightened to reduce the
overall pollution contribution of large enterprisesinthat sector. However, many importantpollution
Sources such as non-point sourcepollution from agriculture, animal husbandry facilities and the vast
numbersofsmall-scaleindustries,haveyetto beeffectively addressedbythe national or local
environmental regulatory authorities.

Inthe domestic wastewatersectorinChina, responsibilityfor urbanwater andwastewaterservicesis
generally divided betweenmunicipal governmentswithjurisdiction over core city areas, anddistrict
governments,responsiblefor towns. Manydistrict govemments inthe Tai Basin area have recently been
upgradedfrom county level governmentsto expandtheir role inproviding urbanpublic infrastructure and
utilityservicesinurbanizingtowns andindustrial development zones. Respondingto nationalpriority
plans andprovincial strategies, locally-funded programs are underway at the municipal level, albeit slowly,
andwith limited coordination, to rehabilitate andexpand wastewatersystems inthe core city areas o f
Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou. The rapidlydeveloping districts surrounding these cities are also now
scrambling to collect andtreat increasing wastewater flows, particularly inareas where industries continue
to concentrate.

Tai Basinh@beenthe fragmented approachto localplanning andmanagementof environmental
intiastructure inthe Basin. A lack ofeffective inter-jurisdictional coordination inservice planningand
delivery, as well as relatively weak regulatory oversight andenvironmentalmonitoring/enforcement
capacity, has limitedthe effectiveness of implementation. For example, inthe wastewatersector, district
governmentsinthe Basinare actively developing independentwastewaterfacilities under new wastewater
agencies, rather thanconsolidating new service areasunderexisting, more experiencedmunicipal
wastewater companies. Sewernetworks, where they exist, are ofteninadequateto fully capture
wastewater flows even for the relatively smalldistrict treatmentplants inplace. Inthe areao fwater
transfers, planninghas beenhamperedby a lack o flocal consensus on the location o f gates and other
infrastructure.

n e Government recognizesthe needto buildthe capacity o f agenciesresponsible.for wastewater
management by strengtheningthe planning,management and financing capabilities of these agencies to
improve the efficiency andsustainability of the substantialinvestment required. Inparticular, gov-ent
policies aimto strengthenthe market orientationo fwastewater service by promotingestablishmentof
autonomousandfinancially viable wastewater enterprisesandlimitedprivate sector participation, including
through partnerships withprivate sector operators.

Consistentwiththese objectives for overall environmental sector reform, some municipalities inthe Basin
are reforming organizational structuresto consolidatethe water resources(including transfers and other
hydraulic controlmeasures), water supply andwastewater sectors undera single Water Affairs Bureau,
These reforms generally transfer ownership of wastewater networks andfacilities to an assetmanagement
company andpromote outsourcing o foperations andmaintenancefor these systems to experienced
operators. While these arepositive developments, whichbringthe promise of better coordination ofthe
water andwastewater sectors inthe future, they generally do not yet extend to district governments.
Moreover, without reformo f funding arrangements, wastewatercompanies, particularly at the district level,
will be unable to operateinthe market oriented andfinancially sustainablemanner sought bygovernment
policies.

Indeed, achieving financial viability andsustainability has been a considerablechallenge for the small
district wastewater systems inthe Tai Basinbecause, first the lack o f economies ofscale andthe relatively
highproportionofindustrial wastewater, result inrelativelyhighunitinvestment andoperating costs,
Second, district governments do not have sufficient authority to establishtariff levels or levy separate
wastewater fees reflecting their higher cost base. Third, district wastewater companies lack any legal claim
over wastewater fees leviedbymunicipal governments on consumers inthe districts andthere is presently
no agreedmechanism inplace to returnmunicipal wastewater fee revenues to district wastewater
companiesto meetdebt serviceobligations andoperating expenses.

3. Sector issuesto be addressed bythe project and strategic choices:
The project will meet a strategic needfor expandedandmore sustainablecoverageo f environmental
planningandprotection systems inone of China's mostrapidly industrializingandurbanizingareas where
bothphysical andinstitutional infrastructure for wastewater managementi s inadequate. A start will be
made underthe project on four key sector issues: (a) the lack o f environmental infrastructure existingin
key areas inthe Tai Basin, (b) the poor water quality inthe urbananddistrict canals andriver system; (c)
the lack of financial andinstitutionalsustainability of existing wastewater service delivery arrangementsin
the Basin; and (d) the weak anduncoordinated planningand environmental management inmajor urban
centers. The project's contributionto these sector issues is as follows.




                                                     - 5 -

First, the project will supportphysical investmentsto reducethe presenthighlevel ofuntreateddischarges
of domestic andindustrialwastewater flows. Second, the project willhelp protectwater quality inWuli
Lake (one o f Lake Tai's most heavily pollutedperimeter lakes locatedinWuxi Municipality) from heavy
inflows of pollutedwastewater andflooding, andwill supportrehabilitation of canals inthe centralcity o f
Suzhou. Third, the project will supportinstitutional andfinancial reforms that will provide amore viable,
market-oriented basis for managing andoperatingwastewater systems particularly at the district level.
Fourth, bothWuxi and Suzhouare undertakingwastewater masterplanning exercisesinvolvingthe rapidly
growing districts as well as core cities,

Three strategic choices have beenmadeduringthe design of this project. First, emphasishas beenplaced
onworking not only withmunicipal governments, but also with governmentsinthe districts, where a
significant portion o fthe total urbanpopulation ofthe Basinlives, andwhere most new industrial
development andurbanization istakingplace. Existingexperience indistrict andtown sewerage systems is
mixed. Typically, the staff o f agencies that becomeresponsiblefor these systemsrequire extensive and
lengthycapacity building. Moreover, as notedabove, unitoperating costscanberelatively highfor small
wastewater systems especially as inmany cases, investmentsare often almost entirely debt financed. The
needfor efficient models for the management ofdistrict level wastewatersystems inrapidly urbanizing
districts is widespread inChina andis recognizedas a priority inthe Government's strategy for sanitation
sector development.

Second, a strategic choice hasbeenmadeto supportthe Government's strategy ofcomplementingpollution
control with water transfersinorder to improve water quality inthe Basin's river andcanal network as
articulated inthe Tenth Five-Year Plan. In200112002, the Tai Basin Authority conducted severalpilot
water transfers from the Yangtze River through the WangYuRiver to Lake Tai. These pilots showedthat
water transfers canhave a major impact on improving the water quality inLake Tai andcan speedup
circulationinthe lake andriver network Analysis o fthis pilotprogram indicates that all neighboring areas
including Suzhou, Wuxi and Shanghaibenefit from these transfers. However, to realize the benefits o f
these transfers, severalstructural andnon-structural measuresare requiredto reducepollutionentering the
system, This project will support the Government's pollutionControYtransfer strategy throughphysical
investmentsinpollution control andhydraulic works inWuxi and Suzhou. Inaddition, the locally-financed
wastewater masterplanning inWuxi and Suzhou Municipalities shouldenhance stakeholderinvolvement
andclarify sectorobjectives andinterventions for improvedwater quality management.

Third, inrecognition of the rapidandcontinuing development inthe Tai Basin, astrategic choicehasbeen
madeto support investmentsthat tackle existing industrial wastewater, as well as domestic discharges, and
provide for future growth. The marketfor private sector fitlancing is not considered to be sufficiently
mature at this time to fully provide these services, andtherefore local govemment andBank intervention is
warranted. The JiangsuProvincial Government andthe municipal anddistrict government counterpartsin
this project are currently working towards developing prudent ways to encourageprivate participation in
this sector. The project will support these efforts to reformthe wastewater sector inthis heavily
industrializedarea of JiangsuProvince by providing assistance inthe development o f strategiesfor private
sector involvement, andinproviding opportunities to pilot certain strategiessuch as combination of areas
under single wastewatersystems andoutsourcing for operation andmaintenance.

2. Keypolicyandinstitutionalreformssupportedbythe project.
As partofoverall institutional reforms Within municipalgovernmentsinthe Lake TaiBasin, anew
institutional model for public utilities is emerging. The objectives ofthis model are to: (a) consolidate
strategicplanningandoversight of water-related functions; and(b) separate asset ownership fromthe
operation o f assets as ameans to openupnew iinancing opportunities for utilityservices andto improve
the efficiency o futilitymanagement.

Basedonthis model, SuzhouMunicipality has consolidated its water andwastewater functions under a
Water Affairs Bureau. Inaddition, in2002 it establishedthe SuzhouWater Investment and Development
Company Limited(SWIDC) for the purposeso fholding all sector assetsthrough subsidiary companies.
fie Suzhou QingyuanConstruction Company (SQCC) is one such subsidiary and is responsible for
wastewater sector assets incentral SuzhouCity area including those developed under the project. By2006,
the Drainage Facilities Management Division(DFMI))will be corporatized also as a subsidiaryunder
SWIDC to manageandoversee operation andmaintenanceofall wastewater systems inSuzhou's central
districts. Similarly, Wuxi Municipality has recently establisheda Public UtilitiesManagement Group and
anasset managementcompanyto overseeandsupervise operating companiesfor water supply, wastewater
andtown gas inits central urban districts.

However, as indicated above, these institutional reform initiatives at the municipal level havenot yet been
extendedto the rapidly urbanizingdistricts outside the central city areas. Inthese districts, plans for new
wastewatersystems have typically involved establishmento fseparate wastewater systems andinstitutions
for eachtownship, therebyincreasing institutionalfragmentation andmakingcoordinated planningmore
difficult, as well as increasingthe cost of deliveringwastewater service. The projecttherefore seeksto
beginconsolidationof managementarrangementsfor wastewatersystems at the district level. Byalso
outsourcingoperationsandmaintenance, the project will overcome the lack ofin-house experiencefor
managingwastewater systems inthese districts.




                                                       - 8 -

Moreover, these institutional reforms will not be fully effective without supportingreforms to the funding
arrangementsfor wastewater operations. Althoughexisting wastewater fees appliedinSuzhouandWuxi
are amongst the highest inChina, they are applied underthe legalauthority of the municipal governments,
not the wastewater companies. As such, the fees are remisedto the finance bureauo f eachmunicipal
government, or to the district governmentinthe case of Wuzhong, with sector fundingthen beingprovided
throughbudgetary allocations. A substantialshare of the proceedsis generallyretainedby municipalities
for other purposes and the allocationto the wastewateragencies is often insufficient for adequate
maintenance of the assets inoperation. Of even greater concern, inHuishanandXishan Districts inWuxi,
no systematic arrangementsare inplace for the returno fwastewaterrevenuesto enable the districts to
finance operation of existingsystems andto undertakemuchneededexpansions. These existingfunding
arrangementsare basedontraditional institutional structures, inwhich governmentbureaus directly
providedall wastewater services. However, with asset ownership andmanagementfunctions now being
separatedthroughthe corporathation model, these new companiesneedtheir own sources of operating
revenue.

The project would therefore seek to assist SuzhouandWuxi to make the municipal anddistrict institutional
reforms fully operational. As a first step, the project will assist inimplementing, at boththe municipal and
district levels, the recently approvedstate guidelinesby corporatizing wastewaterutilities to enhance
prospectso f tapping private sources of capital for future investments, possibly throughpublic/private
partnerships, To further improve the cost effectivenesso fwastewater operations, proposedinvestmentsin
severaltownships inXishanDistrict inWuxiMunicipalityhave been combined into substantially more
economical engineering confrgurations. For example, Xishan District is mergingall wastewater systems
withinthe district startingwiththe existing wastewatersystemat Dongtingwiththe proposednew system
to Serve townships at M e n , Houqiao andYangjian, as well as the WuxiEastIndustrialEstate. In
addition, the SQCC that presentlymanageswastewateroperations inSuzhouCity is to be contractedto
manageimplementation of the wastewater systeminadjacentWuzhong District.

Fundingarrangementsfor wastewaterserviceproviders are alsoto bereformedunder the project. The
legalbasis for wastewater revenuesis to be changedfrom a municipal wastewater fee to awastewater
utilitytariffthat is legally due to theresponsiblewastewatercompanies. This will allow revenuesto be
transferred directly to wastewater companiesbythe water supply companies that presently act as collection
agent for wastewaterfees. To implement this reform, Wuxi andSuzhouMunicipalities will formulate an
actionplanearly duringproject implementation for transferring all wastewaterrevenuesback to the
districts to finance wastewater operationsandfor counterpart funding o f investments underthe project,

Ap-reement was reached at nepotiations on the timetable for these initiatives.

3. Benefitsand target population:
Consistentwith the Bank's UrbanStrategy, the project is designed to enhancethe livability, govemanceo f
core public services, competitiveness andbankability o ftwo majorurbancenters that are facing continued
rapid growth.

The project would directly benefit aboutfive millionpeople presently living and working inWuxi and
SuzhouMunicipalities, as well as substantialdownstream communities, including Shan-.            These
benefitswould includereducedhealthrisks andimprovedproductivityandlivelihood prospects, including
for rural-urban migrants.

Expansion of wastewater service inrapidly industrializingdistricts under the project willhelpestablish a



                                                     - 9 -

viable model for managing smallwastewatersystems andwill reducepollution o fthe region's critical water
resourcesandsupply, andthereby helpensure the environmentalsustainability of continued economic
growth andthe Government's policy for urbantransition.

The canal rehabilitationprogram inSuzhouwillhelp reduceflooding andfurther enhance the quality of life
for residents andthe tourism potential of this historic city. Similarly, the locally-financed Wuli Lake
rehabilitationprogramwill help reducethe frequencyandseverity of flooding inWuxi City and, at the
same time, open up anew area for developmentinWuxi City with substantialamenity value for
commercial, residential andrecreationaluses.

Finally, wastewater masterplanninginWuxiandSuzhouMunicipalities would contribute to the goals
soughtbythe ongoingmunicipal reforms inthe water/wastewater sector, including consolidation o f
strategic planningandoversight of water-relatedfunctions to achievemore cost effective options for the
very substantial future investmentthat will be required inthe wastewater sector inthe Basin,

4. Institutionaland implementation arrangements:
The Tai BasinUrban Environment Project Office (TBUEPO), whichhas beenestablishedwithinthe
JiangsuProvincial FinanceBureau, hastakenthe leadincoordinating the work ofthe intemational
consultant team for review of project proposalsandwill beresponsible for overall coordination o f project
implementation. TBUEPO willexercisethis coordination functionproactively to avoidthe difficulties
experiencedbyJiangsuProvincial Environment Bureau duringimplementation of the recently completed
Southem JiangsuEnvironment Protection Project. A timetable for recruiting experienced staffin
procurement andproject financial management, environmental, andresettlementaspectshas beenagreed.
TBUEPO will report to the provincial Project LeadingGroup (PLG) which consists o f heads ofrelevant
provincialcommissions andbureaus.

SuzhouandWuxi Municipalities have eachestablisheda PLG anda PMO alsounder the respective
Municipal Finance Bureau, andProject Implementation Units(PIUs) for individual components,

InWuxiMunicipality, thelocally-financed WuliLakeRehabilitationcomponentwillbeimplementedby
the Wuxi Water ConservancyBureau, which gained satisfactory experienceimplementinga component of
the Tai BasinFloodControl Project, andhas already implemented dredging works, relocationof fishponds
and water transfer works inthe lake.

The HuishanWater Treatment Company Limited (HWTC) establishedinMarch2003, will beresponsible
for implementing the Huishanwastewater component and, followingconstruction, will outsource operations
andmaintenancefunctions to anexperiencedoperator. Similar arrangementsare proposedfor the
DongtingandM e nwastewater systems, which are being mergedunder the new Xishan Wastewater
Treatment Company Limited (XWTC).

~n Suzhou, the SQCC will be directly responsible for implementation o fthe canalrehabilitationcomponent
includingthe control gates onthe ShangtangandXujiangRivers, andthe dredging programas well as for
the implementation of the expansionto the FuxinandLoujiangwastewatertreatment plants. The
(corporatized) DFMDwill be responsible for operations and maintenance ofthe wastewater treatment
plantsfollowing construction. The Wuzhong Asset Management andAdministration Company Limited
(WAMC), set upunderthe Wuzhong Economic andTechnical Development Zone Company (WETDZ),
willberesponsiblefor implementingandmanagingtheproposedwastewatersystemintheWuzhong
industrial zone area. However, WETDZ is arrangingto contract SQCC to manage implementationand

will outsourcenetworks andfacilities to an experiencedoperator, following construction.

Confirmation was obtainedat nepotiations on these arrangements and that the DFMD will be
comoratized bv December 31.2006. as a subsidiary under SWDC to manage and oversee operation and
maintenance of all wastewatersvstems in Suzhou'scentral urban districts.

 Confirmation was also obtained at negotiations on satisfactory arranaementsfor imtdementation
suaDort for wastewater treatmentcomoanies.

D. ProjectRationale
1. Project alternatives consideredandreasonsfor rejection:
The originalproject designfocused on improvingwater quality inLake Tai. However, this narrow focus
onthe lake didnot adequatelyrecognizethe impact ofthe highly pollutedcanal andrivernetwork
throughout the Basin on the quality of life andeconomicprospectso fthe residentso f the area. Ifeconomic
growth inthe regioni s to be sustained, andquality of life improved for all residents, improvedwastewater
planningandmanagementincludingadditional investmentandincreasedinstitutionalcapacity inthe
wastewater sector is urgentlyneededinthe rapidly urbanizingandindustrializingdistricts surrounding the
major cities, including inareas that do not drain directly intoLake Tai. Therefore, the project design has
beenadjustedto focus on improvingthe localenvironment inthe core urbancenters andthe rapidly
urbanizingdistricts inthe large conurbations ofWuxi andSuzhou.

This project focus reflects much o fthe work alreadybeingledbythe Government, andthe local authorities
intheTaiBasin. As indicatedabove, programstoimproveurbanenvironmentalconditions, including
wastewater management inparticular, are underway inmanyparts o f the Basin, including inShanghai
Municipality, ZhejiangProvince andinChangzhou,WwCi andSuzhouMunicipalities withinJiangsu
Province. The Bankproject will complement andbuildon these existing efforts.

Moreover, the original project design hinged onimplementation o fcontrol structures onthe westernbankof
the WangYu Riverto protect water transfers from pollution inthe river catchment. Inthe absence o f
expandedinfrastructure and environmental monitoring to addresspollutioninthe river catchmentat source,
local governmentshave become concernedover possiblenegative environmental impacts ofthe control
structureson nearbycommunities. The investmentsunder the project, particularlyinXishan District, seek
to address this issue by reducing untreatedwastewaterdischargesthat presently flow into the WangYu
River andwill thereby also have a positive impact onLake Tai water quality.

3. Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign:
Chinahas the largestportfolio inthe Bankandits quality is amongst the best performing. A recent OED
assessment, China: Review of theBank's assistanceto the Urban Water Supply and WastewaterSector,
Report No, 24979 ratedthe outcome of Bank's assistance as having beenmoderately satisfactory, its
sustainability as likely, butits institutional impact as modest.

ratedthe wastewater componentas highly satisfactoryhaving beenwell designedandimplementedbelow
appraisedcost andfully meeting the water quality objectivesas set out ineach city's long-term water
qualitymaster plan. However, theproject failedintwo ways, a) to achievefullcostrecovery for
wastewater investments; andb) to convert the wastewatercompaniesintofully autonomous entities in
accordancewiththe 1994 company law, thus perpetuatingtheir dependence on the municipalpublic utility
bureaus andfinance bureaus. Key lessons learned frompastprojects,which will have beenreflected in
project designinclude the needfor: (a) strong client ownership; (b) improved coordination at the provincial
level; (b) greater focus onutilityreform to implement the Government's policies towarddevelopmentof
autonomous, commercially oriented utilities, with tariffs adequate to ensure financial sustainability and
emure satisfactory operationandmaintenanceo f assets created; and (d) encouragingprivate sector
participation, where there is political support for it.

The project design hasalso beenshapedbyrecent experiencethat hashighlighted a tendency for local
investment plans that make inadequateprovisionfor collection networks resulting inunderutilization o fthe
treatment plantsthat are often over-designed. Investmentsinnetworks have beenincreasedto fully capture
wastewater flows to support existing, as well as proposednewwastewatertreatment plants, whichhave
beenreviewedandscaleddown, where appropriate, to reflect morerealistic wastewater flows. The turnkey
coneacts for wastewatertreatmentplants inSuzhoushould ensure that plants operate at peak efficiency
andlowest operating costwhenhandedover following commissioning andinitialoperation.

The institutionaldesign ofthe project for asset managementlooks to outsourcing operation and
maintenanceactivities to experiencedoperatorsratherthanrelying solely on strengtheningin-house
capacity, whichhas had mixedresults elsewhere. Reforms infunding arrangementsaddress major
impediments to sustainability andexpansiono fwastewater service indistricts.

4. Indicationsof borrower commitment and ownership:
Project componentsare basedon the priorities outlined inthe cities' urbanandenvironmental masterplans
andthe extensiveongoingprograms oflocally funded wastewaterinvestments, includingfor rehabilitation
of city sewer networks inbothWuxi and Suzhou. The NationalDevelopment andReformCommission
(NDRC) identifiedthe project as a key priority for Bank support. Assurances were obtained at
negotiationsthat an action Dlan would be FAmished to theBank bv June 30, 2005 for imnlementation of
the locally-financed Wuxi Sewer Network Rehabilitation Promam.

Project implementationarrangementsare beingfinalized provincialandmunicipal project management
ofices are inplace, andchartersfor allexecuting wastewater companies have beenrevised to meet the
requirementsfor project implementation. Municipalities have retainedprocurement agents andhave set an
implementationschedule that calls for advance contracting andretroactive financing for some components.
Aspects o fthe HuishanandDongtingwastewater components inWuxi andthe Canal Rehabilitation
program inSuzhou, for which retroactive financinghas been requested,are already underway. Most
importantly, municipal governments have committed to reformfunding arrangementsto ensurefinancial
autonomy andviability o fwastewater investments, particularly inrapidly developing districts.

5. Value addedof Banksupport inthis project:
The value of Bankassistance interms o f effective investment outcomesis already known to the client, who
successfullyimplementedthe wastewater investmentsunder the Southem JiangsuEnvironmentalProtection
Project. To buildonthis satisfactory experience, Bankinvolvement during project preparation has
highlightedpractical opportunities to modernize managementarrangements for district wastewater utilities
and improve the cost effectiveness andfinancial sustainability o f wastewater systems andto help strengthen

institutionalarrangementsfor sector coordination. The project, therefore, seeks to address apriority inthe
Government's strategy for wastewater sector managementby helping to shape viable approaches for
smallerdistrictltownshipwastewater systemsthat generallyhaverelatively higherunitcostsandmore
difficulty inmobilizingexperiencedoperatingstaffto ensure efficient andeconomical operationand
maintenance o f networks andtreatmentfacilities.
Inparticular, morecosteffective andviableconfigurationsrequiringfewer separatewastewatertreatment
plants andinstitutionshavebeendevelopedfor district wastewatersystems. Inaddition, the proposed
expansiono f sewer networks, both for existing, as well as for proposednew treatment facilities under the
project, will minimize the risko funderutilization ofthese assets inthe project area, which is a growing
problem for many existing wastewater systems inChina. Use o ftumkey contractsincludingdetailed
design, construction, equipment supply/installation, commissioning andinitialoperation for wastewater
treatmentplantsin Suzhou, should ensure these plants operate at peakperformance andat lowest operating
cost when handed over to the responsiblewastewater company, thereby reducingwastewater feeltariff
increasesneeded. Outsourcing of implementation management andoperation andmaintenancefunctions to
experiencedoperators should enable the new wastewater companiesbeing establishedto avoidlengthy and
costly implementation delays due to inexperience, andto set clear performance accountabilities for the
efficient andreliable operation andmaintenanceof wastewater systems. Dialoguethrough project
preparationhas also encouragedmunicipalities to initiate reform o f funding arrangementsnoted above to
make the ongoing municipal institutional reforms fully effective.

Water quality modelingduringproject preparationhas helpedtarget project investments inwastewater
systems inthe areaof some o fthe most heavily polluted rivers. Expandedtesting o fwastewatertreatment
plantsludgefor hazardousmaterial, is asignificant enhancementofenvironmental safeguardsinlightof
the proportiono f industrialwastewater being treated. Inaddition, the locally-financedwastewater
masterplansinWuxi and Suzhouwill provide abasisto strengthencoordination betweenjurisdictions in
strategyandactionplanningfor improvedwater quality managementinthese rapidly developing areas.

The project will improve the quality o fthe urbanenvironment through improvedwastewater andwater
quality managementinthe key municipalities o f Wuxi and Suzhou andmore widely inthe Tai Basinwhich
will facilitate sustainableurbaneconomic growth andsocial development. The locally-financed Wuli Lake
rehabilitation programwill help reducethe frequency andseverity o f floodinginWuxi City andwill open
upa substantialnewareafor development with significant amenity value for commercial, residentialand
recreationaluse. Similarly, the canalrehabilitation programin SuzhouCity will reduce the fiequency and
severity o fflooding andwill further enhance the quality o f life for residents andthe tourismpotential ofthis
historic city. Expansion o fwastewater treatment capacity inSuzhou City will benefit most o fthe city's
population. Expansion of wastewater service inrapidly industrializing districts inWuxi andSuzhouwill
helpto reducepollutionof the region's critical water resources. Byexpanding sewer networks, the project
willhelputilizewastewatertreatment capacity, includingatexistingplantsthereby increasingthe
productivity ofwastewater investments. Itwill also helpreduce healthrisks andenhancelivelihood

sustainablebasis for wastewaterinvestments,particularly inthose small systems servingthe rapidly
developing outlying districts. The locally-financed wastewater masterplanningto be undertakenby Wuxi
andSuzhouMunicipalitieswould, for the fmt time, incorporaterapidly-growingperi-urbandistricts in
actionplans that addressthe growing pollution of water resourcesina strategic area inthe basin.

Economic Analyses. Manyo fthe project benefits, particularly those relating to environmental andpublic
healthimprovements, couldnot bereliably quantified. For this reason, the choice o fpriority wastewater
investments under the projecthas beenguidedby cost effectivenessanalysis. Basedon this approach,
alternative project designs were identifiedandevaluated inorder to determinethe least cost solutions.

InHuishan,the optionofchannellingwastewaterto anexisting wastewatertreatmentplantinthe Wuxi
City systemwas consideredwas rejecteddue to limitedexpansioncapacity. InXishan, separate
wastewatersystems were initially proposedfor eachof the seven townships and anindustrial development
area. However, a comparison of investmentandlong-runoperating costs indicatedthat one or two
wastewatertreatment plantscouldserve these areas more efficiently andeconomically, resultinginlower
operating andoverhead costs. Combining the Xishan systemsandthe Dongting systemwouldfurther
reducecosts. For the Wuzhong system, the optiono f conveying wastewater for treatment innearby Suzhou
City was considered, butrejectedinlightof the characteristicso f the mainly industrial areabeing served
andthe desire to integrate future wastewatersystems inthe district undera single wastewatercompany.
The sequential SBR was selectedas the most economical treatment processfor the relatively small
m p sproposedinthe three districts.

The overall, locally-financed WuliLake rehabilitation program includes dredgingandwater diversion, as
well as control gates, embankmentwork andpilot ecological restoration. Two options were consideredto
divertwaterto Wuli LakeandWuxiCity's canals from either Gong Lake,where the WangYuRiverenters
Lake Tai, or from Meiliang Lake, which is more polluted, but significantly less so than Wuli Lake. Water
quality modeling simulations indicated that divertingwater from GongLake could improvethe water
quality inWuli Laketo ahigher degreethanfromMeiliangLake. However, the other optionwas favored
byJiangsuProvince andthe TBA as away to also draw water infrom Lake Tai, thereby also improving
water guality inMeiliangLake. Moreover, Wuli Lake is intendedto serve only as a tourism water body
anddivertingwater from MeiliangLakecanmeetthis requirement.

2. Financial(see Annex 4 andAnnex 5):
NPV=US$ million; FRR= % (see Annex 4)

Financial projections over the 2004-2015 periodhave beenprepared for the four project wastewater
companies, SQCC, WAMC, HWTC, andXWTC for the merged Dongting andM e nwastewater
system. These projections are basedonthe requirement o f eachcompany to comply with the agreedupon
furancial covenantsregarding costrecovery, debt service coverage, as well as the needfor intemally
generatedcontributions towardproject counterpart funding. The kev financial covenant reauires that each
project comvanv generates annual overatino revenues that are sufficient to cover all oDeratinP emenses,
including -
         - devreciation. anv loss on non-onerating activities. vlus the amount. if anv. bv which debt
service exceeds devreciation. This ratio o f operating revenues to costs is expressedas the costrecovery
ratio, which, therefore, mustbe at least 1.O ineach year. In addition. a debt service coverageratio
covenant will also be avvlied under which the comvanies'abilitv to incur additional debt will be
conditional on them maintaining this ratio at not less than 1.3, Tosafeauard good Drosnects for
financial viabilitv. agreement was reached that the Bank will be advised and Piven an ovnortunitv to
comment on any additional borrowing bv wastewater companies.

The mainsource of revenue for project wastewatercompaniesis the existing municipal wastewater fees,
which at RMB 1.15/m3 inSuzhouand RMEl 1.10/m3 inWuxi, are amongstthe highest inChina. With
conversion o fthis fee to awastewaterutilitytariff, all revenues generatedfiom the tariffswill be directly
transferred to the project companies. This will give the companies their own source o f operating revenue
andprovides the basisonwhich they canestablishthemselves as financially viable andsustainable
enterprises consistent withtheir independentlegal status under g o v m e n t policy. However, the
companieswill alsoneedto carefully managetheir operations, as well as their capital investment programs,
so as to achievethe greatestpossible efficiency inthe use of these revenues. This is particularlyimportant
for the three small district wastewater companiesbecause opportunities to achieve low cost operations
through economies of scale are limited. This challengehas beenaddressedthrough a number ofmeasures
incorporated into the project designs. Project investments are basedon the leastcost solutions over the
opqating life o f eachwastewater component. Additionally, the operating scope of eachcompany has been
maximizedto the extentpresentlyachievableinorderto minimizemanagementandother overheadcosts.
Operating efficiencies will be further enhanced through the outsourcingo f operations andmaintenanceto
experiencedwastewater operators.

IfmoderatetariffincreasesareimplementedeverythreetofouryearsinSuzhou, tariffrevenuesshouldbe
sufficient to enable SQCC to filly recover the cost o f its operations, as well as to make contributions
toward capital investments, includinga portiono fproject counterpartfundingrequirements. The tariff
would needto be increasedby a modest 15 percent in2006, to RMB 1.32/m3, andthenby a further 18
percent to RMB 1.561m3 by 2009, whenthe project facilities are fully operational andprincipalrepayment

requiredto cover generalinflationary increasesinoperating costs. Overthe 2004-2007 period, the
on the Bank loanbegins. After 2009, the needfor further increases is anticipated to be limitedto that

company will generate an operating surplusthat shouldbe sufficient to fund almost 40 percent o fproject
counterpartfunding. The cost recovery ratio is projectedto exceedthe covenantminimumo f 1.O inall
years andaverage 1.3 over the 2005 -2015 period. The debt service coverageratio is also projectedto be
satisfactory, remainingwell above the 1.3 minimuminall years.

prior to the commencemento foperationsofthe project-funded facilities in2008, the wastewater company
inHuishanwouldnothaveanyoperatingassetswhilethe companiesinXishanandWuzhongwouldhave
only limitedassets inoperation. Therefore, a large share o f the revenue generatedfrom the wastewater
tariffs over this periodcan be allocated to counterpart fimding. InHuishan, tariffrevenues should be
sufficient to cover 45 percentofcounterpart fundingrequirements. InXishan, the company will be
operatingthe existing Dongting WWTP, but this will require only about 50 percent o frevenue over the
2004 -2008 period, with the remaining50percent allocatedto cover almost 20 percent o f counterpart
fundingrequirements. Wuzhong isprojectedto be able to generatejustunder40 percent ofrequired
counterpartfunds from the tariff. Revenuegeneration inWuzhong is basedon projectedincreasesin
Suzhou's municipaltariff, referred to above. For HuishanandXishan, the projections are basedon
anticipated increasesinthe municipaltariffapplied throughout Wuxi. Tariff increaseso f 15 percent in
2006 and20 percentin2009 are envisaged.

Withthe newwastewatersystems beginning operation in2008 2009,revenueswould thenbeused
                                                                 -
primarily to coverthe operatingcostsanddebt service obligations o fthe four project companies. Given
that wastewater tariffsinbothSuzhou andWuxi are set ona municipality-wide basis, andtherefore largely
reflect lower unit cost structures inthe central urbanareas, the projections indicate that these tariffs will be
insufficient to fullyrecover the costs o fthe district companies beginningin2008. Inorder to cover this
anticipated shortfall, eachdistrict company will apply a surcharge on industrialwaste generators. The
existingmunicipal fee is set at the same levelfor all customers, but since the cost o ftreating industrial


                                                       -16-

wastewater is generally higherthanthat for other groups, the surchargewill reallocate charges so that they
better reflectthe actual cost of providing wastewater services to the different customer groups. In2008,
the projected requirement for the surchargeis RMB 0.501m3 inHuishan,RMB0.80/m3 inXishan, and
RMB0.65/m3 inWuzhong. Onthis basis, allthree companiesshouldcomplywiththe costrecoveryratio
ineachyear over theforecast period. InHuishan, thecostrecoveryratioisprojectedto average 1.3 over
the first eight years of system operations, 2008 - 2015. InXishan, where the project facilities are expected
to enter operation in2009, the costrecovery ratio over the 2009-2015 averages 1.2. For Wuzhong, the
average cost recoveryratio is 1.2 over the 2008 -2015 period. The debt service coverageratio is projected
to alsomeet the covenant requirement inmostyears, butinthe case ofHuishanandXishan, may fall
slightly below 1.3 inone or two yearsjust after the project facilities enter operation. However, the
companiesshould have sufficient cashreservesfrom previous years that will ensure that they canmeettheir
debtservice obligations.

FiscalImpact:
An analysis ofthe availabilityof counterpartfunds was undertakenbyreviewingrevenuesandexpenditures
intheproject cities anddistricts. Althoughrevenuesfromthe wastewatertariffwillbeusedtomeeta
portiono f counterpart funding for the projectwastewater components, contributions are also requiredfrom
the capital budgets of the municipal anddistrict governments. Forthe non-wastewater components, all
counterpart funding is providedfrom the capital budgetso fthe municipal governments inSuzhouand
Wuxi. Basedonconservativeassumptionsregardingfuture revenuegrowth, the analysis indicatesthat the
project components are consideredto be affordable to the municipal anddistrict governments.
Requirementsfor project counterparth d s from the two municipal governments andthree districts as a
proportionof total revenuesvary between0.2 percenton average inSuzhou (0.5 percent inthe peakyear),
0.2 percent inWwi (0.5 percentinthe peakyear), 0.4 percent inWuzhong (0.8 percent inthe peakyear),
0.5 percentinHuishan(1.1 percent inthe peak year), and 1.9 percent inXishan (3.7 percent inthe peak
year), Whenconsidering only revenuesthat canbe allocatedto the infrastructure investment, which is an
approximation o f financial capacity to contribute to the project, counterpart contributions as a proportion
of the capital budget varies between 0.6 percenton average in Suzhou (1.5 percent inthe peakyear), 0.4
percentinWuxi (1.2 percent inthe peak year), 1S percent inWuzhong (2.9 percent inthe peakyear), and
1.9 percentinHuishan(3.8 percent inthe peak year), and5.5 percent inXishan (11.3 percent inthe peak
Year).

3. Technical:

The choice o fthe treatment process for the proposedwastewatertreatment plants hastaken into account
the highproportionof incoming industrialwastewater (50 to 70 percent o f total flow) andthe potential
fluctuations inthis influent quality. For district wastewatertreatment plants, the borrowers' selectionof
SBR is the most appropriate andcost-effective choice. Inthe case o fthe largerSuzhouWWTPs,
additional samplingdatawill determine the most appropriate system, andthe borrower has agreed to
proceedthrough a tumkey bid. Underthis type o f contract, bidders would be askedto make technical
proposals through a two-stage approach, Le. by includingthe design as part o f their services.




                                                    - 17-

 While treatment facilities havebeendesignedto accommodatesome fluctuations inthe quality andquantity
 o finfluent, this uncertainty is to beminimizedthrough capacity buildingandinstitutional strengthening.
National law requires industrial enterprises treat their effluent to a preliminarylevel suchthat the effluent
 quality meets prescribed standards (equivalentto domestic strength wastewater) for releaseintothe public
 sewers. Under the project, wastewaterutilities will take responsibility for protecting their own assets by
 directly monitoringthe incoming effluent at its entryto the sewer network, andbypolicing the acceptability
 o fusers' discharges. The charters of the wastewatercompanies inthis project include provisions that allow
 them to seek interventionandultimately to refuseindustrial sewage from non-conforming industries.
Agreement was reachedat negotiationson measuresto be taken to ensure effectivemonitoringand
 enforcement arrangementsand to record activitiesin ueriodicproiect promess reuorts.

departmentswith adequate staff to be responsiblefor procurement. Also, additional training programs will
beprovidedbyTBUEPO to ensure that allresponsible staff are fully conversantwith the Bank'sguidelines
andprocedures. Except for thetwo turnkey contractsfor wastewatertreatmentplants inSuzhou, all
contractswill be procuredundernational competitive bidding (NCB) proceduresbecauseof the nature and
relatively small size of these contracts; very few are likelyto be over $7 million. Retroactive financing

5. Environmental:                          Environmental Category: A (FullAssessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertakenfor environmentalassessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation anddisclosure) andthe significant issues andtheir treatment emerging from this analysis.
HohaiUniversity carried out the consolidatedEnvironmentalAssessment (EA) of the proposedTBUEP in
accordancewith China'snational policies andBankprocedures, withsupport from an independent
international consulting environmental specialist. The terms ofreferencesandvarious draftversionswere
reviewed anddiscussedindetail duringproject preparation. The draft Englishversion o fEA documents
were submitted to the Bankinlate September 2003 andreviewed bythe Bankduringthe appraisalmission
andrevisedaccordingly. The finalEAreport, EA Summary andEnvironmentalManagementPlan(Em)
were submittedto the Bank inDecember2003 andfollowing additional clarification andanalysis in
February2004, were found to be satisfactory. The FinalEAdocumentation, as supplemented, was sentto
the Bank'sInfoshop inWashington andinBeijinginMarch2004. Duringthe EA preparation, localpeople
were consultedat leasttwice, andtheir opinions havebeenreflected inthe project design andenvironmental
mitigationmeasures, as appropriate.

Project investmentswill have positive environmental impacts intenns of improving water quality inthe Tai
Basin. Domestic andindustrial wastewaterswill be collected andtreated at six WWTPs to remove
pollutants. For year 2010, the expectedreduction o fpollutant discharges to surface waters from the six
WWTPs are 122tonnes/day (tpd) ofchemical oxygen demand(COD)Cr, 62 tpdo f biological oxygen
demand(BOD)S/day, 6 tpdof NH3-N,80tpdofsuspendedsolids (SS), and0.6 tpdofTP. These
reductions will improve the quality o f the receiving surfacewaters inSuzhouandWuxi anddownstream
areas. The canal network rehabilitation investmentsinSuzhouunder this project -including dredging and
construction o fsluice gates andshiplocks will improve the water quality andreduce the riskof flooding in
                                            -
this city. The locally-financed Wuli Lakerestoration activities, also under this project, will improve the
water quality andaquatic life inthe Lake, andcreate a public greenbelt for tourism andrecreation.

Minor adverse impacts duringconstruction andoperation o fparticular investments are expected, butwill
bemitigated. The adverseimpacts will bemostly inthe form o fnoise, odor (stink gas), particulate matter
(PM)emissions, sedimentandsludgedischarges, andtraffic congestion. Noise emissionsfromWWTP
havebeenassessedat the boundary line ofWWTPs, and found to be inexcess o f standardsonly inthe case
of the FuxinWWTP (both day andnighttimes), HuishanWWTP (only at nighttime), and Loujiang
W P s (only at nighttime). However, adverse impacts onreceptors -which are 200 mto 500maway
from these WWTPs -are not expected. Regardingtransportation o f sedimentsdredged fiom the Suzhou
Canalsto the disposal site, alternatives were evaluatedconsidering such factors as noise andtraffic
impacts. Mitigatory measures for noise emissionswill include no construction at night, use o fequipment
withlownoise, useofvehicles with noise control, andsettingupofconstruction barriers. Inaddition,
cargo shipswill not be allowed at any time andpleasureboatswill not be allowed at nightsinthe

ShangtangandXujiangnetworks inSuzhou; shipnoisewill be limitedto 55 &A, silencers will be installed
on ships for noise suppression, siren duration andfrequencieswill beminimized; anduse o f sirens will not
bepermittedinresidential areas.

Odor emissions fiom the sedimentationand SBR tanks o fWWTPs will beminimizedbyproper operation
through adjustment of the air flow rateo fthe blower to bringwastewater to aerobic state, andthrough
timelysludge dewatering, handlingofsludge cakes indewateringrooms, use ofsealedtrucks for
transporting the sludge to the disposalsite, sprinklingtemporary sludge storage areas withbleach, and
plantingtrees aroundthe aerationtanksandWWTP. To mitigate PMemissions, vehicles will be covered,
their speedwill be limitedto 40 km/h, andtheir wheels will be cleanedofmud.

Sediments from Suzhou Canalshavebeentestedfor hazardousmaterials and, inalmost all cases, found to
be withinstandardsprescribedbyapplicable Chineseregulations, withmost indicators low or undetectable.
Inaccordancewith theregulations, these willbedisposedat asite at Sanjiaozuithat iszonedas greenarea
inSuzhou'smasterplan.Furthertestingforhazardousmaterials istobeundertakenofsedimentsinthe
Xiaomiduqiao River sectionprior to dredging to determine ifother disposalarrangementsare needed, for
example at purpose builtcells at the municipal landfill. Sludge from WWTPs will be testedfor hazardous
characteristics under applicable Chineser e g u l a t i o n s / s t . Any sludgefound to behazardouswillbe
disposedat a hazardouswastelandiill. Ifthe sludge is foundto benon-hazardous,itwill be disposedat a
separate cell that is designedandoperatedincompliance with ChineseGovernment regulations, ina
sanitary landfdl. Prior to receiving the sludge, the hazardous andor sanitarylandfillswill be certified as
designedandoperatedincompliancewith applicable govemment regulationsrelatingto disposal of
wastewater treatment plant sludge. Transportation o fthe WWTP sludgewill be conducted by leak proof
trucks. Confirmation of theseawanaementswas received at neaotiations.

Public consultations haverevealedconsiderablesupport for this project. However, concernswere also
expressedabout the potential unpleasantodors from WWTPs, andgreaternoise and dust levels, as well as
traffic. Some suggestedshorterconstruction periods to reduce adverseimpacts duringthe construction
period. The shiplock at the ShangtangRiver was re-sited further away from the historic Hangshang
Temple. Agriculturaluse o fthe WWTP sludgewas viewed not feasible by affected people for the
Wuzhong andDongthgWWTPs. These concernshave beenincorporated intothe project design andinthe
EMP.

TWOsuggestionsare madeat the conclusion ofthe EAReport. The first oneregarding implementation of
the locally-financed Wuli Lake ecological restoration sub-component as a pilot activity (instead of an
activity for full-scale implementation) is reflected inthe project design. The secondrelatesto the
implementation of industrial pollutionprevention measures(inparticular, waterrecycle and reuse at
industrialfacilities) as a means to reducecosts associatedwithwastewater treatment and sludge
management. Aweement was reached at negotiations that industries discharoing into vroiect-financed
~       Pwill be included in theJianasu CPvropram and that ueriodic vroiect vropress reuorts will

Bankreceived the fvst drafiofEAinEnglishinlate September2003 duringthepreappraisalmission.
Bank's comments wereprovidedonOctober 12,2003. The EAwas finalized with all clarifications and
analysisinFebruary2004.

5.4 How have stakeholdersbeenconsultedat the stage o f (a) environmental screeningand(b) draflEA
report on the environmental impacts andproposedenvironment managementplan? Describe mechanisms
of consultation that were usedandwhich groups were consulted?
Consultationswiththe potentially affectedpeople were conductedbythe EA team intwo stages. First
stagepublic consultationswere heldprior andduringpreparation of the EA Report (period between
October 2002 and August 2003). At this stage, the EA team heldmeetingswiththe potentially affected
people to discussthe EA TOR, including informationaboutthe project componentsandactivities involved,
potential environmental impacts, mitigatorymeasures, andthe implementation schedule. Informal
discussionsandon-site visits were held, andquestionnaireswere distributed to understandthe public
attitudesandneeds aboutthe project's environmental aspects. The interviewees were from differentsexes,
age groups, culture levels, andfamily structures.

Second stagepublic consultationswere conductedinJuly 2003 bythe EAteam after completion of the
draft EAReport to disseminatethe conclusions ofthe EAReport anddisclose the mitigatory measuresto
the potentially affected people. This provided anopportunity to address the concernsthat hadbeenraised
bythe affectedpeopleregardingthe project. Consultative meetingswere heldregarding the Anzhen
WWTP (inNianyuVillage), DongtingWWTP (inWangsongbang), Wuzhong WWTP (YinxiVillage), and
WuliLakerestoration (inD a hTown, DongjiangTown, JingchengandXuelangTowns). Inaddition,
on-the-spot interviewswere heldandquestionnaireswere usedto receive feedback. InAugust 2003, the
Project was publicized bythe EA team inHohaiUniversity's website (httu://www.hhu.edu.cn), anda
24-hour telephonehotline was opened.
5.5 What mechanismshave beenestablishedto monitor andevaluate the impact o f the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results o fthe EMP?
As partofthe EMP,monitoringprograms havebeendraftedfor eachprojectcomponenthub-component.
Monitoringarrangements andreportingprocedureshave been strengthenedinthe Final EAreport, as
supplemented, inFebruary 2004. The indicators regarding "improved urbanwater quality environment"
specified in h e x 1 of the project appraisal document (PAD)reflect objectives o fthe EMP.
6. Social:
6.1 Summarizekey social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
developmentoutcomes.


The key adverse social impacts o fthe project are largelyrelatedto landacquisition anddemolition o f
structuresfor different components o f the project. In accordancewith local laws, regulations andthe
World BankOP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, two ResettlementAction Plans (RAPS)have been


                                                    - 22 -

   preparedfor the various components, includingwastewatertreatment plants, seweragenetworks, canal
   dredging, flood control facilities, sluice gates andembankmento fWuli lake inSuzhouandWuxi
.  Municipalities, respectively. The two RAPs are eachbasedon a detailed census of the affected people,
   inventory ofaffected assets, socioeconomic surveys andextensiveconsultationswith the project affected
   people.

   The various components of the project will require a total o f904.7 muof land, demolitionof 53,967 m2 of
   houses, andrelocation of 16 enterprises. These would affect 536 people due to landacquisition and774
   people in 176householdsdue to housedemolition. Cashcompensationor replacementhousing will be
   offered to those who will lose their residence. Enterpriseswill be offered analternative site and
   compensatedfor property loss. Forpersonswhose employment will be affected temporarily, cash
   compensationwill bepaid for their income losses. The RAPs detail the census, inventory, project
   resettlementpolicy, compensationrates andbudget, compensationandrehabilitation programs, institutional
   andmonitoringarrangements.

   A retroactive reviewwas undertakenfor relatedresettlementactivities whichhave alreadybeencompleted.
   The retroactive review provideddetailed information ofthe numberof affected people andthe status of
   livelihoodrehabilitation.

   A ResettlementPolicy Framework hasbeenpreparedinaccordancewith local laws, regulations andWorld
   BankOP4.12 onInvoluntaryResettlementfor the linkedsewer networks rehabilitation inSuzhou. Details
   are available inAnnex 1l-B.

   6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholdersparticipatinginthe project?
   The project componentswere preparedinaparticipatory manner. The project entity, with its team of
   international andnational consultants, have organizedvarious consultative meetings withrepresentativesof
   the provincialandmunicipal governments to apprisethem o f the environmental anddevelopmentissues.
   These have facilitated participatory consultations, garneringstakeholder support for the project concept,
   andeducatingthese stakeholdersontheir roles andresponsibilities inprojectexecution.

   Local consultants carried out social surveys ofpotential beneficiaries andusers o fproject services. The
   participatory approachfor the resettlementaspects o fthe project has beendealt withinthe RAP, following
   ChineseandBankprocedures andguidelines closely.

   Consultationswill continue withcommunities inthe areas directly affectedbyproject works. All affected
   householdsandcommunities inthe project areas have beenidentified through socio-economic andinventory
   surveys. Project information, includingresettlementpolicies, hasbeenprovidedto the affectedpopulations
   throughvarious channels. They have beenextensively consultedandhave participated inthe preparation of
   the resettlementandrehabilitationprogram.

   6.3 How does the project involve consultationsor collaboration withNGOs or other civil society
   organizations?
   Local government officials andcommunity organizations inthe areas affected have beenconsultedand
   haveparticipatedinthe resettlementprogram preparation. Households directly impactedby works have
   been surveyed Neighborhood meetings havebeenorganized to solicit their views andconcerns, as well as

F. Sustainabilityand Risks
1. Sustainability:
The project would contribute to the sustainability of continued strongeconomic growthby improving
wastewatermanagementand environmental conditions inareas o fWuxi and Suzhouthat are experiencing
rapidurban and industrial growth; and by assistingongoing efforts to stem continued deterioration of
critical water resources inthe Tai Basin. The project wouId strengthenthe sustainability o fwastewater
services through improvementsinthe managementand financing ofresponsiblewastewater utility
enterprises.

2. Critical Risks (reflecting the failure of critical assumptions found inthe fourth column of Annex 1):
Some projectrisks relating to institutional arrangements for strengtheningwastewatermanagementare
generic, but are morepronouncedat the district level, where sector managementexperienceis less mature
andkeyreforms are being implementedinassociationwiththe project. Sectordevelopmentthrough
(locally-financed) wastewater masterplansis important to achieving the project's longer-term objectives.
However, achieving the level o finter-jurisdictional coordination andc o n s e m requiredfor this will be
challenging. Even so, overall project risk is assessedas modestbecauseof the strong commitment by the
leadershipinSuzhou andWuxiMunicipalities andparticipating districts and because overall project
coordination hasbeenplacedunder the FinanceBureauto avoid the unsatisfactory experiencedunder the
SouthernJiangsu Environmental ProtectionProject.

HuishanDistrictwas separatedsome two years agofromthe original, largerXishandistrictandoccupiesa
total area o f km2. Italreadyhas two smallWWTPs which mostly serve industrial areas. Underthis
project, Huishanwill construct: (a) a 25,000 m31dwastewater treatmentplant; and(b) the associated
network to convey sewageflows to the newplant. The network developmentwould consist of about 58 lan
of tnuik andsecondarypipes and3 liftingstations.

The WWTP would treat sewage up to secondarylevel for a capacity of 25,000 m31d; all industries are
expectedto providepreliminary treatmentof their own effluent so as to meet applicable regulations for
handlingsewage at the municipal level. Inthe eventthat faster economic developmentinthese industrial
zones generates greater industrial wastewater flows thananticipated, secondarytreatment can be expanded
on site. The ultimatetreatmentcapacity for the whole serviced area would be 50,000 m3/d. After review
o fthe various possible treatmentprocesses, the proposedtreatment technology agreeduponwouldbe SBR
as it fits the expectedflow andload composition o fmixedindustrial anddomestic users, as well as the
operational capabilities of district staff. Particulars of the quantitiesofpipe supplies andpumping
characteristicsare indicated inthe Project files. All facilities to be constructedwouldbe under the
supervision of a PMOunderthe District Construction Commission andhandedover to a District
Wastewater Company.

Partsof the remaining Xishan District are expectedto be administratively integrated with the four urban
districts o f Wuxi Municipalitywithina few years. Currently, XishanDistrict has three wastewater
treatmentsplants, either recently commissionedor undercompletion. These are located inDongting
(20,000 m3/d), Meicun, andShoufang(both of 15,00Om3/d). Thepresentproject component wouldfocus
on: (a) extension of the Dongtingplant to 50,000 m3/d and constructionof associatedsewer networks;
and (b) construction of a secondary WWTPof 20,000 m3/d capacity at Anzhen and constructionof
associated sewerage networks and associated lifting stations.

The Dongting plant will serve urbanareas now under intense industrial development as it is closely located
to the oldWuxiurbandistricts. The Anzhenscheme will serve the three urbandistricts o fM e n ,
Yangjie, Houqiao andindustrial zone ofXishanDistrict. This combined scheme is the least-cost
altemative for sewerhgeach area andtreating the resultingeffluent. As inthe case o f Huishanabove,
these two plants would use the SBR treatmentprocess, since they face identicaloperating characteristics
with significant andnot yet fully definedindustrial effluents. The plant locationinM e nis inan
agricultural area, close to the WangYuRiver, where the plant effluent will be discharged.

These plants would be servicedby anetworkof about40 kmo flarge trunk andsecondary sewer lines in
the Dongting area, and 146kmof trunk andsecondary sewer lines inthe Anzhen area. This program has
alreadystartedWith district financing, as the presentDongting first phase is still under-utilized. The
presentproject would dso include fundingof sewer connectionsfor the domestic users. Mostindustries are
builtwithpreliminarywastewatertreatment facilities, buttheir operations are not always upto the standard
required. In order to protect wastewater assets (plantandnetwork) constructed under the project against
over strengthindustrialinfluent resultingfrom insufficient preliminary treatment bythe industries
connectedto the network, the wastewater company charterwouldinclude provisions givingrightsto the
companyto sample incomingdischargesfrom the servicedindustries andto close their connectionsincase
of inadequatepreliminary treatment. The Dongtingnetwork would also include one lifting station; the
M e nnetwork wouldhavethreeliftingstations.

XishanDistrict Govemment intends to mergethese plants under a single wastewater enterprise. While
networks andplantsare not interconnected, a single wastewatercompany would present substantial
advantagesinterms of reducedmanagementoverheads and staff training requirements.

This non-Bank financed componentcomprises: (a) the constructionofI O new sluice gates andone
shiplock oncanals andstreams connectedthe Wuli Lake to the hinterland; @) the rehabilitation o f about
some 20 kmof embankmentsaroundWuliLake; and(c) pilot ecological restorationinselectedareas of
Wuli Lake. The aboveinvestmentsarepartofanoverall schemeofinvestments,including some already
implemented under local financing, consistingof a largepumpingstation, to increase the flow circulation in
the Wuli Lake at low flow periods; and a sewer interceptor on the northemside o fthe lake. The overall
justification for this scheme is the interception o f all incoming sewageflows into the lake andthe increased
circulation of flow inthe lake area inparticular at low flow periods, inorder to avoid the growth of algae.
The gates andshiplock .areintendedto protect the lake fiom incoming polluted flows coming from the canal
network during the low flow season, as well as excessflood flows duringthe rainy season. Inadditionto
these works, a sewerage network andinterceptorswill be constructed under an ongoing program of sewer
development inthe WWri city.

byother cities. This componentwill improve thewater environmentinthese canals andthroughout this
popular tourist area. A numberof industrieshave beenrelocatedoutside of the historic city anduse of
cargobargesinthe area is also being reduced. There are two key points of entry for outsidepollutionat
Xujiang and Shangtang. Theproject will construct two new gates and 1 shiplock on theXujiang River
next to the Grand Canal and one shiplock in ShangtangRiver. The gates are designedto block entry o f
pollutedwater to the inner systemo f canals, includingfrompollutionspills on the GrandCanal, as well as
protect againstflooding duringhighflow periods. The locks are designedto accommodatetraffic flows of
tourist barges. Suzhoumunicipalityhas also embarkedon a locally-financed program ofhouseconnections
that would permitseparationof rainwater from sewage inthe networks andalso intercept all sewage still
entering canals.

The project will finance a dredgingprogramto remove flow bottlenecksinSuzhou's inner canals to
restore their initial transit and absorptiveflood capacity andprovide cleanflowing water through the
historic city. Most inner canals  - 65.7" - wouldbe   subjectto dredging andthe collectedsludge evacuated

                       WastewaterMasterplansForWuxiAnd SuzhouMunicipalities

60.      Background: NeitherWuxinor SuzhouMunicipalities currently have anup-to-date approved
wastewatermasterplans uponwhich investmentscanbebased. Suzhourelies on a masterplanpreparedin
1995 for the core city area only. Wuxi recently updatedits original wastewater masterplan, but this is not
yet approvedbythe municipalgovernment. Itis understood, however, that the updatedmasterplanis again
restrictedto a separateplanfor eachadministrative district. Other plans inplace includeJiangsu
Province's Tenth Five-YearPlan, andthose of the municipalities. For the urbanizingdistricts, these plans
call for individualwastewatersystems operatedby separatecompaniesineachtown. Inboth Suzhouand
Wuxi, several districts located close to the core cities havebeen absorbedintothe city area, butthe
wastewaterplans do not reflectthese fundamentaladministrative changes.

61,      There is a needto develop more integratedinfrastructure plans, including for sewerage, that
adequately cover the rapidly urbanizingareas surrounding cities andto reducethe fragmentation and
duplication that results from separateplansbasedonold administrative boundaries. Iti s also important to
develop more cost-effective wastewatersystems, which would likely favor a smaller numberof larger
treatment plants located strategically aroundthe urbanizingdistricts. Thus, there is anurgent,needinboth
SuzhouandWuxi to conduct a wastewatermasterplanningexercise considering eachmunicipality as a
whole, inorder to determinethe optimal configuration o fwastewater systems interms of number, size and
location.
62.      TA will beprovidedto helpensure that wastewater strategiesandmasterplansfor bothWuxiand
SuzhouMunicipalities reflect presentconditions andmajortrends, the types ofdevelopment existing and
proposed(and therefore accurately characterizelikely wastewater conditions), andthat optimize the types,
locations and size of wastewatersystems inthe future. These planningexercises should be conductedon a
municipality-wide basis, andshould include allurbandistricts andsub-municipalities within Suzhouand
W w i Municipalities. Inaddition, where combinedindustrial anddomestic wastewater systemsare
proposed, these planningexercisesshouldensure full integration of information andrecommendationsfrom
the relevant municipal and district bureaus (Le. water resources,water affairs, environmental protection,
etc.).

            InstitutionalStrengtheningofWastewaterUtilities andTraininginProjectManagement.

63.      This TA would strengthenthe capacity of the wastewater utilities responsible for the project's
wastewater components. The key overall objectives of the proposedTA are:

e        to assistthe project companies inestablishingthemselvesas autonomous andfinancially
sustainableutilitycompaniesthat caneffectively andefficiently meet the service obligations set out for
them;
e        to assist the project companiesandtheir parentmunicipal anddistrict governments incomplying
with allrelevantnationalpolicies for the reformofthe wastewater managementsector; and,
         to assistthe project companies andtheir parentmunicipal anddistrict governments indeveloping
plans andprogramsfor private sectorparticipationinthe wastewater sector that support government
policies for optimizhg the efficiency andeffectivenessofwastewater service delivery.

64.     This assistancewill be implementedwithinthe framework of a definedandagreedupon sector
plans for each project municipalityanddistrict (see above). These planswill establishthe basic policies,
plansandimplementationprogramsfor achievingtheoverall developmentgoalsfor the sector. The
assistance is then intended to supportachievementofthese developmentgoals through assistanceinthe
implementation ofthe specific institutional, financial andoperational aspects of the sector plans.

a needto write carellly worded Tumkey BiddingDocuments, and goodcoordination betweenthe
Tendering Company, the DesignInstitute andthe Client. This is utmost importance to ensure satisfactory
documentation for bids for design, supply, installation andconstruction of two wastewatertreatment plants.
Inaddition, the constructiion offive completewastewatertreatmentunitswill requireconstant guidanceto
the PMOs for ensuring that contractorsperfom as expected.

To ensure success of the construction activities andits timely execution, the TA will be providedto PIUs

Project Setting

1.       TaiBasin. The Tai Basin,whichincorporatessouthemJiangsuProvince andthe project cities of
SuzhouandWuxi, is one of the economically active areas inChina. In2000, the totalpopulation inthe
Basinwas 36.3 millionwithover halfresidinginurbanareas. Inthis same year, totalGDP inthe Basin
was estimated to be RMB 890 billion, about 10.8 percentof the national total, andgrowing at an average
annualrate o f over 10percentsince 1998.

2.       JiangsuProvince. JiangsuProvince is one of the most important eastemcoastalprovinces in
China andis an integralpartof the Yangtze Economic Zone, with over 200 millionpeople, including in
neighboring ShanghaiMunicipality, andthe provinces ofZhejiang andAnhui. The regionforms one ofthe
largest concentrations of international trade andcommerceinthe Asia-Pacific region. Jiangsu coversan
areaof 103,000km2 (1 percentofthe national total) andhasa population of about 74 million (5.7 percent
of nationaltotal), of which 30 percentis urban. Jiangsuaccountedfor 9.9 percent o f China's total GDP in
2001.

3.       Economic growthis being driven primarily by the secondaryandtertiarysectors, which
respectively accountedfor 52 percentand37 percento f GDP in2001. The strongest growth has beenin
the tertiary sector, which has doubled its share o fGDP since 1980. Over this same period, the proportion
o fGDP accountedfor bythe primary sector declined fromjust under 30 percent to 11percent. Although
the tertiary sector is becoming increasingly important, Jiangsu continuesto have a significant heavy
industry sector, which accountedfor 57 percent o fthe province's total industrialoutput in2001. Among
the heavy indusmes, machinery and equipmentis the largest sector whichaccountedfor 32 percent of the
province's total industrial output, followed by chemicals.

4.       The very rapid expansionofexport-oriented developmentzones hasbeen a major stimulus to the
provincial economy. Totalforeigntrade has increasedsignificantly, registering USS9.2billionin2000 to
US$70.3billionin2002, anincreaseof almost 43 percent. Between 1985 and2001, exports grew 17 times
while imports grew 55 times. Manufacturedgoods accountedfor 97 percent and88 percentofthe
province`s exports andimports respectively. Muchof this growthinforeign trade is being drivenby
foreign investment. In2001,Jiangsurankedfirst nationallyinterms o f foreign direct investment withtotal
commitments of US$15.1 billionduringthe year.

5.        Suzhouis animportant historicalandcultural heritage city, located inthe central part of Yangtze
River DeltaArea with Shanghaito the east, Zhejiang to the southandWWri to the west. Itcovers anarea
of 8,488 lan2. In2000, the total population o f Suzhoumunicipality was 5.8 million, the largest inthe
province, withabout 2.5 millionresiding inurbanareas o fthe municipality, o fwhom about 800,000 live in
the inner city. Suzhouaccounts for 18 percent o fprovincial GDP. Suzhou's per capita GDP has increased
from RMB 23,618 (US$2,850) in 1999to RMB30,400 (US$3,670) in2001. The city's economy is based
onthe secondary sector, which accountsfor 56 percent o f GDP, followed by the tertiary sector, which
accountsfor 37 percent. Foreigntradehas been anextremely importantfactor inSuzhou's growthover the

  6.       Wuxi. WWriis the thirdlargest municipality inJiangsuProvince, 128kmeastof Shanghai,
  bordering the Yangtze Riverto the north, andthe Lake Tai to the south. Wuxi's total populationis 4.4
  million, o fwhich about 2.1 millionreside inurban areas. The municipality covers an area of 4,650 km2,
  including 518km2 as the city center. The municipality comprisessevendistricts andtwo county-level
  cities. Wuxi accounts for 15 percento fthe total provincial GDP. Per capita GDP increasedfrom Rh4B
  18,000 (US$2,155) in 1995to RMB31,200 (US$3,770) in2001. Industrialdevelopment has beenthe
  mainengine o f growth, especiallyinmachinery, electronics,textiles, metallurgical, chemical and
  pharmaceuticals.

  7.       The remarkable economic growth inthe two project cities over the last 15years andthe resulting
  structural transformation has resultedinrapidurbanization, risingreal incomes, a sustainedconstruction
  boom andincreasing pressure on basic infrastructure andpublic services. Inthe environmental context,
  this has resulted insignificant deficienciesinthe managemento f wastewater, which the project i s designed
 to help address.

  ProjectBenefitsandBeneficiaries

  8.       The project will improve the quality of the urban environment through improvedwastewaterand
  water quality managementinthe key municipalities of Wuxi and Suzhou andmore widely inthe Tai Basin
  inordertofacilitate sustainableurbaneconomicgrowthandsocialdevelopment. Thephysical
  infrastructure componentsofthe project include improvements inwastewater collection andtreatment in
  SuzhouandWuxi, canal dredging inSuzhou, control o fpollutedwater onthe Xujiangand Shangtang
  Rivers inSuzhou, andpollutioncontrol and lake bankrestoration for Wuli Lake inWuxi. The project is
  also supporting critical institutionalandfinancial reforms that willprovide a viable and sustainablebasis
  for the wastewaterinvestmentsbeing implementedunder the project, particularlythose insmall systems
  servingtherapidly developing areas of SuzhouandWuxi. A summary ofthe major benefitsby project
  component is given below.

  9.       ProjectWastewater Components. The investmentsinwastewater inSuzhouandWuxiinclude
  expansions of existing systems as well as construction of new collection andtreatment facilities to areas
  presently not served, where waste ispresentlydischargeduntreated to watercourses. Expansion o f existing
  systems will beundertaken inthe Suzhoucore city area (Fuxin andLoujiang) andinWuxi's Xishan
  District Oongting). New systems will be constructedinWuzhong District inSuzhou, HuishanDistrict in
' Wuxi, andinXishanDistrict (Anzhen). The project will also supportthe rehabilitationandexpansionof
  the sewer network inthe Wuxi city center area. Combined, these investments willprovide additional
  secondarytreatmentcapacity of 280,000 &/day.        This additional treatment capacity is projected to reduce
  COD dischargesinto the environment by about35,500 t/year. Expansion o f the wastewater systems in
  central urbandistricts of Suzhou andWuxi will benefit most o fthe cities' populations. Expansion of
  wastewater service inrapidly industrializing outlying districts inWuxi and Suzhouwill reducepollution o f
  the region's critical water resourcesand supply andthereby enable these areas to achieve the targets for 70
  percentwastewaterservice coverageby 2010. By expandingsewer networks, the project will help utilize
 wastewater treatmentcapacity, including for existingplants, more fully and, thereby, increasethe
  productivityofinvestmentsinwastewater assets overall. Itwill alsoreduce healthrisks andenhance
  livelihoodprospects andproductivity inthese rapidly growing areas and for downstream communities,
  Throughthe protectionof drinkingwater sources, the project will generatesavingsthrough avoided costs of
 water supplytreatment. The project will provide the basis for sustainable economic growth. Inthe city
  core of Suzhou,the wastewaterimprovements will protect andenhance tourism, which is amajor economic
  activity. Inthe districts, the investmentsinwastewater will provide a more sustainablebasis for the very
 rapidurbanization o f these areas.

10.      Suzhou -Fuxin & Loujiang Wastewater. The project componentwill provide additional
secondarytreatment capacity of 180,000 m3/day, including BNR, through the expansionof the existing
FuxinandLoujiangWWTPs. The project shouldachieveareductioninCODdischargesintothe
environment of about 16,700 t/year. With this expansion, virtually 100percento fthe wastewater
generatedinthe central district of Suzhouwill receivesecondary treatmentcomparedto less than60
percent at present. The population directly benefiting from these service improvements is estimatedto be
about 800,000 in2008 when the project facilities commenceoperations. However, all 2.5 millionurban
residentso f Suzhouwill benefitthrough amix of direct andindirect benefits.

11.      Tourismis a majoreconomic activity inSuzhouandthemainfocus oftourism is the natural and
cultural amenities of the historic city center, which includes the canalnetwork. The city attractedover 17
milliontourists in2001, morethan double the number in 1990. Total income from tourisminSuzhouwas
estimatedto be about RMB20 billion in2002., The project will have a direct impact inprotecting and
enhancingtourismthrough its role inimprovingenvironmental conditions inthe central city.

12.      Suzhou  -WuzhongDistrict. Theprojectwillfimdtheconstructionofanewwastewatercollection
andtreatment facility withaninitial capacityof25,000 m3/day. The new facility is projectedto reduce
COD discharges into the environment by about 3,800 Vyear. The project will serve a rapidly developing
industrial area andits adjacentresidential andcommercial developments. The project will protect local
surface water resourcesandpublic health, which are coming underpressureas aresult of economic growth
inthe district. Throughthis, itwillprovideabasisformoresustainableindustrialandurbangrowthin
Wuzhong.

13.       Wtuci Huishan District. The project componentwill provide wastewater collection andtreatment
                -
to a rapidly developing areaof HuishanDistrictthat presently has no centralized wastewater management.
The project willprovide secondarytreatmentcapacity o f 25,000 m3/day, butwill be designedto
accommodatea future expansioninsecondarytreatment to 50,000 m3/day. The new systemis projectedto
achieve areduction inCOD dischargesinto the environment o f about 4,300 Uyear. The project component
will protect surfacewater resources, safeguardpublic health andfacilitate sustainableeconomic growth in
the district.

14.       W u i-Xishan District. InWuxi's XishanDistrict, the projectwill fund the expansiono fthe
existing Dongtingwastewater treatment andcollection systemas well as the construction o f a new system
inAnzhen. This willprovide additional secondarytreatment capacity of50,000 m3/day. The Dongting
systemwill serve urbanareas of Xishan District adjacentto the central city ofWuxi, which are undergoing
rapid industrial development. The newAnzhensystemwill have an initialsecondarytreatment capacity of
20,000 m3/day. Itwill servethe threeurbanareas o fAnzhen, Yangjie, Houqiao andarapidly expanding
industrialzonewithinthe district. The two newsystems are projectedto achievea combinedreductionin
COD discharges intothe environment ofabout 10,750 t/year. As inthe case ofthe Huishancomponent,
the wastewaterimprovements inDongting andAnzhen will provide a more sustainablebasis for the rapid
economic andpopulation growth of the district through the environmental andpublic health protection.

15.      Suzhou-Water Regulation Gates onXujiangdk Shangtang Rivers. This project componentis
partof the overall flood protection planfor Suzhouandwill also support the municipality's ongoing
pro-      for cleaningup its internal network of canals within the historic city. The gates will control the
flow o fpolluted water from the GrandCanal into the inner canal systemandprevent the loss of cleanwater
divertedthrough Xujiang from the WangYuRiver. The improvement inflood control will reduceeconomic
losses arisingfromflooding inthe central city. Basedonanalysesundertaken inpreparation o fthe Suzhou


                                                     -44-

FloodControl Masterplan, the PV of avoideddamages due to reducedflooding that can be directly
attributed to this project componentis estimatedto be RMB 188 million, significantly greater thanits
economic cost, RMB 110million. The improvement inthe water quality ofthe inner city canalswill also
significantly enhance their amenity andrecreationvalue, bothto city residentsas well as to tourists and
other visitors, for which the canals representone of the maincity attractions.

16.      Suzhou Central City CanalDredging. This project componentis designed to compliment an
                   -
ongoing program for the separationo f the existing combined sewer systemthat would intercept all sewage
still entering the inner city canals. Dredging o f 65 kmofurbancanals inSuzhouwill improve water
qualityandenhancethe capacityofthe canalsto provide for flood control. This will reducethe incidence
of localized flooding andassociateddamages. Basedonthe resultsofthe water quality modelling
undertakenduringproject preparation, the dredgingcouldreduceCOD concentrationsby 0.1           - 0.8 mg/l
andNH3-Nby 0.1 -O S m@. As inthe case ofthe water regulation gates, improvedwater quality will
increasethe amenity andrecreationvalue of the inner city areathat is permeatedby canals andwillhave a
direct economic impactthrough tourism andother activities.

17.      Wuxi WuliLake Rehabilitation. The locally-financedWuli Lake componentofthe project will
                -
contribute toward the restorationofthe lake through pollutioncontrol (10 sluice gates, one shiplock),
restoration of 19.4 kmo flake bank, andpilotresearchinecological restoration. The program will also
help to reducethe frequency andseverity of flooding inWuxi City and openupa substantial new area for
developmentwith significant amenityvalue for commercial, residential andrecreationaluse. As inSuzhou,
tourism is animportant economic activity inWuxi. The number of tourists visiting Wuxi in2001 was 12
million andtourist income was RMB 15 billionin2002. SinceWuli Lake is one ofthe city's maintourist
attraction, the lakerestoration will have a direct and significant impact on economic activity inWuxi. The
restoration will also directly benefit city residentsfor whom Wuli Lake is a major recreational resource.

Economic Analysis

18.      Methodology. Although attemptsto quantify project benefits were undertaken, many ofthe
benefits, particularlythose relating to environmental andpublic health improvements could not be
quantified For this reason, the choice for priority interventions for the project hasbeenguidedby cost
effectiveness andleastcost analyses. Incrementalcosts andoutput are calculated fiom the difference
betweena "with project" scenario and the "without project" scenario. The economic costs for the
componentsare determinedbymakingadjustmentsto the component's financial costs. All taxes andduties
were excludedind e t e*r " g economic costs. Price contingencies, interest duringconstruction andnet
working capitalrequirementsare also excluded.

19.      Least-Cost Analysis. Alternative project designswere identified and evaluated inorder to identify
the leastcost solution for incorporation into the project. The findings o f these analysesare summarized
below.

20.      WastewaterSystem ConJigurations. One ofthe mainobjectives of the project wastewater
interventions is to minimize service costs through the consolidation o f service areas andtreatment facilities.
Insome ofthe districts, andparticularlyinXishan,the originalpreliminary proposals includedplans for
separate collection andtreatment facilities for each small town andindustrialdevelopment. Duringproject
preparation, these plans were revisedonthe basis o fleast cost analysis, which indicatedthat a more
consolidatedapproachwas more cost effective andpreferable on environmental grounds.




                                                      -45-

21.       Wuxi Xishan District. Originally, separatesystemswere proposedfor each ofthe seventowns in
                -
southernXishan. This was found to be significantly moreexpensivethanproviding servicesthrough either
one single system or through two systems. Underthis second alternative, one WWTP wouldbe locatedat
M e nandserve Anzhen, YangjianandHouqiao, whilethe secondWWTP wouldlocatedat Dangkou and
cover Dangkou, Houzhai, Hongshen andGalu towns. The least-cost analysisindicatedthat the unitcost of
the two-system optionwas slightly less expensive than the single systemover the economic life ofthe
facilities. The average incrementaleconomic cost (AIEC) ofthe two systemoption is estimatedto be RMB
2.18/m3 o fwastewater treated,comparedto RMB2.32/m3 for the single system. Although this cost
differential is not significant, the two systemoption possesses the additional advantageo fnot requiringlong
distancetransfer of wastewater. There are technical concemsassociatedwith this transfer that couldnot be
adequatelyquantified andincorporated into the least-costanalysis. Therefore, the two-system alternative
has beenincorporated into the project designas the least-costoption. The M e nsystemhas been
included inthe project while the secondsystem, serving Dangkou, Houzhai, Hongshen andGalu, will be
undertakenbythe district governmentdirectly withlocalhding.

22.       W u i Huishan District. In Huishan, the optimal configuration for serving the three towns
                -
--Yanqiao, Changan, Xizhang       -- plusthe Huishan Industrial Park, was assessed on the basis o f three
alternatives. Under Option 1, a newWWTP andcollection systemwould be constructedto serve this entire
servicearea. Under Option 2, the new WWTP would serve only two ofthe towns, Yanqiao and Changan,
plusthe industrialpark. WastewaterfromXizhang would becollected andtreatedat the existing Chengbei
WWTP, which wouldthenrequire expansion. UnderOption3, all wastewaterfromthe threetowns and
industrial parkwould be collected andtransferredto the Chengbei WWTP. However, this thirdaltemative
was soonrejected once it was confirmedthat insufficient landwas available at Chengbei for the necessary
expansion. A least-cost analysis was thenundertakenfor the two remainingaltematives, which indicated
that Option 1, a single WWTP serving all three towns andthe industrialparkwas the least cost. The AIEC
for Option 1 is estimatedto be RMB 1.83/m3, comparedto RMB2.23/m3 for Option 2. Therefore, the
selecteddesign o f this project componentis based on Option 1.

23.       Suzhou WuzhongDistrict. Two altemative systemconfigurations were assessed, Under Option
                 -
1, the wastewaterwithinthe project service area wouldbe collected andtransferred to the existing Songlin
WWTP, which is outside the project serviceareabut withinWuzhong District. This existingWWTP, has
an existing capacity of only 5,000 m3/day, is presently beingexpandedto 10,000 m3/day, but wouldneed
to be expandedby a further 25,000 m3/day under this option. Under Option 2, a separate WWTP would
be constructedwithintheproject service area inthe Wuzhong Economic Development Zone. The AIEC for
Option 2 is estimatedto be RMB 1.98/m3, comparedto RMB2.26/m3 for Option 1, Therefore, Option 2
was found to be the least cost andhas beenadoptedas the preferred project configuration.

24.       TreatmentProcess Selection. A least-cost analysis was undertaken to support the selection ofthe
preferred secondarytreatmentprocess for each wastewater component ("able 1). The processesconsidered
were oxidation ditch, conventional activated sludgeprocessunder the anaerobic/anoxic/oxidationmode,
andSBR. Inaddition, for the FuxinandLoujiangWWTP expansions, the proprietaryUNITANKprocess
was also evaluatedbecausethe existing first phaseo fbothfacilities employs this process. However, the
oxidation ditchprocess was not consideredfor FuxinandLoujiangbecause there is insufficientavailable
landat these sites. For the district systems, the SBR process is estimated to be the least cost although in
HuishanandXishan, the differencebetweenSBR andactivatedsludge isnot significant. For allofthe
district systems, the SBRprocesshas beenselectedas the preferredtreatment process. For the Dongting
wWTP inXishan District, the SBR processwas selectedwithout undertaking a detailed least-costanalysis
becausethe existingfirst phaseo f this WWTP employs the SBR process. For FuxinandLoujiang, all
three processesevaluated, activatedsludge, SBR andUNITANK, are essentially the same cost. Although


                                                     -46-

the selection o f the UNITANKprocesswould be advantageousinthat it provides for full compatibility
betweenthe first and secondphaseso fthe WWTPs, the processis proprietary. However, since UNITANK
is a technical modification of the SBRprocess, the preferredprocessi s selectedas SBR, without specific
patent.

25.      Cost EffectivenessofWastewater Investments. The marginalcosto fpollutantremoval provides
an indication of the relative cost effectiveness o f eachwastewater component. The AIEC per tonne of
CODremoved for eachproject alternativeis given inTable 2. AIECs for the FuxinandLoujiang WWTP
expansionsare comparableto those for other larger scale expansionsproposed for Bank funding. For
example, AIECs calculated for the wastewater componentsinthe SecondLiao RiverBasinProject (2003)
were betweenRMB 3,170 andRMB3,305 per tome of COD removed. For the secondarytreatment
altemative assessed for inclusioninthe Chongqing UrbanEnvironmentProject (2000), the AIEC per tonne
of COD removedwas estimatedto be RMB 3,630.

26.      Fortheproject wastewatercomponentsinthe districts, the costofCODremovalis significantly
higher, rangingbetweenRMB 7,570 andRMB 9,050 per ton o f COD removed. While the smaller scale of
these facilities increases unit capital andoperating costs, the major reasonis these project components
include the construction of a sewer network inaddition to the WWTP. Incontrast, the FuxinandLoujiang
components incorporate only WWTP expansion.

economic prices (AIEC) andfinancial prices (average incremental financial cost -AIFC) andgiven in
         Average IncrementalCost (AIC). For eachwastewater component, the AIC is expressedinboth

Table 3. The AICs are calculated onthe basis of the economic life o fthe project. This is the 30-year
operating life of the projectplusthe construction period, whichis either four or five years, depending onthe
specific project component. The economic opportUnity cost of capital (EOCC), assumedto be 12percent,
is usedto discount incremental costs andvolumes inorder to calculatethe AIEC. The discount rate usedto
calculate AIFC is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC is calculated separately for
eachproject componentdependingonthe specific financial structure of each component, but varies only
slightly, between 5.3 percentand5.9 percent.

28.      The AICs are significantly higher for the district wastewater systems than for FuxinandLoujiang
systems inthe central Suzhou. The AIEC for FuinandLoujiangis estimatedto be RMB0.97/m3 and
RMB l.O2/m3 of wastewatertreatedrespectively,while those ofthe district systems are between3.7 and
4.9 times higher. Of the district systems, the least-cost system is HuishanwithanAIEC ofRMB 3.56/m3.
The highest cost systems are those inXishan withan AIEC of RMB4.73/m3. The AIEC for the Wuzhong
system is RMB3.81/m3. There are anumberofreasons for the significant difference inincrementalcosts
betweenthe district systems andthose incentral Suzhou. As for the cost effectivenessanalysis, the most
important reasonis the inclusiono f sewer networks inthe district project components while those incentral
Suzhouconsist only of WWTP expansion. Furthermore, addingtreatment capacity through anexpansion
of existingfacilities is less expensivethanthrough the construction ofnew facilities. All of the district
WWTPs included inthe project, withthe exception ofthe DongtingWWTP expansioninXishan, will be
entirely new. Another reasonfor the higher incrementalcosts for the district systems is that they will
receive a higher proportionof more costly to treat industrial wastewaterthanthe central Suzhou systems.
In2008, industrialwastewateris projectedto contribute48 percentoftotal wastewaterflowsincentral
Suzhou. Incontrast, industry is projectedto account for 82 percentinWuzhong, 68 percent inHuishan,
and61percent inXishan.

1.       An analysis of the availability ofcounterpartfundswas undertakenbyreviewingrevenuesand
expendituresinthe project cities anddistricts. Table 1presents a summary o f this analysis. The complete
analysis is available inthe project file. The dataanalyzedrelatesto what is referred to inChinese
government accounting as on-budgetand off-budget funds. On-budgetandoff-budgetary funds include
revenuesfrom statutory taxes andlevies. Their allocations are subjectto approval by higher level
governments. Off-budget are non-taxrevenues suchas net income remitted from municipally controlled
enterprises, and some types of user charges collectedby administrative departments. There is less control
byhigherlevelgovernment onthese revenues sources. Inthe two project municipalities, some ofthe
off-budget funds are actually transferred to on-budgetrevenuesand are generally allocated for the purpose
of capital investment expansions.

2.       For the four project wastewatercomponents, animportant source o f counterpart funds is the
municipalwastewaterfee. However, revenuegeneratedfrom this fee is not sufficient to cover all
counterpartfundingrequirements. Therefore, contributions are alsorequiredfrom the capital budgetsof
the municipal anddistrict governments. For the non-wastewatercomponents, all counterpart funding is
provided from the capital budgetsof the municipalgovernments inSuzhouandWuxi. Therefore, the
capital investment capacity of eachmunicipality anddistrict, andparticularly the ability of each
city/district to provide the necessary counterpartfunding, is assessed on the basis of these capital budgets,
Inthe case ofthe HuishanandXishan wastewatercomponentsinWuxi andthe Wuzhong wastewater
componentinSuzhou, the districts will providethe local government contributionfrom their capital funds,
For the other components, the municipal governmentsare responsible for the provision of counterpart
funding.

3.       The analysisof historical trendsindicates very large annual increasesinrevenuesand expenditures
inrecentyears inthe project cities, atboththe municipal anddistrictlevels. This is areflectionofthe
strongeconomic growth inthe cities andthroughout JiangsuProvince over the past decade. For example,
between 1998 and2002, municipalrevenueswithinthe core urbandistricts increasedat average annual
rates of 42 percentinSuzhou and 31percent inWuxi. For the entire municipal areas, which also include
the outlying districts and counties, average annual revenuegrowth inSuzhou was even greater, 48 percent,
over this same period. This reflects the tremendous growth innew industrialparks andresidential areas in
Suzhououtside the core city. InWuxi, revenuegrowthfor the entire municipality was 28 percentbetween
1998 and2002, only slightlylower thanthat inthe core city area, indicatingstrong economic growth inthe
newlydeveloping districts. The capital investmentbudgetso fbothcities also increasedsignificantly over
the 1998 2002 periodinbothcities, although the increasewas much greater inWuxi. Over this period,
           -
revenuesallocatedto the city's capital investment budget increasedat an averagerate o f 69 percent, well
above the increase intotal municipalrevenues. This reflects the City's focus on infrastructure investments
neededto improve living standards andprovide the basisfor continued economic growth. InSuzhou,
growth infundsallocatedto the capital budgetwas much lower, 15 percent per year. These very different
growthratesreflect large differences inhistoric capital investment levels. Although the cities haveroufly
comparablepopulations intheir urbancore areas, capital investment levels inSuzhouwere muchhigher
thaninWuxiupto 2002.

4.       Financial projections havebeenpreparedto assess the capacityof the two project municipalities
andthree districts to provide the necessarycounterpartfundingfor TBUEP. Relative to actual growth
rates over the recent past, the projections are basedon more conservativeassumptions,bothfor total
revenues, as well as that portionallocatedto their capital investmentbudgets. Over the 2003 -2009
period, total municipalrevenuesare projectedto increase at average annualrates of 6 percent inHuishan, 9
percent inSuzhou, Wuxi andXishan, and 12 percentinWuzhong. Over this sameperiod, revenues
allocated to the capital budgetare projectedto increase at anaverageannual rate o f 8 percent inthe urban
core districts o f SuzhouandWuxi. Revenuesallocatedto capital budget of the three districts are projected
to increase at average annualrates of 10percentinHuishan, 18 percentinXishan and20 percent in
Wuzhong andover the 2003 2009 period.
                              -

5.       The analysis indicatesthat the project componentsare consideredto be generally affordable to all
o fthe municipal anddistrict govemments. Requirementsfor project counterpartfunds from the two
municipal governments andthree districts as aproportion o ftotal revenuesvary between0.2 percenton
average inSuzhou (0.5 percentinthe peak*year),0.2 percent inWuxi (0.5 percent inthe peak year), 0.4
percent in Wuzhong (0.8 percentinthe peak year), 0.5 percent inHuishan(1.1 percent inthe peak year),
and 1.9 percent inXishan(3.7 percentinthepeakyear). Whenconsideringonlyrevenuesthat canbe
allocated to the infrastructure investment, which is anapproximation of financial capacity to contribute to
the project, counterpart contributions as a proportiono fthe capital budgetvary between 0.6 percent on
average inSuzhou (1.5 percentinthe peak year), 0.4 percent inWuxi (1.2 percent inthe peak year), 1.5
percent inWuzhong (2.9 percentinthe peakyear), and 1.9 percentinHuishan(3.8 percent inthe peak
year), and5.5 percent inXishan (11.3 percentinthe peakyear).

                                     B. Sector FundingandCost Recovery

6.       Sector Funding. China employs apolluter-pays approachto sector funding under which charges
are applied to all wastewater generatorsinurbanareas regardlessof whether they are connectedto the
public sewer. InSuzhouandWWri, a municipal wastewater fee is appliedthrough the municipal and
district water supply companies(WSC) to those receiving pipedwater supply. Fundingo fthe wastewater
sector from the municipal fee is, therefore, dependent onthe servicecoverage ofthe WSCs. Inthe central
cities, coverage is near universal, while inthe three project districts, coveragelevels are muchlower.
However, with the municipal water supplysystemnow being rapidly extendedinto HuishanandXishan,
revenue from the wastewater fee is now beginningto increase significantly. In2002, collections of the
municipal wastewater totaled aboutRMB 100millioninSuzhou and 140million inWuxi. By 2004, the
amount collected from HuishanandXishanis anticipatedto increasetotal municipalcollections by a
further RMB 24 million andthenmore thandouble over the next 3 -4 years.

7.       Reform of Wastewater Fee. Existingwastewater fees applied inSuzhouandWuxi are amongst
the highest in China, RMB 1.15/m3 andRMB 1.1O/m3 o fwater consumedrespectively. However, these
fees are applied under the legal authority o fthe municipal governmentsinboth cities and as such, are
remitted to the municipal finance bureaus ineach city, not to the wastewater companies. Inthe case of
Wuzhong District, the fee is collected bythe district water supply company andremittedto the district
finance bureau. Fundingo fthe sector is thenprovidedthrough budgetary allocations to the wastewater
companies rather thandirectly from the wastewater fee. InHuishanandXishandistricts inWuxi, the
situationhasbeenparticularly challenging becausethere has beenno mechanisminplace to retum
wastewater fees to the district companies, eventhrough the budgetaryallocations. Therefore, the priority
reform requirement, at leastover the immediate term, does notrelate to fee levels butrather to the direct
transfer of fee collections to the wastewater companies. Wuxi and SuzhouMunicipal Governmentshave
agreedto addressthis requirementby changing the legalstatus o fthe existing municipal fee to that o f a
wastewaterutilitytariff bythe end o f2006. Withthis reform, tariffs will be directly remittedto the
wastewater companiesinWuxi, including those inHuishanandXishan districts, andnot through the
finance bureaus. Over the interimperiod, Wuxi Municipal Government will transfer the fbll amount o fthe
fees collected inHuishanandXishanto the district governments.

8.       Cost Recovery Mechanisms inthe ProjectDistricts. Existingwastewater fees are set by the
municipalgovernmentsinSuzhouandWuxi and applied on a uniformbasisthroughout each municipality.
The fees are set primarilyon the basis o f capital andrecurrent fundingrequirements withinthe central
urbanareaofeachmunicipalitywhere mostofthe existingwastewater infrastructure is located.
Consequently,there is no direct linkage betweenthe setting o f fee levels that are applied inthe three project
districts andthe actual costs ofproviding wastewater services inthese areas. Furthermore, future increases
inwastewaterfees will also bedictatedprimarilybythe cost structuresinthe central cities. However, the
project wastewater systems inthe three districts will have higher unitcosts because o ftheir relatively small
scale and greater proportionof more costly to treat industrial wastewater. Therefore, the municipal
wastewaterfee may not be sufficient by itselfto filly recover the costs of the district companiesonce the
project iimdedfacilities beginoperations. To supplementtariff revenues, the district companiesplanto
apply a surcharge on the industrialwaste generators. The municipal fee is applied ona uniformbasis, but
the cost of treating industrialwastewater is generally higher. Therefore, the surchargewill reallocate
charges so that they better reflect the actual cost o fprovidingservice to the industrialgroup.

                 C. ProjectCompanyFinancialProjectionsandInstitutionalArrangements

9.       Financial projections have beenpreparedfor eachproject wastewater company on anannualbasis
over the 2004 -2018period. These projectionsare basedonthe requirementof each company to comply
withthe agreeduponfinancial covenantsregardingcostrecoveryanddebtservicecoverage,aswell asthe
needfor intemally generated contributions towardproject counterpartfunding. The key financial covenant
requires that eachproject company generatesannualoperatingrevenuesthat are sufficient to cover all
operating expenses, includingdepreciation, any loss on non-operating activities, plus the amount, if any, by
which debt service exceeds depreciation. This ratio of operatingrevenues to costs is expressedas the cost
recovery ratio, which, therefore, mustbe at least 1.O ineachyear. Inaddition, a debt service coverageratio
covenant will also be applied underwhich the companies' ability to incur additional debt will be conditional
on themmaintaining this ratio,atnot less than 1.3.

10.      The projections incorporatethe proposedchange inthe legal status ofthe existingmunicipal
wastewater fee to that of autility company tariff. Therefore, these tariffs are consideredto be the operating
revenueofthe project companies. Summary financial projections for eachcompany are giveninTables 5          -

SuzhouQingyuanConstructionCompanyLimited

11.      InstitutionalStructure. Suzhouhas embarkedona comprehensiveprogramofreforms for its
water andwastewater sectors basedon the following principles: (i)    integratedmanagementof water and
wastewater under a single municipalagency; (ii)   increasedcommercialization o fthe sector; and, (iii)
separationo fasset ownership from the operation o fthese assets through outsourcing. In2002,
responsibility for water andwastewater was consolidated withthe establishmento fthe SuzhouWater
Affairs Bureau (SWAB). Also in2002, the municipal government establishedthe SWIDC for the purposes
of holding all sector assets together withthose entities responsiblefor the sector operations. SWIDC is
wholly owned bythe municipalgovernmentandis under the supervision o f SWAB. SWIDC is intendedto
facilitate greater commercialization o fthe water andwastewater sectors andspecifically as a vehicle for
attracting financing into these sectors. Within SWIDC, subsidiary assetmanagementcompanieshold
sector assets while other subsidiaries are responsible for asset operations.

12.      The SQCC is a subsidiary o f SWIDC responsible for assetmanagementandproject
implementation inthe city's wastewater sector. Itwas establishedin 1999 andis presently is responsible
for the implementationandmanagementofthe first phases o fthe FwrinandLoujiang collectionand
treatmentsystems, as well as the expansiono fthese facilities under TBUEP. Operations of existing
wastewater assetsinthe central urbandistricts are undertaken bythe DFMD, anagency o fthe municipal
governmentunderthe supervision of SWAB.

13.      ReformFramework Although the basicreform framework for the Suzhouwastewatersector has
beenestablished, the implementation o fthis framework is still inits early stages. While SQCC has been
establishedas legally independententity from government, ithas beenfunctioningessentially as a
dependent govemmentproject implementationunit. Furthermore, since the initial assetsunder its
management, the firstphases o f FuxinandLoujiang systems, are still intheir findstages of construction, it
has not yet assumedresponsibility for existing Operatingassets. Withthese systems commencing
operationsshortly, SQCC needs to develop an asset managementcapability, animportant part o fwhich
will bethe managementof the outsourcing process. The TA for Institutional, Financial& Operational
Strengtheningto beprovidedunder TBUEP will support SQCC indevelopingan adequate capacity for


                                                    - 5 4 -

asset management andoutsourcing. By2005, all existingsector assets will be transferred from the
municipal government to SQCC. The operationofthese assets will be initiallyundertakenbyDFMD,
which by end 2006 will be corporatizedandbecomea subsidiary of SWIDC. However, the operation of
newassets, includingthose hdedunder the project, will be outsourcedthrough competitive bidding.

14.     To be fully successful, the institutional reforms beingimplementedinSuzhou's wastewater sector
require supporting financial reforms. The existing systemofbudgetaryallocations to fundthe sector in
Suzhouis basedon traditional institutional arrangements, inwhich governmentbureausdirectly provided
all wastewaterservices. However, with asset ownership andmanagementfunctions now beingseparated
from govemment andtransferredto SQCC, the company needsto haveits own sourceof operating
revenue. This requires a change inthe legalstatus o f the existing municipalwastewater fee to that of a
utilitycompany tariff. This changewill establishSQCCas afinanciallyviable andsustainableentity
consistentwithits independentlegalstatus. The municipal governmentplansto reformthe wastewater fee
over the project implementation periodandapply the newtariffthroughout the municipality. Therefore, in
addition to the Suzhouurbancore area inwhich SQCC operates, these reformed fundingarrangements
would also be applied the project h d e dwastewater componentinWuzhong District.

15.      Tariff Requirements. Wastewatertariffs are set on a municipalitywide basis primarilyon the
basis of the cost structure of the central city wastewater systemover which SQCC holds responsibility.
Therefore, future tariffrequirementsare estimatedspecifically on the basisofthe financial requirementso f
SQCC. This means that, unlike the district companies that will needto apply a surcharge, SQCC does not
require a supplementalrevenue source. The most recent increaseinthe municipal fee, whichbrought it to
RMB 1.15/m3, was implementedinMay2002. Thenextincreaseistentatively plannedfor 2006 and
future increasescouldrealistically be implementedevery 3 -4 years. Onthis basis, it is estimatedthat the
municipaltariffwill needto be increasedby 15percent in2006, to RMB 1.32/m3 (Table 2). The next
increase wouldthenbe about 18percent in2009, bringingthe tariff to RMB 1.56/m3. Beyond2009, the
needfor further increases is relatively limited. Basedonthe fmancialprojections for SQCC, increasesof
10percentwould beneededin2013 andthen again around2018.

16.     FinancialPerformance. Unlike the district companies, which willhave few if any operating assets
over the project implementationperiod, SQCC will needto beginto fundoperating assets as of 2004. The
companywill also haveto use its tariff revenuesto funda portion o fthe cost ongoing capital investments,
inadditionto TBUEP, over the 2004-2008 period. However, despitetheseother demandsoninternally
generatedcashflows, the financialprojections indicate that the company shouldbe able to h dalmost 40

percento f TBUEP counterpartfunding (Table 5). Most of this companycontribution, which is estimated
to total RMB45 million, would be provided in2006 with a smaller contribution in2007. The municipal
govemment would provide the remaining 60 percentof counterpartfunding, about RMI3 75 million, over
the 2005 -2007 period Withthe completion ofthe project, capital expenditures would decline but still
average almost RMB50 millionannually, virtuallyall of which would be allocatedto replacementand
expansiono f the sewer network. Tariff revenues are projected to be sufficient to enable SQCC to fund
these annual expendituresentirely from internal cash flows. The company is projectedto e m positive net

forecast period. Over the 2005 -2015 period, the cost recovery ratio is projectedto average 1.3 andabove
income andcomply withboththe costrecovery anddebt service covenant inall years over the 2004 -2015

the 1.0 minimuminall years. The debt service coverage ratio should alsoremainwell abovethe 1.3
minimum, largelybecausethe companyshouldnotrequire any additional debt after that providedunder

SuzhouWuzhongAssetManagementandAdministrationCompanyLimited

17.      InstitutionalStructure. Wuzhong District is located adjacentto the coreurbanarea of Suzhou
andhas experiencedvery rapidgrowthover the pastdecade. Muchofthis growthhasbeenconcentratedin
the Wuzhong Economic DevelopmentZone (WEDZ). However, the managemento fthe wastewater
generatedby this growthhaslagged significantly. All wastewater generatedwithin the WEDZ, most of
which is from industries, is presently untreatedexceptfor that partiallytreatedby the induskesthemselves.
Outside the WEDZ, there is only one small wastewatertreatment facility that serves part o f the urban area
of the district. No single entity has beenresponsiblefor providingwastewater services on a district-wide
basis. Inorder to provide for a more comprehensiveapproachto service delivery, the district govemment
andWEDZ establishedthe SuzhouWAMC. WAMC is responsiblefor the implementation, ownership and
operation for the TBUEP fundedwastewater componentinWuzhong. The company is to be responsible
for wastewatermanagementthroughout WEDZ, as well as through those other areas o fWuzhong District
not connectedto the Suzhoucity wastewater system, which are servedby SQCC.

18.      ReformFramework. WithWAMC onlyjust havingbeenestablished, ithasyet to assumethe
responsibilities andfunctions set out for it. Overthe immediate term, WAMC will complete its initial staff
recruitmentsanddevelop andimplement the core management, legalandfinancial systems required for the
company. Initially, the company's primaryfunctionwillbe to oversee implementation o fthe TBUEP
wastewatercomponent inWuzhong. However, the company will needto start preparing itself for the
operationo f these facilities, presentlyscheduledfor 2008. WAMC will not directly operatethese facilities,
butwill outsourcethis functionthrough competitive bidding. The TA for Institutional, Financial &
Operational Strengtheningto be incorporated into the project will support the company inthe designand
implementation o fthese outsourcing arrangementsandregulatory oversight o fthe effectivenesso fthe
operatingfmcontracted. The reform of sector fundingarrangementsby the municipal govemment will
meanthat collections ofthe wastewatertariff bythe district water supply company willberemitted directly
to WAMC, rather thanto the district financialbureau. This will then give WAMC the operating revenue
neededto initially contribute toward the capital cost o f the TBUEP component inWuzhong andthen later
to cover the cost of operating these facilities anddebt repayment.

19.      Tariff Requirements. Wastewater tariffs are set on amunicipality wide basisandare determined
primarily on the basisofrequirements inthe Suzhoucentral urbanarea. Therefore, the tariffs applied in
Wuzhong over the forecast period will be the m e as those for SQCC (Table 23. However, inaddition to
the wastewatertariff, WAMC will also apply an industrial surchargebeginningin2008 whenthe project
assets enter service. It is projected that the surchargewill needto be initially set at RMB0.65/m3.
Increasesof RMB0.1O/m3 would then needto be implemented in2011 and2015, bringingthe surchargeto

                                                      - 56 -

RMB0.851m3.

20.      Financial Performance. Theprojected financial performance of WAMC is assessed onthe basis
ofits operating scopebeingthe entire WDZ (Table 6). Those areas outsidethe WEDZ have not been
included inthe projections becausethe schedule for the company's takeover o fthese areas has not yet been
confiied. Within the WEDZ, aprivatelyinvestedWWTP, witha first phase capacity o f 15,000 m3/day,
is presently under construction and is scheduledto beginoperating in2006. The tentative planis to double
its treatment capacity by about 2011. This WWTP impacts uponWAMC intwo important ways. First,
WAMC will be responsiblefor the operationandmaintenanceofthe sewer network providingwastewater
to this facility. Second, paymentsto the owners ofthe WWTP willbe made from the collections of the
wastewater tariff. Therefore, WAMC revenues are net ofthese paymentswhile its operating expenses
includethoserelatedto the sewernetwork dischargingwaste into the private WWTP. Although the net
impact is to reduce WAMC's ability to generateproject counterpartfundingfrom tariffrevenues, it is still
anticipated to be able to meet almost40 percentofthis requirement from this source. Oftotalcounterpart
funding ofaboutRMB 86 million, RMB33 millionwouldbe generatedfromthe tariff withthe remaining
RMB53 millionprovidedbythe district government. Withoperationoftheproject facilities commencing
in2008, netincome will declinesignificantly butremainpositive over the forecastperiod. Principal
repayment onthe Bank loanwill begin in2009, placinga further demandoninternalcashflows. However,
the company's overallcashposition should actually improve somewhatbecause, with the completion o f
project construction, reducedcapital expendituresmorethan offset the increaseindebt service. The
company is projected to comply withboththe cost recovery anddebt servicecovenant ineachyear over the
forecast period. Over the initialeight years of operationso fthe project facilities, 2008 -2015, the cost
recovery ratio is projectedto average 1.2 andremains above 1.O ineachyear. The debt service coverage
ratio is projected to average about2.3 over this same period, well abovethe 1.3 minimum.

HuishanWater Treatment CompanyLimited(FIWTC)

21.      InstitutionalStructure. Huishanis a rapidly urbanizingdistrict within WuxiMunicipality that
hadbeen a county untilearly 2002. As a new district outside Wuxi's urbancore area, coverageby urban
wastewatertreatmentsystems has beenlimitedto four small facilities ownedandoperatedbythe different
towns that these systems serve. No entity has existed at either the district or municipal levelthat is
responsiblefor wastewater serviceprovisionthroughout the district. The district government beganto
assumea direct role inthe sector with its establishmento fthe HWTC inMarch2003. HWTC is
responsiblefor the implementation, ownership andoperation o fthe TI3UEP funded wastewatercomponent
inthedistrict. AlthoughHWTCispresentlyresponsibleonlyforthiscomponent,thelegaloperatingscope
of the company incorporatesthe entire district. Therefore, it is plannedthat HWTC will gradually assume
responsibility for the entire district. Suchanexpansionwould enable HWTCto achieve greater economies
of scale, which inturnwould reduceits unit cost structure andthereby moderate the company's tariff
requirements.

22.      ReformFramework Huishanhas beensomewhat aheadof the other two project districts, Xishan
andWuzhong, inestablishing its wastewatercompany. The new company hasthen progressedin
establishing a basic organizational structure andhas begunto recruit staff. HWTC's initial functions will
be limitedto those directlyrelatingto the implementation o fits TBUEP fundedcomponent. However, as
constructiono fthese facilities is completed andthey enter service, the company will then assume
responsibility for the managemento fthese assets. Direct operation andmaintenance ofthe completed
systemwill beoutsourcedto a qualifiedwastewaterfacility operator. Therefore, the company will needto
develop an adequate capacity for the design, tendering andmanagemento f outsourcing arrangements. The
TA for Institutional, Financial& Operational Strengthening to be incorporated into the project has been

                                                   - 57 -

designedto provide support indevelopingthis capacity.' One o fthe most important reforms to be
implemented is that relating to sector financing arrangements. Presently,the municipalwastewater fee is
collected andremitted to the municipal finance bureau. However, as ofthe endof2006, the legalstatus of
the wastewater fee will be changedto that of a utilitycompany tariff. Therefore, the tariff will be applied
under the legal authority ofHWTC within its servicearea. The WwriWater Supply Company will billand
collect the tariffandthen transfer collections to HWTC.

23.      Tariff Requirements. Wastewater tariffs are set on a municipality-widebasis inWuxi and are
determined primarily onthe basisof requirementsinthe central urban areao fthe municipality. Basedon
anticipated increases inthis municipal tariff, the company is also expectedto needto implement a
surchargebeginning in2008 whenthe project assets enter service (Table 3). Givenanticipated increasesin
the municipal tariff of 15percentin2006 and20 percentin2009, the COD surchargewouldneedto be set
at RMB0.50/m3 in2008. It couldthenbe maintained at this leveluntil2012, when it wouldneedto be
increasedto about RMB 0.55Im3.

24.      Financial Performance. The financial projections for HWTC have beenprepared on the basis
that the company's operating scope is limitedto the service area o fthe TBUEP funded project component (
Table 7). Although HWTC plans to assumeresponsibility for the entire district, this will occur gradually
andthe timingandphasingof this expansionplanhasyet to be confirmed This provides amore
conservativeassessmentof financial performance because itlimitsrevenue generationto the area served
under the project. Over the project implementation period, virtually all revenuefrom the wastewatertariff
canbe allocatedto project capital costs. Between2004 and2007, about RMB 35 millionwill be generated
from the wastewatertariffand allocated to project capital investments, which represents45 percent of total
counterpartfundingrequirements. With operationsbeginningin2008, revenueswill then be usedprimarily
to cover operatingcosts anddebtservicerequirements. The most critical periodfor HWTC is anticipated
to bebetween2009 and2011. The project funded assets are fully operational and, in2009, principal
repayment onthe Bank loan begins. Furthermore, anexpansion insecondarytreatment capacity is planned
for 2010 2011,which places anadditional demandon internally generatedcashflows. However, given
          -
that the tariff increases are implemented as projected, the company should be able to meet these various
funding requirements. Netincome is projectedto remainpositive andthe cashpositionofthe company will
be withinacceptable levels. The company is projectedto comply withthe costrecovery covenant ineach
year over the forecast period. Over the initial eight years of operationsofthe project facilities, 2008-

2015, the cost recovery ratio is projected to average 1.3 andremains above 1.0 ineachyear. The debt
service coverage ratio is projectedto average2.3 over this same period, well abovethe 1.3 minimum, but
mightfall slightlybelowthis minimumin2011and2012. Althoughthis would limitthe company's ability
to take on additional debt, no suchrequirementis anticipateduntilanexpansionprogramis undertaken
beginning in2016, bywhichtime the ratio isprojectedto be well above 1.3.

Xishan Anzhen WastewaterTreatmentCompanyLimited& DongtingWastewaterTreatment
Company Limited

25.      InstitutionalStructure. Xishanis similar to Huishaninthat it is a new district o fWuxi
Municipality outside the urbancore, which is undergoingrapid economic growthandurbanization,
Presently, the only existing treatment facility is the DongtingWWTP, which will be expandedunder the
project. Also like Huishan, no entity at the municipal or district levelhas beenresponsible for wastewater
serviceprovision on a district-wide basis. The district consideredto establishtwo wastewater companies,
to be initially responsible for the wastewater componentsat Dongting andM e n , respectively. This
responsibility includes project implementation, asset ownership andmanagement. The WuxiXishan
DongtmgWastewater TreatmentCompany Limitedis responsiblefor the existing Dongting treatmentand
collection system, as well as the project funded expansion. The responsibilities o f the XishanAnzhen
Wastewater Treatment Company Limitedwould have beenlimited to the Anzhenproject component,
However, inorder to provide the basisfor the rationalization of the sector inXishan, the two companies
will nowmerge. Once operationsbeginunderthe managementofthis mergedcompany, direct operating
andmaintenancefunctions will be outsourcedto aqualifiedoperator.

26.      ReformFramework. The most important reformobjective over the immediatetermis to merge
the two companiesinXishan. This would provide the basis for more effective andefficient service
delivery, not only inDongtingandM e n , butbecausethe mergedcompany will operate onadistrict-wide
basis, throughout XishanDistrict. Once merged, the new company will immediatelyassume responsibility
for the existing Dongtingfacility, as well as preparefor the operation o fthe expandedandnew facilities
that will enter service in2009. Withoperationsbeingoutsourced, the company will needto have an
adequate capacity for the design, tendering andmanagemento foutsourcing arrangements. Support in
developing this capacity will beprovidedunderthe project TA for Institutional, Financial & Operational
Strengthening. As inthe case of Huishan, sector financing arrangementswill also be reformedover the
next two years. As of the beginning of 2004, collections o fthe wastewaterfee inXishanDistrict will be
transferredto the district finance bureau. The district will thenallocate these revenuesto the project
companies. By end2006, this fee will be converted into a utilitycompany tariff anddirectly remittedto the
project companies.

27.      TariffRequirements. As notedfor Huishan, wastewatertariffs are set onamunicipality-wide
basisthroughout Wuxi and, therefore, maynotreflect the actual cost structures inofthe systemsinXishan.
Basedon anticipatedincreasesinthis municipaltariff, the mergedwastewater company responsible for
bothDongtingandM e nis expectedto also require a surcharge to fully recover its costs uable 3).
While the structure of the surchargewould be the same as that inHuishan,it is projectedthat the actual
chargelevelrequiredinXishan is higher, RMB0.80/m3 in2008 compared to RMB0.501m3 inHuishan.
This is primarilydue to mainfactors: (i) unitcostsofthe Xishansystemsarehigher; (ii) revenue
                                           the                                                 the
basefor the surcharge inXishan is somewhat smaller becausethe proportion o f totalwastewater from
industry is lower; and(iii) proportion o f customerspaying the tariffthat actually have their wastewater
                             the
treated is somewhat more limitedinHuishan, at least over the periodto 2012. However, the need for future
increasesinthe surchargeinXishan is more limited. A small increase, to RMB0.85/m3, is estimatedto be
requiredin2012, but then the surcharge could likely remainunchangedupto at least 2018.

28.      FinancialPerformance. The financial projectionshavebeenpreparedfor the mergedcompany,
referred to here as the XWTC, which will be establishedfrom the two companiesinDongting andAnzhen(
Table 8). The projections havebeenpreparedfor this combined entity as o f2004. Beforethe
project-funded assets enter servicein2009, the operating assets under the company's managementwill be
limitedto the existing Dongtingfacility. Overthis 2004-2008period, about50 percentofrevenuewould
needto be allocated to cover the operationalcostsofDonghng. Theremaining 50 percentwouldthenbe
allocated to cover about 18 percento ftotal counterpartfundingrequirementsfor the Dongtingand Anzhen
components. With operations of the project facilities beginning in2009, revenueswill thenbe used
primarilyto cover operating costs anddebt servicerequirements. This first year ofoperations, inwhichthe
principalrepayment onthe Bankloanwill alsobegin, is expectedto be the most challenging year for
XWTC intermsof itsfinancial performance. Althoughnet income isprojectedto remainpositive, the cost
recovery ratio will bejust above the covenantminimumo f 1.O. The debt servicecoverage fatio may
actually be slightlybelow the 1.3 minimumbefore increasingto an acceptable 1.5 in2010. However, there
are no plans for the company to take on any additional debt untilaround2015, by which the ratio would be
inanacceptablerange. After 2009,financial performanceisprojectedtograduallyimprovesignificantly.
m e r the initial seven years of operationso fthe project facilities, 2009 -2015, the cost recovery ratio is
projected to average 1.2, while the debt serviceratio averages 1.8 over this same period.

                                         D. Affordability Analysis

29.     An affordability analysishas beenundertakeninorder to ensurethat domestic customers,
particularlythose inthe lower income group, can afford the wastewatertariffs in Suzhou (Suzhouurban
core andWuzhong District) andWuxi (Huishan andXishan Districts). Two representativehousehold
groups are considered inthe affordability analysis: (i)the average income group; ,and, (ii) low-income
                                                                                            the
group, which is defined as the householdeaming approximately the 20th percentile of income distribution.
InbothSuzhouandWWi, incomesare conservatively projectedto increaseat anannualrealrateoffour
percentfor the averageincome householdandtwo percentfor the low-income household over the 2004 -
2010 period, which is significantly below that actually achievedover the past decade. The results o f this

entire 2003 -2010 period.
analysis, which are summarizedinTable 4, indicate that the tariffs are anticipated to be affordable over the

 30.    Affordability is assessed by comparing incomes to the total cost o f wastewater and water supply.
The water tariff is assumed to increase at the same rate as the wastewater tariff over the 2004    -2010
period. On this basis, the combined cost of water and wastewater for an average-income household is
projected to actually decline slightly, from 1.2 percentin2003 to 1.1 percent by 2010 inthe Suzhouurban
core and from 1.2 percent to 1.O percent over this same period inWuzhong. For a low-income household,
the proportion of income required to pay for water and wastewater is projected to increase only very
marginally, from 1.8 percentin2003 to 1.9 percentby 2010 inSuzhou, andremainconstant at 1.7 percent
inWuzhong. Thecombinedcostof waterandwastewaterfor anaverage-incomehouseholdinHuishanand
Xishan is projected to be 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent respectively in both 2003 and 2010. For the
low-income household inHuishan,this cost is projected to increase slightly from 1.3 percent in2003 to 1.4
percent in2010. InXishan, the increase between these same years for the low-income group is from 1.4
percent to 1.6 percent. Inall cases, the combined cost o f water and wastewater services is well within the
generally accepted guideline that the cost of water supply and sanitation should not exceed 5 percent of
householdincome.

SummaryProjectDescription

4.       The objectives of the proposedTai BasinUrbanEnvironment Project are to: (i) the improve
qualityoftheurbanenvironment through improvedwastewaterandwater quality managementinthekey
municipalities o fWuxi and Suzhouandmore widely inthe Tai Basin, and(ii)      facilitate sustainableurban
economic growth andsocial developmentin'the region. The project will therefore support Jiangsu Province
inimplementingpriority long-term urbanenvironmental servicesto alleviate environmental degradationof
its water resources, including through physical investments andinstitutionalandfinancial reforms, that
would provide aviable andsustainablebasis for small wastewater systems inrapidlydeveloping areas,

    A. Wuxi Municipality

a        Wuli Lake Sub-project
a        WWTPs andnetworks

    B.SuzhouMunicipality

6.       The estimated cost of the proposedproject is $174.46 millionexcluding interest during
construction, commitment fees andfront-end fees andthe proposedBankLoanamount is $60.69 million
(excluding fiont endfee).

CountryIssues

7.       To date, no country financial accountability assessment(CFAA) has beenundertaken for China.
The Bankhasrelied on a similar exercisecarried out bythe Asian Development Bank in2000 for reference
anda direct dialogue withthe governmentofChinainrespectofthe CFkA exercisehasbeeninitiated and
is currently underway.

8.       Bankexperienceandsubstantialachievementinthe areas ofpublic expenditures, accountingand
auditing withChinaprojects for the pastfew years is notable. However, further improvement is expected
inthe nextfewyears. As the economicreformprogramfurtherunfolds, the governmento fChinahascome
torealizethe importance ofestablishingandmaintaining anefficient andeffective marketmechanismto
emure transparency andaccountability, andminimize potentialfraud or conuption.

9.       Due to rather unique arrangementsby the government o fChina, fimding (inparticular Bank loan)
of Bankprojects is controlled and monitoredby MOF andits extension, i.e. finance bureaus at provincial,
municipaVprefecture anddistrictkounty levels. However, project activities are usually carried out by
implementingagenciesofa specific industryor sector dueto the levelandcomplexity ofexpertiseinvolved.
The abovearrangementusually requires more and closer coordination of the project, as the multi-level
managementofthe fundingandimplementationmechanismsometimesworks to the detriment of smooth
project implementation.

7.        SocioeconomicSituation. The Basinincludes Metropolitan Shanghai; the four municipalitiesof
Suzhou, Wuxi, ChangzhouandZhenjianginJiangsuProvince; andthe three municipalitiesof Hangzhou,
JiaxingandHuzhouinZhejiangProvince. The Basincovers only 0.4percentoftotalnationallandarea,
andthe populationamountingto 36.8 million at the endof 2000 including18.6 million(51 percent) urban,
represented2.9 percent ofthe nationalpopulation. The populationdensityofthe area, at 978 personskm2,
is seven times higher thanthe nationalaverage and amongst the highestinChinaas is the urbanizationrate.

8.        GDP inthe Bashwas estimated at RMB 890 billion, accountingfor 10.8 percent of nationalGDP
in2000. Suzhou(RMB 135.864billion) andWuxi (RMB 113.802 billion) together accountedfor almost
three quarters ofthe GDP the area ofthe BasinwithinJiangsuProvince. Among the sectors, agricultural
output was RMB21.104 billion(6.1 percent), industry was RMB 195.012 billion(56.5 percent) and
service sector was RMB 129.052 billion (37.4 percent).

9.        CultivatedlandinLake Tai Basinis 21.45 millionmu(1`43 millionha), accountingfor 43 percent
of landarea inthe Basinand 1.8 percentofnationalcultivated land. The maincrops includepaddyrice,
wheat, silk, tea, bamboo, fruits, etc.

10.       CurrentWater Oualitv. PollutionsourcesofsouthernJiangsuProvincewithinthe Basininclude
i n d h a l , municipal/domestic, agriculturalandtraffic sources, ofwhich industrial pollution is the most
serious. Accordingto municipal EPBstatistics for 2000, COD discharge from industrial wastewater in

Suzhou city andWuxi city totaled 151,200 tla. Dischargesofuntreateddomestic wastewater is increasing
rapidly due to increasing urbanizationandbecause ofthe low presentcapacity for collection andtreatment
of municipal wastewater inthe majorcities. Accordingto 2000 statistics, wastewater dischargedfrom
domestic sources inSuzhouandWuxi was 304.03 milliontons per year (tpy), total CODwas 136,700 tpy.
Eutrophicationis widespreadinLake Tai, as well as inthe perimeterlakes.

(a)      Water quality of main watercourses in Wuxi City: Accordingto monitoring data source for
2001-2003, NH3-Nconcentrationinfour major rivers inWuxi city exceededthe specifiedstandard,
resultingina classificationofworse thanClassV (the lowestwater quality classificationinChina). Other
items, e.g., COD, DO andTP exceededClass IVstandards.

(b)      Water quality of main watercoursesin Suzhou City: Accordingto monitoring data of 2002,
NH3-NconcentrationineightmainriversinSuzhouseverelyexceededClassV standard. Remaining
items, such as COD, DO, TP, exceededthe prescribedstandard, apart from oil content. The riverkanal
systeminthe city center andthe ShangtangRiver is mostseverelypolluted,mainly byNH3-N, TP, DO,
COD, andbiological oxygendemand(BOD).

(c)      Water quality of the Grand Canal (Beijing-Hangzhou Canal): basedon 2001-2002 monitoring
data, the water quality inthe Suzhousectionofthe GrandCanalcanmeet its designatedClass IVwater
quality standards(suitable for navigation,irrigation, and landscaping)exceptfor NH3-NandTP.
However, monitoringresults for the Wuxi sectionof the GrandCanal have shownthat many pollutant
parameters (e.g. NH3-N,TP, DO, COD) exceedClass IVstandard, indicating thatpollutionfrom the
Wuxi andChangzhouurbanareas contributesubstantiallyto the badwater quality of the GrandCanal.

11.      FutureWater OualitvObiectives. Since 1996,the State Councilhas incorporatedLakeTaiinto
the major nationalpriority water pollution control program. Governments at all levels inJiangsuProvince
have worked out animplementationplan (Tenth Five-YearPlan2001-2005). The planaims at protecting
the water quality of the Lake Meiliang andWuli Lake, both of which are part of the Lake Tai system,
constructinga series of city/townshipwbtewater treatment systemsthat includeonly limitedsewer
networks, dredgingriver coursesandlakes, andimplementingwater conservation programs. Key
objectivesare to improvewater quality inthe area ofmaindrinking water sources inthe Lake andmain
connectingrivers/canalsto Class111(COD content) andto reduceTP concentrationbelow the level of
2000. Furthermore, the water quality of the rivernetwork inSuzhoucity center shouldmeetthe
requirementfor ascenic area.

PotentialEnvironmentalImpactsandtheir MitigationMeasures

12.     WastewaterTreatment. The project includesconstructionofsix WWTPs: the Wuzhong,
Loujiang, andFuxinWWTP inthe Suzhou area; andthe Huishan, Dongting, andM e nWWTP inthe
Wuxi area. For year 2010, the expectedreduction ofpollutant dischargesto surface waters from the six
WWTPs are 122tons per day (tpd) of CODCr, 62 tpd of BODS/day, 6 tpd O fNH3-N, 80 tpdof SS, and
0.6 tpdof TP. These reductionsWill improve the quality of the receivingsurface waters inthe Suzhouand

3.1 percent, Class V water will decreaseto 20.4 percent,ClassIVwaters will increaseto 64.9percent, and
ClassIIIwaters will increase to 11.2 percent(withno change inClass I1waters). Importantelements of
the programare underwayor plannedwith local financing for rehabilitationof the sewer networksin
Changzhou, SuzhouandWuxi. Other elements require inter-institutionalcooperationandamore
cost-effective investmentplanandsector managementarrangements.

13.      WuzhonpWWTP. The WuzhongWWTPwill be locatedinanindustrialzone, surroundedby
factories onthree sides andthe GrandCanalon one side. This WWTP will serve anarea of 15.26 lan2 in
Suzttouthrough a 43 kmsewer networkto treat wastewaters from domestic andindustrialsources (there
are 10industries). The Bank will finance both the WWTP andthe sewer network.

River CourseDredgingandRehabilitation:

61.     This activity involves sediment dredging in65.7 kmofwaterways inthe central urbanarea o f
Suzhouas flood protection andwater quality improvement measures. Besidesincreasing the water flow
(about doubling) at Jiuqugang(inXujiang PanxiDistrict), this component improves the quality ofthe
waterways inSuzhouinterms of reduction o fthe CODMnconcentrationsby 0.16-0.84 mgllor 2.6-12.3
percent (see Table 2). CODMn concentrationsina few waterways not dredgedare expectedto increase.
Dredging complementsthe locally-financed activities that include widening of some ofthese canal sections
anddiversion ofwater from the XitangRiver to SuzhouCity's waterways. The overall cityplanrequires a
minimumriverlcanalwidthof 6 minancienturbanareas, 8 minother existing urbanandsuburbanareas,
and 15minnewly builturbanareas. Withthe implementation ofthese additional measures, the reductions
in CODMnconcentrationsinSuzhou's waterways are expectedto be as highas 2.9 mgA or upto 25.3
percent (Table 2).

62.     The dredgedsectionso f Suzhou's waterways will have a sedimentthickness o f at least 0.6 meter.
The volume o fthe dredgedsediments is estimatedto be 1.287 millionm3. Based on site characteristics
(narrow canalswith limitedwork space) mechanical dredgingwitha grab dredger o f 0.3-0.5 m3 will be
used.

63.     Suzhou's waterways to be dredgedare seriously polluted, with nobenthos or plants. During
dredging, the turbidityinwater will increaseby2 to 7 times thanthe operation period. However, this
increasewill be limitedto some local areas for a short periodandthe adverseimpact will disappearwith
the completion o f dredging.

64.     Sedimentsfrom SuzhouCanalshave beentestedfor hazardousmaterials andfound to be within
standards prescribedby applicable Chineseregulations    - mostindicators were low or undetectable and, in
                                                                                                  -
accordancewith applicable Chineseregulations, will be disposedat anunusedsite at Sanjiaozhui (located
north of the Shanghai-Nanjing expresswayand east ofthe Shinziyang River). This site, whichis 3.8 km
long and 150kmwide, 3 mdepth, and 1.5 melevation, is zoned as greenareainSuzhou's masterplan.
Evenso, further testingfor hazardousmaterialsisto beundertakenofsedimentsinthe Xiaomiduqiao
River sectionprior to dredgingto determine if other disposalarrangements,for example atpurpose
builtcells atthe municipallandfiu,isrequired.

 65.    The transportationmethodsconsideredfor dredgedsedimentsto the sludge application site
included bargetransportation andlandtransportation. Based on evaluation o fimpacts, barge
transportationwas selected. Barge transportation will be conductedinspecified routes (mostly
concentratedinYuanhetangandDalonggang) insuch a manner notto adversely affect the navigation
traffic.

66.     Accordingly, sediments will be dewateredon site prior to loading inbargesfor transportation for a
distanceof about 5- 19kmaccording to predeteminedroutes.

67.     There are residential areas at distances rangingfrom 20-120 mfrom the dredging areas. These
sensitive receptorswill be protectedfrom noise emissions throughsuchmitigatory measures as prohibition
of construction work at nights, setting upnoise barriers, andarrangemento ftransportation routes away
from sensitiveareas. Inaddition, cargo ships will not be allowedat any time andpleasureboatswill not be

will be covered andtheir speedwill be limitedto 40 kmlh,andmudon their wheels will be cleanedoff.

PollutedWater Controlin Suzhou:

68.      This component involves construction of a shiplock andtwo sluice gates onXujiang River, anda
shiplock on the ShangtangRiver to prevent the upstreampoor qualitywater ofthe GrandCanal flowing
into the urbanwaterways of Suzhou. Inaddition, these measuresreducethe risk of flooding inSuzhou.
The sites o f these barriers are locatedat the intersection o f GrandCanal with XujiangRiver, andthe
boundary o f the central urbandistrict of Suzhouandits new district.

69.      XujiangRiverisdivided into twobranches(north andsouth) at itsintersection with GrandCanal.
Two sitingaltematives (two separate gates, and a combined gate) were evaluatedusing the following
criteria: (i)geological conditions o fthe site; (ii) o fpollutioncontrol from GrandCanal; (iii)
                                                    effect                                           impact
onhistoric relics near the project sit; (iv) impact onnavigationsafety; (v) construction conditions; and(vi)
costs (land acquisition, excavation, resettlement). Basedonthis evaluation, two separate gates, eachon a
branchof the Xujiang River, were selected.

70.      Two altemative sites were consideredfor the shiplock onthe ShangtangRiver. The evaluation
criteria consistedof: (i) size of the lock system; (ii) pollution andflood control from GrandCanal; (iii)
impact onhistoric relics near the project site; (iv) impact onnavigation safety; (v) complexity ofproject
management; and(Vi) construction conditions. Basedonthis evaluation, the sitebetweenthe Laifeng
Bridge andJiangfeng Bridge was selected.

71.      Withthe closingofthe XujiangRiverwith sluice gates andthe ShangtangRiver with a shiplock,
the water quality improvements -intenns o freductions o f CODMn concentrations-are estimatedto be
0.95 mgA at the GuangjiBridge over ShangtangRiver, 0.05 mgA at the Tairang Bridge over the Xujiang
River, and 0.38 mg.4 and0.33 mg/l at the westemandsouthern lines o fthe Waicheng Riverunderthe
influence of improvedwater quality of the ShangtangandXujiang Rivers.

72.      The construction work at the Xujiang Riversites will generate about 51,000 m3 o f sediments and
 10,000 m3 o fsoils, andthe ShangtangRiver site will generateabout 64,000 m3 o f sediments and 13,000
m3 of soils that require disposal. Ifthe sedimentsare found to benon-hazardous, then these sediments and
excavatedsoils will be landdisposed. Fivealternative sites were considered for the disposal of sludge
generated from gate construction inSuzhou. These alternatives includedthe site o f (i)    the abandonedfish
pondat Sanjiaozuiby Shiziyang River; (ii) abandonedbrewery site; (iii) Chemical Co. Ltd.(the
                                              an                              Anli
industryis to berelocated); (iv) anabandonedpapermill(Huasheng PaperMill); (v) anabandonedfish
pond andfarmlandat Xuelang; and(vi) a vacant landat the intersection o f XihuanRoadandShuangqiao
Road. The evaluation factors includedthe current landuse andthe sensitivereceptors inthe area. The
evaluation results indicate that sedimentsandsoils from the XujiangRiver sites could be piledat the vacant
land(at the intersectionof XihuanRoadandShuangqiaoRoad) for sale, andthe sedimentsandsoils from
the ShangtangRiver site couldbe filled into the abandonedfishpondat Sanjiaozui by Shiziyang River and
usedfor plantation.

73.      There are residential areas at distancesrangingfrom 10-70 mfrom the dredging areas. These
sensitivereceptors will be protectedfrom noise emissions through such mitigatory measures as no
constructionat night, use o fequipment withlow noise, use o fvehicles withnoise control, andsetting up of

                                                      - 111-

  construction barriers. Vehicles will be coveredandtheir speedwill be limitedto 40 kmlh,andmudon their
  wheels will be cleanedoff.

  74.      This component requirespermanentlandacquisition of 23.9 muandtemporary landoccupancy of
  49.1 mu, and relocationo fresidentialandfactory housestotaling6,602 m2 andbuildingo f 1,953 m2.
  Vegetation along the riverbanks include willow, paulownia, andothertrees plantedbyman. Although
  some tress will be destroyedby construction, the impacts will be minor. Mer completion of construction,
  vegetation willbe restored.

  WuliLake Restoration:

  75.      The locally-financed sub-componentsfor Wuli Lake restorationinclude: (i)     pollutedwater control
  andwater levelregulation; (ii) embankmentrehabilitation; and(iii)  ecological restoration. These
. subcomponents willcomplementthelocally-fimded activities thatincludedredgingof sedimentsinthe
  Lake, restoration of fish ponds, andwater diversion.

  76.      Before control of the Wuli Lake water entrances, wastewatersinthe surrounding areas entering the
  Lakefreely deterioratedits quality. Withthe implementation of the water levelregulation sub-component,
  the meanwater level inthe Wuli Lake will increase from 3.06 mto 3.30 myandthe wastewaterquantity
  entering the Lake is expectedto bereducedby 60 percent, withreductions inpollutant loadings inthe
  amounts of 445 tpy for CODCr, 51.4tpy for totalnitrogen, and4.9 tpy for total phosphorus. However,
  water quality insome of the waterways inthe surrounding areas ofWuli Lake will deteriorate. For
  example, with the construction of gates at Xiaoxuabngang, Ludianqiaobvang, andLixiRiver, the mean
  value o f CODMnis expectedto increaseby approximately 0.1-0.6 mgA, butis not expectedto change
  significantly inother waterivays further away fromthe Lake.

  77.      Withthe implementationof the integratedrehabilitation project, the reductions inpollutant
  concentrationso fWuli Lake will be 35.3 percent for CODMnto reach 6.6 mgA, 33.8 percent for total
  phosphorusto reach 0.11mgA, and 18.5 percent for totalnitrogento reach4.57 mg/l. As such, the Lake
  will reachClass IVfor CODMnandtotal phopphorus, andClassV for totalnitrogen. Rehabilitation ofthe
  Wuxi City sewernetwork will fiutfier improve onthis as overall wastewatercaptureincreases.

  78.      Polluted water control and water levelregulation. Under this sub-component, gates will be
  builtonthe rivers that connectWuli Lake withthe innerrivernetworko fthe urbanareao fWuxi. In
  addition, a PS is beingbuiltwith local fundingto artificially control the water level o fthe Wuli Lake, the
  directionof water flow inthe Lake area and the quality o fwater entering the Lake.

  79.      Embankment rehabilitation. Underthis sub-component, 19.4 kmo f shoreline o f the total of 29.3
  kmshorelinearoundthe WuliLakewillberehabilitated as apublic greenbeltfor tourism andrecreation. It
  will helpreducesoil erosion andimprovethe Lakewater clarity. As no endangeredflora or fauna has been
  recently identifiedinthe lakeshoreconstruction area, the embankmentrehabilitation sub-componentwill not
  have a negativeimpact onthe ecological environment around the Lake. Inaddition, along with this
  activity, vegetationcoverageof the belt along the shore will increase, improving the ecological conditions
  over the current status.

  80.      Ecological restoration. Under this sub-component, plantation will be carried out ina small pilot
  area, followed bythe introduction o f benthosandfishes. Emergingaquatic plants such as cattail andreed
  will beplantedinzoneswithwater depth lessthanonemeter; andtapeglass, black algae, andwaterweed
  will be plantedinzones withwater depthgreater thanone meter. The pilot will complement researchunder

EA Suggestions

81.      Two suggestionsare made at the conclusionof the EA Report: (i)     implementation ofthe Wuli
Lake ecological restoration sub-component as apilot activity (insteadof an activity for full-scale
implementation); and(2) the implementation of industrial pollutionpreventionmeasures (inparticular,
water recycle and reuse at industrial facilities) as a means to reducecosts associatedwithwastewater
treatmentandsludge management. The project designresponds to boththese suggestionsby scalingthe
ecological restoration component inWuli Lake to apilot activity andby incorporating industries that will
discharge into project-financed WWTPs inJiangsuProvince'sCleanedProduction Program.

PublicConsultationandInformationDisclosure

82.      A social survey of the public inthe project areawas conductedto findout about their demandsand
concerns. The following methodologieswere used:

0   First stagepublic consultations. Priorandduringpreparationofthe EAReport(period between
    October 2002 andAugust 2003), the EA teamheldmeetingswiththe potentially affectedpeople to
    discuss the EA TOR, including information about the project components and activities involved,
    potential environmental impacts, mitigatorymeasures, andthe implementation schedule. Informal
    discussionsandon-site visits were held, andquestionnaireswere distributedto understandthe public
    attitude andneeds onthe project's environmental aspects. The interviewees were from different sexes,
    age groups, culture levels, andfamily structures. The majority were supportive o f project activities.
    Concernswere expressed aboutunpleasantodors from WWTps, greater noise anddust levels andas
    well as traffic. Some suggestedshorter construction periods to reduce adverseimpacts. Regardingthe
    shiplock at the Shangbng River, the HangshangTemple was emphasizedand the shiplock was re-sited.
    Agricultural use of the WWTP sludge was viewed not feasibleby affectedpeople for the Wuzhong and
    Dongting WWTPs.

ResettlementPlanning

86.      JiangsuProvincial PMO together with PMOSo f Wuxi and Suzhou Municipalities are responsible
for the resettlementplanningof the proposedproject, andhave organized separate teams to carry out the
assignmentinWuxiandSuzhourespectively. Resettlementplanningincludes detailed census of affected
people, inventory of impacts and socioeconomic surveys. These resettlementplanningactivities provide a
detailed record o fproject adverse impacts, including land, house, business, institutions, the numbero f
people affected. Socioeconomic surveys were conducted throughquestionnaires, interviews andfocus
group discussionsas part ofthe resettlementplanningprocess. Two resettlement actionplans(RAPS)and
one resettlementpolicy framework were developed, andtwo retroactive review reports were prepared.

88.      The RAP was preparedinline withrelevant Chinese laws, regulations andWorld BankOP 4.12 on
Involuntary Resettlement. The followingbasic principles were adoptedfor resetttementplanning:

0        Compensationwill be paidat replacement cost without depreciation
0        Landcompensationwill bepaidbefore acquisition
0        House compensationwill be paidbefore construction o fthe new house
0        Compensationrates must be finalized through consultation
e        Lack o flegaltitle will not bar anaffectedperson fromhis or her resettlement entitlements
0        The objective ofresettlementis to enable the affectedpersonsimprove or at leastrestore their

    livingstandard

RehabilitationStrategyandMeasures

89.      The proposedproject will require acquisition offarmland. For farmers who will lose farmland, the
livelihoodrehabilitationstrategy follows the traditional Chinese approach, which is landandagriculture
based, anddepends onvillage collectives for livelihoodrestoration. All affected farmers will be allocated
farmlandwithinthe village andthe landcompensationfundwill bepaidto the village andusedcollectively
inthevillages for agriculture andsideline development.

90.      About 774 peoplein.176 householdswill lose their residences. The affected householdsconsistof
bothurban andrural residents. Differentrelocation methods are applied for rural- andurban-affected
householdsbasedonextensiveconsultationswith the affectedpopulation. For relocating urbanresidents,
the project has plannedto offer three options: (i)cashcompensation; (ii) replacement housing; or (iii)
provisionof a cheaphousefor rent. Urbanresidentscouldchooseto findandbuytheir ownreplacement
housingwith the cash compensation. Forthose who do not want to fmdandbuytheir ownreplacement
housing, the project will provide either ownership of areplacementhousingunit ingovemment-built
apartmentsor a cheaphousefor rent. For relocating ruralresidents, the project will provide compensation
at replacement cost withno depreciation.

91.      About 16enterpriseswill be affected. Compensationfor businessloss hasbeenprovidedfor inthe
RAPS.A few governmentagencieswillrequire relocationandnew sites have beenplannedfor them. The
project will also impact some public infrastructure. Compensationbasedonreplacement value will be paid
to the relevant government agencies or localgovernmentsto restorethe affectedinfrastructureandservices.

ManagementOrganization

92.      A multi-level organization hasbeenestablishedfor the implementationo fthe RAPs. An
independentmonitorhas beenselectedfor resettlementimplementation. Details o f staffingandtheir
responsibilities are providedinthe RAPS.

PublicConsultationAndParticipation

93.      Public consultation andparticipationhasplayeda key role informulating the RAPs. The affected
residents, businesspeople anddistrict governmentsparticipatedinthe census, inventory andformulationof
the livelihoodrehabilitation strategy, measures andrelocation sites. Their feedback has been incorporated
intheRAPs. TheRAPcontainsalistofmajorconsultationsessions.

94.      Public consultation andparticipationwill continue inthe RAP implementation. Project
informationwill beprovidedto the affectedpeople through TV, radio broadcast, newspapers, bulletins and
posters. The RAP willbe summarized into a resettlementinformation booklet (RIB) anddistributed to
every affectedhousehold.

GrievanceRedressMechanism

95.      A mechanismhasbeendesignedfor grievanceredressundereachofthe project components. All
grievancescanbe filed inboth written andverbal forms. The redresschannel lies withinthe project
management andgovernment systems. Recording requirementsandtimeframe have been establishedfor
grievanceresolution. This mechanism will be disclosed as part of the RIB.

ResettlementImplementationMonitoring

96.     Internal andexternalmonitoring havebeendesignedas part ofproject resettlementmanagement.
The project resettlement offices will cany out internalmonitoring o fresettlementimplementation. The
monitoringprocedures, content, staffing, responsibility, timeframe andreporting have beendetailed inthe
RAPS.An external monitorhasbeenselectedfor independentmonitoring ofRAPimplementation.
Independentmonitoring will cover physical progressof RAP implementation, compensationpayment,
allocation o fresidential sites, farmland allocation, andrestorationof infrastructure. The independent
monitor will also review the public consultationprocess, operation o f the resettlementproject offices,
grievance redressmechanismsandrestorationof livelihood o f affected farmers. Independentmonitoring
willbeconductedonce ayearduringthe projectimplementation period.

CompensationAnd ResettlementBudget

97.     The RAPs contain compensationratesfor various impacts, Landcompensationrates include land
compensation andresettlementsubsidy. Compensationrates for structures are calculated for replacement
costs. The affectedinfrastructure will be compensatedfor reconstruction and the compensationbudget will
befinalizedthroughnegotiation withthe owning govemmentagencies.

98.     The RAPscontain a detailedresettlementbudgetthat covers all basic resettlement costs,
managementcosts, contingencies, survey, designandmonitoringcosts. The basic resettlementcost
includes compensation for land, house, other structures, standing crops andtrees, business profitloss,
reconstruction of affected infrastructure andrelocation subsidies. Management cost is includedinthe
budget as well. The total resettlementbudgetis estimatedat RME3202 million, equivalent to 24.7 million
US$ at an exchangerate o f RMB 8.27 =US$1. Resettlementcosts will be financed from counterpart
funds. Disbursement proceduresandmonitoringmechanismsare designedanddocumentedinthe RAP.


Other EnvironmentalManagementAspects
A. Cleaner Productionfor Industry

99.      Implementation of a CP program for pollutionreductionbegan inJiangsuProvince as apilot
program in 1997after the JiangsuProvincialGovernment issued a circular entitled4 * O p i n ion   ~ ~
ImplementingCP Audits." InWuxiandSuzhouMunicipalities, the CPprogramimplementation hasso far
progressedthrough two stages: a pilot (shi dim) stage from 1997to 2001andimplementation stage from
2002 to 2003. Since the enactment o fthe national CP law in2002, CP has been acceleratedinWuxi and
Suzhou.

100.    Mostrecently, inSeptember2003, the JiangsuProvincialGovernment issueda circular entitled
"Circular Concerning the Issuanceo f the Planfor Implementationo fCleaner Production inJiangsu
Province duringthe FinalThree Years o fthe TenthFive-Year Plan. This circular has the followingthree
mainrequirements:

    0   Bythe endof 2004, all enterprisesinthe following categoriesmustcomplete CP audits: (a) All
        mainpolluting enterprisesinthe dyeing, metallurgy, chemical, power production, building
        materials, light industryetc., sectorswithinthe Lake Tai Basinandinall areas of the Province; (b)
        all enterprisesinthe province that do not comply with discharge standards; and(c) some primq



                                                      -117-

         andtertiary enterprises.

   0    Bythe endof 2005, allenterprisesinthe following categoriesmustcomplete CP audits: (a) all
        polluting enterprises inthe Lake Tai Basinandall other mainpollutingenterprises inthe province;
         (b) all enterprisesintheprovince that do not complywithdischargestandarb, (c) all enterprises
        that use or dischargetoxic materials; andd) some primary andtertiary enterprises.

   0     All new, expandingor changingenterprisesshall conductCP auditsandcommenceimplementation
         duringconstruction acceptance.

101.     The followingtable summarizes the number o f enterprisesthat have participated inSuzhouand
Wuxi's CP program since its inception in 1997:



    Year           1997         1998         1999          2000          2001          2002        2003
   WUXi              4           10            8              6            10           35          60
  Suzhou             2              2          3              5               5         42          65

102.     As aresult of the issuanceofthe new circular inSeptember2003, the Wuxi andSuzhouMunicipal
authorities reportthat the implementation o fthe CP p r o g r e is expectedto acceleratewithinthe nextfew
years. For example, SuzhouEconomic andTrade Commission (ETC) reported that it is expectedthat more
than90 enterpriseswill participate in2004, anincreaseof40 percentover 2003. According to Wuxi's
plan, over 300 enterprisesandinstitutions insectorsof chemical, metallurgical, dyeing andtextile,
mechanical, pharmaceutical, etc., will have completed CP activities by2005.

103.     The investmentsmade inthe CP programare significant, as are the environmental achievements.
For example, inSuzhouMunicipality, duringthe pilot years ofthe program (1997-2001), more than 230
million RMBwas investedbyenterprisesinCP measures. The total estimatedbenefits of the program
were areduction inwastewater dischargeof 9.5 milliontons per annum (tla), a reduction inwater use o f
7.24 milliontla andaneconomic benefito fRMB 136million.

104.     Since2000, the municipal economic andtrade commissionshavebecome the leadauthorities for
implementation o fthe CP program, withEPBs providing technical support.

105.     Withrespectto the largestenterprisesdischargingto the municipalWWTPs to be constructed
underthe project, the SuzhouandWuxiauthorities reportedthat many ofthese enterpriseshave already
participated inthe CP program. For example, all five of the largest industrialwastewater dischargers to
the FuxinWWTP (see annex to the project EA), have participated inthe Suzhou CP program between
2001 and2003. Similarly, manyo fthe largest enterprisesthat will dischargeto the HuishanandDongting
WWTPs inWwci havealreadyparticipated inthe program. Forexample, the single largest wastewater
discharger, the Wuxi XianjiangChemicalIndustryCo. Ltd. (discharging to the DongtingWWTP)
participated inthe CP program in2003.

106.     The Wuxi and SuzhouEPBs implemented a system o fpublic disclosure to complement their CP
programs. These EPBspublished the environmental performance o fall the enterprisesundertheir
supervision incategoriesof "black, red, yellow, blue andgreen" twice a year through the media including
newspaperandtelevision.

B. AmbientEnvironmentalMonitoring

107.     The JiangsuProvincial Governmenthas made significant investmentsinenvironmental monitoring
inrecentyears. A particular focusofthe authoritiesis environmental monitoringintheLakeTaiBasin.

108.     Water qualitymonitoringinJiangsuProvince is the responsibility o fthe provincialandlower level
EPBs. There are 90 rivermonitoring stationsand20 lake monitoring stations inthe Lake Tai Basin
mannedby municipalEPBs butunder the direction ofthe ProvincialEPB. The river monitoring stations
are located on key tributaries o fLake Tai, andonreaches o f rivers that cross administrative boundaries
(e.g. from municipality to municipality). Eachof these stationsmonitors 12 mainwater pollution
parametersonce per month, as required bynational laws, andthe results are reported to the Provincial
EPB.

109.     The JiangsuProvincialEPB provides environmentaI monitoring data to key organizations with
responsibility for Lake Tai, includingthe TBA.

110.     Institutionalstrengthening: The JiangsuProvincial EPBhas instigated a significant programof
institutional strengtheningfor environmental monitoring during 2003. This includedthe establishment,
with ProvincialGovernment approval, o fthe "Jiangsu ProvincialEnvironmental MonitoringCoordination
Group" underthe leadership o fthe Provincial EPB. The members o fthis CoordinationGroup comprisethe
Provincial EPB, ProvincialMonitoring Station, municipal monitoring stations, district andcounty
monitoring stations, andkey enterprises. The objectives o f this group are to provide coordination and
training for all certifiedenvironmental monitoring units(including private andpublic).

111.     JiangsuProvincialGovernment hasimplementeda program whereby large, well-equipped
enterprisescan apply for certification to conduct environmental monitoring. M e r certification, these
enterprisescanprovide fee-for-service monitoringservices for other enterprises. The certified enterprises
participate inthe Coordination Group's activities.

 112.    Hardware andsoftware improvements: Duringthe recent few years, the JiangsuProvincial
Governmenthas investedRMB 173 million inits environmental monitoringnetwork. This has included the
establishment o fnine automatic water quality monitoring stationsinkey locations withinthe Lake Tai
Basin(three already commissioned, six under final installation). Inaddition, laboratories have been
upgraded, and a new computer system for the collectiono f data hasbeenbrought online. The Jiangsu
ProvincialEPB reports that the investmentsmade so far are adequate to meet its needs at this time.

 113.    Inadditionto these localinvestments, aTA assistanceof$200,000 was providedbyUSTDA (US
Trade Development Agency) in2003 (primarilyfor international consultancy services) duringthe initial
provisionofthe automatic monitoring system.


automatic monitoring stations, increaseshthe numberof parametersthat canbe monitoredat all stations,
 114.    Longer-term plansfor environmental monitoring improvement includethe establishmento f 21 more

andthe introduction of"ecological monitoring" usingremote sensing.

 115.    Inadditiontomonitoringbythe EPBsinthe province, water resourcemonitoringisconductedby
the water resourcesbureaus. The water resourcebureaus maintain a system o fmonitoring stations that
primarilycarry out monitoring offlow andflooding, inadditionto water extractions. This systemis
separate fromthe EPB water qality monitoring system.

C. EnvironmentalPlanning

116.     Recognition o fthe needfor urgentactionto protect the healthandeconomic well-being of
communities relying on the Lake Tai Basinledthe State Council to establishthe Lake Tai BasinWater
ResourceProtection Leading Group in 1996andamulti-stage program with the goal o fresolving the
region's water pollutionproblemsby2010. However, to date, implementationo fthe Government's
program inthe provinces, municipalities anddistricts within the Basinis behindschedule andthe
program's interim pollutioncontrol targets have not beenmet.

117.     The first stage o fthe Government's pollution control program (1996 -2000) for the Lake Tai
Basin focused on reducing bothindustrialanddomestic wastewater discharges. IndustrialPollution
Control ActionPlans were developedandimplemented by local governments. Progresswas madetowards
bringingkeypolluting enterprises, particularly those withincore city areas, into compliance with
environmental regulations. However, at the endofthe program's implementation period, the heavily
industrializingdistricts andcounties surroundingthe core cities withinthe Basinwere still not in
compliance withthe targets. Inaddition, progresswas slow on the collectionandtreatment o fdomestic
sewage.

118.     The secondstage of the Government's strategywas articulated inthe Tenth Five-Year Action Plan
for Lake Tai Pollution Control (2001-2005). This strategyplaces highprioriw on: (a) improving
wastewatermanagement, particularly collection andtreatment of domestic sewage; (b) improving water
qualitybyreducingTP dischargesinto heavilypollutedwater bodiessuchas MeiliangandWuliLakes in
WwriMunicipality andbytransferring higher quality water from the Yangtze Riverto the lake andcanal
system to increasecirculation; and(c) strengtheninglocal capacity for water environment monitoring and
management.

119.     Inrecentyears, theJiangsuProvincialEPBhas continuedto preparesmallerplans for individual
priority areas withinthe Lake Tai Basin. Intotalnine plans are to be developed, some o fwhich are already
issued, or underpreparation. For example, the "Pollution Control Plan inthe West BankArea o fWangYu
River" was issuedin2002 by the JiangsuProvincialGovernment. This plan lists 101industrialenterprises
and40 large-scaleagricultural farms locatedonthe WangYuRiver andfour maintributaries (Xibei Canal,
Zhangjiagang River, Xin-xinTang, and, BodugangRiver) to be subjectedto point source pollution control
measures.

120.     Inthe short-term (before the endof2OO5), theJiangsuEPBwill fulfill thenational planning
requirementsbyreportingonprogress duringthe lothFive-Year Plananddevelop the 1lthFive-Year Plan
for Lake Tai. This planwill ultimately form part o fJiangsuProvince's 1IthFive-Year Plan.

121,     The Jiangsu Provincial Water ResourcesBureau notedthat the NationalWater ResourcesMinistry
hasrequired allprovincial water resourcesbureaus to develop "water resource comprehensive plans,"
which include water quality planning. This is not the traditional planningresponsibility for the water
resourcesadministration, andfor this reason, the JiangsuProvincialWater ResourcesBureau has met
considerableinstitutional difficulties infulfillingthis requiredtask.

122.     According to national requirements, a water resource comprehensiveplanshould include three
maincomponents-water resourceprotection, ground water utilization and, surface water utilization.

123.     To complete this task inJiangsuProvince, a leading group has beenestablished with the Jiangsu
ProvincialPlanning Commission at its head. The mainimplementingagency (andthe heado fthe plan's

                                                    - 120-

PMO) is the Jiangsu Water Resources Bureau. A total ofRMB30 millionwill be required to complete this
plan, butat this stage, funds allocatedby the ProvincialPlanningCommissionandFinance Bureau are so
far still insufficient.

124.       Environmentalplanninginthe Lake Tai Basin suffers from institutional fragmentation. The water
resourcesadministration is taking over muchof the environmental planningwork (including water quality
planning), butthis is a new task for this administration, andfor this reason, it is not proceeding smoothly.
InJiangsuProvince, there islimitedcooperationbetweenthe EPBandwater resourcesbureausatalllevels.
The traditional rivalry betweenthe agencies is hamperingthe developmento fcohesive, well-integrated
plans. Solvingthis problem, which is vital for JiangsuProvince to achieveits goals of sustainable
development, will require strong andcommitted leadershipbythe JiangsuProvincialGovernment, in
particularthe Jiangsu PlanningCommission andFinanceBureau.
