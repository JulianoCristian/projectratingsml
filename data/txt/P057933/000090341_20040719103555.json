improving\n            the quality of the urban environment. The project has the\n            following three components: Component 1) deals with the\n            most-heavily polluted perimeter lake - Wuli Lake, and\n            include: (a) pollution control facilities (b) lake-bank\n            restoration; and (c) pilot research in ecological\n            restoration. Component 2) will control gates on Xujiang and\n            Shangtang Rivers to enhance flood protection and prevent the\n            intrusion of polluted water from the Grand Canal into\n            Suzhou's urban canal system; and to prevent the loss of\n            clean water diverted through Xitangh River from the WangYu\n            River. Component 3) Will include: (a) technical assistance\n            for capacity building for wastewater utilities management,\n            and financing; (b) training in project management; (c)\n            technical assistance for engineering design and construction\n            supervision; and (d) locally-financed preparation and\n            updating of wastewater masterplans for Wuxi and Suzhou Municipalities."}, "docdt": "2004-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
