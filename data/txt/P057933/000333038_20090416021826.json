It describes\n            mitigation measures to reduce expected negative\n            environmental impacts, discussed as follows. During the\n            design phase, water discharge structures for the wastewater\n            treatment plants will be designed to control the discharge\n            of safe water flows, and, the collection and treatment of\n            odorous gases shall be considered. During construction,\n            water should be sprayed on working sites, transport routes,\n            and on material stockpiles. To reduce noise disturbances, a\n            work activity timetable will be worked out. Water and land\n            traffic plans will be coordinated with central urban traffic\n            authorities. Temporary treatment facilities such as water\n            collecting tanks, sedimentation tanks, oil separating tanks,\n            and water drainage ditches will be built to treat wastewater\n            produced during works. To prevent contamination from septic\n            tanks, and in groundwater, wastewater treatment facilities\n            will be built. Construction debris and contaminated soil\n            will be disposed of appropriately, at selected landfills,\n            strictly forbidding waste disposal on rivers, lakes, or sea.\n            During the operational period, temporary emergency measures\n            will be in use to avoid direct discharge of wastewater in\n            the event of power supply failures, overflows, equipment\n            failures, or other adverse conditions. Other measures\n            include: treatment of domestic wastewater prior to\n            discharges, with simple sedimentation tanks; and, location\n            of work sites should be at an agreed distance, away from\n            residential sites. Sites and roads should be sprayed\n            frequently, while replanting of trees and vegetative\n            propagation should follow construction."}, "docdt": "2008-12-01T00:00:00Z"}
