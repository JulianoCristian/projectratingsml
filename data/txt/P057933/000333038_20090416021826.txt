1. Introduction 
 
The Wuxi Hiushan Third Phase Wastewater Treatment Works is proposed to join the Tai Basin 
Environmental Project partially financed by the World Bank using the remaining loan at an 
amount about USD 6 million. The World Bank loan for the Tai Basin Environmental Project 
became effective on 2005, which is intended to contribute to the attempt to tackle the severe 
surface water pollution within the Tai Basin through a series of interventions such as provision 
of domestic wastewater treatment capacities and river dredging.  
 
Officially regarded as one of the three most polluted lakes, Tai Lake has experienced more and 
more severe pollution accidents, caused by uncontrolled discharge of wastewater from both 
urban wastewater and agricultural runoffs. In 2003 th
e
State Council approved the “Tenth Five 
Year Plan for Tai Bain Water Pollution Control” (the Plan hereafter) which calls for 
construction of 81 wastewater treatment plants with a combined capacity being 3.91X10
6
m
3
/d 
within the basin. This Plan also defines a technology policy to be adopted by the wastewater 
treatment plant so as to remove the nutrient loads (generally are Total Phosphorous and Total 
Nitrogen) that trigger the algae blooming frequently occurred in Tai Lake. In response to the 
Plan, Wuxi Government has developed an Implementation Plan for the ‘Tenth Five Year Plan 
for Tai Bain Water Pollution Control’ in Wuxi that requires phased construction of Wuxi 
Huishan Wastewater Treatment Works at a medium-term capacity of 50,000m
3
/d to be reached 
by the end of 2010. The first two phases of the Wuxi Huishan Wastewater Treatment Works 
have been successfully completed under the Tai Basin Environmental Project to a capacity of 
25,000 m
3
/d.  
 
An environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and environmental management plan (EMP), 
collectively known as the EA documentation, has been compiled by the Guangzhou Zhonglu 
Environmental Protection Company, with the assistance from the project DRA consultant, Mott 
MacDonald. This document is a summary of the EA documentation.

2.3 
World Bank Safeguard Policies  
After screening of the ten safeguard policies of the World Bank, it is determined that only the 
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment is to be triggered by this project. As the project is to be 
constructed within the boundary of the existing plant for which the land was acquired under the 
first two phases of the works, the Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12) is not to be triggered.  
 
3. EA 
Coverage 
 
According to the TOR, the EA covers the area from the joint of Xibei Canal and Xicheng Canal 
where the treated effluent will be discharged to the joint of Xicheng Canal with Xishan District.

4.2 Influent 
Quality 
Estimate 
As the industries that are to discharge wastewater into the project are required to install 
treatment facilities which are designed to meet the national standard for industrial wastewater 
discharge into municipal sewers. The local EPB will enforce such requirement to ensure the 
safe operation of the project. Based on the operational experience of the first two phases and 
the specific features of the service area, the influent wastewater quality for this project is 
estimated as follows:

/O biological reactor 
(Anaerobic - Anoxic- Aerobic) and secondary clarification, and tertiary sand filter. The sludge 
produced will be thickened by gravity. Thickened sludge will then be chemically conditioned 
and finally dewatered to produce sludge cakes with approximately 20% dry solid. Final effluent 
will be discharged into the Xibei Canal after UV disinfection. 
4.4 
Wastewater Flow Projection 
The service area of the project has a separate sewer system. Estimated water demand is based 
the medium term master plan of Wuxi with a planning horizon to 2015. Various data on per 
capita consumption for domestic water are adopted for the people living in different areas, the 
common living area and the expensive living area respectively. The industrial discharge of 
wastewater within the service area is obtained from these industries. 88% is used as a 
conversion coefficient to convert water demand to wastewater generation from municipal 
sector. The wastewater flow projection is summarized in Table 4-3 below.

5. Environmental 
Baseline 
5.1 General 
Setting 
Huishan District is located in the north of Wuxi Municipality, 129 km from Shanghai and 177 
km from Nanjing. The general topography is very flat with an elevation averaging 2-5 m.  This 
area has a rich and complex geology. The Quaternary fluvio-lacustrine and glacial sediments 
form the most important groundwater aquifers in the area. They include gravels, sands and silts 
up which are intercalated with clays deposited during three marine transgressions. 
5.2 
Climate and Air Quality  
Huishan District is located in the sub-tropical area where a maritime monsoon climate 
dominates.  The climate is characterized by distinct seasons and rich rainfall. Average annual 
precipitation is 1,000mm.The annual temperature averages 15.5
O
C. 
Page  7
EA Summary 
6
The project is located within a new developed area where cleaner fuels are required to be used 
in the industries. An air quality monitoring program conducted from Oct. 6 to Oct. 10 2008 
confirmed the high air quality of the site where SO
2
,
NO
2
and TSP can meet the Class II of Air 
Quality Standard (GB 3095-1996) while the NH
3
and H
2
S
can meet the standard for residential 
area (TJ 36-79) 
5.3 
Acoustic Environment Quality 
The acoustic environment quality is fairly good in the project site. A noise monitoring program 
was conducted on Oct 6 through Oct 7 2008. The monitoring results indicate that the Class II of 
the Acoustic Environment Quality can be reached at the site
5.4 Surface 
Water 
Quality 
Currently the Xibei Canal receives the domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff from the 
south side of the river, although the wastewater from the north side will has been intercepted by 
the wastewater treatment works. A surface water quality monitoring program, carried out 
during the period from Oct. 6 through Oct. 8, 2008, indicates that some of the pollutants 
concentration of primary concern, such as COD, NH
3
-N and TP can not constantly meet the 
respective standard while BOD
5
failing to meet the standard throughout this monitoring period. 
 
The Xibei Canal is a tributary of Wangyu River which discharges into the Tai Lake. Water 
quality objective for the Xibei Canal is required to meet the Class IV of Surface Water Quality 
Standard (GB 3838-2002) by 2010 and the Class III by 2020. This proposed project is mainly 
designed to improve the water quality in the Xibei Canal, which is currently receiving large 
amount of agricultural runoff and domestic wastewater flow. To achieve the above water 
quality objectives, Wuxi needs to remove COD 823t/a by 2020  
5.5 Hydrology 
River system is well developed in the project area. There are totally 129 rivers in Wuxi which 
are discharged either by the Jinghang Great Canal or Xicheng Canal. These rivers discharge to 
the Tai Lake, or to the Yangtze River through the Wangyu River, or the JInghang Great Canal. 
The water quality in the upstream section of the Xicheng Canal and the Jinghang Great Canal is 
below the Class V standard. In addition, the flat terrain and the clogged river courses in Wuxi 
often lead to very slow flow velocity, hence very poor self-cleaning capacity. As a result, the 
water quality in the Xibei Canal varies between Class Iv and V throughout the year. 
 
The Xibei Canal is an important waterway for navigation. It runs from Xicheng Canal to join 
the Wangyu River in Suzhou with a total length of 37.4 km and an averaged flow rate of
 
5.57 
m
3
/s.   
5.6 
Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment 
Although the water resource in Wuxi is abundant, the poor water quality has forced the city of 
Wuxi to abstract drinking water from Tai Lake where the water quality is being deteriorated. In 
2007, the severe outbreak of algae blooming in the lake made the cities that abstract drinking 
water from the lake close their water abstraction points, causing a drinking water crisis in the 
cities including Wuxi.   
 
The existing water supply capacity of Wuxi is 1.38 million m
3
/d. To guarantee the drinking 
water safety, Wuxi is implementing a phased water transfer work that abstract water from the 
Xicheng Canal at a total capacity of 0.8 million m
3
/d.  
Page  8
EA Summary

Wuxi has a limited domestic wastewater treatment capacity. The total domestic wastewater 
treatment capacity is
 1.05 million
 m
3
/d which treats 
55.04
%
of the domestic wastewater flow. 
The industrial wastewater flow in the city of Wuxi 57% is treated by the industrial wastewater 
treatment plants.   
5.7 Socio-economic 
Condition 
The Huishan District, where the project is located, lies within the Yangtze Delta which is the 
most prosperous area in China. The key indicators of the socio-economic condition of the 
Huishan District are summarized in table 5-1 below.

Analysis of Alternatives  
7.1  
Introduction 
During project development, various alternatives have been screened and compared with 
technical, economic and environmental criteria. In terms of the environmental assessment of 
alternatives, the primary objective was to identify and adopt options with the least adverse 
environmental impacts. The evaluation and comparison has included the following component 
options: 
Page  9
EA Summary 
8
y
Wastewater treatment process; 
y
Sludge treatment and disposal, including sites for the final disposal of sludge; and  
y
The scenario of with and without the project. 
7.2  
Wastewater Treatment Process Options  
The priority for wastewater treatment in the Tai Basin is the removal of pollutants that impact 
adversely upon the surface water quality. The most critical pollutant in this context is organic 
matter expressed as COD, TN, TP and NH
3
-N.  
 
As required by the Bank, the following criteria formed the basis of identifying the most 
appropriate wastewater treatment proposal. 
 
y
Comply with the required wastewater discharge standard of Class 1 A; 
y
Appropriate in respect of local conditions; 
y
Proven in operation at or close to the scale proposed; 
y
Capable of supporting competitive bidding; 
y
Representing the least cost option. 
 
Two alternative processes were considered for the secondary treatment of wastewater and 
compared against the above criteria. The two process options are the modified SBR and 
modified A
2
/O with the latter being identified as the preferred and least cost option for 
secondary wastewater treatment. 
 
As wastewater is treated, solids are removed and become sludge that needs proper disposal. 
Sludge will be treated by gravity thickening and dewatering by means of belt press or 
centrifuge. More complex is digestion of the sludge in large vessels, either aerobically or 
anaerobically. Thickening produces sludge with 3% solids content, which is still a liquid. 
Dewatering produces a semi-solid sludge with about 20% solids content, which can be handled 
by spade. Given the features of the wastewater treatment technology, the amount of sludge to 
be produced is expected to be very small, less than 4 tons per day. Digestion of the excess 
sludge will release phosphorous from the sludge to the supernatant. In addition, digestion may 
result in complex of operation of the wastewater treatment plants at such a small scale, which 
will lead to poor financial viability of the plant.    
7.3 Sludge 
Disposal 
Options 
Landfill and use for brick making were considered as the options for disposing of the excess 
sludge. Landfill is considered as the least-cost means for the final disposal of sludge, however 
the addition of sludge to an existing landfill site may reduce the service span and often result in 
alternation of the operation procedure of the landfill, causing difficulties in operation of the 
landfill. Thus the Wuxi EPB has developed a municipal sludge disposal plan which requires 
that the municipal sludge generated by WWTWs be hauled to a dedicated disposal center where 
the sludge will be incinerated and used as additives for brick making at site.  
 
To minimize the potential impacts during hauling of sludge to the disposal center, two 
alternative routes were considered.

8. Environmental 
Impacts 
and 
Mitigation
 
8.1 
Impacts in Construction Phase  
Project construction activities will generate the following adverse impacts: 
 
y
Airborne dust, mainly due to construction vehicle movement, land preparation, and 
materials handling. Under the condition of 5 m/s wind speed, the dust concentration in 
150 leeward of the construction site will be 0.49 mg/m
3
,
which can not meet the 
Class II of Ambient Air Quality. However, if the site is fenced, the impact of noise 
will be limited to less than 90 m under the same meteorological condition. 
y
Vehicular emission from the construction vehicles will impact the area 100 m leeward 
of the construction site and route under the condition of 2.5 m/s wind speed. After the 
site is fenced, the emission impact will be limited to less than 70 m under the same 
metrological condition.  
y
Noise, from construction equipment and vehicular movement. The noise, as high as 
105 dB(A), could travel as long as 250 in night in the open fields around the source 
before it is reduced to the level that can meet the acoustic quality standard, affecting 
residents of nearby villages. As the residential houses are far away from the site, the 
noise impact will not cause disturbance on the residential area.  
y
Waste discharge from construction camps. The discharge of sewage from construction 
camps will create temporary pollution sources to the surface water environment. The 
construction camps will be sources of other pollutants such as sediment-laden 
stormwater discharges, solid waste and waste oil from machinery maintenance. 
8.2 Positive 
Impacts 
This project will help enhance the trend of water quality improvement in the local water 
environment and sub-sequentially help reduce the pollution loads, particularly the nutrients, to 
the Tai Lake. The water quality objective of the Xibei river is to achieve Class IV by 2010 and 
Class III by 2020. Implementation of this project will contribute towards achieving this 
objective.  
 
A
surface water quality model recommended by the Technical Guideline is used to forecast the 
water quality of the Xibei Canal which receives the treated effluent from the project. The result 
of the model indicates that after the project is operational in 2010 and in a constant yearly 
averaged flow rate, the concentration of COD, NH
3
-N and TP will be reduced by 2.5 mg/l, 0.25 
mg/l and 0.02 mg/l respectively at the control section of the canal.  Table 8-1 shows the trend of 
water quality improvement in the Xibei Canal.

Other additional potential benefits to be brought by the project include: 
 
y
Improved sanitation and hygiene for residents near the rivers; 
y
Increased property values for land and real estate along the rivers; 
y
Improved recreation and environmental aesthetics to the communities of the project 
area;   
y
Increased revenue from tourism; and  
y
Improved bio-diversity and ecosystem 
8.3 Sludge 
Disposal 
Impacts 
This project alone will generate about 4 tons/day excess sludge containing 80% moisture. The 
sludge will be hauled to the municipal sludge disposal center, about 10 km southwest to the 
WWTW by a self-loading truck. The management of the Wuxi Huishan WWTW has signed an 
agreement with the sludge disposal center which defines the obligations and responsibilities of 
the two parties on the disposal of the sludge.  
 
The sludge disposal center is established through the internal permitting procedure of Wuxi 
EPB which designates this center a role to dispose of all the municipal sludge in Huishan 
District. Financial sustainability of the sludge center is guaranteed by the subsidy allocated by 
Wuxi Municipal Government, although the agreement has set a unit rate of RMB 100 for 
disposing of each ton of sludge with 80% water content. This center is also an integral part of 
the municipal sludge management planning in the city of Wuxi which requires municipal 
sludge produced in municipal WWTWs in Huishan District be hauled to this center for 
disposal.  
 
This sludge center is designed to be capable of disposing of 250 t/d sludge. Currently the idle 
capacity is about 50 t/d. The sludge will be initially piled in the workshop to accumulate to an 
amount capable of sustaining continuous operation of the equipment for a certain period. Then 
the sludge will be mixed with coal at a mass ratio of 3:7 before being conveyed to the vessel of 
the fluidized bed furnace. Residue from the furnace will be used to produce brick by a 
proprietary process.  
 
Water curtain is used to remove the dust and SO
2
from the flue gas before its discharging 
through a stack at a height of 15 m, and the wastewater will be conveyed to the local industrial 
wastewater treatment plant for treatment.          
 
There are no sensitive receptors in the areas surrounding the sludge disposal center. .  
 
Sludge haulage is another potential environmental concern. Potential leakage and odors from 
sludge as well as the heavy haulage truck emissions would affect the environment and residents 
along the haul routes. The hauling route has been carefully selected so as to avoid densely 
populated area or business area.  
 
To further investigate the nature of the sludge, the sludge produced from the existing process 
was analyzed against the Limit for Agricultural Application of Municipal Sludge (GB 4284-
84). The analysis result show that traces of heavy metals are at an acceptable standard for 
agricultural application, as given in Table 8-2 below.

8.4 
Air and Odor Impacts 
The primary air emissions from the wastewater treatment plants will be odors generated from 
the operation of aeration tanks and sludge handling processes. The pumping stations could also 
be a source of odors. The main constituents of such odors are NH
3
,
H
2
S, and methyl sulfide.  
 
An air diffusion model, recommended by the Technical Guideline, was used in the EA to 
predict the concentrations of the air emission constituents which cause the odors. The modeling 
results (Table 8-2) indicate that the distance required to achieve the residential area standards is 
expected to be 50 m for the wastewater treatment plant. However the standard (GB/T3840-91) 
requires that where there are more than two protected distance at the same grade from a plant, 
the protected distance be increased to a higher grade. Thus the protected distance required by 
this phase is at least 100 m. The protected distance for odor for the existing first two phases is 
150 m as required by the EPB, which should be adopted by this proposed phase. Within this 
distance there are no residential or other sensitive receptors surrounding the treatment plant. For 
the three pumping stations, the distance required is expected to be 30 m within which there are 
no sensitive receptors.

8.5 Noise 
Impacts 
Main noise sources during the operation phase include the sound of lifting pumps, air 
compressors and blowers in the wastewater treatment plant and submerged pump motors in the 
pumping stations. The noise at the source is 85-90 dB(A) for various equipment at the 
wastewater treatment plant and 85 dB(A) inside the pumping stations. About 15 m from a 
pumping station, the noise level is attenuated to 42 dB(A).  
 
A
fixed source noise attenuation model, recommended by the Technical Guideline, was applied 
in the EA to forecast noise impacts. The modeling results show that the noise level at the 
property boundary of the wastewater treatment plant and pumping stations are all expected to 
be below the day time standards of 60-70 dB(A) and night time standard of 50-55 dB(A).

Construction sites, transportation routes and materials handling sites will be water 
sprayed in dry, windy conditions up to 3 times a day. the construction materials will 
be stockpiled in leeward of sensitive receptors. The construction machinery and 
vehicles will be well maintained to reduce the emission;  
y
Construction activities will be scheduled carefully to minimize the impact of noise 
from construction machinery to the surrounding environment. Night time use of 
certain noisy plant such as pile-drivers, concrete vibrators, etc. will be prohibited. 
Temporary fence will be installed around the construction site to reduce the noise 
level; and 
y
Sewage and other waste from construction camps will be collected and diverted to 
municipal systems to avoid contamination of the surrounding areas. Spoils will be 
piled and compacted away from adjacent river course and irrigation canals, and 
transported to the designated site for disposal on regular basis.

Phase 
y
Operational procedures will be carefully followed, and the plant and sludge disposal 
facilities will be operated as designed; 
y
Industrial discharge will be monitored and supervised by local EPB to ensure the 
compliance with the standard, and the internal auditing of pollution discharge will be 
enhanced by the industries; 
y
An Emergency Response Plan will be developed for the discharge of raw wastewater 
into the receiving environment. The plans will anticipate power failure, overflows, 
equipment malfunctions and other conditions that may affect the proper functioning of 
the plant; and 
y

Public Consultation and Information Disclosure 
11.1 Process 
Community stakeholders were consulted during the project EA, particularly those who will be 
directly affected by the Project. These included urban and rural residents near proposed 
pumping stations, wastewater treatment plant, and the sludge disposal site. The primary 
methods of public participation included public meetings/hearings, interviews, questionnaires, 
and use of public media such as newspapers and internet. The EA team organized and chaired 
the public meetings which were also attended by project planners, design engineers, and 
government officials from the Wuxi Huishan Wastewater Treatment Plant and Wuxi EPB.  
 
Consultation has been undertaken throughout the project preparation. Wuxi has carried out two 
rounds of public consultation. The first round focused on environmental screening to define 
public concerns, to assist identification of key environmental issues and to draw public 
response and comments on the initially developed mitigation measures for the potential adverse 
impacts identified before EA TOR  finalization. The second round was designed to ensure 
public awareness of the EA effort and final project definition and mitigation by presenting a 
draft EA report to the public through information disclosure procedures. As part of the process 
of public consultation, a telephone hotline has been maintained in the Wuxi Huishan 
Wastewater Treatment Plant to solicit public comments. Details of the two rounds of public 
participation undertaken are presented in Table 11-1.

11.4 Results of Consultation  
While the overwhelming majority of the public strongly supported the objectives of the project, 
concerns were expressed at the potential impacts, both long-term and short-term, during the 
construction and operation of the project. For each of the concerns expressed during the public 
consultation, response has been developed and communicated to the concerned public. The 
main findings of the consultation are summarized below: 
 
y
96% of the people surveyed are well aware of this project, with 79% from the 
public media and 21% through personal communication; 
y
81% of the people surveyed think the project will bring minor adverse impacts 
while 15% concern about the dust and noise in construction phase. After the 
mitigation measures, these concerned impacts will be reduced to an acceptable 
level; 
y
76% of the people surveyed fully support the project, 19% support the project 
with a condition that all the adverse impacts be mitigated to an acceptable level, 
and 5% think it is no matter to them. No people oppose this project. 
11.5 Information

12 Conclusions 
 
The environmental assessment for the project has drawn the following conclusions: 
 
y
Wuxi has been suffering severe pollution in virtually all its rivers. The city has 
limited municipal wastewater treatment. As a result of the direct discharge of 
contaminants into its waterways, the drinking water safety is being threatened 
by the surface water pollution; 
y
This project, to be partially financed by the World Bank, fits well into the 
integrated environmental management plan for the Tai Basin.  This is one of the 
top state and provincial pollution control priorities. While this project alone 
cannot resolve the problem and meet the government goal for surface water 
quality, it will be a key step and contribute towards achieving the goal; 
y
This project is an important part of the Tai Basin Environment Project in terms 
of pollution loads reduction to the basin. Together with the first two phases, it 
will cut the COD load by 4106.2 t/a, NH
3
-N by 393.4 t/a, and TP by 36.4 t/d, 
accounting for 8.8%, 17.9% and 18.2% of the Tai Basin Project respectively. It 
will also help enhance the trend of water quality improvement in the Xibei 
Canal;   
y
The project will also cause some adverse impacts to the environment. During the 
construction phase, dust, noise, construction camps, and construction materials 
extraction will be experienced. During the operation phase, noise, odors, sludge 
haulage and sludge disposal will impact on the surrounding environment. With 
careful design and implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, however, 
these adverse impacts can be mitigated; and 
y
To further ensure environmental protection and proper implementation of 
mitigation measures, an environmental management plan has been developed. 
This includes government and local organizations.
