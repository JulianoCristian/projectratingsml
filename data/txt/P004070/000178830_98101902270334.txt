REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of $20.0 million to help
finance a proposed second agricultural credit project. The loan would
have a term of 17 years, including three and one-half years of grace, with
interest at 8.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Republic of Korea") was distributed under cover of
SecM75-437 dated June 9, 1975. A Basic Economic Mission visited Korea
in June/July 1976; its report is being prepared. The Country Data Sheets
are attached as Annex I.
3.        Korea's economic performance over the last decade was outstanding.
It entered the sixties with one of the lowest income levels in the world;
it had little experience of participation in international trade; and
it lacked natural resources. Despite these unpromising beginnings, Korea
embarked on a course of export-oriented industrial growth that has led to
its recognition as one of the most successful examples of development. Its
rich endowment of human resources, including skilled labor and entrepre-.,
neurial talent, a social environment which is conducive to rapid economic
change, and a national dedication to economic growth, all contributed to
Korea's impressive record.
4.        Around 1960, the Korean economy was still heavily dependent on
agriculture and tended to grow at 3-4 percent per year. Since then, however,
the economy has been transformed and the growth of real GNP accelerated to
around 10 percent per year. Exports of manufactures increased from $65
million in 1964 to over $4.3 billion in 1975. The manufacturing sector
grew from 12 to 32 percent of GNP during this period while the share of
agriculture in GNP declined from over 40 percent to 22 percent, despite an
annual growth rate of about 4 percent in value added in agriculture. The
rate of population increase declined from 2.6 percent per year-between the
censuses of 1960 and 1966 to an estimated 1.8 percent in 1975. Consequently,
real per capita income more than doubled in the last decade and is estimated
at $548 in 1975.

of their ofhcial duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



- 2 -
5.        The growth of incomes has been sustained by a significant in-
crease in the proportion of resources allocated to investment. Expenditures
on fixed capital formation were below 11 percent of GNP in the years up to
1962, but have been around 24 percent of GNP in recent years. National
savings rose from very low levels of around 6 percent of GNP in the early
1960s to nearly 18 percent of GNP in 1975, both government and private
savings having increased very substantially. This indicates that large
capital inflows (which averaged about 9 percent of GNP during 1970-71,
roughly the same level as in the early 1960s), did not weaken efforts to
mobilize resources domestically. However, Korea entered upon a period
of rapid growth with a very low level of domestic savings and, therefore,
the Government pursued a policy of relatively heavy dependence on external
capital in the interest of a rapid acceleration of investment and growth.
Moreover, since exports during 1964-75 were rising at an average rate of
over 40 percent (in current prices), the burden of additional external debt
was not excessive and the debt service ratio stood at around 13 percent in
1975.
6.        Korea's performance in attempting to achieve a balanced distribu-
tion of the benefits of growth is also creditable. Available data for 1964
and 1970 indicate that the distribution of income in Korea is among the most
equitable in the developing world and that the overall size distribution of
income changed little during this period. However, as a consequence of the
rapid growth in manufacturing and a shift of terms of trade against farmers,
income of urban wage-earning households tended to increase faster than that of
rural households and was twice as high in 1968. Since 1968 the Government has
succeeded in raising the relative price of farm outputs, increasing produc-
tivity in agriculture through improved technology and subsidized supply of
inputs, and improving the opportunities for off-farm employment principally as
part of the Saemaeul (New Community) movement begun in 1971. These measures
have almost eliminated the differential between average household incomes in
urban and rural sectors.
Recent Developments and the Adjustment Process
7.        In the 1970s, the Korean economic situation has been subject to
sudden and sharp changes (see Economic Reports distributed under cover of
R74-42 dated March 4, 1974 and SecM75-437 dated June 9, 1975). Following
a period of rapid growth the Government tndertook a stabilization program
during 1970-72 as a result of which real investment did not increase and
the growth of real GNP slowed to about 8 percent per year. In 1973,
international demand grew rapidly and Korea took full advantage of its
opportunities. As a result, there was an unprecedented boom: real GNP grew
by 16.5 percent and export volume by 57 percent; national savings rose to
22 percent of GNP, and foreign savings financed only about 15 percent of
total investment.
8.        The transition from the boom of 1973 to the difficulties encoun-
tered in the last two years reflects the impact of the twin shocks of the
rise in food, oil and other import prices and the recession in the industrial
countries. The Korean economy was particularly vulnerable to both of these
because of its heavy dependence on imported energy, raw materials, and food-
stuffs, and on exports to th,. i-olionc-d -'rmntries.



- 3 -
9.        From the last quarter of 1973 to the middle of 1974, the prices of
imports rose very rapidly. The immediate impact of the oil price increase
alone was to raise the import bill by more than twice the entire current
account deficit in 1973. The payments required to maintain the 1973 volume
of oil imports rose from $277 million to over $1 billion; the increase was
equivalent to 19 percent of total imports and over 6 percent of GNP at their
1973 levels. The higher prices of foodgrains added another $300 million to
the import bill. Furthermore, the average unit value of imports other than
petroleum and foodgrains rose by 45 percent during 1974, while the unit value
of Korea's exports rose by only 27 percent in that year. The impact of the
adverse shifts in the international terms of, trade was aggravated during 1974
by the sudden recession in industrialized countries which affected the demand
for Korea's exports. The United States and Japan, which took 70 percent of
Korea's exports in 1973, suffered a decline of about 2 percent in real GNP
in 1974. As a result, Korea's merchandise export volume, which had grown
by 57 percent in 1973 (and by over 29 percent in each of the preceding five
years), grew by only 9 percent in 1974 and 23 percent in 1975. The volume
of exports to Japan actually declined by about 12 percent in 1974 and
increased by only 1 percent in 1975.
10.       The slackening of export demand and the adverse price.movements had
a variety of effects on the economy. First, as a direct consequence of the
18 percent deterioration in the international terms of trade, Korea suffered
a real income loss of the order of 4 percent of GNP in 1974. 1/ Adjusting
for this terms of trade effect, real gross national income rose by only
4.2 percent in 1974, following increases of 6.7 percent and 15.2 percent
in the previous two years. Second, the rise in import prices accelerated
domestic inflation.   The rate of increase of wholesale prices rose to-
42-percent in 1974 from an average of 7 percent in the previous four years.
Two-thirds of the increase in prices was the result of increases in the
landed cost of imported commodities. In an effort to prevent the emergence
of untoward distortions, the Government allowed import price increases to
be fully reflected in domestic prices (with the exception of basic food-
stuffs and fertilizers). Domestic prices of petroleum products rose nearly
300 percent from August 1973 to December 1974. These were also reflected
in the prices paid by consumers for electric power and transportation. In
general the burden of adjustment to higher import prices was borne directly
by consumers. Consequently, wholesale -prices rose by 42 percent in -1974 and
at an annual rate of nearly 30 percent in the first half of 1975. In the
second half of 1975, however, the index increased by only about 5 percent
as domestic prices completed the process of'adjustment to international
inflation, and the program of monetary,restraint instituted by the Govern-
ment began to take effect; during 1975, the increase in the wholesale price
index was 20.2 perent. Third, the current account deficit on the balance
of payments grew from $309 million: in 1973 to $2.02 billion in 1974 and
net foreign exchange reserves-dropped from $1.1 billion to $0.3 billion
during 1974. About half of this external deficit was due to the terms of
trade loss, the balance being primarily due-to the recession in the economies
of Korea's trading-partners.   Finally, part-of the adjustment was made-by'a
1/    At 1970 prices and exchange rates.



sharp slackening in the pace of domestic economic activity. The annual
,.ate of growth of GNP slowed from 16.5 percent in 1973 to 13.8 percent in
the first half of 1974 and 4.3 percent in the second half. Import volume
grew by onlv 4 percent in 1974, compared with an average increase of 16
percent per year in the previous five years. Industrial production (season-
all- corrected) fLuctuated sharply from month to month but showed very little
gain after the first quarter of 1974. Employment rose by only 3.4 percent
and was able to absorb only three-quarters of the increase in the labor
force in the year.
1i.       The slowdown in domestic production would have been greater but
for various government measures to sustain employment.    In December 1974
thie currency was devalued by 17.5 percent to W 485 per US$. Special
credits were extended through the banking systemi to enable industry to
finance accumulation of inventories, and the GoVernment purchased excess
inventories of finished goods from industries particularly hard hit by
.b_ fall in export demand.   Subsidized credit was extended to small firms
and exporters to ease their financial, situation. The purpose of these
ameLiorative policies (which characterized the second half of 1974 and
the first quarter of 1975) was two-fold. One was to sustain employment
levels, thereby easing the adjustment of the economy to the permanent
and sizeable loss of real incomes resulting from the terms of trade
movement. The second objective was to prevent too precipitate a decline
in investment and production levels of export industries in response to
a temporary recession in export markets. In support of Korea's long-term
goals, it was held desirable to maintain a minimal economic momentum and
to remain poised to take rapid advantage of the anticipated recovery in
export demand. This policy was, of course, predicated on the belief that
the world recession would be relatively shallow and shortlived, a belief
that was shared at the time by many economists and policy makers through-
out the world.
12.       Contrary to expectations, the recession in industrialized countries
continued well into 1975, with the GNP of OECD countries having fallen by an
estimated 2 percent in 1975. Despite the unfavorable demand conditions,
Korea's export volume expanded by about 23 percent in 1975. However, as a
result of reduced demand and increased international competition, particularly
for iron and steel and clothing exports, Korea's export prices declined by
about 7 percent and its terms of trade deteriorated by about 10 percent in
1975.  This, together with rising payments on freight and interest obliga-
tions, has been principally responsible for a continued large deficit in
the balance of payments of $1.9 billion in 1975 compared with $2.02 billion
in 1974.
13.       Korea has suffered heavy balance of payments losses in 1974 and
1975 due to an exceptional combination of adverse events. The average loss
in the two years on account of terms of trade movements alone is estimated at
about 7 percent of GNP (at 1970 prices and exchange rates). Any attempt to
adjust to such a large foreign exchange loss without incurring sizeable
balance of payments defic,its would undoubtedly lead to large-scale unemploy-



- 5 -
ment and a loss of growth momentum, which would have severe adverse conse-
quences for Korea's long-term economic development. The essence of Korean
policy, therefore, has been to smooth the process of adjustment, while at the
same time attempting to ensure that there is a steady movement toward long-
term improvement in the balance of payments. Toward this end, the Korean
Government has intensified measures by which it had already begun, earlier
in the decade, to tackle longer term structural problems in its balance of
payments and the need to increase the availability of resources for invest-
ment.
14.       The severity of Korea's balance of payments problems in 1974 drew
attention to the sensitivity of a trade-oriented economy to the economic
fluctuations of its trading partners. Because Korea is poorly endowed with
natural resources and its principal comparative advantage is a skilled and
energetic labor force, a relatively high degree of trade orientation is
unavoidable; however, the Government has made and is making strenuous efforts
to reduce Korea's vulnerability to international fluctuations by diversify-
ing the commodity composition of and markets for exports as well as reducing
import dependence.
15.       In recent years Korea has made considerable progress in diversify-
ing exports. In 1971 and 1972, 75 percent of Korea's exports went to the
United States and Japan. This proportion dropped to 56 percent in 1975.
In the same period, the share of exports to Europe more than doubled from
9 percent to 18 percent, and the share of other countries (excluding the
United States, Europe and Japan) increased from 16 percent to 26 percent.
Commodity exports to Middle Eastern countries have increased very rapidly
from a small base, and amounted to $319 million in 1975. Similarly, the
commodity concentration of exports has declined significantly; four major
categories of exports (textiles, clothing, plywood and miscellaneous manu-
factures) accounted for 60 percent of exports in 1970 but only 47 percent
in 1975. During this period there was a particularly rapid growth of
exports of iron and steel, electronics, electrical machinery and appliances
and ships. During the last year, Korea has also been highly successful in
winning construction contracts in the Middle East. The development of new
exports and the upgrading of the quality and design of traditional exports
are the major means by which Korea hopes to diversify its exports and to
further reduce its dependence on markets in Japan and the United States.
16.       These developments suggest that Korea will be able to sustain a
rate of growth of exports that is relatively rapid compared to other countries,
although not as high as it was prior to 1974. Global projections indicate
that the volume of manufactured exports by developing countries is likely
to grow about 12-15 percent per year for the rest of this decade. Consider-
ing that 90 percent of Korea's exports now consist of manufactured goods,
that its links with the Japanese and U.S. economies remain strong, that
successful efforts are being made to penetrate new markets (especially in
Europe and the Middle East) and that some progress has already been made in



- 6 -
diversifying the industrial structure, the long-term prospects for Korea's
exports are markedly better than for developing countries as a whole. Pro-
vided measures continue to be taken to maintain price competitiveness, which
has been somewhat eroded by the relatively high rates of inflation in Korea
in the past two years, Korean exports may be expected to grow at 20-25 percent
per year in terms of current prices (allowing for international price infla-
tion of 5-6 percent per year).
17.       The potential for strengthening the balance of payments on the
import side is not great. Of total imports in 1975, 30 percent consisted of
raw materials for exports and a further 27 percent was capital goods, cat-
egories in which substantial import savings are unlikely to be compatible with
maintaining international competitiveness of export industries. More than
half of the remaining 43 percent of imports consisted of petroleum and food-
grains. The scope for restraining petroleum imports (18 percent of the total)
is very limited; because domestic energy sources are limited to low quality
coal, firewood and limited hydroelectric power, petroleum supplies about half
of Korea's energy needs and is utilized almost entirely for essential indus-
trial and transportation purposes. The number of private automobiles is
relatively small and home heating needs are met by coal and wood. Despite
these constraints, the rate of growth of petroleum consumption has been
severely curtailed - from 1.8 times GNP growth in 1968-73 to about the same
rate as GNP growth in the following two years.
18.       In order to reduce dependence on imported foodgrains, there
has been an energetic effort to increase agricultural productivity. In
1972-73 imports of grain accounted for about 30 percent of grain consumption
and about 11 percent of total imports. Since then, the rate of growth of
value added in agriculture has nearly doubled (from about 3.5 percent to about
6 percent per year). In part this was the result of good weather conditions,
but it was also in response to improved inputs and the assurance of high
grain prices. The proportion of land under high yielding varieties of rice
has increased from 16 percent in 1972 to an estimated 48 percent in 1976.
Despite the very severe topographical limitations (nearly three-quarters of
the land area is too mountainous to cultivate), there is a growing promise
that Korea will be able to achieve self-sufficiency in its staple foodgrains -
rice and barley. As a result it is anticipated that, in the future, imports
of foodgrains will amount to only about 6 percent of total imports and will
consist mainly of wheat, which cannot be grown in sufficient quantity
because of Korea's climate and topography.
19.       The Korean Government set itself two major economic goals for 1976:
restraining inflation to a rate of 10 percent and reducing the balance of pay-
ments deficit on current account to $1.4 billion (from $2.0 billion in 1975).
Present indications are that both these goals, which seemed ambitious when
set at the beginning of the year, will be achieved. The current deficit for
1976 is now forecast at about $1.1 billion as a result of buoyant exports and
strong measures to restrain domestic demand. Export earnings are expected
to rise to about $7.2 billion, 45 percent ahead of 1975, primarily because
of the economic recovery in the industrialized countries; and GNP is expected



- 7 -
to rise by about 11 percent at constant prices. Despite this, the rate of
increase in wholesale prices is being held at around 10 percent. In part,
this is the result of reduced Government deficits and a slowdown in invest-
ment due to the severe restriction of banking credit to the private sector.
The significant improvement in Korea's economic performance in 1976 will
provide a strong base for the Fourth Development Plan for the period 1977-81.
Longer-Term Prospects and Program
20.       The preparation of the Fourth Five Year Plan for the period 1977-81
has afforded an opportunity for a comprehensive review of Korea's economic
problems, prospects and priorities. Korea's longer-term goals as specified
in the draft Plan are "growth with enhanced self-sufficiency" and greater
"equity and social development". Self-sufficiency is interpreted princi-
pally in terms of a strengthened balance of payments rather than autarky.
It is the firm intention of the Korean Government to achieve a maximum rate
of growth consistent with a sound balance of payments and also with the main-
tenance of internal financial stability. Although investment is expected to
continue at about 26 percent of GNP over the Plan period which will enable
the achievement of a rate of growth of GNP of about 9 percent (slightly lower
than the average of 10 percent attained during the last decade), the current
account deficit, which is now about 6 percent of GNP, is to be eliminated by
1981. National savings are expected to finance as much as 98 percent of
total investment as compared with about 72 percent in the Third Plan period
(1972-76).
21.       Growth and stability are not the only objectives.    Enhanced equity
and greater social development are of equal importance in the Korean scheme
of things. The main emphasis is on providing adequate employment opportu-
nities for the rapidly growing labor force to prevent aggravating the unem-
ployment problem 1/ and on achieving a wider distribution of the benefits of
growth. Productivity and earnings will be increased by the provision of
increased facilities for vocational and in-plant training. Health outlays
will increase as a proportion of total investment with special stress on pre-
ventive care and an innovative health delivery system to service low income
families. The family planning program will be strengthened nationally.
22.       The achievement of these goals would not require a change in the
basic development strategy of export-led growth, which Korea has adopted so
successfully since the mid-sixties. *The ratio of total exports to GNP is
expected to rise from the current level of about 27 percent to about 42 per-
cent in 1981, with the manufacturing sector continuing to provide about
90 percent of total exports. This demands the achievement of further gains
in efficiency and productivity. Korea's comparative advantage lies in manu-
factures, such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding, which require
relatively more skilled labor. It is also necessary to achieve some import
1/ Although the rate of population growth has declined to below 2 percent,
the rate of growth of the labor force will continue to be around 3 percent
a year over the next decade because of the baby boom following the Korean
War in the early 1950s.

substitution in steel and chemicals to ensure an adequate supply of the
intermediate inputs for the export industries. These changes in the indus-
trial structure will require intensive efforts to improve the mechanisms
for the transfer of foreign technology and the development of appropriate
indigenous technology.
23.       The successful implementation of the forthcoming Plan will depend
in large measure on Korea's ability to marshall the required resources.
Strong policy measures are envisioned in the Plan to increase the mobiliza-
tion of domestic resources. Success in restraining inflation is, as already
noted, expected to have a significantly favorable effect on the mobilization
of private savings. In the past, private savings have fluctuated with the
movement of the terms of trade and the rate of inflation. No further adverse
movement in the terms of trade is expected in 1976 and the rate of inflation
is to be of the order of 10 percent. This situation is expected to continue
through the Fourth Plan period. The Korean Government is taking measures
designed to channel the higher private savings likely to be generated by
these developments to an increasing extent into the financial system, and
thereby, into more effective use for productive investments. In addition
to restoring a positive real rate of return on financial forms of savings,
the Government is taking steps to increase the supply of government and
corporate securities to the public and to provide more attractive schemes
for savings mobilization by commercial banks.
24.       The measures to increase the mobilization of private savings are
being supported by fiscal actions to increase public savings. The defense
tax surchage imposed in 1975 is to be continued and a value-added tax intro-
duced. The extent of the subsidization of farmers and urban consumers
through the Grain Management Fund and the Fertilizer Fund is to be reduced
so as to eliminate the operating deficits on these accounts. This will
remove the substantial burden which these Funds had imposed on Government
finances (in 1975, the borrowing from the Central Bank on the two accounts
was W 350 billion, or nearly 4 percent of GNP). The increased resource
mobilization and the strong restraint on most current expenditures will
result in substantial budgetary current surpluses which could be used to
finance capital expenditures.
25.       The fruits of growth are to be spread more equitably among all
segments of the population. The continued adoption of a high-growth
strategy and emphasis on labor intensive production is expected to
generate adequate employment opportunities to absorb the increment in
the labor force during the Plan period. Rural incomes are expected to
increase as a result of a further improvement in the agricultural terms
of trade and increased opportunities for non-farm employment (primarily
through the Saemaeul Movement). The quality of life in the rural areas
is to be further improved by the provision of infrastructure facilities.
26.       The Plan's priorities, strategy and programs are sound.    The
continued emphasis on relatively rapid growth is essential in the light
of the employment objective and the predominant role the export sector



- 9 -
is expected to play is appropriate in view of Korea's limited natural
resources. Moreover, Korea has the manpower and the entrepreneurial
capacity to implement the proposed investment program.
27.       However, the main impediment to the successful implementation of
the Plan is likely to be the difficulty Korea may encounter in raising the
necessary resources. The domestic savings targets are somewhat ambitious
while the projected import requirements may turn out to be too low. The
ability to obtain foreign capital in adequate amounts and on reasonable
terms will continue to be a challenge to Korea. The servicing of the
sizeable foreign borrowing required should not pose serious difficulties
for Korea given the present debt service ratio and the prospects for con-
tinued export growth, provided, however, that the proportion of external
debt incurred on shorter-term and at high interest rates is not excessive.
Assuming the capital inflows will be forthcoming on reasonable terms, the
debt service ratio is expected to peak below 15 percent by the end of the
decade and subsequently decline steadily as exports continue to expand
rapidly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
28.       As of July 31, 1976, Korea had received 27 Bank Loans (including
one Third Window Loan) and 8 IDA Credits, amounting in total to $1,123.8
million in loans and $106.9 million in credits (taking into account cancel-
lations and the refinancing of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank Loan).
29.       A substantial part of Bank financing has been for the transport
sector - $219.7 million for railways, $191.5 million for highways and $80
million for ports. $145.5 million has been lent for agriculture projects.
The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received $150 million,
the Korea Development Bank (KDB) $60 million, and the Medium Industry Bank
(MIB) $30 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry. A total
of $80.3 million has been provided for three education projects; $25.0 mil-
lion for a tourism project; $15.0 million for a secondary cities project; and
$60.0 million for a Rural Infrastructure Project. In addition, two Program
Loans amounting to $175.0 million have also been granted to Korea.
30.       As of July 31, 1976, about-$587 million of the total Bank lend-
ing remained undisbursed on effective Loans and Credits, mostly from commit-
ments in the past 18 months. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank Loans, IDA Credits, and IFC Investments as of that date and Notes on
the execution of ongoing projects. As indicated in the Notes, progress on
project implementation is generally satisfactory.
31.       Excluding one project which was subsequently cancelled, IFC had,
by July 31, 1976, entered into 14 commitments totalling $69.5 million (net
of participations and cancellations). Under advanced consideration is a
further investment in electrical and electronic products; under preliminary
consideration are projects in cement distribution, special steels, petro-

32.       Korea's ambitious industrial development programs require large
capital expenditures and further loans to the three major development banks
and direct lending for an industrial machinery project are planned to meet
this need. This will enable the continuation of assistance to a wide spec-
trum of industries, including small-and medium-sized enterprises. With the
closer relationsh-ip established as a result of recent promotional efforts,
we expect IFC's activities also to continue expanding rapidly. IFC would
seek projects that would: (a) result in foreign exchange revenues or
savings; (b) contribute to modernize or deepen the industrial structure;
and (c) increase value added in manufacturing.
33.       The emphasis which the Government places on agricultural and
rural development will be reflected in the program for FY77. In addition
to the proposed project, the Miho watershed area development project has
been approved and the second stage of the Yong San Gang irrigation project
appraised.
34.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural sectors
and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent infrastructural
development.  Although the transport sector will be given relatively less
emphasis than in the past, the investments required are large, and thus there
is considerable support for this sector in the proposed program.
35.       The Government is intensifying its efforts to prepare projects
suitable for external official financing in the fields of infrastructure,
agriculture and regional development. The foreign exchange component of such
projects is low, partly because they consist largely of civil works and
Korea's construction industry is efficient and well organized and wins an
overwhelming proportion of contracts put out to international competition.
Moreover, the construction industry's dependence on imports is expected to
lessen in the future. Korea's need for official aid therefore cannot be
met if financing is confined to the foreign exchange costs of projects.
36.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt (dis-
bursed) outstanding at the end of 1975 was about 8.5 percent, and the share
of debt service was of the order of 3.0 percent at that time. These ratios
are expected to increase somewhat by the end of the present decade.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
37.       The extraordinary expansion of Korea's export-oriented manufactur-
ing sector in recent years has, to a certain extent, obscured the tangible
and impressive, albeit less spectacular, gains made by the country's agri-
cultural sector; over the 1962-74 period its output increased by about 4.0
percent per annum (a rate comparable with that attained by Thailand, Indo-
nesia and the Philippines). Korea's agricultural exports (including those



of the fisheries subsector) rose from about $70 million equivalent in 1967
to approximately $423 million in 1974 and are estimated to have risen to
over $600 million in 1975. Further, despite the steady increase in indus-
trial wages, rising agricultural productivity and increased farmgate prices
have contributed towards the achievement of near-parity in the earnings of
urban and rural households. These achievements are all the more commendable
in view of the fact that, because of Korea's geo-physical features, only
about a quarter of its total land area of about 10 million hectares is cul-
tivable.
38.       About 22 percent, or 2.24 million ha, of Korea's total land area
is cultivated. Another two-thirds are classified as forest land most of
which being mountainous would not be suitable for cultivation. Additional
land that can be brought into cultivation is consequently quite limited.
The total cropped area was 3.29 million ha in 1974 giving a cropping
intensity of 147 percent. Rice (1.2 million ha) and barley (0.9 million
ha) are the major crops accounting for about two-thirds of the total
cropped area. Pulses (mainly soybeans), vegetables, mulberry, fruits,
tobacco and ginseng are the other important crops and, together with mis-
cellaneous cereals, viz. maize, wheat and millet, account for most of the
remaining cropped area.
39.       There are some 2.38 million farm households in Korea.    The average
farm size is about 0.9 ha. Nearly two-thirds of farm households have less
than 1 ha of cropland but only 4 percent are landless largely as a result of
the Farmland Reform Law of 1950 which imposed a ceiling of 3 ha of cultivated
land per household.
40.       The Government places high priority on expanding foodgrain produc-
tion to supply as large a part of domestic consumption requirements as pos-
sible. Efforts to expand production, especially of rice, barley and soybeans,
are directed mainly towards increasing yields on presently cultivated land
as new land suitable for cultivation is limited. Although rice yields are
already high, further increases can be obtained through irrigation coupled
with the wider use of high yielding and earlier maturing varieties.
41.       As a result of rapidly rising per capita incomes and increasing
urbanization, the consumption pattern of the population has been undergoing
significant changes. It is estimated that the per capita consumption of
foodgrains reached a plateau during the 1972-73 season. In contrast to this,
per capita consumption of high value foods, especially fruits, vegetables
and meat products, has been increasing significantly. Thus, between 1962 and
1974, while annual foodgrain consumption increased by about 4 percent, con-
sumption of vegetables, fruits and livestock products increased by 8 percent,
12 percent and 11 percent, respectively.
42.       Reflecting the rapidly rising domestic demand for the high value
foods, the other major strand of the Government's agricultural development
strategy is the continued diversification and expansion of agricultural
output into vegetables, fruits, livestock, mulberry, mushrooms and tobacco
to meet domestic consumption needs and for export. Increased production



- 12 -
of these highly income-elastic commodities is an important way to raise the
incomes of farmers and would result in fuller utilization of the available
farm labor as well as more productive use of other agricultural resources.
43.       The growth of agricultural output, which has been impressive as
compared with other East Asian countries especially when the country's geo-
physical features referred to in paragraph 37 above are taken into account,
has nevertheless not kept pace with domestic requirements. This has
caused the Government to be increasingly concerned with the need to raise
agricultural productivity and to devote additional resources to the develop-
ment of the agriculture sector. More than three times the resources
budgeted for agriculture in the previous Five-Year Plan (1967-71) are in-
cluded in the current Plan (1972-76).
Fourth Five-Year Development Plan (1977-1981)
44.       The proposed project would fit into the programs embodied in the
new Development Plan being formulated by the Government for the period
1977-1981. The objectives of the Plan in the agricultural sector are: (a)
the expansion of agricultural production and rural incomes; and (b) the
further diversification of agricultural output through expansion of seri-
culture and the production of nutritionally superior and higher value
horticulture and livestock products.
Support Facilities
45.       Research, Extension and Marketing.   Research on fruits and
vegetables is undertaken primarily at the Horticultural Experiment Stations,
and includes development of improved varieties and cultural practices, and
use of fertilizers and pesticides. Storage problems are also being investi-
gated with a view to developing suitable storage facilities for the various
fruits and vegetables. The Suweon Sericulture Experimental Station has
been involved in sericulture research since 1914. It is presently under-
taking research in four main areas - breeding of disease resistant and more
productive silkworm varieties, improvement of rearing techniques, develop-
ment of higher yielding mulberry trees, and improvement of silk-reeling
techniques and silk processing. The research and experiment stations are
operated by the Office of Rural Development (ORD) of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries. The stations' specialists and ORD'S extension
officers provide technical advice and extension support to farmers.
Extension guidance is also provided by the Horticultural Cooperatives and
Sericulture Associations of which most of the farmers are members. The
cooperatives, which are part of the National Agricultural Cooperative
Federation's (NACF) network of cooperatives, are engaged in the marketing
of farmers' output which is sold at NACF's crop and livestock auction
centers located in the urban areas. In addition, they provide the farmer
members with supplies of agricultural inputs.

46.       Agricultural Credit and Subsidies.   The total amount of credit
made available to farm households from institutional sources increased
steadily over the past decade from about W 2,000 per farm household
in 1964 to over W 6,000 in 1974. 1/ However, in 1974 institutional
credit represented only about 25 percent of total outstanding borrowings
with the remainder being provided from noninstitutional sources. NACF
is the main source of institutional credit for the agricultural sector
in Korea. The terms and conditions of its loans vary with the purpose
and the source of funds and are controlled by the Government. Part of
NACF's operations are funded by borrowing from the Government which
charges interest varying from 2 to 5 percent per annum; these funds are
used to provide medium-term loans primarily for agricultural production.
Borrowings from the Bank of Korea at interest rates varying from 2 to 6
percent are used to finance NACF's fertilizer operations, the purchase
and export of agricultural products and credit sales of agricultural
inputs. Short-term loans to depositors and cooperatives are made from
NACF's deposit resources as a normal banking service; the interest rate
charged is 15.5 percent - the same as applied by the commercial banks.
Medium- and long-term loans are made by the Gun (County) Cooperatives,
and short-term financing of agricultural inputs is handled by the Primary
Cooperatives. NACF loan interest rates range from 3.5 percent for irriga-
tion associations to 15.5 percent for commercial loans. Interest charged
on the bulk of NACF loans is between 9 and 12 percent. In addition to
interest subsidies, the Government provides farm inputs, such as fertilizers
and farm implements, to farmers at subsidized prices. It has also provided
price support for certain products produced by farmers, e.g. through the
operation of the Grain Management Fund. However, in recent years the
Government has begun to reduce the levels of subsidy partly because incen-
tives of the magnitude provided previously were no longer needed to boost
production.
Bank Group Agricultural Operations in Korea
47.       The Bank Group's lending for the agricultural sector in Korea has
been aimed at assisting in the achievement of the Government's objectives.
Of the $145.5 million lent, to date, for agricultural projects, $93 million
was provided for the Pyongtaek Kumgang (Loan 600-KO) and Yong San Gang (Loan
795-KO-Credit 283-KO) Projects, which are expected to provide irrigation for
60,000 ha; $10.5 million has been made available for an Agricultural Credit
Project (Credit 335-KG) which supported a three year lending program for the
provision of medium- and long-term credit to Korean farmers through NACF to
develop orchards and sericulture and to encourage the breeding of poultry
and swine; a $7 million Loan has been made for a Seeds Project (Loan 942-KO)
which is helping to develop higher yielding varieties of cereal crops, oil
seeds and potato for multiplication and distribution to farmers; $13 million
has been lent for the Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project
(Loan 994-KO) aimed at combining the on-farm production of commercial crops

provision of medium- and long-term credit to Korean farmers through NACF to
develop orchards and sericulture and to encourage the breeding of poultry
and swine; a $7 million Loan has been made for a Seeds Project (Loan 942-KO)
which is helping to develop higher yielding varieties of cereal crops, oil
seeds and potato for multiplication and distribution to farmers; $13 million
has been lent for the Integrated Agricultural Products Processing Project
(Loan 994-KO) aimed at combining the on-farm production of commercial crops
1/ Based on a sample survey of farm households in 1974.

banking, mutual insurance, guidance and training. In all these operations,
NACF receives substantial financial support in the form of funds at subsi-
dized interest rates from the Government and the Bank of Korea, which is
the country's central bank. NACF recently embarked on a major reorganiza-
tion of the cooperative structure which is to be completed in 1977; it
would involve a reallocation of functions between the Primary and Gun
Cooperatives whereby all short-term production credit and noncredit activi-
ties would be undertaken by the 1,545 Primary Cooperatives, while the Gun
Cooperatives would handle medium- and long-term credit and exercise audit
functions over the Primary Cooperatives on behalf of NACF.
64.       The General Assembly of NACF is the representative body of the
member cooperatives (Gun and Special Cooperatives). The Representatives
Meeting elected by it approves NACF's annual business plan, budget and
accounts. The Administration Board, the policy-making body of NACF,
consists of the President of NACF (appointed by the President of the
Republic of Korea), representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture and
Finance and the Bank of Korea, and five delegates elected by the Represen-
tatives Meeting. The President of NACF is assisted by an Executive Vice-
President while six Vice-Presidents supervise the various departments.
NACF has a staff of approximately 2,100 of whom about a third are profes-
sionals. It operates an Agricultural Cooperative College and two other
training institutions, the Saemaul Leaders Training Institute for farm
leaders and the Cooperative Training Institute. Many of the graduates of
the College and the Cooperative Training Institute are employed by NACF
and its cooperatives.
65.       Loans advanced by NACF and Gun Cooperatives grew from W 222 billion
in 1971 to W 449 billion in 1974 and outstanding loans rose from W 123 billion
to W 252 billion during the period. NACF's loan collection record is satis-
factory. The ratio of arrears to outstanding loans was 4.1 percent at the end
of 1974. Net income in 1975 was W 1,818 million compared with W 950 million
in 1974 and W 442 million in 1973.
66.       The Technical Unit.   For effective implementation of the proposed
project, the TU established under the First Project would be strengthened
by the inclusion of three additional technical staff comprising an agricul-
tural economist, and two horticulturists specializing in greenhouse vegetable
production and sprinkler irrigation for orchards, respectively. They would
be appointed and in position within three months following loan effectiveness
(Section 2.05(b) of the draft Project Agreement).
67.       Gun Cooperatives.   The 140 Gun Cooperatives with their 211 branches
function at the intermediate level of the three-tiered cooperative structure.
NACF and Gun Cooperatives are distinct legal and financial entities, but are
closely integrated in regard to management, resource mobilization, and lend-
ing operations. The Gun Cooperatives handle NACF's credit and noncredit
activities at the county level and act as a channel for funds to their mem-
ber Primary Cooperatives. In the framework of the reorganization mentioned
in paragraph 63, the number of branches will be reduced and the Gun Coopera-



- 21 -
tives will concentrate on banking activities such as the mobilization of
deposits, and the provision of medium- and long-term agricultural development
loans. As under the First Project, Gun Cooperatives will be required to
meet, inter alia, the following eligibility criteria in order to participate
in the proposed project: (i) overdues at the end of the preceding financial
year would not exceed 10 percent of loans outstanding; (ii) there would be
at least one Loan Appraisal Officer in a Participating Gun Cooperative
working full-time on project loans, the actual number to be commensurate
with-the workload; and (iii) adequate extension support would be available
for project farmers (Schedule 1 to the draft Project Agreement).
68.       Project Coordinating Committee.    A Project Coordinating Committee
was established under the First Project to ensure coordinated planning and
execution of project operations between NACF and other Government agencies.
Constituted under the Chairmanship of the Vice President of NACF responsible
for the project, the Committee includes representatives of the MAF, Office
of Rural Development, Economic Planning Board, Ministry of Finance, and the
Agricultural Development Corporation, with the Project Manager as its secre-
tary. The Committee played an important role in the timely and effective
implementation of the First Project. In view of this, the Committee is to
be maintained to carry out a similar role under the proposed project
(Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement
69.       Project investment items and operations on individual farms are
varied and small, and therefore would not be suitable for international
competitive bidding. The scattered location of farms and the fact that
project investments would be spread over several years are additional
factors which would discourage interest by foreign firms. Silkworm rearing
houses, on-farm storage and greenhouses are simple structures and would be
constructed by local artisans and in some cases by the farmers themselves.
There are numerous suppliers of project equipment and services, both private
companies and cooperatives. Prices are competitive. Project procurement
would consequently be through normal commercial and cooperative channels by
the individual farmer subborrower as in the First Project (Section 2.03 of the
draft Project Agreement).
Disbursement
70.       Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan is expected to extend
over three years. Against appropriate statements, disbursements would be
70 percent of subloans to beneficiaries made by the PGCs. The documenta-
tion certified by the PGCs would be retained on file at NACF, and be avail-
able for review by Bank missions. The disbursement schedule is included in
Annex III.
Financial and Economic Analysis
71.       Benefits.   The project would directly benefit about 7,900 farmer
subborrowers and their families, or a total of some 47,000 people. Most of
the subborrowers are expected to be farmers with incomes above the absolute

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-"
Loan No. 600      Pyongtaek Kumgang Irrigation Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of May 23, 1969; Effective Date: May 25, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Project includes irrigation for about 31,000 ha, (4,000 ha
less than expected at appraisal), improvement of drainage and roads, con-
solidation of paddy fields, benching of upland and tidal land reclamation.
Construction was delayed by a reorganization of the executing agency and
a delay in hiring consultants. The major project components (two sea dikes,
the main distribution system and pumping plants) were largely completed by
the end of 1974. Cost considerations have led to the exclusion of about
4,000 ha of land from the project. Costs have risen from US$90 million
at appraisal to about US$130 million largely because of the increased
costs of right-of-way, engineering, administration and land consolidation.
Preliminary estimates indicate increases in the price of rice will partially
offset the effects of higher costs and reduced irrigable area. The econo-
mic rate of return is now estimated to be about 10 percent, compared with
the appraisal estimate of 14 percent. About 95 percent of the loan has
been disbursed. Construction has been virtually completed.
Credit No. 151    First Education Project; US$14.8 Million Credit of
June 4, 1969; Effective Date: May 25, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
The Project comprises: (a) the expansion and equipping of 27
technical, commercial and agricultural schools, 5 post-secondary higher
schools and 4 university teacher training departments; and (b) 26 man-
years of technical assistance and 20 man-years of overseas fellowships
to support the development of agricultural and technical education. All
civil works, equipment and furniture procurement, technical assistance
and fellowships included in the Project have been completed. The Credit
is expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date. The total project
cost is estimated to remain about 3 percent below the appraisal estimate.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalu-
ation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 669     Third Railway Project; US$40.0 Million Loan, US$15.0
Credit No. 183   Million Credit of May 14, 1970; Effective Date:
September 11, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The bulk of the Loan and Credit was earmarked for the purchase
of freight cars, diesel locomotives, and telecommunications and track
maintenance equipment. Progress is generally satisfactory except for
delays in the procurement of some micro-wave equipment which had to be
retendered, and delivery is now expected in October 1976. The Closing
Date has been extended by a year to December 31, 1976 to provide adequate
time for the completion of procurement.
Loan No. 769     First Highway Project; US$54.5 Million Loan of June 29,
1971; Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The construction of approximately 370 km of national highways
between Jeonju and Busan was satisfactorily completed in December 1973,
at a final cost of about five percent above the appraisal estimate. Feasi-
bility studies and detailed engineering have been completed for 1,400 km
and 900 km of national highways, respectively. A study of road maintenance
and the establishment of a pilot maintenance organization formed the basis
of the creation of a country-wide Highway Maintenance Organization which
is being carried out under the Second Highway Project. The Closing Date
has been extended by 13 months to permit completion of procurement of
highway maintenance equipment, and staff training.
Loan No. 795     Yong San Gang Irrigation Project; US$33.0 Million Loan
Credit No. 283   and US$15.0 Million Credit of February 2, 1972; Effective
Date: September 15, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977
The Project aims at transforming an area with the highest drought
frequency in Korea into one with reliable irrigation and crop diversifica-
tion. Also, there will be increased production of high value crops such as
fruits and winter vegetables. Although good progress is being made under
seven major construction contracts, project completion will be nearly two
years later than scheduled at appraisal. The delay was caused mainly by
increased costs due largely to price escalation and design modification.
The cost increases will be partially compensated for by benefits attribut-
able to the enlargement of the area to be irrigated by about 1,400 ha; and
the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) plans to reduce costs by
constructing only canals, roads and drainage systems for contour furrow
irrigation on all lands exceeding 2 percent slope. Also the Bank has begun
monitoring construction costs on each of the ten civil works contracts on a
monthly basis.

Credit No. 335   Agricultural Credit Project; US$10.5 Million Credit of
September 29, 1972; Effective Date: May 24, 1973;
Closing Date: September 1, 1976
The Credit supports a three-year lending program to small farmers
to develop orchards, sericulture and mushroom production and to encourage
the breeding of poultry and swine. It also finances an organizational and
accounting study of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF)
and the strengthening of its training facilities. The Project is progressing
satisfactorily and was completed ahead of the Closing Date. The Credit has
been fully disbursed.
Loan No. 863     Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
November 22, 1972; Effective Date: February 26, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The main elements of the Project are: electrification of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 km of line running from Seoul to the
northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision of yard
facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improvement of
facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and rolling
stock. No major problems have been encountered; most of the loan pro-
ceeds have been committed, and nearly 95 percent already disbursed.
Loan No. 905     Fourth KDFC Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of June 13,
1973; Effective Date: September 10, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Project is progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 906     Second Education Project; US$23.0 Million Loan and
Credit No. 394   US$20.0 million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective Date:
September 10, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Project provides equipment for and extensions to the buildings
of 18 technical and 14 agricultural high schools; ten higher schools/junior
colleges for industrial, agricultural, fishery and nursing training; colleges
of agriculture, engineering and natural sciences in nine universities and
a merchant marine college; and ten junior teacher colleges and 12 colleges
of education. It also includes pre-investment studies on health and
management education. Implementation has improved significantly in the
last year. All equipment lists have been prepared and reviewed. Progress
on civil works is satisfactory and ahead of schedule. Equipment procurement
is somewhat behind schedule, but has improved significantly in the last
semester. A staff development plan has been approved. Total project cost
is estimated at US$75.8 million, about 8 percent above appraisal estimates.
Covenant requirements under the Development Credit Agreement are being met.
Project completion is expected to be on schedule.

1980           7.6         20.0
Procurement:            Investment items and operations are varied and small
and would not be suitable for international competi-
tive bidding. The scattered location of farms and
the fact that project investments would be spread
over several years would also discourage interest by
foreign firms. Silkworm rearing houses, on-faim
storage, and greenhouses are simple structures and
would be constructed by local artisans and, in some
cases, by the farmers themselves. Consequently,
project procurement would be through normal commer-
cial and cooperative channels by individual farmer
subborrowers.
Rate of Return:         The economic rates of return for the various project
components would range from 29 to 38 percent. The
weighted average economic rate of return is estimated
at about 33 percent.
