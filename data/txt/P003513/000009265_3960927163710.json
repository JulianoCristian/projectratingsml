It will also utilize lands which are\n            unproductive or unsuitable for grains and other crops. The\n            project will support a livestock development program\n            featuring pigs and poultry on hilly lands unsuitable for\n            grain cultivation, develop and intensify fresh water fish\n            culture in low-lying areas and in lakes and ponds. The\n            project will also rehabilitate low-yielding tea plantations\n            and establish new commercial forest plantations.\n            Agroprocessing facilities will be established to increase\n            the value added of project output, to provide feed for\n            project livestock, and to demonstrate the organization,\n            management, and financing of such facilities."}, "docdt": "1989-05-19T00:00:00Z"}
