MEKORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE KEECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOA THE JIANGXI AGRICULTURAL DvELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 46.2 million
(US$60 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and help finance the
Jiangxi Agricultural Development Project.
2.       hgkac ond.   Agriculture in China, including crops, livestock,
forestry,and fisheries; provides sustenance to over one billion people, is
the major source of income for some 190 million farm households, and
accounts for about 3c percent of the country's GDP. China's decade long
rural reform program has revitalized the agricultural sector through
improved work incentives, decentralized decision making, better
exploitation of comparative advantages, decontrolled agricultural markets
and prices, and technological modernization. The program has resulte4l in
impressive growth of income and production and in a remarkable
diversiification in family diet. The gross value of agricultural output
(GVAO) increased by 77% in real terms during 1978-87, at an average annual
rate (6.5%) more than twice that of the previous 25 years (3.2%). Grain
production, one of the key indicators of China's agriculture, increased by
about one-third (100 million t) over the same period. However, several
major problems have emerged in recent years. First, state investment in
agriculture has declined, dropping from Y5.3 to Y3.7 billion during
1978-86, or from 10.6% to only 3.1% of total state capital construction.
The investment downturn in the rural sector has contributed to increasing
bottlenecks in infrastructure (roads, power, and market facilities) and a
minor decrease in irrigated area.  Second, of great concern to the
government, a 5% decline in grain production has occurred since the record
harvest (407 million t) of 1984. Host observers ascribe this development
to continuing rigidities in the pricing of grain, while liberalization of
markets for high valued products (fruit, meat, fish, eggs, milk, silk,
shrimp, etc.) provides much stronger income incentives for farmers and
villages.
3. The Government has responded to these problems by reversing the decline
in state investment in agriculture which was increased to Y4.4 billion in
1987, with priority given to irrigation. Objectives for agriculture during
the plan period are to maintain per capita grain consumption at current
levels while continuing to diversify the overall output structure to
accommodate changing consumer preferences. This means increasing food
grain output to 450 million t by 1995 to match population growth, boosting
production of fruits,' vegetables, meat, poultry, fish and cash crops, and.
expanding output of processed products. To achieve sector growth, Chinese
planners, on the one hand, ire calling for technology improvement and
maintaining sown area at current levels, and on the other, are supporting a
series of systemic reforms which include: a) allowing diverse forms of
enterprise ownership and management to encourage growth of agroprocessing,
transport, and commerce; b) establishing legal guarantees to farmers



* 2 -
regarding land use rights and ownership of assets; and c) expanding
marketing channels and introducing some measure of price decontrol.
4.       The Bank Group's lending to date has ineluded 18 operations
involving a total assistance of about $1.6 billion for land development;
support services including agricultural training, research, credit and seed
production; development of specialized product subsectors including rubber,
forestry and fisheries; and area development projects combining irrigation,
crop and livestock production. More recently the Bank is supporting the
reform program through the Rural Sector Adjustment Loan. Implementation of
these projects is generally on schedule. Future Bank Group lending would
continue to support projects in large and diverse subsectors, e.g.,
livestock, forestry, irrigation, agroprocessing, area development, and
rural credit (which supports a broad range of activities).
5.       Rationale for IDA Invovemnt. The project fits in with the Bank
Group's strategy to support Government's efforts to diversify agriculture
and to promote alternative employment and income opportunities in rural
areas. Apart from resource transfer, tho major Bank Group contribution
would be in upgrading project design, financial and economic analyses to
eliminate unviable investments, regional feed requirement planning, and
technical innovation, particularly in relation to livestock breed
improvement and feedmill and agroprocessing plant design.
6.       Pro1ect Obiectivs.  The main objective of the project would be to
assist the Jiangxi Provincial Government to accelerate and diversify
agricultural development. The proposed project is intended to improve the
productivity and incomes of participating farmers, communities, and local
governments and move farm operations from a subsistence level to commercial
orientation. It also seeks to utilize lands which are unproductive or
unsuitable for grains or other crops.
7.       aroleet Iene LRnti. The proposed project consists of the
following components: a) livestock development - establishment of livestock
and poultry breeding farms and assistance to households through
construction of sheds and pens and provtsion of breeding stock, b)
aquaculture development - construction and improvement of ponds, barriers,
pens and cages for fish culture and establishment of a pearl farming area,
c) forestry development - establishment of slash pine plantations, d) tea
development - rehabilitation of tea gardens, e) agroprocessing -
establishment and improvement of feedmills and facilities for processing
pork, aquatic poultry, tea, resin and raw materials for feedmills, and f)
training and technical assistance - carrying out programs for staff
development and training to upgrade research, extension and project
management. The tea component is justified as an exception to the Bank's
policy on lending for tea because i) the component would be for
rehabilitation of existing piaatations with very limited incremental
production, ii) the tea variety involved (Congou) has only a limited
global export potential, and its incremental production under the project
would have virtually no effect on the world tea market, especially in the
context of a steady increase in China's own tea consumption, and iii) the
project area offers no other economically viable investment opportunities.
Agroprocessing facilities would be established or improved to increase the



-3-
value-added of project output, to provide formula feed for the project
livestock and fish, and to demonstrate proper methods to organize, manage
and finance upgraded processing and handling facilities. The project also
has a short-term credit element which would cover establishment costs which
could be repaid within one production cycle, e.g. day-old ducks and geese,
fish fingerlings, sows, feed, labor and other production costs; these funds
would then be available for recycling to other project participants and
ultimately for expanding the scope of production activities. The project,
to be carried out over 5 years, provides funds for civil works, buildings,
equipment, machinery, vehicles, training, technical assistance, and init'al
working capital. The total project cost is US$121.7 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$32.6 million (27%). Retroactive financing
of up to US$3 million is being recommended for expenditures made after
February 1, 1989. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and
the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively, and a map is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7664-CHA, dated May 19, 1989, is being
distributed separately.
8.      Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the followsing:  a)
the standards and methods of afforestation would be subject to consultation
with IDA from time to time in order to ensure consistency of objectives and
approach between this project and the Forestry Sector Loan under
preparation, b) the provincial government would ensure that sufficient
funds for the procurement of raw materials to produce feed of suitable
quality would be available for project livestock, c) project activities
would be carried out in conformity with national and provincial
environmental control standards acceptable to IDA, and d) project funds
would be onlent to borrowers and sub-borrowers at interest rates no less
than those charged by the Agricultural Bank of China for similar purposes
and similar maturities, such rates to be reviewed with IDA from time to
time.
9.       Benefits. At full development, annual incremental production
would amount to about 12 million ducks and geese, 26,000 t of eggs, 300,000
pigs, 19,000 t of fish, 2 t of pearls, and 5,300 t of tea. The value of
annual incremental output from project investments would be about US$128
million. Over the 20-year life of the project, the forestry component
would produce some 59,000 m3 of pulpwood, 579,000 ,3 of logs and poles and
88,000 t of resin. The project would increase incomes for some 18,650 farm
families, create about 8,285 permanent jobs and provide annual employment
of casual labor equivalent to about 540 jobs. Ecological benefits, in the
form of soil and water conservation, would be gained from the afforestation
schemes and tea rehabilitation. The internal economic rate of return is
39%.
10.      Risks.  The project faces no unusual technical, organizational or
financial risks. For the livestock components, the Jiangxi Animal
Husbandry Bureau has demonstrated its capability to recruit and train
households capable of successful pig and poultry production and of serving
as models for other farmers to emulate. There is some risk that adequate



- 4 -
supplies of feod raw materials would not be available In the province to
meet livestock feod demand; to minimize thls rlsk, the provincial
government has agreed to make funds available for purchasing such materials
eSither domestically or abroad. The project will be implemented by the
Jiangxi Agricultural Development Corporation, which has successfully
implemented the Bank Group-financed Red Soils Project (Credit 1733-CGA).
11.      RecommendatioLn.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Associatioak and recommend that
the Executive D:rectors approve the proposed credit.
