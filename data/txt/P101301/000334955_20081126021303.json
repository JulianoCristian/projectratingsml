This DPL is the third in a\n            series of three loans supporting the government's\n            efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\n            It particularly supports Goal seven which seeks to ensure\n            environmental sustainability, Target nine which aims to\n            integrate the principles of sustainable development into\n            country policies and programs, Target ten which aims to\n            reduce the proportion of people without sustainable access\n            to safe drinking water and sanitation, and Target eleven\n            which aims to achieve a significant improvement in the lives\n            of the urban poor. The first loan (SusDevDPL I),completed in\n            FY06, focused on the initial steps of building a\n            results-based framework for monitoring sustainable\n            development goals, improving interinstitutional coordination\n            mechanisms, and beginning preparation of critical decrees,\n            while the second (SusDevDPL II),completed in FY08, focused\n            on the development and passage of sustainable development\n            policies. Annex two provides an overview of the achievements\n            reached under the first and second operation. The SusDevDPL\n            III continues efforts to prepare critical sustainable\n            development policies, strengthen Sistema Nacional de\n            Ambiente (SINA) agencies, and implement a system to monitor\n            regional and national environmental performance."}, "docdt": "2008-11-13T00:00:00Z"}
