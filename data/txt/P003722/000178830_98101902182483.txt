INTERNATIONAL DEVELOFMEWT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND R2COMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$13.2
million on stanidard IDA terms to help finance a population project.   The
project would be financed jointly with the United Nations Fund for Pbpulation
Activities (UNFPA) which would make a grant of US$13.2 million.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        Indonesia has received seventeen IDA credits for a total amount
of US$231.4 million.   In addition, the Executive Directors have approved, on
February 22 and 29 respectively, a $12.5 million credit for a fourth irrigation
rehabilitation project and a $6.3 million credit for a second education
(agricultural) project.   These credits will be signed shortly.   A summary
statement of IDA credits and IFC investments is attached as Annex I. Credits
experiencing delays in disbursement, as well as the overall disbursement rate
of the Indonesian lending program, are described in paragraphs 2 to 5 of the
report (P-1021) distributed to the Executive Direotors on Fbbruary 9 (IDA/R/72-14
in connection with the consideration of the credit for the fourth irrigation
project.
3.        The Association's lending program in Indonesia reflects the
rehabilitation and development priorities established.by the Government and
is described inthe above-mentioned report.   The proposed project is one
important indication of the increasing priority attached by the Government to
investments in the social sectors.
PART II - THE ECCNCMY
4.        Recent information on Indonesials economic performance and prospects,
which continue to. be satisfactory, was included in the report (P-1021) mentioned
above.   Supplementary data on sources of aid to Indonesia is given in Annex
II of this report.   More comprehensive information on aid, and on the econouy
generally, is contained in the latest Bank economic report on Indonesia (EAP-27a)
dated November 30, 1971.
PART III - THE POPULATION SECTOR
5.        Indonesia's population of about 121 millon ranks among the world's
largest (fifth), is growing at a relatively high annual rate (2.6%), and is
one of the vorld's poorest (annual per capita income of less than $100).
Nearly two-thirds of this population live on the islands of Java and Bal.,



-2-
two of the most heavily populated regions of the world with an average density
of about 575 persons per square km.   It is unlikely that living standards can
be significantly raised unless the rate of population gro6th ia slowed.    The
Government is aware of this problem and has given strong policy support to a
national family planning program.   In 1970 it established a National Family
Planning Coordinating Board (NFPCB) to take over and expand a program which
had been initiated by a voluntary organization.    The support.of.religious
leaders is increasing and there is little overt opposition to the Government's
program.   Progress to date has been encouraging, but much higher numbers of
continuing acceptors are necessary before any significant effect on the birth
rate can be expected.
6.        The Government's 1972-1977 family planning program is primarily
confined to Java and Bali and to carryi t out in full would call for a total
outlay of about US$85 million during the five years.    The, program is based on
the recommendations of a UN-WHO-IBRD mission which visited Indonesia in 1969 in
response to a Government request for assistance in drawing up a national program.
Over 80% of family planning services is now delivered by the facilities and staff
of the health services; other implementing units, such as voluntary organizations
and the military, account for the remainder.   To support the family planning
effort; an extensive motivation program has been started which uses non-medical
field workers and a variety of communications media.   For the implementation
of the national program, Indonesia is also receiving financial and technical
assistance from USAID, Japan, Sweden, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, IPPF, the Population
Council, and the Ford Foundation.   In 1970 such external assistance amounted
to about US$3 million.   Aid is currently adequate to meet the needs for con-
traceptives and exi'sting cammitments will be increased to meet demands as the
program expands.   Should there be any shortfall, however, ,the Government would
use its own resources for the procurement of contraceptives.
7.        Th carry through its program, the Government must greatly expand the
scale of its efforts.   This will involve a sizeable construction program, an
expansion of health services personnel, a major training effort, the building
up of demographic research, and the farther improvement of the statistical
reporting system.   All this calls for large increases in budgetary allocations,
and considerable help from abroad in the form of capital and technical assistance.
The proposed project, which forms an important part of the national program,
is designed to provide such assistance.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
8.        The proposed project, which is deacribed in the attached Appraisal
Report (PP-8a), has two unusual features.   It represents a unique experiment
in international cooperation in the field of population.    It would be financed
jointly with the UNFPA; and 'WHO, UNESCO, UNICEF and the Population Council
would assist the Government in implementing certain components (see paragraph
18).   It is also the first Bank Group project which, over a five-year period,
provides financing for a large number of the elements essential for the success
of a population project.



-3-
9.        The main objective of the project is to increase greatly the scale
of the Government's family planning program and to broaden the range of its
activities.   It is estimated that as a result of the project the number of
new acceptors of family planning would increase to a level more than three
times higher than would be reached without the project.   The current level
is about 270,000 acceptors per year.   Without the project, this might rise
to around 500S,000 per year by 1975s  with the project, 1.6 million is probableO
While it is difficult to measure the economic impact of this kind of comprehensive
population project, it clearly represents one of the most efficient means of
attempting to increase per capita incomes.   Other benefits of the project include
the reduction of unemployment and improvement of health conditions (see Part VI
of the Appraisal Report).
10.       The main elements of the project ares   (i) a ten-fold increase of
non-medical field workers, (ii) construction and staffing of schools for the
training of all categories of existing staff in the national program as well
as for the training of additional paramedical staff, (iii) preparation of
curricula and other programs for the introduction on a national scale of educa-
tion in the field of population, (iv) strengthening and expansion of the research
capability of NFPCB, (v) rehabilitation and expansion of family planning centers,
(vi) construction of administrative centers for NFPCB in Djakarta and in the
provinces, and (vii) provision of vehicles to meet the transport requirements
arising from the expansion of staff.   To assist the Government with implemen-
tation, the project also includes a sizeable component of technical assistance.
The construction element of the project involves more than three hundred widely
dispersed structures, of which some 290 are small maternal and child health/
family planning centers.   The construction and service elements of the project
are concentrated in East Java, Bali and Djakarta, while the institution-building
aspects and the training, research, evaluation and technical assistance components
will benefit the entire national program.
11.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be $33 million including
contingencies, of which $12.8 mlllion (38 percent) represents foreign exchange,
and $20.2 million. (62 percent) local costs.  Of the total cost, about 36 percent
is for civil works, 28 percent for incremental operating costs, 17 percent for
technical assistance (including advisory services, consultants' fees, fellowships
and research funds), 10 percent for vehicles and spares, and 9 percent for equip-
ment and furniture.
12.       The Association would finance 40 percent ($13.2 million) and the UNFPA,
on a grant basis, an equal amount.   The UNFPA at this time can commit uncon-
ditionally only $9.3 million, and the $3.9 million balance of ita contribution
is pledged subject only to the availability of funds.    The Government would
finance 20 percent ($6.6 million) of the cost of the project, and would be liable
to finance up to an additional $3.9 million in the unlikely event that UNFPA is
unable to provide the conditional portion of its pledge and no other external
finance were found.   The relatively small contribution of the Government to the
project should be viewed in light of the fact that the project is only part of
the national family planning program to which the Government has a financial
commitment far in excess of its contribution to this project.



13.       Under the proposed arrangements, which have been agreed with UNFPA,
the Association would administer and disburse the UNFPA grant. The Association
would be responsible for supervising the carrying out of the project, but would
consult UNFPA prior to jiving any consent or approval on matters which fall
outside the normal course of implementation and supervision.    The Association
would obtain the concurrence of UNFPA prior to approving (i) the arrangements
between the abvernment and other agencies for implementation of the components
described in paragraph 18 below, and (ii) the three advisors to the senior
management of NFPCB.   These arrangements are set forth in a draft tripartite
Joint Financing Agreement among IDA, UNFPA and the Gbvernment.
14.       The proposed disbursement arrangements are such that the Association
and UNFPA would share equally so far as posaible in financing the full capital
costs of the project, net of Indonesian sales taxes, as well as a portion of
the incremental operating costs (on a declining scale, meeting 80%, 60%, 40%
and 20% of such costs in the first through the fourth years rfd4ectively).
The obvernment's contribution would finance on an increasing scale the remainder
of the incremental operating costs (reaching 100 percent in the fifth year).
The incremental salaries and maintenance costs involved in the project represent
a permanent build-up in the level of operating costs as a result of the project.
IDA and UNFPA participation, on a declining scale, is intended to support the
Covernment's efforts to devote increasing resources to this sector.
15.       The Joint financing arrangements provide that as a general rule an
equal amount of the UNFPA grant and of the IDA credit would be disbursed against
each withdrawal application.   This may not always be possible in practice.   At
the request of UNFPA, procurement would not be limited to members of the Bank
and Switzerland, but would be extended to all members of the United Nations.
IDA would not disburse in respect of procurement in non-member countries other
than Switzerland.   For its part, UNFPA may have restrictions on the use of its
funds for procurement in certain member countries of the Bank.    In the event
that one party could not disburse, the other could, at its option, agree to
finance more than half of the withdrawal application.    Should these circumstances
lead to unequal drawings on the credit and the grant over a period of time, the
Government, the Association and UNFPA would oonsult on what steps might be taken
to restore the parity of disbursement as between the credit and the grant.    If
the conditional portion of-the UNFPA pledge were not to become available, the
Association would have no obligation to increase the proportion of each withdrawal
application to be financed out of the credit.   Under the proposed arrangements,
it is expected that approximately $6.8 million of the credit would be disbursed
against local currency costs.
16.       With the exoeption of the NFPCB headquarters building in Djakarta,
which will be put out to international competitive bidding, the construction
included in the project consists of small and scattered units unlikely to be of
interest to international contractors; in the case of these latter works,
therefore, invitations for pre-qualifioation, which would be required in all
cases, would appear only in the local press.    Contracts for equipment and



furniture - totalling about US$2.0 million - would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding.   Dbmestic manufacturers of furniture and
equipment would be accorded a preferential margin equal to 15 percent of the
c.i.f. costs of competing imports or to the wdasting rate of duty, whichever
is the lower. Vehicles would be procured with the assistance of UNICEF on
the basis of international oompetitive bidding, except where the Association
and the Government agree that for purposes of fleet standardization, vehicles
should be procured under UNICEF's long-tenm bulk-purchasing arrangements with
manufacturers. . The case for standardization is ourrently being reviewed by
the Resident Staff, in conjunction with UNICEF's transport advisor in Djakarta.
17.       The Mini3tries of Health, of Educations of Infonmation and of Public
Works, a number of Provincial Administrations3 and certain international
organizations and agencies, will participate in the project.   The NFFCB will
be responsible for the overall administration and coordination of project
activities.   Because of the complexity of the projeot and the relative
inexperience of NFPCB, implementation will be difficult.    The project includes
a number of provisions for strengthening the management of NFPCB.   These
include: (i) the reorganization of the NFPCB; (ii) the setting up of a three-
man team of international experts to advise the senior management of NFPCB
on programming, training and communications aspects of the national program
(UNFPA has already advanced funds for this purpose against its contribution
to the project and the advisors are being recruited); (iii) the establishment
and staffing of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the NFPCB; (iv) .
the retention of management consultants to assist the PIU; (v) the establish-
ment under the auspices of the PIU of an implementation committee on which
senior staff of other Ministries involved in project implementation as well as
international agencies and foundations participating in the project would be
represented; (vi) the appointment of the School of Architecture of the Institute
of Technology at Bandung (or other qualified architects) for the design of the
facilities included in the project and for the supervision of constraction.
18.       In addition, the Government would associate other agencies with the
implementation of specific project components, and funds for the expertise and
services to be provided by these agencies would be jointly financed by IDA and
UNFPA.   WHO is expected to assist the Government with the hospital postpartum
program, UNESCO with the communications and population education components,
UNICEF with vehicle procurement and maintenance, and the Population Council
with the demonstration field postpartum program.   An association with these
agencies is regarded as important to the long-term development of the Indonesian
national program.   These agencies have indicated to the Association that they
are ready to assist with the above components if called upon by the Government.
We would look to the Government, through its arrangements with these agencies,
to carry out the project and, in accordance with their wishes, there would be
no direct contractual relationship between these agencies and the Association.

the Association, the Recommendation of the ODmmittee provided for in Article
V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed credit, are being distributed to

Total          20.2       12.8       33.0
Procurement    All procurement under the project would be open to member countries
Arrangements: of the Bank and the United Nations.     Contracts for the NFPCB
headquarters and for equipment and furniture - totalling about
$2.3 million - would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding.   With the exception of the NFPCB headquarters
building in Djakarta, the constructions included in the project
consist of small and scattered units unlikely to be of interest to
international contractors.   These works, therefore, would not be
advertised internationally, but contracts would be awarded on a
competitive basis after bidding by pre-qualified contractors.
Domestic manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be accorded
a preferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of competing
imports or to the existing rate of duty, whichever is the lower.
Vehicles would be procured with the assistance of UNICEF on the
basis of international competitive bidding, except where the Associ-
ation. and the Government agree that for purposes of fleet standard-
ization, vehicles should be procured under UNICEF's long-term bulk-
purchasing arrangements with manufacturers.   The case for standard-
ization is currently being reviewed by the Resident Staff, in
conjunction with UNICEF's regional transport advisor.   In all other
respects procurement under the Credit and the UNFPA grant would be
conducted in accordance with the Association's Guidelines.
1/ UNFPA can provide only $9.3 million of this amount unconditionally;
the balance, $3.9 million, is pledged subject to the availability of
funds.

Disbursement   The Association would disburse 50% of the capital costs of the
Arrangements: project excluding Indone*ian sales taxes as well as a portion
of the incremental operating costs (on a declining scale meeting
40%, 30%, 20% and 10% of such costs in the first through fourth
years respectively).   The joint financing arrangements provide
that as a general rule an equal amount of the UNFPA grant and of
the IDA credit would be disbursed against each withdrawal appli-
cation. This may not always be possible in practice. At the
request of UNFPA, procurement would not be limited to members of
the Bank and Switzerland, but would be extended to all members of
the United Nations. IDA would not disburse in respect of pro-
curement in non-member countries other than Switzerland.   For its
part, UNFPA may have restrictiona on the use of its funds for
procurement in certain member oountries of the Bank.    In the
event that one party could not disburse, the other could, at its
option, agree to finance more than half of the withdrawal appli-
cation. Should these circumstances lead to unequal drawings on
the credit and the grant over a period of time, the Government,
the Association and UNFPA would consult on what steps might be
taken to restore the parity of disbursement as between the credit
and the grant.   The Association would finance retroactively half
of the expenditures incurred, if any, since February 1, 1972
for the three advisors to the senior management of NFPCB.

consultants, and advisors and other experts on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association.
