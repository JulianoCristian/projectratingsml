Development Policy\n            Loan (DPL) program is to support the Government of Morocco\n            (GoM) in implementing its program of reforms aimed at\n            improving the financial, environmental and social\n            performance of the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco.\n            Major issues and challenges faced in the sector include: (i)\n            a weak legal and institutional framework, which constrains\n            effective governance of the sector; (ii) poor cost\n            effectiveness of services; with doubtful long-term financial\n            sustainability of the sector; (iii) the urgent need for\n            integrated and modernized solid waste management systems,\n            which will mitigate negative economic, environmental, and\n            social impacts of the existing systems; and (iv) missed\n            opportunities available under international climate change\n            mechanisms i.e. the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), while\n            supporting the global effort in climate change mitigation.\n            There are three key risks associated with the DPL program:\n            1) Morocco's macro economy has so far weathered the\n            negative impact of the global financial crisis because its\n            financial sector was relatively insulated from the global\n            context. However, it is facing the impact of the global\n            economic downturn and is taking the necessary measures to\n            respond; 2) commitments to the reform and implementation\n            capacity risks: (i) weakening of political consensus and\n            commitment for municipal solid waste reforms which may delay\n            or impact the effective implementation of the program. This\n            risk is mitigated by a strong and continuous cross sector\n            dialogue and consultation through the established National\n            Commission for the Program; and (ii) weak capacity to\n            implement complex sector reforms at the municipal level may\n            affect the program's results on the ground; and 3) lack\n            of social acceptance of reforms by the public including the\n            waste pickers and service users. This is being mitigated\n            respectively through the implementation of a social\n            inclusion program targeting waste pickers and through\n            increasing accountability of the service providers for\n            improved quality."}, "docdt": "2009-02-24T00:00:00Z"}
