                    The development objective of the DPL program is to support the GoM
                    in implementing its program of reforms aimed at improving the
                    financial, environmentaland social performance of the municipal solid
                    waste sector in Morocco. The first DPL (DPL1) supports the key
                    foundationsofthe Government's reform program, which establishesthe
                    enabling environment for an integratedand affordable municipal solid
                    waste system. The planned second DPL (DPL2)' which will be
                    presented for Board approvalby March 2011, will support capitalizing
                    on the momentum gained during the first operationwhile deepeningthe
                    reform through results-orientedactions at the regional and municipal

Program             level.

Development
Objective(s)and     The solid waste sector was not specifically identified as a strategic

Contribution to CAS objective in the 2005 Morocco CAS (31879-MA of June 14, 2005).
                    However, the proposed operation will contribute to achieving the
                    CAS'S first strategic objective of "Improving Competitiveness and
                    Business Climate" by stimulating partnerships between the private
                    sector and local government and by increasing Morocco's
                    competitiveness as a tourist destination. It will also contribute to the
                    second strategic objective of "Increasing access to basic services by
                    poor and marginalized groups", as the improved solid waste services
                    will cover the urban poor and will support social inclusion of informal
                    waste pickers. In addition, the proposed DPL will contribute to the
                    CAS'Scross-cuttingobjective of improving public governance.

                    There are three key risks associatedwith the DPL program:

                    Macroeconomic risk associated with the globalfinancial contraction
                    and economic slowdown: Morocco's macroeconomy has so far
                    weathered the negative impact of the global financial crisis because it's
                    financial sector was relatively insulated from the global context.
                    However, it is facing the impact of the global economic downturn and
                    i s taking the necessarymeasuresto respond.The MoroccanMinistry of
                    Finance forecasts a growth rate of 5.5 percent in 2009, mainlyjustified
                    by the good winter rains. However, a sharper contraction in partner
                    countries would see growth lower by 1-1'hpercent of GDP, resultingin
                    the IMF growth estimate of 4.5 percent in 2009. The fiscal stimulus
                    package announced for 2009 should help to maintaindomestic demand,
                    but is modest enough that the risk of macro-economic instability is low,

Risksand Risk       as is the risk of fiscal pressures compromising the implementation of

Mitigation          the nationalgovernment's solid waste program.

                    Commitments to the reform and implementation capacity risks: (i)
                    Weakeningof political consensus and commitment for municipal solid
                    waste reforms which may delay or impact the effective implementation
                    of the program.This risk is mitigatedby a strongand continuous cross-
                    sector dialogue and consultation through the established National
                    Commission for the Program; and (ii)weak capacity to implement

PROPOSEDMUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                               TO THE KINGDOMOF MOROCCO


                                        I. INTRODUCTION

1 .       Most Moroccan cities are characterized by high population densities and rapid growth and
suffer from several forms of environmental degradation. Out of a total population of 30 million, 18
million live in urban areas. With the urban population growing at 2.85 percent per year and per capita
consumption increasing, municipal solid waste management has become one of the most serious
environmentalchallenges in urbanareas, with adverse effects on the quality of life, human health, natural
resources and the environment, and economic and socialdevelopment.

2.        Since independence,Morocco's municipal solid waste services have been defined only in terms
of "cleanliness", with the mainfocus on waste collection and limited attention and resource allocation
to waste disposal. This has led to significant environmental and social impacts. Morocco currently
produces about 5.0 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) per year,' a figure that could reach 6.2
million tons by 2020. In the absence of an active and strategic role at the central government level, most
municipalitiesequate solidwaste management (SWM) only with the removal of waste from visible public
areas. Waste disposal in sanitary landfills has been entirely neglected by municipalities, and waste is
generallydisposedin open dumps.

3,        Environmental degradation, which the Mediterranean Environment Technical Assistance
Program (METAP) has estimated costs at least 3.7percent of GDP (2003)) is a significant hindrance to
Morocco's development, as it impacts the health of citizens and environmental resources and interferes
with Moroccan integration into the environmentally conscious EU and US markets.                              Litter and
accumulations of solid waste along roadsides and channels jeopardize the country's high tourism
potential. The contribution of poor solid waste management to the cost of environmental degradation is
estimated at around MAD 1.7 billion per year (or 0.5 percent of GDP), one of the highest levels in the
Middle East andNorth Africa region(0.2 percent in Egypt and 0.1 percent in Algeria, Lebanon, Syriaand
Tunisia).

4.        Major issues and challenges faced in the sector include: (i)a weak legal and institutional
framework, which constrains effective governance of the sector; (ii)poor cost effectiveness of services;
with doubtful long-term financial sustainability of the sector; (iii)the urgent need for integrated and
modernized solid waste management systems, which will mitigatenegative economic, environmental,and
social impacts of the existing systems; and (iv) missed opportunities availableunder internationalclimate
change mechanisms i.e. the Clean DevelopmentMechanism(CDM), while supportingthe global effort in
climatechange mitigation.

5.        Due to its impacts on the quality of life, public health, environmental and natural resources,
and vital economic activities such as tourism, S W M is now recognized as a top priority by the



  MSW includes non-hazardous waste generated in households, commercial and business establishments, institutions and light
industrial processwastes.

Government. The Governmenthas taken two key and significant first steps toward the reform of SWM.
First, the Solid Waste Management Law 28-00 was passed inNovember, 2006. Second, it has developed
and approved the Programme National de Gestion des De`chets Me`nagers (PNDM - the National
Municipal Solid Waste Management Program), which is a 15-year, 3-phase program launched in 2008 in
support of Law 28-00. The PNDM was formally adopted by the newly appointed Government in its
programannounced in October 2007 and sets out, among other objectives, service and disposal standards
for urban areas, quantitative goals for collection coverage (90 percent by 2021), the introduction of
sanitary landfills (100 percent of urbanareas equipped by 2021), and the closure and rehabilitationof 300
existingopen dumps as well as the promotionof solid waste reduction, recovery and valorization.

6.        The PNDM is one of the core elements of the Government's overall reform program for
Municipal SWM (MSWM). The reform prggram, which overlays the PNDM, targets three areas of
reform:


     0    Enhance the governance of the sector through additional legal, regulatory, and institutional
          measures designed to establisha clear framework for the sector, eliminating overlap and/or gaps
          inthe policy-making, regulatory,andoperationalstructure;


     0    Improve the sustainability of the sector through the introduction of financial mechanisms and
          incentives for municipalities designed to support the sustainability of investments and services;
          and

     0    Mainstream social and environmental considerations into the planning, implementation, and
          operations of municipal solidwaste services and investments.

7.        Theproposed Municipal Solid Waste Sector Development Policy Loan has been requested by
the GoM to support the implementation of policy reforms andprograms in the solid waste sector. The
proposed operation is the first DPL in a programmatic series of up to two DPLs designed to provide
budget support and to solidify, sustain and deepen the implementationand impact of the municipal solid
waste reform programin Morocco.

8.        An overall agreement has been reached with the Government on the scope of the reforms
supported under the proposed operation. This agreement is supported by the Letter of Sector
DevelopmentPolicy and the policy matrix, attached in Annexes 1 and 2 respectively.As agreed with the
Government, the reform program is expected to be fully implemented over the next 4 years. Support for
the reforms has been structured into two single-trancheDPL operations that include measures as triggers
accordingto their readiness for implementationand expected impact on improvedSWM.

9.        Theproposed DPL of Euro 100 million was developed under the umbrella - and in support          -
of the GoM's reform program in order to ensure full ownership of the process, actions and outcomes. It
i s the first DPL operation Bankwide in the solid waste sector and the first Bank operation in this area in
Morocco.

A.        RECENTECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTSINMOROCCO

10.       Morocco features sound macroeconomic fundamentals. The economy is characterized by
macroeconomic stability, solid growth, low inflation and declining unemployment, a strong external
position, and sound fiscal balances (Figure 1). Consequently, Morocco's sovereign debt was rated as
investment grade in 2007 and again inJune 2008, despite unfavorableworld conditions.

                                                   6

11.       The economy has been undergoing a structural shiji featuring faster growth in
nonagricultural output. The vigor o f the nonagricultural sector continues to be driven by dynamism in
the postal and telecommunications, finance and insurance, and construction and public works sectors.
Structural reforms and liberalization and privatization policies have transformed these sectors into fast-
growing areas. The three sectors have been growing between 8 and 10 percent per year on average over
the last five years.

     0    The postal and telecommunications sector grew by 11.2 percent inthe first nine months o f 2008,
          fueled by the diversification o f services and the emergence o f a third private cell phone company,
          which triggered more competition and further reductions in prices.

     0    The financial and insurance sector grew 19.1 percent in the nine months o f 2008, reflecting
          increasing demand for financial services from individuals and firms, invigorated by improved
          access to credit and lower interest rates.

     0    The construction and public works sector confirmed its steady dynamism, increasing by 10.1
          percent in the first nine months o f 2008, 1 percentage point more than its performance over the
          previous five years. It benefits from important public infrastructure projects and tourism and
          housing programs. Further strength of the sector came about as a result o f the use o f public-
          private partnership policies and the transfer o f public land to private ownership.

12.       The sound development o f these three sectors translated into a significant change in the structure
o f production over the last decade. Their total share in GDP gained 5.3 percentage points since 1998,
mostly at the expense o f the manufacturingand agricultural sectors.

13.      Strong growth is estimatedfor 2008. The pattern o f growth continues to mirror the cycles o f the
agricultural sector, although with less intensity owing to more vigorous and stable nonagricultural
activities. The agricultural sector, although still below the sector's average performance, improved
substantially compared to 2007; agricultural value added increased by 10.4 percent between January and
September 2008. Despite the unfavorable global economic context and a consequent slowdown in the
second half o f the year, Morocco's growth rate is therefore expected to be 5.8 percent in 2008, up from
2.7 percent in 2007.

14.      The global economic downturn is having a moderate impact in Morocco. Although direct
impacts upon the Moroccan financial sector are small, given its limited linkages to international financial
markets, the decline in world demand i s reducing Morocco's current account receipts from remittances,
merchandise exports and tourism, as well as FDI receipts. As at end-November 2008, remittances were
down 2.4 percent, tourism by 3.5 percent, and FDIby 23.3 percent, while the country's largest phosphate
producer - the Oflee Che`rifien des Phosphates temporarily suspended production. Nonetheless,
economic indicators suggest that activity overall remains solid, with strong credit growth continuing, as
well as resilient activity in construction, services, and agriculture.

15.      Infation is expected to edge up to 3.9percent in 2008, while unemployment will be around 9.7
percent. Since 2000, inflation has been less than 2 percent on average, but it is expected to reach 3.9
percent by end-2008, compared to 2.0 percent for the same period in 2007. Inflation is driven by rising
food prices (up 6.8 percent), reflecting higher import prices and the impact o f drought on domestic
production. Both these factors are expected to be reversed in 2009 as a result o f global recession and
improved rains in Morocco. Policies to control domestic prices - food and fuel subsidies, temporary
waivers on customs duties for cereals, and actions to fight price speculation - have helped contain
inflation. On the employment front, strong economic performance has kept the unemployment rate in
single digits (9.5 percent over Jan-Sept 2008), although urban youth and graduates still suffer from high
unemployment rates (3 1.3 percent and 20.2 percent, respectively).

16.      The current account is expected to run a small temporary deficit in 2008, primarily due to the
rise in import prices between January and September and, more recently, a decline in tourism revenues
and remittances from Moroccans living abroad. It is expected that the trade deficit would increase to
around 22 percent o f GDP (fob-fob: up from 19.2 percent in 2007), and that the current account would
post a deficit of around 3.5 percent o f GDP (provisional). These events are likely to lead to a decline in
the level o f foreign reserves, although the overall level remains comfortable.

 17.       The government maintained a satisfactory fiscal balance in 2008. The 2008 surplus came to
 0.1% of GDP (provisional) compared to a deficit of 0.1percent thepreviousyear. The rapid growth of
 revenues balanced out the budgetary impact of the rise of worldfood andfuel prices.                  Subsidies are
 expected to exceed MAD30 billion (MAD24 billion for fuels and MAD6 billion for food) by end 2008 -
 which is equivalent to 4.5 percent o f GDP. This amount would almost be double that o f 2007. In
 addition, about MAD4 billion (0.6 percent o f GDP) o f arrears will accumulate. Given the high cost o f
 food and fuel subsidies and the fact that they mostly benefit the non-poor, reforming the subsidy system is
 an urgent issue. The authorities are aware of the complexity o f the reform and are proceeding in stages.



 2 The budget balance here defines does not include the expenditures of the Hassan I1 Fund, which are around 0.3
 percent of GDP, but does not include privatization receipts, which were 0.5 percent in 2007 and 0.0 percent in 2008,
 and does not include foreign grants. Excluding FHII expenditures and including privatization receipts, the budget
 balance was a surplus of 0.7% in 2007 and a surplus of 0.4% in 2008. The 2008 figure has been updated since the
 IMF's January 2009 mission.

                                                         9

On July 1, 2008 the oil price indexation system was partially reactivated by increasing prices o f two fuel
products - premium gasoline and low sulfur diesel - which are mostly used for personal transportation.
The price increase is small, but allowed budget savings o f MAD650 million in 2008 - 0.1 percent o f
GDP).   The recent fallback in international food and fuel prices will reduce the cost o f commodity
subsidies, at least in the short run, and will create fiscal space in 2009 to carry out countercyclical fiscal
policy (notably, boosting spending on infrastructure and social services).

18.     Government revenues are buoyant. Fiscal revenues are expected to strengthen further to reach
27.4 percent o f GDP, benefiting from the ongoing tax reform. The main corporate tax measures taken in
2008 include the reduction o f the tax rate from 35 percent to 30 percent for non-financial institutions, and
from 39.6 percent to 37 percent for financial institutions. The VAT also benefited from new measures
with the aim o f simplification, transparency, and equity: the reduction in the deadline for VAT
reimbursement from four months to three months and further unification o f VAT rates by shifting
selected products and services taxed at a 14 percent rate to the normal 20 percent rate.

19.     Measures taken so far have yielded significant results, as revenues steadily increased by 16
percent per year on average during 2006-07. They continued to grow further in the first nine months o f
2008, at a high 23.2 percent on a year-over-year basis. Enhanced collection of corporate taxes and the
VAT explain most o fthis performance. Consequently, since 2006, the tax base has been reinforced by an
increase o f 25 percent o f businesses liable for corporate tax and 20 percent o f individuals for income tax.

20.     Total central government debt should slightly decline. Since 2006, total debt has remained
below the target threshold o f 60 percent o f GDP. Indeed, it is projected to decline to 49.7 percent o f GDP
by end-2008, down from 53.6 percent o f GDP in 2007. External debt will edge down to less than 10.5
percent o f GDP. Because of Morocco's generally sound macroeconomic policies, major rating agencies
have awarded an investment grade to Moroccan sovereign debt. They confirmed their rating in 2008,
although one Fitch revised its outlook from positive to stable in response to minor risks that may emerge
from a more difficult external environment, potentially affecting the banking sector.

21.     Structural reforms have continued their momentum in 2008. The Parliament adopted in July
2008 a new law on debt securitization, which will contribute to diversifying debt market instruments and
allow private and public economic operators to boost their financing and investment capacity. The
mission o f the soon-to-be-established Economic and Social Council (ESC) will be to propose economic
and social policies and play the role o f an open forum where social dialogue takes place on a regular and
transparent basis. The government has also operationalized the "Emergency Plan" o f the industrial sector
into a new Vision for the Development o f Industry (VDI), including the creation o f a new Investment
Development Agency. Finally, the authorities have announced a "Green Plan" for the development o f the
agricultural sector composed o f two pillars: one addressing growth in value added, and another addressing
rural poverty through income-generation activities.

B.             MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

22.         Over the medium term, Morocco is expected to preserve macroeconomic stability and
moderate to high growth (Table 2). While the Moroccan economy does not seem to have been strongly
affected by the world financial crisis - its banking system and capital markets have no direct exposure to
U.S.subprime assets and related securities -it has experienced moderate adverse effects o fthe unfolding
recession in its main trading partner countries. Moroccan banks are generally well capitalized and
profitable, and the government is encouraging them to use their 2008 profits to strengthen their capital in
order to reach a capital adequacy ratio o f 12 percent by end-2009. However, preliminary forecasts show

                                                                  11

that GDP growth in 2009 would continue to reflect sluggishexternal demand, slowing tourism activities,
stagnant workers remittances and FDI. However, the various forecasts available suggest that the impact
on Morocco will be moderate. A reasonable central estimate is that growth will be 4.5 percent in 2009.
Eventhe "low case" of 3.5 percent growth would not entailmacro-economicinstability. The good rains of
winter 2008-9 should mitigatethe impact of the reductionof external inflows, and this factor mayjustify
the Ministry of Finance's forecast of 5.5 percent growth in 2009. Consequently, the GDP growth rate is
projected to recover gradually after 2009, with domestic demand as its main driving force.
Nonagriculturaloutput growth should continue to grow at 5-6 percent a year, driven by construction,
telecommunications, highvalue-added industrial sectors and service activitieswith export potential.

23.      Despite the world recession, the external position is expected to remain sustainable in 2009
owing to gains inthe terms oftrade, despite a fall inworkers' remittances andtourism receipts. The trade
deficit is expected to improve owing to recedingworld commodity prices, particularly those of oil and
cereals, and more dynamic exports. With a manageablecurrent account deficit and steady inflows of FDI
and loans, the level of gross internationalreserves will remain at a comfortable level-above 7 months of
 imports. Investment and national savings ratios should remain high, at above 30 percent of GDP. To
judge from the experience of 2006-8, the future course of Morocco's external position will be largely
determined by world commodity prices.

24.      Thefiscal stance should remain sustainable. The fiscal accounts project two main outcomes
 during 2009. First, the fiscal balance should shift from a surplus of 0.1% to a deficit of 2.5%, with the
 exact value depending upon the global downturn's impact upon energy prices, upon the proposed fiscal
 stimulus package and upon revenue growth. The fiscal balance forecast is based upon the conservative
 assumptions of an oil priceof $lOO/barrelandof a large slowdowninthe growth of government revenues.
 A new element is the cost of the 2009 fiscal stimulus package, consistingof an increase in public sector
wages, higher pensions and family allowances, an 18 percent increase in public investment and reduced
 income tax rates of 1 to 3 percentage points across all income brackets, although in large part this is
 expected to be offset by the drop in subsidy payments. Second, the public debt should continue declining
 as a percent of GDP. Under a base case scenario, reaching both outcomes implies, first, success in
 ongoing tax reform to broaden the tax base, improve the efficiency of the VAT, strengthen tax
 administration, and remove tax exemptions. These measures would offset the negative impact of the
 proposed measures to lower the marginal rates on corporate and personal income taxes. If so, tax
 revenues are projectedto stabilize around 26 percent of GDP despite declining customs duties, resulting
 from compensatinghigher VAT and consumption taxes (up 0.5 percentage point of GDP) of the revenue
 losses arising from lower customs duties (down 0.4 percentage points) committed under the Free Trade

                                                        12

Agreements. Furthermore, these outcomes imply at least three critical expenditure measures: sustaining
the declining trend o f the wage bill (projected gains o f 0.4 percent o f GDP); reforming oil and food
subsidies (projected gains o f 1 percent o f GDP); and preserving an active debt management (interest
savings o f about 0.4 percent o f GDP).

25.     A comprehensivepublic debt sustainability analysis shows that thefiscalframework is robust
to downside risk in the medium term. The sustainability o f the fiscal framework is robust to shocks:
Under alternative scenarios, several shocks to the baseline scenario are simulated, and public debt
sustainability is preserved in all o f them. Inthe medium term, the performance o f the external accounts i s
also expected to remain strong, with ample foreign reserves (corresponding to about 7 months of imports)
helped with declining small deficits in the current account over 2009-11. Overall, these factors would
make external outstanding debt fall over 2009-2011.

26.       Budgetary financing needs should remain restrained in the short run.                     Projected
disbursements o f Municipal Solid Waste Sector DPL would help meet the Government's objective of
diversifying financing sources as well as provide financing on more favorable terms. This, in turn, would
support the Government's strategy o f fiscal consolidation and diversification o f financing sources. The
World Bank will cover a financing gap o f between US$300 million to US$350 million per year over the
projection period (Table 3).

27.       I n the medium term, the Moroccan economy remains vulnerable to adverse domestic and
external shocks. On the domestic front, risks arise from the possibility o f severe droughts and fall in
tourism receipts from potential security threats as well as worsening o f the global recession. If the
business environment worsens, this could affect exports, tourism, workers remittances, and FDI flows.
On the external front, possible main external shocks are: (i)a resurgence o f high international oil and food
prices, which would create inflationary pressures and worsen the trade deficit; (ii)a fall in main export
commodity prices, which would have a negative impact on the current account, as the export structure
remains concentrated in a few key exports; and (iii,tougher migration policies and possible decline in
workers' remittances due to the on-going recession in European markets. Labor recipient Schengen
countries, like Belgium, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy are enforcing tougher regulations on
migration. In addition, the per worker remittances sent by the current, so-called third generation o f
migrant workers is lower than the remittances sent by the previous generations. Combined, both factors

                                                        13

could contribute to slightly dampening the overall level o f remittances, even though so far they have
shown a remarkable degree o f resilience.


        111.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMAND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

A.       SOLID WASTE SECTOR ISSUES

28.       The legal and institutional framework for the solid waste sector is at an early stage of
development, constraining effective governance of the sector. In December, 2006 Morocco enacted its
first law on solid waste management - Solid Waste Management Law 28-00 - as well as laws on
environmental protection and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). However, executive regulations
remain to be prepared and adopted. As a result, monitoring, enforcement and compliance are ad hoc, at
best. There is an immediate need for the preparation and approval by the Government o f a relevant set o f
regulations, including those related to: (a) regional and local planning tools for solid waste management;
(b) waste classification and norms and standards for waste treatment and landfilling; (c) EIA procedures,
institutional review mechanisms, and related public consultation; (d) cost recovery instruments such as
solid waste fees (redevances des de`chets) and other financial instruments; and (e) modalities for
monitoring and supervision o f waste services at national, regional and municipal levels.

29.      In accordance with the Charte Communale o f 2002 as well as the new solid waste Law, the
collection,   transfer and disposal o f     I
municipal waste has been confirmed as         Box 2: Municipal managementof solid waste
the   responsibility o f municipalities,      The responsibilities of Moroccan municipalities with respect to
which are under the administrative            household waste are based in two laws: (i) Article 39 of Law 78-00, or
oversight o f the Ministry o f Interior       the Charte Communale, states that the elected municipal council is
(MoI). This decentralization was not          responsible"for the establishment and management of municipal public
accompanied by strengthening o f human        services, in particular in the following areas: the collection, transport,
                                              disposal and treatment of household and mixed waste"; and (ii) articles
and technical capacities in the local         16 through 23 of Law 28-00 define the specifics tasks of waste disposal
entities. Furthermore, S W M policies         and treatment, including planning, management and financing. With
have long suffered from: (i)insufficient      respect to financing, the law allows for user fees to be charged. These
coordination     between     and   within     municipal responsibilities are consistent with the delegation of other

relevant line ministries and an absence       local services to municipalities, such as water supply and sanitation,
                                              public lighting, urban transport, and the provision of cemeteries.
o f strategic planning; (ii)poor solid        Municipalities are administered by an elected municipal council, which

at regional and local levels; and (iii)       are consideredto have the approvalof the government

lack o f inter-municipal cooperation,
leading to inefficiencies and foregone economies o f scale. This situation has significantly affected the
quality and cost efficiency o f municipal solid waste management systems and prevented cost-effective
private sector involvement in the sector.

30.      During the last few years, attempts have been made toward the promotion o f private sector
provision o f municipal solid waste services. These include the enactment o f the new concession law as
well as the provision o f ad-hoc subsidies by the Direction Ge`ne`raledes Collectivite`s Locales (DGCL) for
municipalities to upgrade their municipal solid waste management. Recent figures show that private firms
collect two-thirds o f urban waste nationwide. However, there is a great need to improve competition and
transparency at the bidding stage, while also strengthening accountability at the municipal level as well as
enhancing the quality o f bidding documents. As an indicator o f the capacity to manage private sector
contracts, it has been reported that one-third o f ongoing contracts with private operators are experiencing
difficulties because o f inadequate bidding specifications, confusing contractual terms, unclear
performance measures, and lack o f capacity to supervise and enforce contracted services. Another

                                                      14

indicator o f low outsourcing capacity is the significant increase in unit costs when S W M services are
contracted out.

31.       Municipal Solid waste management services are not currently cost-effective, and achieving
long-term financial sustainability of the sector is a signijkant challenge. M S W M is one o f the largest
categories o f expenditures o f cities. Total recurrent municipal solid waste expenditures were estimated to
MAD 1.3 billion in 2007, or about 10.5 percent o f the total municipal budgets in urban areas. Of this
amount, MAD 1.1 billion, or 85 percent, i s allocated to collection and transfer services. Waste disposal is
today insignificant in terms o f allocated financial resources (less than MAD 200 million), as
municipalities have not had political, economic, or regulatory incentives to finance disposal facilities.

32.       Services contracted to private operators represent about MAD 900 million (2007), i.e. 70 percent
o f total spending on SWM. Inthe private sector, the average cost i s MAD 360 per metric ton, and exceeds
MAD 500 per ton in some cities. This average cost is slightly higher than costs usually encountered
internationally because o f several factors: (i)the limited size o f contracts (i.e,, o f the coverage area) and
immaturity o f the market, which does not favor strong competition; (ii)poor knowledge o f private sector
participation mechanisms, including differences between traditional public procurement (input-oriented
contracts) and output- or performance-based contracts; (iii)poorly designed contracts (use o f standard
bidding documents not customized for the specific local conditions, vague definition o f output
specifications, leading to differences o f interpretation and litigation during the operational phase, etc.);
and (iv) small contracts and loss o f economies o f scale due to the lack o f inter-municipal cooperation and
regional planning for disposal/treatment facilities.

33.       Additionally, the arrangements for financing municipal solid waste services are very poor. There
i s very limited knowledge o f the true costs o f service provision, and there are no provisions for cost
recovery. In general, current municipal solid waste expenditures are usually covered through the general
municipal budget o f each city. Notably, the General Directorate o f Local Communities (DGCL) has
recently established an ad-hoc financial support mechanism to benefit some o f the main cities (as part o f
the allocation o f a discretionary portion o f the VAT under the control o f the Ministry o f Interior (MoI)) to
partially cover the first 2-3 years o f private operator contracts. But the ad hoc nature o f these transfers
prevents municipalities relying on them for the long-term development o f solid waste services.

34.       Meeting the requirements o f the new solid waste law will have significant fiscal impacts for
municipalities. It is estimated that annual investment and operating costs will double from the 2006
amount to MAD 2.2 billion in 2012, an increase o f 14 percent per year. Recent analysis on sector
financial issues project annual financial shortfalls for municipalities o f MAD 300 million over the next 3
to 5 years, even assuming increases in municipal revenues and VAT transfers resulting from the
Government's overall tax reform program. This clearly shows that municipalities cannot afford - at least
in the short term - the additional costs of modernizing and sustaining M S W M without increased central
financing and/or improved cost-recovery arrangements.

35.       Morocco's municipal solid waste services have been defined in the past only in terms of
"cleanliness", with the mainfocus on waste collection and limited attention and resources allocated to
waste disposal. This has led to significant environmental and social impacts. Currently Morocco
produces about 5.0 million tons o f municipal waste per year, a figure that could reach 6.2 million tons by
2020. In the absence of a more active role and strategic guidance by the central government, most
municipalities equate M S W M only with the removal o f waste from visible public areas. Waste disposal in
sanitary landfills has beenneglected by municipalities, and waste has been disposed in open dumps.

36.       As a result o f this focus on "cleanliness", 70 percent o f municipal solid waste produced in urban
areas is being collected, while less than 10 percent of collected waste is being disposed o f in an
                                                      15

environmentally and socially acceptable manner. Problems resulting from disposal in about 300
uncontrolled dumpsites throughout the country include, inter alia: (i)poor location o f sites and failure to
meet environmental standards; (ii)uncontrolled access by informal waste-pickers and children; (iii)
uncontrolled access by domestic livestock to waste that includes infectious and toxic material; (iv)
commingled collection and disposal o f healthcare and industrial hazardous waste with regular household
waste; (v) lack o f safe and cost-effective waste treatment prior to final disposal of treatment residuals; and   I


(vi) lack o f incentives and programs to stimulate waste reduction and recycling. These practices pose
serious health concerns and safety hazards linked to air pollution and surface/ground water contamination
and adversely affect the tourist, export agriculture, and service sectors, which demand a clean and healthy
environment.

37.     In terms o f social concerns, about 3,500 waste-pickers, o f which about 10 percent are children,
live on and around open dumpsites. Most waste-pickers face elevated health risks and occupational
hazards and live in conditions o f severe poverty. The closure o f existing dumpsites and the opening o f
new controlled ones may reduce and even eliminate opportunities for waste-pickers and affect their
livelihoods. Thus, social inclusion activities should be developed as part of any proposed reform agenda
in order to mitigate such impacts. Ideally, programs would be developed to improve the income, living,
and working conditions o fthe waste-pickers.

38.      There are untapped opportunities in the solid waste sector to support the global climate
mitigation agenda and to mobilize additional financial resources for the sector under the carbon
market umbrella. Morocco, as a developing country (non-Annex B Party) that has ratified the Kyoto
Protocol, is eligible to participate in the flexible mechanisms enabled under the Kyoto Protocol, such as
the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Waste disposed in landfills generates gases typically
composed o f 50 percent methane (a Greenhouse Gas [GHG]), which can be captured and flared or used to
produce electricity. Emission reductions (ERs) from the capture or use o f landfill gas can be sold to Part 1
country (essentially developed countries except the United States and Canada) entities to generate
revenue for the improvement o f current S W M practices.

39.      There i s at present only one landfill gas (LFG) capture project in place in Morocco, which results
not only in global environmental impacts linked to GHG emissions, but also in financial losses - i.e.,
foregone revenues from the sale o f Carbon Emission Reductions (CERs) under the CDM. In addition to
landfill gas capture, carbon finance is available for composting or waste-to-energy projects that reduce
methane emissions. Carbon revenues could be earmarked to support municipal efforts toward greater
financial viability o f municipal solid waste services, to support municipalities that provide land for solid
waste treatment and disposal, and to upgrade livelihood conditions for waste-picking communities. The
potential emissions reductions from solid waste in Morocco are estimated to be 0.7 - 1.O million tones of
C02eqlyear.

B.       THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

40.     Recognizing the urgent need for leadership and partnership in addressing the very serious
issues in municipal solid waste management, the Government has begun to take vigorous actions
toward the development and reform of the sector. Extensive consultations, conducted by a steering
committee led by the Ministry o f General Economic Affairs (Ministire des Affaires Economiques et
Ge'nerales- MAEG) involving key stakeholders, Le., Ministry o f Economy and Finance            - MoEF, MoI,
and Secretariat o f State in charge o f Water and Environment -SWE, and supported by the Bank and other
donors, have enabled the Government o f Morocco (GoM) to initiate the development o f a comprehensive
municipal solid waste sector reform program. This consultation and dialogue over the last two years, with
strong commitment and ownership o f Moroccan stakeholders, has led to the elaboration o f the program


                                                     16

detailed in the sector development policy letter and reform matrix provided respectively in Annex 1 and
2, and substantially outlined and discussed inthe following paragraphs.

41.      The Government initiated the solid waste reform program in 2006 with the enactment of the
first Solid WasteLaw 28-00 that establishedthe fundamental principles and key rules that will govern the
management o f solid waste in Morocco. This formed the foundation for Moroccan policy for the sector
with two key objectives: to establish integrated and affordable solid waste management systems and to
mitigate negative impacts o f the sector on public health and the environment. More specifically, this law
(i)establishes the institutionalframework for SWM; (ii)requiresthedevelopmentofsolidwastemaster
plans at the national, regional, and municipal level; (iii)establishes cost recovery principles, including the
"polluter pays" principle and user fees (redevances); (iv) introduces sanitary landfills as the standard for
final waste disposal and requiring regulations establishing landfill norms and standards; (v) introduces
regulations for hazardous waste management; and (vi) establishes a system to monitor compliance with
the law.

42.      The Government also prepared and approved a national municipal solid waste management
program (Programme National de DPchets MPnagers et Assirnilis           -PNDM).     The PNDM is the result
o f strong inter-sectoral collaboration and dialogue between the key ministries concerned. A 15-year, 3-
phase program launched in 2008, it sets out objectives for the modernization o f SWM, in particular,
expanding and professionalizing collection services, modernizing disposal practices and promoting
recycling activities.   It includes specific targets for the municipal waste sector, including: collection
coverage increasing from 70 percent to 90 percent by 2021; 100 percent use o f sanitary landfills in urban
areas by 2021; the closure and/or rehabilitation o f 300 open dumps; and sorting o f 20 percent o f
recyclable materials.

43.      The overall reform program builds on the momentum gained through the introduction of the
above twogovernment actions. Itfocuses over the nextfour years on three areas of reform:

     (i)     Improving governance o f the sector through additional legal, regulatory, and institutional
             measures designed to establish a clear framework for the sector, and eliminating overlap
             and/or gaps inthe policy-making, regulatory, and operational structure;

     (ii)    Improving the sustainability o f the sector through the introduction o f financial mechanisms
             and incentives for municipalities to improve their S W M systems; and

     (iii)   Mainstreaming social and environmental considerations into the planning, implementation,
             and operations o f solid waste services and investments.

44.      Reform measures in this area are intended to address fragmentation and legacies that affect
policymaking and effective implementation. Policy actions aim at (i)policy planning and coordination in
the sector through the establishment o f the National Commission (Commission Nationale - CN) as a
policy and strategic planning coordination body for the PNDM; (ii)defining the eligibility and allocation
criteria for government subsidies to support municipal S W M operations and investments in an equitable,
transparent, and cost-effective manner; (iii)strengthening the regulatory framework through the
enactment o f executive regulations for S W M planning and for standard and norms for disposal facilities;
(iv) improving competition, transparency, and accountability o f SWM Private Sector Participation (PSP)
schemes by improving the quality o f standard bidding and contracting procedures and strengthening the
capacity o f respective local governments; and (v) developing appropriate communications and public

awareness programs. Responsibility for the implementationof these reforms rests primarily with the MoI
andthe SWE, with the CN serving as the main coordinationentity. Specific actions are presentedbelow:

   municipalities       and        the  beingthe largest, the recovery rates of these taxes are weak, as the central
                                        fiscal authorities do not consider them - because they are allocated to the

    regulations. The GoM intends to enact, by end of 2010, the following regulations:(i)the elaboration
    of regional and local planning tools for solid waste management; (ii)administrativeprocedures and
    technicalstandards for waste treatment and landfilling; (iii)guidelines for the determination of solid
    waste fees (redevances des dkchets); and (iv) modalities for monitoring and supervision of waste
    services at national,regionalandmunicipallevels.

    Establish regulatory mechanisms governing localpublic services. GoM has initiatedthe amendment
    of the Charte Communale in order to introduce, among other changes, the concept of regulationof
    local public services, includingsolidwaste management.The amended Charte will be enacted during
    2009 andwill providegreater legitimacyto regulatoryactions inthe sector.

    Improving competition, transparency, and accountability of PSP schemes in SWM by improving
    standard bidding and contractingprocedures. With the support of the Public-PrivateInfrastructure
    Advisory Facility (PPIAF), the Government is currently undertakinga study on PSP in MSWM that
    aims to recommend areas where improvements or adjustments need to be made in order to improve
    efficiency in the sector. The study will review existing PSP contracts and will benchmark the
    MoroccanPSP experience to other relevant experiences before suggesting areas of improvements in
    contract design, tender preparation and implementation, and contract management. The study will
    also propose options to improve transparency and accountability in PSP contract management by
    suggesting modalities to ensure greater participation from usedbeneficiaries.GoM will validate
    proposed changes by end 2009 and incorporate them in preparing new standard contracting
    documents and procurement procedures startingin2010.

    Public communications and awarenessprogram: The Journke de Communications,held on July 9,
    2008, launchedthe Government's communication strategy with respect to the reform program. The
    strategy will continue to be developed and implemented over the course of the PNDM. Annual
    budget allocations will take place beginning in 2009 for the implementation of a national
    communication and public awareness program. In parallel, the GoM will implement a national
    benchmarking system that will constitute an additional incentive for municipalitiesto improve their
    performanceinthis sector.

ReformArea 2 -Enhancingsustainability

45.     The Government recognizes that sustainability of the municipal solid waste sector is critical.
Sustainabilityfactors include(i)short-, medium- and long-termfinancial sustainability,and (ii)improved
municipal capacity to plan and manage S W M services; including regular monitoring and evaluation of
sector performance.

46.     Financial Sustainability: There are two main aspects to the Government's strategy to promote
financial sustainability - improving municipal financial capacity to meet the financial requirements of
modernizingthe MSWM system and improvingthe cost effectiveness of services. Interms of improving
municipalfinancialcapacity, measures include:(i)in the short term, the provisionof targeted subsidies to
municipalities to cover the incremental costs due to the requirements of the PNDM; (ii)supporting
municipalitiesin mobilizingadditionalfunds through the internationalcarbon market; and (iii)exploring
new revenue sources and mechanisms for generating additional revenues such as the earmarkingof local
revenues and the creation of solid waste fees (redevances) in application of Law 28-00 and possible
introductionof "eco-taxes" on packagingwaste. Interms of improvingthe cost effectiveness of services,
the Government intends to: (i)introduce incentives and tools to promote inter-municipalcooperationand
regionalizationof solid waste disposal facilities; this will help municipalities to take advantage of the
significant economies of scale in waste management; and (ii)revise contracting documents and
procedures for private sector participationin SWM.

47.     Inthe case of smaller municipalities,contractingout for improvedsolidwaste disposal may pose
particularchallengesas these have: (i)lower revenuesfrom local taxes as a proportionof their volume of
waste produced; (ii)are less able to realise technicaleconomies of scale in waste handling; and (iii)have
limited financial capacity to smooth out the gap between their up-front investment costs and the
annualized, tonnage-based subsidy from the GoM. The regulations on the technical arrangements for
waste disposal will therefore be indicative rather than obligatory during the first phase of the PNDM,
allowing smaller towns to opt out.The Phase 1 (2008-2012) focuses on the larger towns and cities, which
represent around 70 percent of national solid waste production in Morocco. A study on S W M
arrangements in smaller towns is plannedfor 2009 with possibleKFW funding.It is envisagedthat DPL2
will pursue and deepen reforms among smaller towns to allow them to participate in the program. It is
hoped that multi-town groupings will permit many smaller municipalities to realise technical and
managerialeconomiesof scale and equallybenefit fromthe PNDM.

48.     Improved municipal capacity to plan and manage SWM services: The Government program
includes a multi-year capacity building program targeting local authorities and aiming at improving (i)
managerialandtechnicalcapacity in S W M at the municipallevel, (ii)   elaboration, reviewand approval of
environmentalimpact assessmentof solidwaste investment; (iii)contractingout solid waste services; and
(iv) municipalfinancialmanagement.

GoM actions program for reform area 2

     Governmentsubsidies to support the implementationof the PNDM: GoM is committedto allocating
    financial resources to support municipalities in improvingtheir municipal solid waste management
    systems, and to annually transfer all targeted subsidies committedto as part of the Budget Laws. As a
    prior action, the Moroccan Government has already credited MAD 100 million to the National
    Environment Fund (Fonds National de 1'Environnement - FNE) under the 2008 budget as well as
    MAD 200 million as part of the Programme d'emploi de la TVA to provide financial support for
    municipalitiesthrough the PNDM.Additional transfers will be includedfor the upcomingfour fiscal
    years (2009-2012) on ayearly basis.

    Supporting the municipalities to mobilize additional financial resources under the Clean
    Development Mechanism (CDM): The GoM is committed to supporting municipalities in the
    identification,preparation and negotiations of a CDM programmatic project in the solid waste sector.
    The FEC has been appointed by the Government as the coordinating agency responsible for
    developing a programmatic CDM project in parallel with the implementation of the PNDM.
    Additional resourcesprovidedby carbon finance could help cover part of the cost of municipal solid
    waste landfilling. Concurrently the CDM program will also contribute to international efforts to
    reduce carbon emissions and therefore contribute to the international community effort to mitigate
    climatechange.

     Completion of a feasibility study on long-term financial sustainability: Based on Terms of
    Reference prepared and finalized in 2008, the GoM will conduct in 2009 a feasibility study for the
     implementation of identified tools/actions for mobilizing new revenue sources, such as the
    earmarking of local revenues; the creation of "eco-taxes" on packaging materials, and the
    establishment of users fee (redevances)in applicationof the Solid Waste Law 28-00. Validationand
     implementationofthe recommendationsand findingsofthe study will take place in 2009-2010.

    Strengthening the legalframework to promote inter-municipal cooperation GoM initiated in 2008
    the revisionof the Charte Communale in order to provide formal legal status (personalite`juridique)
    to groupings of municipalitiesand enabling them to act as special purpose vehicles. The adoption of

    the amended Charte communale by the Parliament took place in December 2008. This will help
    municipalitiestake advantage ofthe significanteconomiesof scale inwaste management.

    Implementation of a national capacity-building program in SWM: As a prior action, the
    Government will implement a multi-yeartrainingplan for localmunicipalitieswithin the framework
    of the PNDMin order to address the lack of managerial, technicaland financialmanagementcapacity
    at the municipallevel.The programwill be co-managedby the Ministry of Interior andthe Secretariat
    of State in charge of Water and Environment.The Government has already mobilized national and
    international actors for the implementationof this program includingthe FEC, GTZ, JICA, AFD'and
    PPIAF. A first series of capacity building and technical assistance has been launched in 2009 and
    shouldcoverthe first phaseofPNDMcoveringthe period2009-20 11


ReformArea 3: Mainstreamingenvironmentaland social dimensions

49.     The GoM is committed to promoting environmentally and socially sound disposalfacilities.
Given the current situation in terms of final disposal and the huge potential social and environmental
impacts, the primary focus of this aspect of the reform program is to (i)support the implementationof
environmentallyand sociallysound disposal facilities; and (ii)improvethe social and workingconditions
of wastepickers, whose livelihoodswill be affectedby closure of existingdumpsites.

50.     The Government recognizes the need to upgrade the existing EIA system. The GoM is
committed to removing the regulatory, administrative, technical, and managerial shortcomings of the
current EIA system so that a harmonizedEIA platformcan facilitate direct investment and donor support
and elevate Morocco's environmentalimage in the international arena. These shortcomings include: (i)
absence of established criteria, guidelines and rules for reviewing EMS,approving EIA reports, and
including the EIA mitigating and monitoring measures in services and work contracts; (ii)incomplete
standard TORs for preparing EIA reports for solid waste management, and lack of TORs for
environmental audits for landfills; (iii)absence of procedures and modalities for integrating social
concerns into the EIA processfor projects in general and, for S W M projects in particular,those related to
wastepickers; (iv) lack of technical staff, resourcesand operational manuals for local staff to review EIA
reports, and (v) lack of monitoringand enforcement of EIA mitigatingmeasures at the nationaland local
levels.

5 1.     The reform program also supports the international agenda on climate change. Morocco is
committedto promotingprojects and activities to reduce GHG emissions, with particular focus on the
solid waste sector. The FEC, a government agency specialized in the funding of municipalities, has
already been appointed to support the municipalities in promotingthe CDM agenda in municipal solid
waste, including: (i)to assist in developing, preparing and sustaining CDM projects in parallelwith the
implementationof the PNDM; and (ii)to assist in sellingCertifiedEmissionReductions (CERs) under a
programmatic approach under which the FEC will act as the coordinating entity of a nationwide CDM
Programme of Activities. Because of the potential reduction in GHGs and the resulting stream of
revenuesthat can be generated, CDM related activitiescontributeto mitigating short- and medium-term
financial shortfallsinthe sector.

    the EIA process, the Government is committed to enacting the decrees required in the EIA law,
    namely, (i)the responsibilities and operations of the national EIA committee and regional EIA
    committees, and (ii)   procedures for EIA-relatedpublic consultations.

     Operationalize the EL4 system as whole through: (i)the preparation of a comprehensive EIA
     operationalmanual detailing steps and procedures for EIA preparation, review and approval; and (ii)
    the provisionof training and capacity building on EIA preparationand review.The Government will
     also (i)prepare model TORs for Environment and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) for sanitary
     landfills; (ii) prepare model TORs for environment and social audits (ESA) for the
     closure/rehabilitation of open dumpsites; and (iii)establish best-practice guidelines for including
     mitigation andmonitoringmeasuresinwork and services contracts.

     Preparation and implementation of a multi-year plan (Phase 1 of the PNDM) focusing on
     municipal waste disposal: For the first phase of the PNDM (2008-2012), a detailedaction plan has
     been prepared and adopted by the three concerned ministries (MoI, MoF and SWE) in order to help
     local authorities improve SWM, includingthe modernization of collection services; the construction
     of transfer stations and new sanitary landfills in eligible municipalities; the closure of 63 open
     dumpsites; and the preparation of seven regional master plans benefiting 52 municipalities and
     provinces.

     Preparation and implementation of a program to improve social performance of solid waste
     management: Implementationof this plan has been agreed based on the findings of Phase 1 of a
     Poverty and Social ImpactAssessment (PSIA) conducted duringpreparationof the present operation.
     The plan will include: (i) providing wastepickers access to healthcare; (ii)in-depthconsultations by
     the municipalities with wastepickers and discussion of options for their reemployment, possibly by
     private S W M operators ; and (iii)involving local NGOs, through a call for proposals, which will
     work closely with wastepickers, ensuring that they receive appropriate health and hygiene services,
     assisting in their finding alternative employment, and monitoring the implementation and follow-up
     of the PSIA recommendations. As first steps in this regard, the CN-PNDM has adopted the key
     principlesunder which social aspects will be incorporatedinto the implementationof the PNDM, and
     two pilot social inclusioninitiativeswere launched in 2009.


              IV.      BANK SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

A. LINK TO CAS

53.      The solidwaste sector was not specifically identifiedas a strategic objective inthe 2005 Morocco
CAS (3 1879-MA of June 14, 2005). However, the Government of Morocco requested support from the
Bank in the light of recent policy developments in this sector, as it became increasingly clear that
managing municipalwaste under a "business-as-usual" approach would not only negativelyaffect quality
of life, public health, and environmentaland naturalresources but would also jeopardizethe development
of many sectors, particularlytourism.

54.      Furthermore, this DPL will contribute to achieving the CAS'S first strategic objective of
Improving Competitiveness and Business Climate by stimulating partnerships between the private sector
and local government and by increasingMorocco's competitiveness as a tourist destination. It will also
contribute to the CAS'S second strategic objective of increasing access to basic services by poor and
marginalized groups, as these improved services will cover the urban poor and will support social
inclusion of informal waste workers. In addition, the proposed DPL will contributeto the cross-cutting
CAS objectiveof ImprovingPublic Governance. Finally, the lendingapproach is consistentwith the CAS
                                                   22

recommendation on the use of policy lending instruments under a results-framework approach. Table 4
details the links between this DPL and the CAS.

55.      Bank support is deemed necessary at this junction to help the Government in the process of
promoting an enabling environment for the solid waste sector, particularly towards improving its
financial, environmental and social performance. The proposed support builds upon the policy dialogue
and advisory role the Bank has played in the environmentlsolid waste sector over the last five years,
particularly under METAP.

B.       COLLABORATION WITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

56.      The World Bank and the ZMF maintain close collaboration in Morocco. Regular contacts
between the IMF and World Bank country teams are customary, with discussions focused on the
respective work programs, country priorities, recent developments and prospects. Collaboration between


                                                     23

the Fund and the Bank inMorocco has been seamless, with general understanding on the division o f labor
and a shared assessment o f the critical macroeconomic challenges facing the country.

57.     The Fund participates in Bank project review meetings where relevant. Similarly, Bank staff
contributed to the IMF's 2008 Article IV consultation mission to Morocco. The ongoing analytical work
being carried out by the Fund team, which was welcomed by Bank counterparts, focuses on (i)the
medium-term outlook for public finances in Morocco; (ii)an analysis o f the real exchange rate; and (iii)
the macroeconomic implications o f the global financial crisis and economic downturn. This analysis is
incorporated in this document in Section I1A and B.


58.     The Bank and Fund share information and analysis o f evolving public finance issues, including
on subsidies, and, more broadly, on the activities o f the respective institutions, including technical
assistance. There is broad agreement on the division o f labor between the two organizations, with the
Fundcontinuing to focus on critical macroeconomic areas, and inparticular exchange rate, monetary, and
overall fiscal policy. The Bank continues to focus on strengthening economic management, improving the
business environment, and sectoral reforms. The recent Financial Sector Appraisal Program (FSAP)
update has been a collaborative work between the Bank and the IMF which will continue for the
dissemination and follow-up o f its recommendations.

59.      The IMF has provided technical assistance to Morocco on regional activities over the last
severalyears in thefollowing areas:

      (i)    Business environment, reform, and growthprospects. A regional seminar was held in Rabat
             inNovember 2005.

      (ii)   Regional integration and Jinancial sector development. A regional conference on financial
             sector reform and prospects for regional integration in the Maghreb took place in Rabat at
             end 2006.

      (iii) Monetaryandexchangeratepolicies. A high-levelregionalconferencetookplacein2007 to
             discuss issues related to a possible transition to an inflation-targeting framework.

      (iv) Regional integration and trade liberalization. The IMF is conducting follow-up on the action
             plan adopted after the November 2005 Algiers Conference. Morocco subscribed to the IMF
             Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in December 2005.

Relationship with other donors

60.      The proposed DPL operation was prepared in consultation with donors active in Morocco's
solid waste sector. Close collaboration has been developed with KFW, AFD and GTZ to ensure full
coordination with ongoing donor support activities and to share insights on reform progress and
constraints. As a result, the proposed operation will expand on AFD and GTZ operations supporting the
development o f local capacity under the decentralization agenda and assisting the SWE and M o I in
strengthening the solid waste legal and institutional framework.

61.     All active donors in the sector are keen to see improvements in the regulatory and institutional
framework, and AFD and GTZ expressed interest in funding technical assistance to accelerate the
enactment o f reforms. GTZ has already agreed to fund a second phase o f the poverty and social impact
analysis (PSIA) on willingness to pay o f users, especially the poorest segment o f the population, whereas
AFD is supporting an assessment o f financial management systems at the local level. Also, KfW has
expressed interest in this D P L and is considering collaborating with the Bank in the follow-up DPL,
including funding technical assistance and investments.
                                                    24

C.      RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

62.     Engagement between the Bank and Morocco on S W M has steadily strengthened and deepened
since 2002 through dialogue and technical assistance, in large part through METAP. In parallel with
the preparationof the proposed DPL operation, the Bank providedthe sector with technical support and
advisory services for the elaborationof the PNDM, including support for (i) the identificationof priority
areas for technical and financial support to municipalities as well as eligibility criteria; (ii)the design of
an appropriate system to channel this support to municipalitiescommittedto reformof the sector; (iii)the
development of a PSP strategy in the solid waste sector; and (iv) the development of a Clean
DevelopmentMechanism(CDM) programmatic project inthe municipal S W M area.

63.     The Bank has closely coordinated the preparation of the proposed solid waste management
DPL with the implementation of the Water Sector DPL and Energy Sector DPL, both approved in FY
07. The three sectors covered by these DPLs are all the responsibility of the Ministry of Energy, Mining,
Water and Environment. Consistent approaches have been adopted regardingthe need to strengthen the
legal and institutional framework, to maintain consistent coordination, and to ensure the financial
transparency of water, sanitationandpower distributionand solidwaste management services.

D.      LESSONSLEARNED

64.     While preparingthis operation, lessons learnedfrom METAP assistance have been incorporated,
as well as those from the overall ongoing dialogue in the solid waste sector in Morocco and from the
Bank's wider experience with environment technical assistance and DPL operations across sectors and
regions, including those in the energy, water, housing and administration sectors in Morocco. These
lessons include:

65.     The Government of Morocco has shown a keen interest in developmentpolicy lending and the
Bank has so far delivered DPLs in Public Administration, Housing, Water and Energy. The single-
tranche Public Administration Reform Loan I11(PARL 111) was approved in May 2008 and is making
considerable progress in budget management modernization, human resources management and payroll
control. The coordination of several donors around the PARL, along the principles of the Paris
Declaration, is also an importantachievement. The HousingSector DPL was a two-trancheoperationof
US$150 million equivalent and supported a programof reforms to strengthen the institutional, regulatory
and fiscal environment for a well functioning housing market and to increase the access of low-income
and severely disadvantaged households to more affordable and higher quality housing. The ICR of the
HousingSector DPL was completed in December 2008 and concludedthat the reformprogramsupported
by the DPL is havinga profoundlybeneficialimpacton the functioningof the housingsector in Morocco.
In 2007 the Government requested Bank support for a water sector DPL to support reforms to improve
sector governance, integrated water resources management, irrigation efficiency and water supply and
sewer service. This built on a previouslong-termengagementin the water sector by the Bank inMorocco,
with six investment projects to date. The Government appreciates the support providedthrough the first
Water DPL but has requested that the Bank continue to provide investment support to the sector. The
Programmatic Energy DPL is currently under implementation, with DPL 1 approved in May 2007 and
DPL 2 scheduled for delivery in May 2009. The experience to date with the energy DPL has shown that
the Bank's involvement can be crucial to ensure that key government agencies cooperate effectively to
carry out sector reforms.

66.     Accounting for the technical assistance needs of reform and building donor support.
Consultationswith GoM, GTZ and AFD helped focus on institutional capacity issues. A key precaution

                                                 25

of the DPL has been to identify the technical and financial support needs of the agencies in charge of
reform implementation,and to make GoM explicitly responsible for the timely funding of such needs
through the general budget. As a result, the GoM has already allocated the necessary TA funding and is
effectivelyengagingother donors, Le., GTZ, KFW and AFD, in supportingthe reformprogram.

67.     Assisting reform implementationthrough close supervision and continued high-level dialogue.
Based on prior experiences, GoM welcomes sustained DPL supervision by the Bank as a means to
regularly evaluate reform progress and provide support on specific issues. Close supervision is to be
coupled with continued high-level policy dialogue directed towards mobilizing GoM leadership on
monitoringanddecision-making.

68.     Strategic communicationis needed topromote the reform program. Lack of public outreach on
S W M policy may have contributed to slow progress in the past. Pushing the S W M agenda requires
strategic communication to increase the level of understandingand build social and political support. A
communicationand awareness program is included in the first pillar of the DPL to promote dialogue
among stakeholders and to induce behavioralchanges, as well as to manage stakeholder concerns and
expectations.

69.     Monitoring and evaluation of sector reform implementationis necessary. One key lesson is the
importance of ensuringthat GoMprioritizesachievementofreformobjectives over the implementationof
a set of measures. To that effect, the proposed operation includes strengthening of the accountability
framework for reform implementationand impact evaluation as part of the monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) process. To facilitate monitoringand evaluation, the Bank has made considerable efforts during
preparationto encouragethe Departmentof Environmentto take on the responsibilitiesof monitoringthe
progress and impact of sector reform.

E.      AnalyticalUnderpinnings

70.     The solid waste management sector has been supported by the EU-financed regional solid
waste management project for the Mashreq and Maghreb Region and implemented by the
Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP) of the World Bank (2003-
2006). This regional project was the major catalyst of solid waste management reform in Morocco. It
developed the necessary policy and institutional studies upon which this DPL was structured,
strengthened the technical capacity of MoI and SWE in waste collection and disposal, and provided
training to several municipalities on contract management and monitoring and the role of the private
sector, as well as onthe opportunitiesofferedfor the sector under the CDM.

71.     I n addition, the cost assessment of environmental degradation,conductedby the World Bank in
2003, formed the basis for engaging the Government in a policy discussion in solid waste management
and water quality. This environmental sector work was the first step in using such an assessment to set
policy and investment priorities while integrating environmental issues into economic and social
development.

72.     I n parallel with the preparation of the proposed DPL operation, the Bank provided technical
support and policy advisory services in many areas, including (i)municipal finance, including the
development of a set of matricesto guide the allocationof state financial support for the implementation
of the PNDM; (ii)a technical note on the main options to improve the financial sustainability of the
sector; (iii)a PPIAFgranted study for the development of a strategy for private sector participationin the
sector; and (iv) support of the MoIand Department of Environmentfor elaboration of their draft decrees,
generic TORS,and a capacity-buildingprogram inthe solidwaste sector.

                                                  26

73.     The SWMprogram is also supported through the GTZ Environmental Program in Morocco
(Programme de Gestion de Protection de L'Environnement, PGPE). GTZ has assisted in the
development of the four laws on solid waste management, EIA, environmental protection, and air
pollution. More recently, it has engaged in providing technical assistance and capacity building in the
solid waste sector. Also, AfD has financedexpertise and capacity building to the municipalitiesthrough
its Fonds d'Expertise et de Renforcement des Capacitks de`die`aux collectivite`slocales. A D will also be
conductingstudiesto support MoIin strengthening financial managementat the municipality level.

74.     In summary, the program has an extensive analytical foundation in the form of recent sector
work, including:

        The Povertyand SocialImpactAnalysis (Phase l),     September 2008
        Morocco-Environmentalfiscal reformStudy, June 2007
        Assessment of EnvironmentalImpactAssessment System, GTZ, 2007

         Country SolidWaste ManagementReport, METAP, May 2004
         Cost Assessment of EnvironmentalDegradation, June 2003

75.      These studies helped the policy dialogue with the GoM on the key sector issues and provideda
better understanding of the economic and social benefits of the reforms. Additional analytical work will
be conducted in parallel with the implementation of the DPL, with close coordinationand support from
other involveddonors. The ongoingwork will help develop detailedmedium-termreformplans.

V.       THE PROPOSEDMUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
         POLICY LOAN

A.       OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

76.      The proposed DPL, thefirst in a programmatic series of two single-tranche DPLs (the DPL
program), is designed to provide budget support and policy advice for the implementation of a national
program for the reform of the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco. It was developed in close
coordinationwith the GoM's reformprogram, to ensure full ownership of process, actions and outcomes.

77.      The GoM and the Bank recognize that under GoM leadership, the Bank can play a critical role in
strengthening cross-sectoral policy dialogue between the various government entities and sustained
commitmenttoward effective reform of the sector, and that a DPL program is the best suited instrument
to structure such commitment.A programof two single-tranche DPLs designedto providebudget support
is thus envisionedto sustain further and accelerated implementation of an integrated program of solid
waste reformsbetween 2009 and 2011, as described inthe draft Letter of DevelopmentPolicy (Annex 1).
The first operation of the DPL program(DPL1) supports the key foundations ofthe Government's reform
program, which aims to establish the enabling environment for an integratedand affordable solid waste
system. The planned second DPL (DPL2), which will be presentedfor Board approvalby early 2011 (Le.
within the required24-monthtimeframe for Programmatic DPLs), will aim to support capitalizingon the
momentum gained during the first operation while deepeningthe reform through results-orientedactions
at the regionaland municipallevel.



                                                27

78.      The objectives, prior actions, indicative triggers, outcomes and indicators are described in the
OperationPolicy Matrix providedinAnnex 2.

79.       The higher-level objective of theprogram is to improve thefinancial, environmental and social
performance of the municipal solid waste sector in Morocco. The overall benefits expected from this
operationare relatedto the mitigation of the political, environmental, social and economic impacts of the
existing municipal solid waste management system. The Government is committed to addressing these
impacts as part of its policies to improve the governance and the performance of the sector as well as the
sustainability of related services in urban areas, and the Loan is expected to provide support to coherent
implementationofthe necessaryreforms.

80.       The specijic benefits expectedfrom the implementation of the reform program supported by
this operation are: (i)improved environmental and social conditions which would result from the
progressive elimination of the existing uncontrolleddumpsites and construction of sanitary landfills; (ii)
enhanced access to waste collection services for the urban poor; (iii)reduced cost of waste landfilling
resultingfrom more cost-effective planningregulationsand standards; (iv) more efficient use of resources
allocatedto the solid waste sector and better targeted public subsidies to the sector; and (v) growth and
job creation resulting from the creation of small and medium enterprises, the promotionof recyclingand
integratinginformal actors such as wastepickers.

  81.    An overall agreement has been reached with the Government on the design and
  implementation of the reforms supported under the proposed programmatic operation. In agreement
  with the Government, the proposed DPL directly supports the entire reform program over the 2009-11
  period. The 2009-2011 reforms are a continuationof the reform actions implemented since 2007. The
  agreement on a long-termstrategy, intermediatesteps and immediateactions is reflected in the Letter of
  Sector DevelopmentPolicy (Annex 1) and Policy Matrix (Annex 2). The Policy Matrix includes prior
  actions proposed to be met for the proposed first loan and triggers for the second loan. Continued
  engagement of the Bank to support the medium-term reform process will depend upon progress and
  success in implementation of the action program and confirmation of the long-termperspective of solid
  waste sector reforms - amended as needed in light of the experience with the implementationof the first
  two-year reforms andthe mid-termreview ofthe DPL program.

  82.     The reform program will benefitfrom the support of other donors tofund technical assistance
  needs, as well asfrom GoM commitment to support local authorities to develop and modernize their
  municipal solid waste systems. In coordination with GoM, the preparation of the DPL involved
  consultation and coordination with other donors involved in the solid waste sector as well as in the
  municipal development agenda, resulting in broad alignment on reform needs, and in commitments to
  support, through TA activities, the design and implementationof key policy actions at both national and
  local levels. For instance, the support provided by AFD to support the decentralizationprogram as well
  as the work being done by GTZ in terms of institutionalstrengthening and capacity building in the solid
  waste and environmental fields are factors for success of the reform, and were firmed up as part of the
  preparationofthis proposed DPL.

B.      POLICY AREAS

83.     The DPL program policy matrix consists of key actions based on and aligned with the GoM's
reform program matrix, which are detailed in Annex 2. Eight policy actions are retained as agreed prior
actions for the first DPL; they are listed in Table 6, below and explained in greater detail in the following
paragraphs. Verified completion of the eight agreed actions is a prerequisitefor Board presentation of the
DPLl.


                                                    29

84.      Nine policy actions have been agreed as triggers to initiate the preparation o f DPL2. The
following paragraphs also describe these triggers, which are included as well inAnnex 2.

85.      All the prior actions for the first DPL have been met as o f February 6,2009.

POLICY AREA 1-GOVERNANCEOFTHE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SECTOR:

86.      Three prior actions and four indicative triggers have been agreed as essential to achieving the
following key objectives under this policy area: (i)to promote consistency and transparency o f
government actions in the solid waste sector, (ii)to ensure implementation o f Solid Waste Law 28-00,
and, through it, implementation o f the national solid waste policy, (iii)to improve transparency,
competitiveness, and accountability in private sector contracting in SWM, and (iv) to change public
behavior and improve municipal decision making with respect to solid waste management practices.

87.      Issuance of a circular by the Secretary of State in charge of Water and Environment
establishing the National Commission of the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program
(CN-PNDM)).The CN-PNDM is the main platform for enhanced governance o f the solid waste sector,
particularly in terms o f sector policymaking, priority planning, and the allocation o f government financial
support for modernizationo f solid waste management systems. The CN-PNDM will contribute as well to
(i)the establishment of cross-sectoral partnerships and coordination among the key concerned
government institutions; (ii)enhanced consistency o f government technical and financial support to local
authorities; and (iii)close supervision and monitoring o f reform program actions and outcomes as well as
implementation o f the PNDM. The CN-PNDM will be chaired by the Secretary o f State in charge o f
Water and Environment and will include representatives of the MoI, MoEF, MAEG, FEC and the PNDM
program management unit. The Department o f Environment will be responsible for the CN-PNDM
secretariat.

88.      Adoption by the CN-PNDMof eligibility criteria for the allocation of Governmentfinancial
support to municipalities under the PNDM: The definition o f these criteria have guided by four key
principles: transparency o f the allocation system, equity (pe're'quation) to take into account resource
inequalities between municipalities, quality o f investments, and the integration o f environmental and
social considerations. Allocations will be based on (i)investment costs; (ii)   tonnage o f waste handled by
the municipality; and (iii)financial capacity o f the municipality. Allocations would also be adjusted to
reflect factors such as innovation, inter-municipal collaboration and community involvement in waste
management. This one-time government financial support to eligible investments would be disbursed
over a maximum period o f five years. This action and subsequent triggers and benchmarks will help shift
from ad-hoc to transparent and equitable allocation of government financial support for the modernization
o f municipal solid waste management systems.

89.      Publication in the Bulletin Offciel of a decree related to the classijication of waste, and
submission to and approval by the Ministry of Interior and the Secretariat of State in charge of Water
and Environment of the two draft decrees related to (0 proceduresfor the elaboration of a provincial
or prefectural master plan for municipal solid waste and (io administrativeprocedures and technical
standards for municipal solid waste landfilling. This action is the first step toward implementation o f
Solid Waste Law 28-00. The first and third decrees will establish technical standards for the management
o f solid waste disposal and treatment facilities. The second decree will introduce regional planning tools
(master plans) for solid waste management that sets long-term objectives and i s responsive to
demographic and industrial growth based on local urban needs.

90.      Four triggersfor the preparation of DPL2 under the policy area of governance have been
identijied that solidify and put into implementation the prior actions identified above. These are: (i)
                                                    30

that the CN-PNDM meet at least twice a year to coordinate, review and evaluate the implementation o f
the PNDM, including review and approval o f progress reports; (ii)  that regional committees for the review
and validation o f provincial and prefectural M S W master plans are established and operational in at least
two regions consistent with the relevant legislation; (iii)adoption by the CN-PNDM o f revised model
bidding and contracting documents to be used beginning in 2010; and (iv) launch in 2009 o f a fully-
funded communications and public awareness program on solid waste issues through the PNDM. The
first trigger has been selected to ensure the operationalization o f entities necessary for the transparent
coordination and consultation in preparing and adopting the annual P N D M work program, as well as
ensuring appropriate allocation o f resources. The second trigger is the first step to be undertaken by the
government to ensure a consultative and decision-making process for the review and validation o f solid
waste planning at the regional level involving regional governmental entities, professional associations,
and civil society representatives. The third trigger provides one o f the key means to municipalities to
enable them to achieve, on the ground, the program objectives in terms o f transparency, competitiveness,
and accountability for better private sector participation in M S W management. The fourth trigger is
directed toward implementation o f the communications strategy o f the PNDM, which is a necessary input
into behavioral changes among the public as well as into establishing communications between municipal
decision makers and the public regardingpriorities, concerns, and expectations.

POLICY AREA 2 -SUSTAINABLITY OF MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE SERVICES

91.       The modernisation o f M S W in Morocco will entail significant increases in investment and
recurrent costs. The P N D M will support municipalities' short- and medium-term investment costs,
however, cost-savings and increased municipal contributions will be needed to ensure the reforms' long-
term financial sustainability. The key objectives under this policy area are therefore: (i)to strengthen
municipal financial capacity to meet the financial requirements for modern, integrated MSW, (ii)to
improve cost effectiveness o f M S W services, and (iii)to strengthen municipal capacity to efficiently
manage solid waste services. The three Prior Actions below have been identified as essential to achieving
these objectives:

92.       Appropriatefunding has been made available to the PNDMfor 2008, and the Loi de Finances
of fiscal year 2009 includes appropriate budget allocations in support of the PNDM. This formalizes
the central government's commitment to help municipalities to (i)end current open-dumpsite practices
and equip urban centers with sanitary landfills; and (ii)close or rehabilitate uncontrolled dumpsites. It
represents a major G o M commitment towards reducing the negative health and environmental impacts o f
existing practices. The allocations will help the municipalities to narrow the short- and medium-term
financing gap resulting from the shift o f focus from waste collection to an integrated system addressing
collection and sanitary disposal.

93.       Appointment by the Minister of Interior of a coordinating entity in charge of the development
of a national CDMProgram tofacilitate municipalities' access to the carbon market. This action, the
first o f its kind in Morocco, creates an institutional framework for local government to participate in the
C D M through a programmatic approach.            It should thus help municipalities to benefit from the
international carbon market while contributing to international efforts to mitigate climate change. The
potential additional revenues generated through C D M projects will support the sustainability o f the solid
waste sector. It is estimated that the potential CERs o f the solid waste sector in Morocco amount to 0.7-
 1.O million tons equivalent C02.

94.       Launch of a fully funded capacity development program in the solid waste sector targeting
municipalities. Many municipalities lack technical and managerial capacity to manage solid waste
services, particularly to plan, contract out, supervise, and evaluate services. This action is the first step in
the implementation o f one o f the major non-investment components o f the PNDM. The Direction de

                                                    31

Formation at the Ministry o f Interior will be the coordinating unit for the implementation o f this
nationwide program with the support o f national and international agencies (FEC, GTZ and JICA) and
focusing on project preparation, local and regional planning, environmental impact assessment, municipal
financial management, and the monitoring and evaluation o f solid waste services. The implementation o f
this program will be funded through the Ministry o f Interior (Program d'Emploi de la TVA) and donor
contributions.

95.      Two indicative triggersfor DPL2 have been identified under thispolicy area. These are viewed
as key to implementing the policy reforms identified for DPLl and enabling municipal implementation o f
reforms on the ground. The triggers are: (i)signature by the Minister o f Interior o f a circular on the
application o f Article 23 o f Law 28.00 on user fees (redevances) for municipal solid waste; and (ii)
continued implementation o f a multi-year capacity building program. The envisaged approach is to ensure
the long-term financial sustainability o f solid waste management reforms, first by facilitating
municipalities' mobilization o f new sources o f financing, and second by controlling unit costs through
improved management and contracting. Article 23 o f Law 28.00 authorized local authorities to establish
new user fees (redevances) for municipal solid waste services; a study in early 2009 will propose
modalities for applying this legislation and a circular from the Minister o f Interior will be issued for their
effective implementation. It is likely that the user charges will focus on a small number o f easily-
identifiable high-volume producers o f household-type waste. This includes entities such as hotels,
restaurants and offices. If practical, user charges may also be applied to specific products that create
particular household waste disposal costs. The long-term intention is thus to reduce municipalities'
dependence upon central transfers for SWM. In parallel, four actions have been identified as benchmarks
o f progress in improving sustainability o fthe sector; these are included in Annex 2 in italics.

POLICY AREA 3 -ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

96.      Two prior actions have been agreed as essential to achieving the following key objectives under
this policy area: (i)to upgrade and operationalize the existing EIA system at both national and regional
levels, and (ii)to improve the environmental and social performance o f the solid waste sector.

97.      Publication in the Bulletin Officiel of the decrees related to (0 the responsibilities and
operations of the national EIA committee and regional EIA committees, and (ii) proceduresfor EIA-
related public consultations.     This action represents a major achievement in terms o f effective
implementation o f the EIA law, and it confirms the Government's determination to formalize the EIA
committees and to decentralize EIA reviews and approvals. The decree related to public consultation -
which represents a major shift from previous practice - increases public involvement and transparency in
EIA decision making.

98.      Adoption by the CN-PNDM of principles for the inclusion of social considerations in the
framework of the PNDM. These principles, as adopted by the CN-PNDM, are: (i)the inclusion o f social
considerations into SWh4 planning; (ii)the inclusion o f social considerations into criteria for P N D M
financing o f S W M investments; (iii)the inclusion o f social measures into contract with private
contractors; (iv) the participation o f NGOs and public agencies responsible for social programs,
employment and job training, etc. in assistance to socially vulnerable groups related to SWM; and (v)
public communications and training related to social issues in the sector. This prior action represents a
key step towards systematic consideration o f social concerns as part o f the overall sector reform program
and the PNDM.

99.      Three triggersfor DPL2 have been identified under the environmental and socialpolicy area:
(i)the establishmentandoperationalization ofat leastthreeregionalEIAcommittees; (ii)launchofthe
construction o f at least three new sanitary landfills and closure or rehabilitation o f at least three open

                                                    32

dumpsites before March 2010; and (iii)extension o f social inclusion programs to PNDM-supported
disposal investments.      The intention o f the first trigger is to demonstrate the commitment o f the
government towards reaching a consistent and comprehensive framework for environmental management
in general and an effective EIA process for the establishment o f sanitary landfills in particular. The
second trigger represents government action demonstrating the reality o f the reform program by the actual
establishment o f sanitary landfills and rehabilitation and closure o f open dumpsites. The related
quantitative target indicator reflects a realistic time frame and potential implementation challenges for
such disposal infrastructure. On-the-ground results will provide incentive for additional municipalities to
apply for financial support for M S W investments, increasing the momentum o f reform implementation
while incorporating lessons learned from initial investments. The third trigger has been selected to
demonstrate the commitment o f the government to mainstreaming social concerns into projects supported
by the PNDM.

            Finances of fiscal year 2009 includes appropriate budget allocations in support of the
            PNDM.

        5.  Appointment by the Minister of Interior of a coordinating entity in charge of the
            development of a national CDM Program to facilitate municipalities' access to the carbon
            market.

                    Table 7: Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce ownership. This operation has been client driven and enjoys solid
countryownership. Its preparation was guided by: (i)   the new governmentdeclaration announced
in October 2007 that placed the solid waste sector among the key priorities of the government
policy agenda for the period2008-2012; (ii)intensive consultationand coordination among key
stakeholders on reform actions and timing through the DPL Interdepartmental Steering
Committee (SC); and (iii)comprehensive and well accepted sector work including analytical
works conductedby concernedline ministries. Inaddition, the reform program was preparedby
the SC with continued and comprehensiveinputs from all concernedministries

Ownership is also ensuredby timely and demand-drivenanalytical support. Eventhough it is not
envisaged to combine this DPL with a technical assistance lending operation, the GoM has
requestedthe Bankto support with technical assistance and policy advice on solid waste, and the
Bank has already mobilisedresourcesto provide such advice.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a
coordinated accountability framework. The DPL operation benefited from close cooperation
with GTZ, AFD and KFW, to ensure consistency among ongoing donor-funded technical
assistance and operations. Alignment of these major sector partners on the reform program
objectives was also sought and achieved through continued consultations and progress updates.
Donors' commitments to fund technical assistance, capacity building activities and studies to
support specific reform actions and resultsare evidenceof such alignment.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to
country circumstances. The policy matrix and conditionality of the proposed operation are
highly tailored to country and sector circumstances. Through this operation the Bank offers
recognitionand budget support for the excellent measures taken by the country to improve the
environmental, social and economic performance of the municipal solid waste sector. The
proposed DPL operation has been designed based on the lessons learned from prior policy
development operations in Morocco and benefits from the flexibility afforded by the
programmatic approach. In addition, the program includes only two single tranche operations
coveringthe current government mandateperiod which represents a signal of the Government's
commitment to the reform and a place mark for the achievement of the planned objectives over
the comingyears.

Principle 4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement.
The number o f prior actions has been limited to eight, which represents the first critical steps in
each of the main areas of reform. Out of numerous milestones, only nine were selected to be
triggers for the second DPL given their critical importance in unlocking the reform process,
delivering key immediate outputs and achieving reform outcomes. There are no conditions for
effectiveness.

Principle 5: Conducttransparentprogress reviews conducivetopredictable andperformance-
based evaluation. Policy reform of such a young sector needs intensive supervision and
progress review. The proposed mechanisms for review are closely relatedto expected progress
in each area of reform and will strike a balance between achievable results and the desired
objectives of the three reform areas. Substantial progresson triggers andbenchmarkswill also be
assessedduringsupervision missions inorder to beginpreparationofthe second DPL.

                             VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION


A. Povertyand Social Impacts

100.     The operation's design takes into account the results of an analysis of potential socio-
economic impacts of solid waste management reforms. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA)
was conducted between March and June 2008 to: (i)establish baseline data regarding the size o f the
informal solid waste sector, the characteristics o f the groups and individuals involved, and the economic
relevance o f waste collection activities for their livelihoods; (ii)determine the likely negative and positive
effects o f the reforms; (iii)identify options to mitigate adverse impacts and maximize potential benefits;
and (iv) identify the remaining analytical and data requirements for the proposed second DPL. The
analysis benefited from inputs from decision makers at various levels as well as several civil society
organizations, and in this sense served as a platform for stakeholder consultation on the objectives and
broader dimensions o f the reform program. This section highlights the main conclusions o f the analysis
and how they informed the policy matrix.

101.     The informal system of waste collection and recycling plays an important role in the
livelihoods of marginalized groups. The number o f individuals deriving a substantial part o f their
incomes from landfills is estimated at 5,500, o f which 3,500 are directly involved in informal waste
collection and recycling on landfills and 2,000 are herders. These figures are subject to seasonal increases
related to the rate o f economic growth, with individuals not normally involved in waste-picking attracted
to the landfills by the opportunity o f additional income during systemic or other shocks. The estimated
monthly average income o f a waste-picker is MAD 2,300 per month, and the average additional income
from herding is around MAD 1,000 per month. 20 percent o f active individuals are estimated to be
women; 15 percent under 18, and 10 percent over 65. The negative social externalities o f informal waste
picking include loss o f income, impacts on children's education and adverse health impacts for all
wastepickers.

102.     Without adequate mitigation measures, the reforms risk having significant negative direct
impacts on wastepickers and indirect impacts on other social groups and economic sectors. The
closure o f landfills without accompanying mitigation measures would translate into losses o f jobs,
income, and homes, with total welfare loss estimated at MAD 88 million per year. Experience from the
closing o f landfills in Fes, Oujda and El Jadida suggests that 20 to 30 percent o f waste pickers normally
operating on landfills seek new economic opportunities inwaste collection in cities, thereby compounding
the problem there. Between 200 and 300 families living inside the perimeter o f landfills would lose their
homes. Moreover, the consequent reduction o f the volume o f recycled material would imply additional
welfare losses through extra imports on the part o f industries that rely on informal recycling. A 15 percent
reduction in the amount o f recycled materials (a conservative estimate o f those accrued from informal
activities) would translate into a 30 percent increase in the cost o f inputs, due to higher prices and taxes.

103.     Any sustainable solution must begin with the sensitization of decision makers, especially at
the local level. The analysis showed an insufficient level o f awareness among local and national decision
makers o f the scope and relevance o f the informal waste sector, and o f the adverse impacts o f existing
reforms. Morocco's demonstrably high level o f political attention to the themes o f poverty and social
exclusion offers an opportunity to remedy this situation. In addition to a range o f options for the
absorption o f informal waste workers into the formal waste management system and the re-conversion of
others into different activities, the analysis suggests a range o f actions aimed at sensitizing decision
makers and the private sector to the key issues. To this effect, the policy matrix includes the introduction
o f Environmental and Social Impact Assessment tools aimed at placing recognition o f the role o f the
                                                      35

informal waste sector and the adverse impacts o f landfill closing at the center o f decision-making. The
operation also envisages the drafting o f an Orientation Note on enhancing the role o f informal collection
and recyclingwithin value-added chains.

104.    The private sector and civil society can play a fundamental role in mitigating negative
effects of landfill closings and in protecting and strengthening the economic role played by the
informal waste sector. The PSIA suggests one mode o f integration o f informal waste workers into the
operations o f private solid waste contractors, based on a recent successful experience with the
reconversion o f RabaVAkreuch landfill. The matrix thus requires the inclusion in the bidding documents
and contracts for solid waste operators o f provisions for the absorption o f informal waste workers. Based
on that same experience, the PSIA further outlines the role o f Civil Society Organizations in facilitating
the interfacing o f informal waste workers with private sector actors, and suggesting a range o f measures
related to re-absorption, reconversion and schooling to be implemented in partnership with civil society
organizations.

105.     The preparation and implementation of a social inclusion program is the first step to
improving the social performance of solid waste management: The plan will include: (i)providing
wastepickers access to health care; (ii)in-depthconsultations by the municipalities with wastepickers and
discussion o f options for their reinsertion either by private operators or by creating a partnership for; and
(iii)involving local NGOs in project-based activities aimed at working closely with wastepickers to
ensure appropriate health and hygiene services and conditions, provide support for their reinsertion to
other jobs inthe sector, and monitor the implementationand follow-up o f the PSIA recommendations.

106.     Strategy for the development of municipal action plans. As each group o f informal waste
workers, as well as the context in which they operate, are unique, each action plan for addressing their
situation must be developed through a local-level process that includes the following seven basic elements
or steps:

         production o f a set o f basicprinciples (in a programmatic framework, to guide the process);
         conducting o f adequate studies on the relevant characteristics and context o f the local informal
         waste sector (as a key inputto decision-making);
         conducting o f a robust consultation process (including the active involvement o f the informal
        waste workers themselves);
         development o f an adapted actionplan (as an output to the process and with maximal ownership
         o f the various key stakeholders);
         implementationo f the plan (with the involvement o f an experienced NGO or other actor with the
         necessary credibility among the waste pickers);
         monitoring and evaluation o fthe process and results; and finally
        feedback of the results into the designprocess (so as to mainstream best practices and maximize
        the benefits o f lessons learned in subsequent phases).

         A follow up PSIA will inform the preparation of the second DPL. It will evaluate progress
and achievements o f first round actions, in particular ( i ) the effects o f the inclusion o f social
considerations in private sector contracts and partnership agreements; (ii)the extent and impact o f CSOs
involvement; (iii)   the results o f the official recognition o f wastepickers status on living, professional and
health conditions; and (iv) the social impact on poor customers o f the increase in the cost o f solid waste
services brought about by the proposed reforms; and (v) the social impact o f the transfer o f municipal
solid waste workers to the private sector. It will also extend the analysis to the reform o f the sector in
urban areas.

B. EnvironmentalAspects
108.     Over the last fifteen years, Morocco achieved significant progress in developing its institutional
and legal framework in the area o f environment protection. Environmental institutions were first
established in Morocco in the early 1990s with a three-person directorate in the MoI, which evolved to
become a State Secretariat (Water and Environment) within the Ministry o f Energy, Water and
Environment. The State Secretariat oversees a full fledged environmental administration at the central
level and recently at the regional level. Morocco has also developed a comprehensive environmental
strategy through its 2005 National Environment and Sustainable Development Strategy. This strategy
pursues essentially one objective: to stabilize the environment degradation by 2005 and further decrease it
beyond this date.      It has four priorities: water protection, waste reduction and its management
improvement, water quality improvement and soil protection

109.     Morocco has enacted its first solid waste management law (Law 28-00) in December 2006. In
January 2003, it had enacted three laws related to environmental protection, environment impact
assessment and air quality. Also as a result o f the agreement reached on policy actions as part o f the
preparation of the D P L reform program matrix, the Government Council enacted two decrees related to
the establishment o f the national and regional EIA committees as well as well the decree for public
consultation and disclosure. Two other decrees are also expected to be enacted: the decree related to
waste classification and the decree related to technical specifications and standards for sanitary landfills.
In parallel to the DPL preparation, the World Bank carried out a safeguard diagnostic review (SDR) for
the use o f national country systems (UCS) for EM. Although the D P L is not subjected to safeguards
requirements per the World Bank Safeguards Policies, it was found useful and appropriate to carry out the
required analysis o f the environmental and social implication o f the policy reforms to be supported by the
DPL under the format o f the SDR, which is the tool used for assessing the equivalence and acceptability
o f the country systems compared, in the case o f environmental assessment, to a set o f principles defined
inthe Operational Policy 4.00. The SDR determined that that the Moroccan EIA laws and regulations are
generally equivalent to the Objectives and Operational Principles o f OP 4.00 and that the application o f
these laws and regulations are also in conformity with this policy .However the SDR found that EIA
review, monitoring and follow up requires substantial strengthening. A training program was already
initiated by GTZ and will be also implemented in parallel to the DPL. The World Bank will also provide
training and technical support on EIA to the regional EIA committees as a follow up to the UCS
assessment and as a concrete sign o f its commitment to support the institutional and legal strengthening o f
the Moroccan environmental institutions and legal systems.

110.     Potentialpositive impacts: An assessment o f the potential impacts o f supported policies on the
Environment and natural resources was carried out, and concluded that the measures supported by the
program are expected to have significant positive environmental impacts. Main positive impacts include
(i)improvements inpublic healththrough proper collection, transport and disposal ofmunicipal solid
waste; (ii)decreased potential contamination o f groundwater (aquifer) and surface contamination from
waste leachate; (iii)pollution reduction from on site burningo f waste; (iv) improved waste management
with a special focus on waste treatment and disposal in sanitary landfills; (v) protection o f the global
environment though methane capture and (vi) empowerment o f             municipalities as implementers o f
integrated waste management.


111.     The positive contribution o f the proposed operation is the mainstreaming o f environment and
social dimension into the solid waste management sector as well as mainstreaming the global
environment into the local environment through the operationalization o f the Clean Development
Mechanism in the waste sector. In its first and second D P L pillars, environment,is mainstreamed by
improving better governance and better communication with the population and local NGO, establishing
predictable guidelines and standards for private and public sector participation, and introducing

                                                    37

fiscal/para-fiscal instruments for securing stable resources for S W M systems. The third DPL pillar is
exclusively an environment and social related component. It will establish a standard TORs for EIAs that
will be used by all operators, will require that the environment and social mitigating plans are included
into the solid waste management contracts and will also ensure that the social programs for waste pickers
are being implemented in accordance with the PSIA.

112.     Potential negative impacts: The above-mentioned environmental and social benefits o f these
DPL-supported reforms will overwhelmingly exceed potential negative impacts. The latter are not
expected to be substantial, but would be related to the risks o f inappropriate operation o f waste facilities.
The G o M is aware o f such potential negative impacts and is working on measures and actions to mitigate
them. The GoM will establish specific criteria for providing financial incentives to the municipalities.
These incentives are based on the principles o f equity, transparency and environment and social
protection. In order to benefit from the financial incentives, each municipality will prepare an EIA in
accordance with the standard TORs, will agree to close the illegal dumps upon the operation o f the
landfill, and will implement the social measures for waste pickers. Furthermore, the D P L requires in its
program matrix the financing by the Government o f training for EIA, review and approval, monitoring
and follow up o f environment and social mitigating measures. The potential impacts linked to leachate
treatment, noise, odor and visual nuisances are considered manageable through appropriate mitigation
measures to be defined in the EIA, and included as part o f the works and operators contracts. On the basis
o f these measures, the assessment concluded that G o M demonstrates that potential negative impacts will
be addressed in a satisfactory manner. Bank supervision will follow up to ensure that these aspects are
taken into consideration and relevant institutional capacity is strengthened and maintained.

C. Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation
113.     Implementation and coordination responsibilities: The government has put in place the
following implementation and coordination mechanisms:


     0   The Steering Committee for the Municipal Solid Waste Sector DPL will continue to oversee loan
         coordination at the ministerial level.

     0   The government has established the National Commission for the PNDM, which is responsible
         for the coordination, review, and evaluation o f the solid waste sector reform program and the
         PNDM. The National Commission is led by the Secretary o f State in charge o f Water and
         Environment and includes representatives o f the MoF, MoI, SWE, the MAEG, and the FEC. The
         National Commission will in particular ensure progress reporting and schedule management,
         action documentation, inter ministerial coordination, and proactive corrective action on non-
         progress actions. The National Commission will also be responsible for communication with the
         Bank supervision team.

         Day-to-day management o f the P N D M will be overseen by a Program Management Unit
         established within the DGCL.

114.     Supervision by the Bank: Supervision missions will allow the Bank to continue providing policy
advice and technical assistance to the institutions involved in the implementation o f the sector's program
o f reform. Two supervision missions a year will take place in order to monitor actions and review
progress in the implementation o f the DPL, and when conditions are satisfactory to the Bank and the
G o M to start the preparation o f the second DPL o f the supported program.




                                                   38

D. FiduciaryAspects

115.    Financial Management Diagnostics and Risk Rating: In response to the government request,
the Bank issued a Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA) update in 2007 following the
first CFAA of 2003. Like the first one, the CFAA update assessed the Moroccan public sector fiduciary
risks as low. The rating is due in large part to the steady and continued Government efforts and major
reforms to modernize and improve the efficiency of the public sector including the public financial
managementof the past several years. Thesereformsare still ongoing.

116.    The CFAA update recommended improvements in a number of areas; including (a) reducingthe
delays to producethe year end government financial statements and accounts andthe audited accounts by
the Court of Accounts; (b) further simplification of the a priori internal controls while continuing the
strengthening ofthe ex-post controls and internalaudit already underway; and (c) continuingthe progress
inthe ManagementInformationSystem(GID) under completion.

117.    Public Financial Management Reforms progress and Follow-up: Progress in implementing
the large reformprogram known as the Public AdministrationReformProgram (PAW) has been broadly
on track, surpassingplans in certain areas while being slow in other areas. Hence, by end of 2008, in the
area of budget management, the government had (i)introduced budget flexibility norms that facilitated
transfers among resources in 30 Ministries that represent above 90 percent of non-wage expenditures; (ii)
completed aggregate and sector Medium-TermExpenditureFrameworks (MTEFs) in 12 ministries, with
generalizationin 2008; (iii)introducedperformance budgeting (with explicit performance indicators) in
22 ministries with generalization in 2008; and (iv) completed a study to reform control of public
expenditure, which ledto the eliminationof a priori control andthe mergingof two directorates involved,
thereby contributingto cutting paperwork time by about half and making public expenditure processing
more efficient.

118.    It is important to note also that the Government is already engaged in all of the above areas and
intends to enhance budget transparency and anti-corruption policies, while improving accountability in
delivering services, through the introduction of e-government and further simplification of procedures.
These are currentlyunder discussion betweenthe Bank andthe Government.

119.    Funds Flow.Morocco has hadno safeguards assessmentby IMF. However, over the many years
of working with the Moroccangovernment, the Bank has had no major fiduciary issues in relation to the
funds flow. The Government budget is comprehensive, unified and subject to centralized treasury
account. Cash flow and debt are professionallymanaged by the Treasury Department of the Ministry of
Finance under generally satisfactoryconditions.Loan proceeds are deposited in a government designated
account at the CentralBank andtransferredto the Treasury single account for government budget.


E. DisbursementandAuditing

120.     The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursementprocedures for Development Policy
Loans and will be disbursed in one installment. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in a single
tranche in the amount of Euro 100 million upon loan effectiveness. Hence, once the loan is approved by
the Boardand is declared effective, loan proceeds will be deposited by IBRDin an account designatedby
the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the Central Bank of Morocco (Bank A1 Maghrib). The
Borrower should ensure that upondeposit of the Loanproceeds into said account an equivalent amount is
credited in the Borrower's budget. The loan proceeds will be administered by the Ministry of Economy
andFinance(MoEF).


                                                  39

121.    Although an audit of the use of the funds may not be required, IBRDreservesthe rightto require
audits ofthe deposit account at any time.

F. RiskandRiskMitigation

122.    There are three key risks associated with the program.Macroeconomic risk associated with the
globalfinancial contraction and economic slowdown: Morocco's macroeconomy is well positionedto
weather the negative impact of the economic downturn, thanks to robust domestic demand, policy
reforms, and sound macroeconomic balances. Countercyclicalfiscal policy should also help to moderate
the downturn.A reasonablecentral estimate is that Moroccowill sustain growth of 4.5 percent percent in
2009, a moderate slowdown compared with previous years but nonetheless satisfactory in light of the
global slowdown. There are risks to the outlook, including a sharper contraction in partner countries,
which would see growth lower by 1-1% percent of GDP, although there are upside risks, notably the
prospects of a strong agriculture season. The fiscal stimulus package announcedfor 2009 should help to
maintaindomestic demand, but is modest enoughthat the risk of macro-economicinstabilityis low, as is
the risk of fiscal pressures compromisingthe implementationof the national government's solid waste
program. Commitments to the reform and implementation capacity risks: (i)Weakening of political
consensus and commitment for solid waste reforms which may delay or impact the effective
implementation of the program is mitigated by a strong and continuous cross-sector dialogue and
consultationthrough the established National Commission for the Program, and (ii)Weak capacity to
implement complex sector reforms at the municipallevelmay affectthe program's results on the ground.
This risk is mitigated by (i)wide awareness and communicationprograms on the reform agenda; (ii)
strengthening of technical and financial capacity of municipalities as a priority of the PNDM; and (iii)
coordinatingwith other active donors in solid waste sector to reinforcepotential synergies between the
different programs (namely GTZ which provides technical support in S W M to municipalitiesand AFD
which props up the municipal finance and local fiscal agenda). Social acceptance risks: Lack of social
acceptanceof reforms by the public includingthe waste pickers and service users. This is beingmitigated
respectivelythroughthe implementationof a social inclusionprogramtargetingwastepickers and through
increasingaccountabilityofthe service providersfor improvedquality.

123.    Two additional minor risks were also identified and related mitigations measures defined: (i)
Implementation of reforms reveals divergences between the Government and the municipalities
concerning resource mobilization and cost recovery. This will be mitigated by: (a) the introduction of
targeted subsidies and technicalsupport to the municipalitiesunder the PNDM as incentives to adhere to
the reform program; (b) the introductionof a performance-based"Convention de Partenariat" between
the Municipalities and the Government (including provisions and indicators to measure financial and
technicalperformances); (c) the municipalbudget hasto be approved on a yearly basis by the MoEF and
the MoI who have been the champion in the elaboration of the PNDM; and (d) the implementationof a
benchmarkingsystem that is expectedto enhancethe inter-municipalcompetitionto adhereto the PNDM;
and (ii) Slippage of meeting the triggersfor DPL 2 beyond aperiod of 24 months. In this case, an ICR
will be completedfor DPL 1 and providedthe overallprogress is still positiveand the reformprogram is
on track albeit with some delay, DPL 2 will be processed as a second stand-alone single tranche
operation.

               Monsleur le Prdsldent,

      A I'instar de la majorit6 des pays en vole de dbveloppement, le Maroc connalt un deficit
      important en matlbre de gestion et de qualitb des services de dechets, en particuller la
      gestion des dechets menagers et assirnil&. L'ampleur et les coirts grandissants des
      impacts de la gestlon des dbchets menagers sur I'environnement.la sante et la qualite
      de la vle des populationset sur le developpement socio-economique du pays appelle a
      la recherche active de solutions pertinentes pour une gestlon rationnelle, integree et
      durable de ce secteur.
      En effet, au courant des demibres annks, des efforts importants ont et6 deploy4s pour
      la mise  a nlveau de ce secteur. Cependent, si pres de la moitie de la population urbalne
      bdneficie d'un service de collecte des dbchets menagers et de nettoiement par des
      operateurs professionnels, les efforts en termes de mlse en dbcharges contrdl6e6, de

       Strategie du Gouvernement dans la geotiondu secteur des ddchets menagers

       Le Maroc, par I'engagement pris dans le cadre d'actes et d'accords multilateraux et
       bilateraux (Rio 1992 et Johannesburg 2002) a rnontrk depuis de nombreuses annees sa
       volontb d'integrer dans sa politique natlonale les fondements du developpement durable,
       notarnment concemant le secteur des dechets.

       La politique du Maroc dans le secteur des d4chets tire ses bases de la lo1sur la gestlon
       des dCchets solides (Loi 28.00). L'une des finalills majeures de cette lo1 approuvee tin
       2006 est de jeter les bases d'une politique  ((dechets qui s'articule autour d'un double
                                                               ))
       objectif: moderniser ies processus de gestlon en vigueur dans le secteur et r6duire
       autant que possible les impacts negatifs des dechets sur la sante publlque,
       I'envlronnement et les ressources naturelles, et le developpement Bconomique et social.
       Cette politique s'inscrit aussi dans le contexte g6nbral de renovation des procedes de
       gouvernance et de gestlon des services publics, y compris la d6centrabation et la
       deconcentration. Elle prend en compte I'evolution des modes de consommation et
       d'organisatlon sociale tout en prenant appui sur les perspectives economiques et
       financieres prornetteuses, que les rbcentes lnltiaties de gestion deI6guee initides dans
       ce secteur ont confirmbes.

       Pour concrbtiser cette polttlque, le Gouvernement a mis en place un programme de
       reforme qui vise essentiellement :
                     I'am6lloration de la gouvernance du secteur au moyen de rnesures
                     juridiques. rbglernentaires et institutionnelles supplementaires conques

      Subject:          Letter of Development Policy related to the National Municipal Solid Waste
                        Management Program in Morocco



Mr.President:

Like many developing countries, Morocco lags behind in the management and quality o f solid waste
services, in particular municipal solid waste management. The scope and rising cost o f the impacts o f
solid waste management on the environment, public health, quality o f life, and on the country's
socioeconomic development call for an active effort to find appropriate solutions toward a rational,
integrated, and sustainable solid waste management.

Significant work has been done in recent years to upgrade this sector. However, although solid waste
collection and cleaning services to close to half o f the urban population are being provided through
private operators, work in the area of sanitary landfills, rehabilitation o f open dump sites, and recycling
remains inadequate.

With the aim o f improving the quality and management o f this important sector, Morocco has prepared a
national municipal Solid Waste Management strategy, which constitutes a key component of the
country's environmental and sustainable development strategy.

Current Situation in the MunicipalSolid Waste Sector

Morocco currently produces approximately 5 million tons per year of municipal solid waste in urban
areas and will produce up to 6.2 million tons annually by 2020.

Prior to the 2008 launching o f the National Municipal Solid Waste Management Program [Programme
National des De'chets Me'nagerset Assimile's -PNDM], only about 70 percent o f waste produced in urban
areas was collected, and less than 10 percent of the waste collected was disposed o f in controlled/sanitary
landfills. A large percentage of that solid waste ended up in illegal dumpsites.

                                                   48

Waste management deficiencies, which have been a persistent problemfor this sector and constitute the
key challenges to be addressed, are largely attributable to institutional, legal, managerial, and financial
constraints, these include:

             0   A legal and institutional framework that limits the effectiveness of governance of the
                 sector;

             0   Lack of cost effectiveness in the provision of services and uncertainty surrounding the
                 long-termfinancial sustainabilityofthe sector; and

             0   An urgent need for integratedand modernized solid waste management systems in order
                 to mitigateeconomic, environmental, and socialeffects

To address these shortcomings, the Government has undertaken a series of actions in recent years aimed
at developingandreformingthe sector. These actions include:
-   The publication in December 2006 of Law 28-00 on solid waste management. This law reflectsthe
    clear desire to improve solid waste management in generaland municipalsolidwaste managementin
    particular,by:

             0   Confirming the primary responsibility of municipalities for municipal solid waste
                 management;

             0   Introducing integrated waste management planning tools at the national, regional, and
                 local levels;

             0   Obliging municipalities for the provision of resources and infrastructure for waste
                 disposal, treatment, andrecycling;and

             0   Introducing a new cost recovery instrument for solid waste services, including the
                 possibilityof establishing solidwaste managementfees.
-   The preparation in 2007 of the NationalMunicipal Solid Waste Program [PNDM]. This program is
    aimed at upgradingmunicipal solid waste management by 2021. The total cost of the program is
    estimated at DH37 billion (approximatelyUS$4 billion) over a 15-year periodand covers the whole
    chain from collection through disposal and treatment. More specifically, the program is aimed at
    supporting municipalitiesthrough:

             0   Professionalizingsolidwaste services;

             0   Improving access to collection services by increasing the percentage of municipal solid
                 waste collectedinurbanareas to 90 percentby the end ofthe programin 2021;

             0   Upgrading the treatment of solid waste by disposing of all collected municipal solid
                 waste in sanitary landfills by 2021and increasingthe recyclingrateto 20 percent; and

             0   Closinghehabilitating300 existing open dumpsites in parallel with the construction of
                 new sanitary landfills.
-   Inaddition,the October 2007 government declaration placesthe problemof solidwaste management,
    and in particularthe treatment of solid waste, amongthe top prioritiesof the governmentalagenda in
    terms of support to local authoritiesand sustainable development. The political will was reflected in
    the establishment in the 2007 budget law of an earmarked account entitled "National Fund for
    EnvironmentalProtectionand Development."Its implementationprogram includes a section entitled
    "Support for the National Municipal Solid Waste Program." An envelope of DH 300 million has
    been allocated for this purpose in 2008, with DH 100 million being contributed through the state
    budget and DH200 million mobilizedthroughVAT revenue(programme d'emploi de la TVA).



                                                   49

-   At the same time, at the local government level, actions were undertaken by municipalities aimed at
    improving and professionalizing municipal solid waste collection services. Most large and mid-sized
    towns, in particular Rabat, Casablanca, and Tangiers, have contracted private operators to
    professionalize collection services. As a result, by 2008 approximately two-thirds o f collection
    services were provided by private operators. Countrywide, annual expenditure for collection and
    cleaning services provided through private sector amounted to approximately DH 1.2 billion in 2008.



GovernmentStrategyinthe Solid Waste ManagementSector

Morocco, through its multilateral and bilateral instruments commitments (Rio in 1992 and Johannesburg
in 2002) has, for many years, demonstrated its desire to incorporate the core elements o f sustainable
development, particular those related to the solid waste sector, into its national policy.

Morocco's waste sector policy is based on the Solid Waste management law (Law 28-00). One o f the
major objectives o f this law, enacted in 2006, is to lay the foundation for a waste policy that revolves
around two goals: modernizing the sector's management processes and reducing, to the fullest extent
possible, the negative impact o f solid waste management on public health, the environment and natural
resources, and economic and social development. This policy is also part o f a broad overhaul o f the
governance and management o f public services, including decentralization and deconcentration. It takes
into account changes in consumption and social patterns, while drawing on promising economic and
financial models that have been validated particularly through involvement o f private sector in this sector.

To implement this policy, the Government has established a reform program that essentially seeks to:

            0    Enhance the governance o f the sector through additional legal, regulatory, and
                 institutional measures, designed to create a clear framework for the sector, eliminating
                overlap and/or deficiencies inthe decision-making, regulatory, and operational structure;

            0    Enhance the financial sustainability of the sector by introducing financial mechanisms
                and incentives aimed at upgrading and modernizing solid waste management services;
                and

            0     Mainstream social and environmental considerations into the planning, execution, and
                 implementation o f services and investments inthe solid waste sector.

To achieve these objectives, reform o f the solid waste sector covers legal and institutional initiatives, as
well as other initiatives targeting the enhanced economic, financial, environmental, and social
performance o f the sector as well as strengthened capacities, greater efficiency, and improved
performance o f the operators involved inupgrading solid waste management services.

1.      EnhancedGovernance in the MunicipalSolid Waste Sector

With the aim o f providing greater visibility and consistency to government action in this sector,
promoting implementation o f the national solid waste management policy, assisting with the
professionalization and regulation o f the sector, and developing an appropriate institutional framework,
the Government will undertake the following actions:
-   Create a PNDMNational Commission (CN-PNDM). This National Commission will be responsible
    for coordinating, monitoring, and evaluating the Government's program to reform the solid waste
    sector and the National Municipal Solid Waste Program (PNDM). The CN-PNDM will be chaired by
    the Secretary o f State for the Environment and will include government representatives from the
    Ministries o f Interior, Economy and Finance, and Economic and General Affairs, as well as the Fonds
    d'Equipement Communal FEC. The CN-PNDM has been established by a circular o f the Secretary o f
    State for Water and Environment. It will meet at least twice a year.

                                                   50

- Adoption by the CN-PNDM o f eligibility criteria for Government financial support to local
  authorities for projects to establish controlled landfills, improve existing dumpsites, and modernize
  collection and cleaning services.       These criteria have been established to promote transparency,
  equity, performance, and mainstreamingenvironmental and social considerations. The application o f
  these criteria will facilitate the equitable, transparent, and efficient transfer o f financial assistance in
  support o f upgrading municipal solid waste systems.
- Strengthen the regulatory framework o f the sector through effective enforcement o f Law 28-00,
  including the preparation and adoption o f decrees related to:

           0   Preparation o f prefectural, and provincial planningtools for solid waste management;

           0   Standards for waste treatment and landfilling;

           0   Guidelines to put in place solid waste fees; and

           0   Procedures for the monitoring and supervision o f solid waste services at the national,
               regional, and municipal levels.
- Enhance competition, transparency, and accountability for effective private sector participation in
  solid waste services through the adoption o f standard bidding and contracting procedures.               The
  Government is currently conducting a study on private sector involvement in solid waste
  management, which should lead to recommendations for improved bidding and contracting
  documents as well as monitoring and supervision o f private sector services. The Government will
  review the study's recommendations and will ensure effective use o f revised bidding and contracting
  documents by 2010.
- Adoption by Parliament o f the new Charte Communale that vests the Minister o f the Interior with
  authority to adopt necessary measures for the regulation and smooth functioning o f waste
  management services, inter alia, by:

           0   Drafting standards for the provision and organization o f services;

           0   Preparing indicators for monitoring, evaluating, and overseeing services;

           0   Identifying procedures for assisting local governments and groups o f municipalities with
               the aim o f improving services;

           0   Providing technical assistance to local governments to improve supervision and
               management o f private sector contracts; and

           0   Making available to local governments all data and information necessary for monitoring
               and supervision purposes.

  Also, with the aim o f promoting inter-municipal cooperation, this amended Charte Communale
  enables municipalities to form, for the first time, legal and administrative municipal groupings, in
  particular in urban areas, which would offer a better framework for the development o f the sector.
- The Government recognizes that public awareness o f solid waste issues and the communication
  regarding the sector's reform program are critical to success o f Government and municipal actions in
  this area. Consequently, the Journe'e de Communication, held on July 9, 2008, marked the launching
  o f the Government's communication strategy associated with the PNDM. This strategy will be
  implemented through a communication and public awareness program funded as part o f the 2009
  P N D M action plan.
- In addition, the Government initiated the design of supervision and monitoring systems for solid
  waste investment and services, including the elaboration by 2009 o f a monitoring and supervision
  manual.

2.      Greater Sustainabilityof MunicipalSolid Waste Services

Financialsustainability of the municipal solid waste management sector will entail a series of activities
aimed essentially at strengthening the municipal financial capacities to modernize their solid waste
managementsystem and at improvingits cost effectiveness, including:

    Establishinga mechanism for providingincentives in order to encourage the integratedmanagement
    of solid waste at the municipal level. Access to Government financial support will be contingent on
    the aforementioned eligibility criteria adopted by the CN-PNDM. The 2008 and 2009 budget laws
    have made provisions for these allocations, and similar appropriations will be made in subsequent
    budget laws.

    Facilitatingthe implementationby municipalitiesof new cost recovery mechanisms. Duringthe first
    six-month periodof 2009, the Government will initiate a study on measures necessary to ensure the
    long-termfinancialsustainabilityof the solid waste sector. Drawingon the conclusionsof this report,
    the Government will make recommendationsto local governments on the applicationof Article 23 of
    Law 28-00 on solid waste fees.

    Building the technical and managerial capacities of local governments. Enhanced management
    capacity by municipalities, particularly in the area of procurement, contracting, and monitoringthe
    performanceof private contractors paves the way for a significant reductionin unit costs and thus in
    bolsteringthe financial sustainabilityofthe sector. With assistance from its partners(AFD, GTZ, and
    JICA), the Government hasprogrammedand started implementationofa number of training activities
    gearedtowardlocalgovernments.

Cognizant of the difficulties encountered by local governments in developing and implementing
greenhouse gas reduction projects in the context of the Kyoto Protocol, and in gaining access to the
internationalcarbon market, the Government has appointed the Fonds de 1'Equipment Communal as the
nationalcoordinationentity to assist localgovernments with work inthis fairly complex area and with the
preparation of a programmatic MDP in collaborationwith the World Bank`s Carbon FinanceUnit, in the
context of the new Carbon Partnership Facility.This programmatic approach will facilitate achievement
of economies of scale inwaste management,without which access by municipalitiesto the carbonmarket
will be difficult, as well as the mobilizationof additionalsources of revenuefor localgovernments.

3.      Greater Focuson Environmentaland Social Considerations

Mindful ofthe importanceof environmental and social considerationsrelatedto the solidwaste sector and
the negative effects of current waste disposal practices on the environment and socioeconomic
development, the Government has undertaken a raft of preventive and corrective measures to mitigate
these effects, some ofwhich are listedbelow.

Upgradingand operationalizationof the Moroccansystemto conduct EnvironmentalImpactAssessments
(EIAs), in order to meet not only the exigencies of the solid waste management sector but all projects
requiringan environmentalimpact assessment. Inthis regard, the Government has adoptedand published
two decrees relatedto:

                  The responsibilities and functioning of the Environmental Impact Assessment National
                  Committee andRegionalCommittees; and

                  Modalities for organizing and carrying out the public consultation related to projects
                  requiringan EIA.
-   At least three regional EIA committees will be operational by end-2009. The work of these
    committees will be facilitated by the preparation of a manual of procedures for the review and
    approval of EIAs as well as the implementationof a specific trainingprogram targetingmembers of
    regionalEIA committees.
                                                   52

   Enhancing the environmental performance of the sector through the implementation, on a priority
   basis, of the sanitary landfill component of the first phase of the PNDM action plan (2008-2012) as
   well as the closing and rehabilitationof illegal and open dumpsites. All institutional, financial, and
   operationalmeasureswill be supported through partnership agreements with local governments, with
   a view to meeting the PNDM's quantified objective by 2012, namely having at least 30 percent of
   collectedwaste disposedof in controlledlandfills andthe closingof at least eight illegal dumpsites.

   Improvingthe social performance of the sector throughthe adoptionby the Government of a series of
   related measures for the inclusionof social components in PNDM implementation. To this end, the
   CN-PNDM has adopted the principles of inclusion of social aspects, which extends to planning and
   decision-making mechanisms, accountability of municipalities or groups of municipalities,
   accountabilityof operators, a participatoryapproach, and public awareness and training relatedto the
   social aspects ofthe PNDM.

   In addition, the communication and public awareness program, included in the PNDM, contains a
   social component. The outcomes of two pilot social projectsunder way in the RabaUSale Wilaya and
   the Al-Hoceima urban municipality will be helpful for finalizing this component. In carryingout this
   component, the Government will ensure the participation of all actors, including private operators,
   civil society, and professionalassociations in the sector. The Government will ensure that the social
    integrationprogram for wastepickers is extendedto all projectssupported by the PNDM.

        Procedures for Monitoringand Implementingthe ReformProgram

In addition to the CN-PNDMmentioned above, amanagement unit for the program will be createdwithin
the Direction Ge'ne'rale des Collectivith Locales (DGCL)lDirection de 1'Eau et de 1'Assainissement
(DEA). This unit will be assigned the task of project identification and programming, as well as
monitoringof their execution, ex-post evaluation, and classificationbasedon eligibility criteria.

Moreover, the steering committee established in the Ministry of Economic and General Affairs will
provideperiodicupdates on implementationprogress and, to this end, will prepareprogressreports.

Taking into account the importance of this programfor upgradingthe municipalsolid waste sector in the
context of sustainable development, the Government is counting on the support of the World Bank
througha Programmatic DevelopmentPolicy Loan for the first phase, coveringthe 2008-2012 period.

Mr. President,Iwould like to thank you for the World Bank's interest inthe development ofthis sector.

                    ANNEX 3: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE
               NATIONAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT REFORM

The benefits of the improvedMSWM practices promoted by the national municipal solid waste
management reform consist of positive environmental externalities and improved efficiency
within the S W M sector itself. Thesebenefits are described in more detailbelow.

Positive environmental benefits are the main economic justification for Morocco's decision to
invest significantresources in its nationalSWMprogramme:

Improved waste collection. On the basis of a Willingness to Pay study (Belhaj, 1995)' it was
estimatedthat the environmentalcost of sub-standardwaste collectionwas MAD 1,497 million in
2000, or 0.4 percent of GDP. This estimate only reflects households' valuation of improved
collection; one should also note the value to the tourist industry of cleaner cities, beaches and
other public spaces. The programme will reduce this environmental cost through the
professionalizationof solidwaste services.This will involve:
    (i)     the upgradingof municipaldirect labour in solidwaste operations;
    (ii)     a shift from direct labour to contracting-outand;
    (iii)    improvedprocedures and skills inthe contracting-outprocessitself.

Preservation of amenity value of residential land. Land near sub-standard dumpsites loses its
value for residential purposes, for obvious reasons. Once urban dumpsites are converted into
proper, sealable landfills, it is estimatedthat the price of neighbouringland would rise by MAD
200-1,000 per m2,giving a benefit risingto a peak of MAD 943 million per year, or 0.2 percent
of GDP.

Less contamination of water by leachates. Seepage (leaching) of harmful substances from
inadequate dumpsites into aquifers leads to serious water contamination.One liter of leachate
from the dumpsite is estimated to contaminate 50 liters of clean groundwater. The S W M
programme will eliminate this environmental damage by ensuring that waste is stored in
properly-sealedlandfills.This benefitcan be valued as a reductionin the cost of water treatment,
and is estimated at 0.1 percentof GDP (WorldBank, 2003).

Other environmental benefits. The uncontrolledspreading of waste on land reduces its value for
agriculturalpurposes.By concentratingwaste disposalin properly-designedlandfills, land will be
saved for productive use. This benefit has been estimated at MAD 32 million per annum
(Belghazi, 2008). The disposal of waste in sealable landfills would also reduce the health cost of
the water and air pollution from uncontrolled dumping, which has been estimated at MAD 75
million (ibid.). Finally, use of sealable landfills would permit the capture and flaring of the
methane gas producedduringthe anaerobic decomposition of solid waste, thus helpingto reduce
Morocco's greenhouse gas emissions. It is estimated that Morocco would raise MAD 50-90
million per annum through the sale of these carbon credits under the Clean Development
Mechanism(ibid.).The FEC is chargedwith realisingthese sales.

Efficiency gains within the sector will also result from the national MSWM programme's
technicalassistance activitiesand financialincentives for improvedpractices.

Eflciency cost-savings will resultfrom capacity-buildingfor municipal authorities in contracting
out. Currently there are weaknesses in tender procedures and documents, leading to poor
competition,excessive prices andpoor quality of service.

Inter-municipal collaboration promoted by the programme will be a source o f significant
economies o f scale. There can be major economies o f scale in solid waste transport and disposal,
leading to unit cost reductions o f 20-50 percent. The use o f transfer stations allows small vehicles
to be used in neighbourhoods with narrow streets and access ways, while larger vehicles travel
longer distances to the landfill. Sanitary landfills are also characterized by enormous economies
o f scale. Fixed costs include the perimeter fencing, access road, weigh-bridge, receiving gate
house, worker changinghanitation facilities, office, perimeter drainage, buffer landscape zone,
monitoring wells. When landfills are smaller than 400-500 tondday, equipment is under-utilized.
Since landfills with a larger footprint can be higher, with a 3:1 slope, every 10 percent increase in
footprint allows for a 15 percent increase in volume, allowing for economies o f scale in land use.

Value-added@om recycling will increase once informal waste-picking is formalized, improving
sorting practices and creating new options for the marketing of recycled materials. However,
international experience i s that formal recycling is rarely a source o f significant revenues, and
may not take place at all in the absence o f regulatory or tax instruments to encourage the use of
recycled materials.

A cost-benejt analysis was performed to compare the external and internal benefits above with
the cost estimates inthe national M S W M programme documentation.

The key issue in usingthe benefit valuations above is the estimated annual rate o f increase o f the
potential environmental benefits from better MSWM, which would rise over time as Morocco's
population grows and a more urbanised, affluent society produces more household waste. The
calculation used a conservative assumption about the rate o f growth o f potential benefits (3.5
percent p.a., below Morocco's 2001-2007 real growth rate o f 5 percent p.a.). The analysis also
made conservative assumptions about incremental recycling value-added (peaking at MAD 11
million pea.) and efficiency gains from improved procurement practices (20 percent o f without-
project operating costs).

On the basis o f these restrictive parameters, an internal rate of return of 18.6 percent p.a. was
estimated for the programme over 30 years. The net present value at a discount rate o f 10 percent
p.a. is MAD 10.3 billion, approximately 1.7 percent of annual GDP. If the rate o f growth o f
potential benefits were assumed as 5 percent instead o f 3.5 percent per annum, the programme's
internal rate of return would be estimated as 24.9 percent, and the net present value at MAD
2 1.4 billion.

Indeed, S W M investments generally offer high internal rates o f return. The table below shows the
ex-ante estimated economic internal rates o f return (EIRR) o f recent World Bank solid waste
management investment projects in Argentina, Brazil and Jordan. It should be noted, however,
that these cost-benefit calculations have emphasized gains from greenhouse gas emission
reductions and/or electricity sales, whereas the economic case for the Moroccan S W M
programme rests primarily on the local environmental benefits.
