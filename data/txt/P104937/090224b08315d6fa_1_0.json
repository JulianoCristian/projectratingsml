Out of a total Moroccan population of 30 million,\n            18 million lived in urban areas. Moroccan cities are\n            characterized by high population densities and rapid growth.\n            These cities suffered from several forms of environmental\n            degradation, including the effects of poor management of\n            Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). In 2008, Morocco produced about\n            5 million tons of MSW per year and it is expected to reach\n            6.2 million in 2020. The World Bank has been supporting\n            Morocco\u2019s efforts to improve economic, environmental, and\n            social performance of MSW. The program has supported about\n            80 municipalities to improve their collection services and\n            upgrade their landfills. Private sector provided cleaning\n            and garbage collection services to about 60 percent of the\n            urban population compared to about 15 percent before the\n            project. An innovative carbon finance program at the\n            national level was designed to help local authorities\n            mobilize additional financial resources. The program\n            improved the reach and quality of solid waste collection\n            services and contributed to the effort to mitigate climate\n            change effects."}, "docdt": "2011-03-30T09:17:00Z"}
