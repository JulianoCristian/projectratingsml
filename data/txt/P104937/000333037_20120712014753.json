"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the First and Second\n            Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Sector Development Policy Loans\n            (DPLs) Project for Morocco were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was also satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: contributing factors included a long\n            history of Bank-client dialogue on sector policies and\n            strong analytical foundation, which allowed the Bank to\n            accompany the government in a well-designed and phased\n            program of homegrown sector reform in a complex sector. The\n            programmatic series was centered on a simple policy matrix\n            to substantiate the program of reforms as an emerging\n            political priority, with shared ownership of the reforms by\n            the Ministries of Interior, Finance and Environment.\n            Investment lending could not have provided the same leverage\n            on reforms, due to the DPL nature as entry point to policy\n            dialogue and the visibility accorded to the reform program\n            from the engagement of the Bank. The government was fully\n            committed to the program and took advantage of the analysis,\n            planning framework, implementation support and convening\n            power offered by a DPL program whilst maintaining full\n            leadership and ownership of the reforms themselves, which\n            was also essential factors contributing to the success of\n            the DPL program. While private sector participation as\n            services providers in the MSW sector increased\n            substantially, the capacity building and standard\n            specifications supported by the DPL series have shown their\n            limit in terms of improving cost effectiveness, and more has\n            to be done in terms of market development. For now, the\n            major cities have the funds necessary to contract out\n            services, based on revenues from the municipal service tax,\n            but as coverage rates and service standards continue to\n            increase, new sources of funds targeted to MSW should be\n            developed, also by looking at investments by the private sector."}, "docdt": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
