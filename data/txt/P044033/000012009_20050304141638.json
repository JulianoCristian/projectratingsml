for the\n            PFSAL2) institutional development impacts, even upgrading\n            the PFSAL to high institutional development impacts.\n            However, the audit downgrades ratings concerning the\n            Transition Assistance Credit (TAC) Project to unsatisfactory\n            project outcome, and modest institutional development\n            impacts, yet upgrades sustainability to likely, but assesses\n            both Bank and Borrower performances as unsatisfactory. The\n            main lessons from these credits suggest: 1) Upon the need to\n            drastically reduce the scope of a quick-disbursement\n            operation, given practical and political difficulties, this\n            should provide the opportunity for an operation\n            reassessment, in particular the credit amount, to ensure\n            that a relationship remain between that amount and the\n            policy adjustments being supported. 2) Providing general\n            budget support under circumstances where there is virtually\n            no auditing of, or accountability for government\n            expenditures, is unwise, particularly in the absence of a\n            strong, monitorable agreement with the borrower on the use\n            of those funds. 3) Providing budget support, in light of\n            major tax evasion and excessive government expenditures, can\n            be potentially counter-productive, in the absence of an\n            agreed, concerted direct attack on those elements. The\n            presence of budget support reduces the natural pressure on\n            governments to take urgent and meaningful action. 4) In a\n            situation where there is no clear borrower commitment to a\n            course of action, or there is a history of back-tracking or\n            non-implementation of laws and regulations, the mere passage\n            of legislation is not usually a good basis for tranche\n            release conditionality. There also needs to be a period of\n            implementation or, better still, conditionality based on\n            actual results achieved. Given a long, complicated reform\n            agenda, careful sequencing of operations is required. This\n            was the case for PFSAC and PFSAC2, to be followed by the\n            proposed Economic Management SAC; and for SOSAC, to be\n            followed by the proposed SOSAC2, examples of good practice.\n            In contrast, there was no immediate follow-up to TAC,\n            compounding its poor design as a one-tranche operation."}, "docdt": "2005-01-27T00:00:00Z"}
