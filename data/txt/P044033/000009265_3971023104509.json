following the Washington\n            Agreement that ended the conflict between Bosniac and Croat\n            forces. The Dayton Accords in December 1995 further set out\n            an institutional framework for rebuilding the entire country\n            on the basis of a new state consisting of two entities, the\n            Federation and Republika Srpska. The pivotal task in 1996\n            was to create the institutional framework and stimulate\n            economic recovery, demonstrating the advantages of\n            rebuilding Bosnia and Herzegovina as a multiethnic state.\n            This Credit was prepared and implemented under very\n            difficult circumstances. The evolving nature of the country\n            and government institutions created great uncertainty in the\n            fiscal responsibilities of different levels of government.\n            Moreover, Bosniac, Croat, and Serb interests continued to\n            struggle for control over key political and economic\n            institutions. The Credit would test the commitment of these\n            groups to building a multiethnic state by aiming for\n            unification of key economic institutions and agreement on\n            important policy matters. The Credit was primarily intended\n            for the benefits of the Federation, given that Republika\n            Srpska was subject to an embargo for donor assistance at\n            that time."}, "docdt": "1997-06-10T00:00:00Z"}
