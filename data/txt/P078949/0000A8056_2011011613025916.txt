                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to reduce user costs on the Milot - Rreshen section of the Durres - Milot - Morine corridor and improve access for the
                         hinterland population, to introduce innovation in road maintenance on a pilot basis, and to contribute to the development of the institutional framework and
                         implementation of road safety activities throughout Albania.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The implementation of the Transport Project continues to progress well, six months before the formal closing date of the project. As at December 15, 2010, approximately six months
                         before the closing date, the project has disbursed ninety eight (98) percent of the combined credit/loan, and the construction works are complete on all three sections (Lots) of the
                         Milot ­ Rreshen Road; on Lot 1 the Defect Liability Period (DLP) ended on November 6, 2010, while the DLP continues on Lots 2 and 3 ending on December 31, 2010 and
                         September 15, 2011, respectively.

                         The implementation of the Output and Performance-based Road Maintenance contracts (OPBRM) continues to be mixed, but with encouraging signs. One year into the three year

                         period of implementation, the experience with the piloting of the OPBRM contracts in Kukes and Tirana regions, continues to be mixed, reflecting the different levels of performance of
                         the contractors. The GRD/PIT and the Supervising Engineer are working closely with the contractors to ensure performance. Despite the mixed results, there is considerable interest
                         to extend the approach to the other regions of Albania within the forthcoming FY13 Road Management and Safety Project.
