The changes, requested by the\n            Government of the Republic of Albania in a letter signed by\n            the Minister of Finance, dated January 21, 2010, are a\n            reallocation of funds across categories in the financing\n            agreement: i) category of accumulated operating costs to be\n            increased by 230,000 SDR, and ii) category of consultancy\n            one and two to be increased by 40,000 SDR. The requested\n            reallocation is required as the delay in the reform of the\n            General Roads Directorate (GRD) has resulted in a need to\n            continue to pay the salaries and administrative costs of the\n            project implementation team in GRD for a further period of\n            twelve months. The funds are available for reallocation as\n            certain goods and services in the original procurement plan\n            are not now needed, or have been procured from other\n            sources. The items that will not now be procured through the\n            project are the breathalyzers and speed guns for the traffic\n            police, and the sector specific fiduciary assessment."}, "docdt": "2010-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
