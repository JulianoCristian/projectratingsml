                                         ANNEX 1:
                                      Proposed Changes:

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project's development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

   There are no changes to the project's development objectives, outcomes, design,
   and/or scope. The proposed changes, requested by the Government of the Republic
   of Albania in a letter signed by the Minister of Finance, dated January 21, 2010, are a
   reallocation of funds across categories in the Financing Agreement (IDA 4262-ALB):

             i. Category of accumulated operating costs to be increased by 230,000 SDR
             ii. Category of Consultancy I and II to be increased by 40,000 SDR

   The increase in the above categories to be made through the reduction in sums in the
   following categories:

             i. Goods Category                                   SDR 50,000;
             ii. Civil Works II Category                         SDR 40,000; and
             iii. Consultancy III and IV Category                SDR 180,000.

   The proposed reallocation of funds would result in the following change by Categories
   in the table in Schedule 2, Section V, A.2. of the Financing Agreement:

Category                               Before reallocation SDR       The amount requested for
                                                                         reallocation SDR
1. Goods                                      380,000                         330,000
2. Civil Works for Part I of the              664,000                         664,000
project
3. Civil Works for Part II of the             120,000                         80,00
project
4. Consultancy services for part I            350,000                        390,000
and II of the project
5. Consulting services for the part          1,720,000                      1,540,000
III and IV of the project and
training
6. Accumulated operational                    166,000                        396,000
expenses
          Total                              3,400,000                      3,400,000

The requested reallocation is required as the delay in the reform of the General Roads
Directorate has resulted in a need to continue to pay the salaries and administrative costs
of the Project Implementation Team in GRD for a further period of twelve months. The
funds are available for reallocation as certain goods and services in the original
procurement plan are not now needed, or have been procured from other sources. The
items that will not now be procured through the project are the breathalyzers and speed
guns for the traffic police, and the sector specific fiduciary assessment.


                                                5
There are a number of reasons for the delay in the timetable for the reform of the General
Roads Directorate: (i) the original reform action plan and structure needed the approval
of the Council of Ministers; (ii) Agreement amongst the various stakeholders on the
drafting of the new law to establish the Albanian Road Authority took longer than
expected; (iii) the general election in June 2009 delayed the approval of the new law until
October 2009; (iv) the provision of the necessary European Union Grant monies to fund
the consultants to establish the new body was withheld until the law was passed.

As a result, one part of the dated covenant in the project, reproduced below, which
requires the reform of the General Road Directorate to be completed by June 30, 2008,
was not met. The proposed new structure was proposed and accepted to schedule.

        "The Recipient shall: (a) not later than June 30, 2007, submit the proposed new
structure of the GRD for review and agreement of the Association; and (b) not later than
June 30, 20008, reform the GRD in line with the agreed new structure, in a manner
satisfactory to the Association."

It is proposed that the date for the second part of the dated covenant should be extended
until the closing date of the project ­ June 30, 2011.
