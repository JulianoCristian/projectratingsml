outcome was moderate, the Bank\n            performance was satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            the expected levels of service and the penalty system should\n            be defined in Output and Performance-based Maintenance\n            Contract (OPBM) contracts with due consideration of the\n            current condition of assets. It is important to have\n            accurate asset inventory and condition data, because they\n            provide the baseline for measurement of performance by the\n            contractor. Monthly penalties should be defined in\n            accordance with the level of service to be expected during\n            the early life of the project. A sub-contracting provision\n            needs to be clearly defined in the contract. The ambiguity\n            regarding the extent of sub-contracting allowed under the\n            contract for the Milot-Rreshen road section allowed the\n            winning contractor to sub-contract all the civil works, and\n            eventually act as a contract manager. In such a major\n            contract, this could have led to a disastrous situation if\n            not for the experience and ability of the supervision\n            consultants and the contractor's staff. The contract\n            should also include a clearly-defined provision about the\n            main contractor's responsibility to provide its own\n            major equipment (e.g., crushing plant, concrete plant and\n            asphalt plant) in order to avoid forcing sub-contractors to\n            rely on local suppliers."}, "docdt": "2011-12-28T00:00:00Z"}
