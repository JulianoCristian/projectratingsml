The change, requested by the\n            Government of the Republic of Albania in a letter signed by\n            the Minister of Finance, dated May 31, 2010, is a\n            reallocation of funds across the following categories in the\n            financing agreement: i) category of consultancy to be\n            increased by SDR 280,000; and ii) category of goods one to\n            be reduced by SDR 280, 000. The requested reallocation is\n            required to pay for an extension to the road safety\n            technical assistance to allow the consultant to achieve the\n            following: i) to support the actual implementation of the\n            national road safety strategy and action plan, both\n            developed earlier under the project; ii) to prepare a plan\n            for the immediate establishment of the Secretariat under the\n            Inter-ministerial Road safety Council and support the\n            implementation of the plan; and iii) to identify a priority\n            list of accident blacks-pots on the road network and prepare\n            the detailed designs for interventions to address the\n            identified blacks-pots. The funds are available for\n            reallocation as certain goods and consulting services in the\n            original procurement plan are not now needed, or have been\n            procured from other sources.
