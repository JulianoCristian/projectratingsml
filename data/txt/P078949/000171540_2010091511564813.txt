Excellency: 
 
We refer to the Financing Agreement for the above-referenced Project, dated March 21, 2007,

Financing Agreement), and to your written communication dated January 21, 2010 on behalf of the 
Recipient, requesting certain modifications to the Financing Agreement to enable the Project to reach its 
development objectives more effectively. 
After due consideration, the Association concurs with your request and agrees to amend the 
Financing Agreement as follows: 
1. 
Paragraph 6, Section II of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement is deleted in its entirety, and 
replaced by the following: 
 
“The Recipient shall: (a) not later than June 30, 2007, submit the proposed new structure of the 
GRD for review and agreement of the Association; and (b) not later than June 30, 2011, reform the GRD 
in line with the agreed new structure, in a manner satisfactory to the Association.” 
2. 
The table in paragraph A.2, Section V of Schedule 2 to the Financing Agreement is amended to 
read as set forth in the Attachment to this letter. 
3. 
Paragraph 11 of the Appendix to the Financing Agreement is amended to read as follows: 
“
11. 
“Incremental Operating Costs” means reasonable and necessary incremental 
expenditures, approved by the Association on the basis of annual budgets acceptable to 
the Association, incurred by the GRD and the MPWTT (as hereinafter defined) on 
account of Project implementation, management and monitoring, including 
salaries for

Project
,

remain in full force and effect.
