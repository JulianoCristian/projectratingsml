                                         ANNEX 1:
                                      Proposed Changes:

a. What are the proposed changes, as applicable, in the project’s development
   objectives, outcomes, design, and/or scope?

   There are no changes to the project’s development objectives, outcomes, design,
   and/or scope. The proposed change, requested by the Government of the Republic of
   Albania in a letter signed by the Minister of Finance, dated May 31, 2010, is a
   reallocation of funds across the following categories in the Financing Agreement (IDA
   4262-ALB).

             i. Category of Consultancy V (part III and IV of the project and training) to
                 be increased by SDR 280,000; and
             ii. Category of Goods I to be reduced by SDR 280, 000.

   The proposed reallocation of funds will result in the following change by Categories in
   the table in Schedule 2, Section V, A.2. of the Financing Agreement. The change will
   be effected by the Association’s outgoing notification letter to the Recipient:

Category                               Before reallocation SDR      After reallocation SDR
1. Goods                                       330,000                      50,000
2. Civil Works for Part I of the               664,000                      664,000
project
3. Civil Works for Part II of the              80,000                      80,000
project
4. Consultancy services for part I            390,000                      390,000
and II of the project
5. Consulting services for the part          1,540,000                    1,820,000
III and IV of the project and
training
6. Accumulated operational                    396,000                      396,000
expenses
          Total                              3,400,000                    3,400,000

The requested reallocation is required to pay for an extension to the road safety technical
assistance to allow the consultant to achieve the following:
        i)      to support the actual implementation of the National Road Safety Strategy
                and Action Plan, both developed earlier under the project;
        ii)     to prepare a plan for the immediate establishment of the Secretariat under
                the Inter-ministerial Road safety Council and support the implementation
                of the plan; and
        iii)    to identify a priority list of accident blackspots on the road network and
                prepare the detailed designs for interventions to address the identified
                blackspots.

The funds are available for reallocation as certain goods and consulting services in the
original procurement plan are not now needed, or have been procured from other sources.
                                                5
The items that will not now be procured through the project are traffic
counters/classifiers, the vehicles for the project implementation team, and the road
condition measuring equipment. The collection of data for the former and the latter are
envisaged, under the ongoing reform of the General Roads Directorate and its successor,
the Albania Roads Authority, to be outsourced to the private sector. The project
implementation team received vehicles from another source.
