Lessons convey that overall development\n            impact is attained by a sustained support: the decision to\n            allocate the financial resources in two main sectors of a\n            province for a rather long period of time, benefited all\n            five districts of the provinces, and helped strengthen the\n            institutional capacity at the central and provincial\n            government levels. Moreover, the Bank's sustained\n            involvement, and support to the province contributed to\n            developing a strong working relationship with the local\n            authorities, attracting further donors to the province.\n            Although integrated provincial development projects are\n            effective means to strengthen decentralization, the\n            insufficient transfer of resources from central government\n            however, limited mobilization of local revenues, resulting\n            in inefficient allocation of resources across, and within\n            the road, water and sanitation sectors. Thus, concrete steps\n            need to be taken to increase the transparency of the funds\n            being transferred, to improve reliability of transfers in\n            terms of timing and amount, and, to enhance planning and\n            decision making capacity at the provincial level.\n            Implementation arrangements should be responsive to the\n            sectors characteristics and needs, since as in this project,\n            central, and provincial governments were not satisfied with\n            the implementation arrangements, and did not see the\n            relevance on the project coordination unit, nor the\n            technical assistance provided by foreign consultants. The\n            government proposed, and the Bank agreed, that the line\n            units of the provincial office would carry out all\n            implementation activities, institutional adjustments that\n            improved management, and inter sector coordination."}, "docdt": "2003-06-26T00:00:00Z"}
