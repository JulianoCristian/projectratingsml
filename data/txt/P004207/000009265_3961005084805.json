IDA funds will be invested in\n            rural infrastructure -- roads and water supply -- and will\n            support the institutional strengthening of provincial\n            planning and management. Parallel to IDA's project, the\n            European Community's Laung Namtha Area Development\n            Project will finance community development/income generating\n            activities, concentrating on the geographical areas along\n            the IDA financed roads. The road component will: (a) improve\n            two roads totalling about 150 km to low-volume standards;\n            (b) survey and design the Namtha-Nalae road; (c) develop the\n            provincial Department of Communication, Transport, Post and\n            Construction (DCTPC); and (d) develop the local construction\n            industry. The water component will: (a) rehabilitate and\n            expand the water supply network, standpipes and sanitation\n            program in the towns of Namtha and Singh; (b) provide a\n            rural water scheme in the districts of Viengpuka and Long;\n            and (c) provide technical assistance and training to\n            develop, supervise and operate water and sanitation systems.\n            The institutional strengthening component will: (a) set up a\n            Planning, Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) under the\n            provincial governor's office to advise and train\n            provincial counterparts in planning, budgeting and\n            management as well as coordinating the technical assistance\n            program; (b) introduce monitoring and evaluation mechanisms,\n            and integrate relevant project procedures into regular\n            provincial administrative activities; and (c) arrange for\n            scholarships, short-term seminars, and domestic and regional\n            training programs for provincial staff. To ensure\n            sustainability after the project is completed, the\n            technology chosen for operation and maintenance will be\n            low-cost and unsophisticated."}, "docdt": "1994-02-18T00:00:00Z"}
