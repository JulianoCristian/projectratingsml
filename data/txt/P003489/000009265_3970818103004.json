"Ratings for the Gansu Provincial\n            Development Project in China are as follows: overall outcome\n            of the project was rated satisfactory, and the performance\n            of the Bank and the Borrower were also rated satisfactory.\n            Some of the lessons learned are: (a) single-province\n            projects demonstrate the advantage of focused association\n            and provincial attention to a limited number of important\n            provincial goals and bring to implementation the energy and\n            concentration necessary to attain the goals; (b) the\n            education component of this multi-sectoral project benefited\n            from the high level and continuing attention of a group of\n            provincial policymakers responsible for carrying out the\n            full range of association-supported project activities; (c)\n            the provincial focus afforded both the province and the\n            association the opportunity to bring to bear provincial\n            resources, such as Gansu Institute for Educational Research\n            (GIER), which through its research, added value to both this\n            and subsequent association activities in Gansu; and (d) for\n            projects carried out during periods of unforeseen inflation,\n            project supervision needs to be increased during the\n            inflationary periods to prevent slippage in attaining goals,\n            especially in the area of counterpart funding."}, "docdt": "1997-03-28T00:00:00Z"}
