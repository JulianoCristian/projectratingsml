The main objective\n            of the component was to raise the living standards and\n            income levels for about 96,000 poor households in Gansu\n            Province through increased agricultural production achieved\n            through: (a) 57,000 hectare (ha) irrigation development and\n            improvement, and land settlement by voluntary migration of\n            the newly irrigated land; and (b) improvement of rain-fed\n            agriculture on some 76,000 ha in Guanchuan River Basin\n            through soil and water conservation, and improved farming\n            practices. IDA's overall performance in identification,\n            preparation and appraisal was considered as satisfactory.\n            The Borrower's performance in project implementation\n            and management was generally satisfactory. The\n            project's overall outcome is satisfactory despite some\n            remaining works to be completed under the Yindaruqin\n            Subcomponent. The key lessons learned were: (a) for a major\n            and complex engineering project, more attention should be\n            paid before appraisal by the Borrower and the Bank to\n            detailed engineering investigation and design, contract\n            packaging and realistic implementation schedules, taking\n            into consideration the Borrower's resources and\n            implementing capacity; (b) evaluation of bids for major\n            civil works should be more stringent on bidders'\n            capability and past performance (i.e., on prequalification)\n            as opposed to major focus on price (bid evaluation); (c)\n            adequate and timely counterpart funds are critical to ensure\n            scheduled implementation, thereby avoiding delay and\n            increases in project cost; (d) time-bound implementation\n            plans for land settlement of migrant settlers should be\n            prepared at appraisal and covenanted in the Loan/Credit\n            agreements for effective implementation; (e) the use of\n            local consultants with suitable qualifications and\n            experience could be promoted with substantial saving to the\n            Borrower; and (f) large-scale irrigation development with\n            land settlement for poverty reduction invariably takes a\n            longer time to complete."}, "docdt": "1997-01-23T00:00:00Z"}
