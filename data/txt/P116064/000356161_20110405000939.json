Some lessons learned\n            included: vouchers can be used effectively in a\n            post-conflict setting if the necessary organizational\n            structures for retailing and redemption of coupons are\n            intact. Use of the private sector has proven effective,\n            despite the constraints. Without strong mechanisms of social\n            accountability, selection of beneficiaries under such\n            schemes can be subject to fraud and corruption. Constraints\n            in the flow of funds to districts and to agro dealers can\n            undermine confidence that the vouchers will be redeemed or\n            that product will be available in a timely manner, and can\n            reduce effectiveness of the programs. A well managed voucher\n            program can forestall return to public intervention in\n            supply and distribution of fertilizer, and build essential\n            private presence in the sector."}, "docdt": "2010-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
