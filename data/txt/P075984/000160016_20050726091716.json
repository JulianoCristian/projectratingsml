outcome is satisfactory; sustainability is unlikely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is satisfactory.\n            Cited from this project include: 1) An operation focused on\n            fast disbursement and without explicit developmental\n            objectives is an efficient and effective vehicle to respond\n            to emergency and crisis situations. Any conditionality or\n            reform requirements, as well as explicit capacity-building\n            components, risk disrupting the flow of critical financial\n            resources, endanger adequate service provision, and\n            undermine the functioning and credibility of the public\n            agency. 2) Delegation of implementation responsibility to\n            the relevant units in participating agencies and line\n            ministries leads to more effective and efficient\n            implementation. 3) Close supervision, in particular though\n            field-based staff, and flexibility in adopting the program\n            to local realities, as well as quickly responding to urgent\n            needs and changing requirements by reallocating resources,\n            are important elements in ensuring success in emergency\n            operations.4) Ensure that implementing agency staff\n            understand Bank requirements for implementation. Even under\n            emergency conditions, delays can be reduced by using\n            field-based Bank procurement staff to build local capacity,\n            setting up training programs, and establishing a central\n            oversight mechanism with the Borrower. 5) Explore\n            alternatives to monitoring outputs and, whenever possible,\n            identify and monitor outcome indicators. However, emphasize\n            choosing readily observable or available indicators for\n            monitoring and use. 6) Multi-Donor Trust Funds offer a more\n            suitable arrangement for managing large donor-financed operations."}, "docdt": "2005-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
