the Credit will not be required to finance the Project’s costs to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Credit, or (c) at any time, the 
Administrator determines, with respect to any contract to be financed 
out of the proceeds of the Credit, that corrupt or fraudulent practices 
were engaged in by representatives of the Borrower or of a 
beneficiary of the Credit during the procurement or the execution of 
such contract, without the Borrower having taken timely and 
appropriate action satisfactory to the Administrator to remedy the 
situation, and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of 
such contract which would otherwise have been eligible for financing 
out of the proceeds of the Credit, or (d) at any time, the 
Administrator determines that the procurement of any contract to be 
financed out of the proceeds of the Credit is inconsistent with the 
procedures set forth or referred to in the Trust Fund Credit 
Agreement and establishes the amount of expenditures in respect of 
such contract which would otherwise have been eligible for financing 
out of the proceeds of the Credit, or (e) after the Closing Date, an 
amount of the Credit shall remain unwithdrawn from the Credit 
Account, the Administrator may, by notice to the Borrower,

affect the ability of the Borrower to perform any of its obligations 
under the Trust Fund Credit Agreement or to achieve the objectives 
of the Project, or the ability of the Project implementation entity to 
perform any of its obligations arising under, or entered into pursuant 
to, the Trust Fund Credit Agreement, or to achieve the objectives of 
the Project; and (B) do not materially and adversely affect the

in the same legal form as that prevailing as of the date of the Trust 
Fund Credit Agreement.
