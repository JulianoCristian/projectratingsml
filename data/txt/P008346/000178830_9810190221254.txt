INTERNATIONAL BANX FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS FOR AN
IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cyprus for the equivalent of UJS$14 million to help finance
the Paphos Irrigation Project. The loan would have a terra of 22 years, includ-
ing 7 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.    US$1.8 million
would be relent to the Greek and Turkish Central Cooperative Banks at 7-1/4
percent per annum for onlending to farmers.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        k-. "Updating Memorandum on the Current Economic Position and Pro-
spects in Cyr-us" dated May 11, 1973 was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 17, 1973 (R73-107). A Country Data sheet is attached in Annex I.
3.        in spite of the difficult internal political situation which pre-
vailed during the 1960's, and the unresolved tensions between the Turkish and
Greek communities on the island, Cyprus has enjoyed a decade of rapid economic
growth. Most of the targets laid down in the first (1962-1966) and the second
(1967-1971) Five-Year Plans have been fulfilled. The average rate of growth
for the decade (7.1 percent per year) surpassed the Government targets of both
Plans, and preliminary estimates for 1972 indicate that the economy grew by
about 10 percent in that year. During the two Five-Year Plans, value added
in agriculture almost doubled, due to the application of new technologies,
and accounted for 19 percent of GDP in 1971.   Expansion of manu acturing and
service sectors including tourism was even more rapid, and their share in GDP
increased to 12 percent and 54 percent respectively at the end of the period.
Mining, on the other hand, declined both in absolute and relative terms. In
the absence of new discoveries, the future of this sector is uncertain. The
major factors behind the rapid growth of the economy are a high and rising
rate of investment, a rapid increase in agricultural exports and a flexible
fiscal and monetary policy which not only helped to stimulate growth but also
maintained domestic price stability.
4.        As a result of economic growth, unemployment declined to 1 percent
of the labor force in 1971 and the number of emigrants declined from 13,500
in 1961 to 2,300 in 1971. Labor shortages are beginning to be felt largely
in the higher and middle grade technical personnel. While accepted in prin-
ciple by all parties, a policy of keeping wage increases in line with pro-
ductivity growth has proved difficult to carry out.



5.        The attainment cf a sound balance of payments position by encourag-
ing tourism and commodity exports and simultaneously reducing dependence on
foreign military expenditures has been one of the main long-term objec-ives
of the first and second Five-Year Plans. Expenditure by foreign troops, re-
ceipts from tourism and net capital inflows have kept the country's balance
of payments in surplus for the past decade in spite of an ever widening trade
gap, and foreign assets reached $320 million at the end of 1972 (12 month's
imports). Merchandise exports increased by almost 12 perrcent per year be-
tween 1967 and 1972. Agricultural products remain the most important item,
accoun,ing for around half of total exports, but the export of manufacturino
industry grew from about 8 percent to 14.5 percent of the total.
6.        In spite of an increase in current expenditures during the second
Five-Year Plan, the Government has managed to generate sufficient surpluses in
its current budget over the Plan period to finance 85 percent of public sector
development expenditures. Government revenues, which as a percentage of GDP
increased from 17.4 to 18.2 between 1967 and 1971, are mainly derived from in-
come tax and import duties, Current expenditures, which increased from 13 to
15 percent of GDP between 1957 and 1971, grew on the average by about 15.5
percent per year over the same period. The major items responsible for the
increase were expenditures on education (20 percent of the total), interna'l
security (12 percent of the total) and public health (9 percent of the total).
During the same period development expendituLre by the Government increased
from 3 percent to 5 percent: of GDP.
7.        The third Five-Year Plan (1972-1976) proposes to continue the
strategy of the earlier Plans, and focuses on the further development of agri-
culture, manufacturing and tourism together with associated infrastructure
needs. The Plan envisages a 7.1 percent annual rate of growth of GDP. Agri-
culture is expected to grow by about 7 percent per annum while manufacturing
is projected to grow by 12 percent. However, further decline in the value
added in the mining sector is envisaged.
8.        External public debt incurred bv Cyprus over tne past few years has
remained at a low level as a result of the Government's limited ability to
borrow abroad, because of the unsettled political situation, and the Govern-
ment's policy of financing econonmic development largely from internal sources.
As of December 1972 the total public debt outstanding amounted to about US$73.4
million of which $40.8 million was disbursed. New commitments in 1972 totalled
$16 million, of which $12 million came from the World Bank. Debt payments are
estimated at $7 million in 1972 equal to 2.4 percent of exports of goods and
services. The debt service ratio is expected to remain at the same level
through 1978. Cyprus remains creditworthy for substantial borrowing on con-
ventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CYPRUS
9.        Despite unsettled political conditions in recent years, the strength
of the Cyprus economy has made possible a continuity in Bank Group operations.



Cyprus has to date received 9 loans1, tota'lling $56.1 million (net of cancel-
lations), of which $20.5 million was undisbursed as of November 30, 1973.
Four loans were for power, two for water supply and sewerage, one for ports,
one for industry and tourism and one for highways. Although some projects
have been delayed in the past, steps have been taken to remedy this, and
progress in all loans is now satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of November 30, 1973 and
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
10.       Bank Group lending has concentrated on improving infrastructure and
on bringing about necessary structural and institutional reforms which would
provide the basis for sound economic growth. Through four power loans, the
Bank has assisted in the consolidation and expansion of the Electricity Au-
thority. Improvement of port administration and operation through the crea-
tion of a National Ports Authority, now undenray, was one of the objectives
of Bank lending for the ports project, and the creation of Sewerage Boar6s
was an important element in the two sewerage projects, The loan to the Cyprus
Development Bank will help strengthen the main financial institution providing
long-term finance to the private sector, thus giving valuable support to the
formation of industrial export and tourism, the two most promising sectors
in the economy for growth in earning fcreign exchange. The recent loan for
highways will reinforce the road infrastructure necessary for service activ-
ities which at p.z-ent account for more than half of GDP.
11.       A second loan to the Cyprus Development Bank (CDR) is under con-
sideration for FY75p as is a loan to finance a power/desalination project.
The next likely project in the agriculture sector is the Morphou Irrigation
Project which includes improvement of irrigation supplies on about 7,500 hec-
tares. This project is being studied by a firm of consultants under the
supervision of FAO. The Bank's objectives will continue to be to assist
in key sectors where institutional reform is essential, and in the provi-
sion of technical assistance in project planning and preparation. The
present proposed loan, the power/desalination project, and the Morpnou Ir-
rigation Project mark the initiation of a new emphasis in lending to Cyprus
aiming toward a more efficient and rational use of its scarce water resources
for agriculture.
12.       IFC made its first investment in Cyprus ini September 1972 amount-
ing to $0.4 million equity and $2.3 milliorn loan for an expansion of the
Cyprus Cement Company (Limassol). IFC's approach in Cyprus will be to sup-
port the Government's development strategy which emphasizes tourism and
export-oriented industrial projects. A steel rolling mill and a hotel proj-
ect, still in the preliminary stage of preparation, have been brought to
IFC's attention. These may be suitable for financing after further study.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN CYPRUS
13.       Agriculture is the largest sector in the economY.    It accounts Lor
one-fifth of GDP, provides employment to 35 percent of the labor force and



- 4 -
:.,aes up about one-half of the annual exports, mainly citrus, vegetables and
-;-apes. The growth in the agricultural sector during the last decade aver-
aged 8.5 percent a year but there were large year-to-year fluctuations caused
by weather and more specifically by erratic rainfall. To reduce dependence
of agriculture on rain, development of irrigation has been rightly emphasized
in Government development plans. To date, about 43,000 ha. or 12 percent of
:L'e 360,000 ha. cultivated area is irrigated. Its contribution to production
is highly significant as irrigated production, by value, accounts for 75 per-
cent of tile total annual agricultural production. The current Government
plan allocates about half of development expenditure to agriculture and rural
d-evelopment (including water resources), and has a 7 percent growth target
for the sector. At present, per capita GDP in the agricultural sector is
about US$464 per year, which is less than one-half of the national average
(US$1S160). Government's present agricultural policy aims at increasing the
earning capacity of farmers so that the income gap between agricultural and
other sectors is narrowed.
14.       Although irrigation water is scarce, it is not fully exploited,
mainlv because it involves heavy investments preceded by lengthy surveys and
investigations. Surface and underground water resources of Cyprus are es-
timated at about 570 Mm3 of which about 440 1x3 or about three-fourths is
now being used. The development of the remainder would enable irrigation of
an additional 13,000 ha. (another 3 percent of the cultivated area). A further
increase in area can be realized by improving the efficiency of irrigation
through better management and use of sprinklers, which is being envisaged in
the Paphos Irrigation Project, to produce high-value and out of season crops
while avoiding exploitation of the aquifer.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
15.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of Paphos Irrigation Project - Republic of Cyprus"
(252a-CY) dated December 18, 1973, which is being distributed separately.
A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
16.       The project was identified in 1961 by a UN Economic Mission and
preparation was financed by UNDP and supervised by FAO as its executing agency.
Assessment of hydrology, hydrogeology and agronomy, dam reconnaissance and
overall planning was carried out in 1968-1970 by Thomas Ingledow and Associates
Ltd. of Canada. Preparation of feasibility study was carried out in 1971-73
bv Sir M. MacDonald and Partners, Hunting Technical Services, Howard Humphrey
and Sons - all of U.K. - and Jean Saliba of Lebanon. The project was appraised
bv a Bank mission in May 1973, and negotiations were held in Washington in
November. The Cyprus delegation was headed by Mr. R. Michaelidess Director
General of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources.
17.       The project would provide irrigation for 4,960 ha. net and would
also improve production on 1,470 ha. of rainfed cultivation through improved



- 5 -
technology and supporting services.  At full developnent in 1986, the proiect
would increase annual production of main crops:   citrus by 38,000 tons, table
grapes by 23,000 tons, vegetables by 54,000 tons and bananas by 2,000 tons.
The existing production of cereals and other crops would drop by about 6,000
tons due to diversion of land from cereal to vegetable and fruit production.
It is expected that the gross value of production would be increased from the
present US$2.9 million. to US$19.4 million, and that the foreign exchange earn-
ings from the expor: of project produce would amount to UTS$7.3 million. T'ae
project would consist of the following works: (a) 35 tubewelis in 3 well-
fields wich 3 conveyance pipelines; (b) an earthfill dar, witlh a storage capa-
city of 51 Mr;J; (c) a main conveyance svstem from the reservoir to the dis-
tribution network; (d) a pressurized water distribution network to serve
4,960 ha.; and (e) farm access roads, credit for on farm development, and
buildings.  The project includes land acquisition for the reservoir (320 ha.),
irrigation network (100 ha., including 65 ha. of easements for buried pipe-
lines), and farm access roads (1lO ha.); resettlement of about 300 farmers to
be disnlaced fror. the reservoir area; equipment and vehicles for construction,
s3,J:;.ion and maintenance; and consultants and administrative services.  Far-
mers dispi-acec. from the reservoir area would be given Governmertc land to be
irrigated under th.e project, in parcels equivalent to those held by them now.
Construction is scheduled to begin early in 1974 and be completed by 1980.
..S.      TiLe social aspects of the project have also been considered.  Since
about 20 percent: of the project area is owned by Turkish-Cypriots nho consti-
tute about 24 percent of its population, they have requested representatinn at
the decisior.-mEraki-ng and local leveels of project implementation. As a com-
rfromise a ;Pro>,-c. Policy and Coordination Committee (PPCC) would be set up in
Nicosia uncer L-..e chairmanship of the 1finister of Agriculture and Natural
Resources and including tie Directors General of the Ministries of Agriculture
and Natural i<-touzceso Finance, Taterior, Commr.erce and Industry, and the Plan-
ning B'ureau.; C-e C'.-Wlissioners for Greek and Turkish Cooperative Development,
a represen.at -<c wL h.e Pancyprian Turkish Farmers' Union, the Tirector of
ti-ie Water D0evc1 ,pmeret Department, and the UNDP Resident Representative in
Cyprus.  The P2CC would coordinate thle activities of all the agencies involv-
ed and superv-ise project implementation.  A Project Advisory Committee (PAC)
in the project area would be established to advise the Project Manager on
local affairs and developments atfecting the project. It would also be the
forum for obtain§-x.g the vlews of faruiers' representatives on matters stich as
operation and maintenance of completed works, hours for irrigation, and pro-
ject charges and their recovery, and would explain project objectives to the
farmers. By including representatives from the Turkish-Cypriot community,
the PPCC and the PAC woulu assist ir. ensuring equitable distribution of pro-
ject benefits. Overseas training would be provided for a total of 66 man/
months for Cvrriots in the fields of sprinkler irrilgation, agricultural re-
search, extension and marKeting related, to earlv vegetables, quality citrus
and earlv table grapes.   The tieaith Department would monitor the project area
for bilharzia and malar-a.
19.       The project would be executed by tlhe two Central Cooperative Banks
and by the Water Development Department (WDD) of the Mlinistrv of Agriculture



- 6 -
arnd Natural Resources which has a number of trained engineers and other tech-
nical staff. After project completion, a separate section would be created
with.n WDD to operate and maintain the project works.
20.      Of the total on-farm development costs of the project, amounting to
S4.5 million equivalent, farmers would contribute 20 percent; the remaining
.,O percent would be provided during the project by the Greek and Turkish
Central Cooperative Banks (CCBs) through medium- and long-term credits, half
..om the proceeds of the Bank loan and hlalf from other Government resources.
To this end, the Government would relend, from the Bank's loan, about $1.4
million to the Greek CCB and $0.4 million to the Turkish CCB, at a rate of
interest of 7.25 percent p.a. The Government would lend equivalent amounts
to the two CCBs from its own resources, at a rate of interest required to pro-
duce an average rate of not less than 6.5 percent p.a. on the aggregate of the
ou.standing amounts of the credits made by the Government to CCBs from its
own funds and from the Bank loan, or approximately 5.75 percent p.a. Current-
ly the Government lends to the CCBs at 3 percent p.a. and they on-lend such
Government funds to farmers at 4.5 percent p.a. for rmiedium- and long-term
credits while they lend their own funds at 8 percent p.a. The Government has
agreed that the CCBs would lend the $3.6 million derived from the Bank loan
and Government resources to project farmers at an interest rate of not less
than 8 percent p.a.; the actual rate will be established and maintained in
line with prevailing rates for loans made by commercial banks for similar
purposes. To enable farmers to obtain their credit requirements from the CCBs,
the existing lending regulations would be relaxed somewhat by (a) expanding
the list of assets acceptable to the CCBs for mortgages, and (b) lengthening
repayment periods to muatch crop development periods as well as repayment capa-
cities of farmers. Short-term credit will continue to be available to pro-
ject farmers from the village cooperative societies which can borrow from the
two CCBs.
21.       The total cost of the project, excluding import duties, is estimated
at US$36.2 million, including US$8.1 of physical and price contingencies. The
foreign exchange cost would be US$18.2 million. A detailed estimate is given
in Annex III. The proposed loan of US$14 million would cover about 40 percent
of the total project cost and about three quarters of the foreign exchange
component. The Government will provide the balance of the funds required for
the project, including about: US$4 million equivalent in foreign exchange.
22.       A water charge collected from water users under the project would
be set so as to recover full annual operation and maintenance costs and full
investment and replacement costs over the project lifetime of 50 years at an
interest rate of at least 4 percent per annum,
Consulting Services
23.       Most investigations and surveys for the dam and the canal have al-
ready been completed. The wellfields would be designed by WDD and the Geo-
logical Survey Department. The canal, farm roads and buildings would also



-7-
be designed by WDD. A consulting firm would be engaged to design and super-
vise the construction of the dam and the irrigation network. Additional in-
vestigations required for detailed design of the dam and its ancillary struc-
tures would be carried out by this firm. The design of the on-farm irriga-
tion system would be done by the Water Use Section of the Agriculture Depart-
ment. Individual experts, specialized in the fields of sprinkler irrigation
and the growing and marketing of out of season and early vegetables9 quality
citrus and early maturing table grapes would be provided for a total period of
36 man-months.
Disbursement and Procurement
24.       The proposed Bank loan of US$14.0 million would be disbursed over
seven years. The estimated schedule of disbursements is shown in Annex III.
The total cost of project works that would be tendered is US$21.4 million9
excluding contingencies. Of this total, contracts for the construction of
Asprokremmos dam (US$8.7 million), main pipeline and all pumping plants
(US$3.1 million) and for the supply of asbestos cement pipe, pipe fittings,
tubewell pipe, pumps, power equipment, other equipment and vehicles (US$5.3
million) would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under Bank Loans and IDA
Credits. The remaining work (US$4.3 million) comprising installation of
secondary pipelines, construction of the canal, buildings, power lines and
farm roads, are works of varying nature and small magnitude, unsuitable for
international competitive bidding and would be constructed over the seven
years by contractors selected through local competitive bidding. For local
contracts exceeding ITS$200,000 in value, bidding documents would be furnished
to the Bank for approval prior to issue, and awards would be made in consulta-
tion with the Bank. Consultants will be selected in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines, and land acquisition will not be financed by the Bank.
Economic Justification
25.       The introduction of large scale irrigation in the Paphos region
and the provision of proper agricultural services under the project would bring
modern agriculture to some 5,000 ha. which have been subject to rainfed and
spate irrigated agriculture. The provision of a carry-over storage reservoir
would assure badly needed irrigation supplies even in years of drought and
avoid the substantial fluctuations which existed in the past. The major quan-
tifiable economic benefits from the project would be the significant increase
in the production of high value exportable crops which would result in: (a)
an annual foreign exchange earning of about US$7.3 million, (b) higher income
for about 3,500 farm families, (c) employment opportunities for 1,300 landless
families in the project area, and (d) additional production of vegetables and
fruit -or domestic consumption.   Most of the project beneficiaries would be
small farmers, as about 70% of the project area is cultivated either by small
owners having 7 ha. or less each or by tenants and lessees farming 2.5 ha.
each. The project would increase the net income of small owner-farmers by
about 400 to 500%. The income of a 2.5 ha, leased farm would increase by
120%.  The annual net value of production by project farmers would increase



:resenr US$1.3 million to US$9.7 million,   Investment in farm roads,
--  c-ion to serving tne project needs, would improve the general communica-
- wetwork irn the area  The project's economic rate of return, costing
f-:a::lly and hired labor at current wage rates, is estimated at 19%.
The investment cost of about US$7,000 per hectare of irrigated land
, .:gh DJc reasonable in relation to the high value export crops such as
.rapes and citrus which are to be produced.   Since Cyprus lacks large agri-
culcural areas with sufficient cheap water for efficient and competitive far-
r:ing of staple foodstuffs, Cypriot farmers will choose to produce expensive
,-roPs -zen tne small areas suitable for such agriculture with the expensive
'acer supply,
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
27.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Cyprus and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The execu-
cion of satisfactory Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Borrower and the
two CCBs and the appointment of the Project Manager are conditions to the
effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The draft Agreement conforms with the
normal pattern for loans for irrigation projects.
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

provision of port equ:pment at LimassoL and Famagusta.   All maritime works
were satisfactorily complezed in early July 1973. The port was ready for
export cargo in Septeiaber 1973 and will be ready for full use early in 1974.
however, the architect's design for the permanent passe,nger terminal is being
modified as IL was too elaborate and costly for the needs of the port.   This
is likely to necessitace an extension of the present closing date.   Total
project cosLs are now estimated at US$19.7 million equivalernt, compared to
the appraisal estimate of US$18.6 million eQuivalent.   The foreign exchlange
costs are not expected to exceed *he estimated US$11.5 million.   Tne Cyprus
Port Authority has now been created and steps are being taken to appoint the
members of the Authority (Board of Directors) and to engage a General Manager.
It is planned that .he Auzhority will function from january 1, 1974.

March 31, 1975.   Sewerage and drainage projects at Nicosia and Famagusta.  As
a result of delays in sewer construction, following a strike by pipe suppliers,
orogress of both pro-lects is about six months behind schedule. Contract prices
are 20% below estimates, and the loan for Nicosia has consequently been reduced
by SO.8 million at the request of the beneficiary.
