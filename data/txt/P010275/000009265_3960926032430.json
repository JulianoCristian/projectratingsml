The\n            project will add about 120 megawatts (MW) of generating\n            capacity through rehabilitation and about 80 MW through\n            conversion of combustion turbines to combined cycle\n            operation. It will also promote more efficient use of energy\n            by reducing the consumption of fuel per kilowatt hour (kWh)\n            of power generated. In addition the project will continue\n            the institution building efforts initiated under the Bank\n            Group's earlier lending operations by strengthening the\n            Water and Power Development Authority's (WAPDA)\n            capability in the operation and maintenance of thermal power\n            stations and spare parts management."}, "docdt": "1987-03-07T00:00:00Z"}
