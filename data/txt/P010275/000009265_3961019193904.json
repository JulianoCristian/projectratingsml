The project achieved its main objectives, its\n            impact on institutional development was partially\n            successful, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, WAPDA should strengthen\n            its systems for supervision of all its ongoing projects to\n            avoid delays and get timely feedback for taking remedial\n            actions. Second, changes in original design make it\n            difficult to evaluate the project outcome compared to the\n            appraisal estimates, both in terms of costs as well as the\n            specific benefits (capacity recovery, efficiency\n            improvements, etc.) to be achieved. Finally, in the future,\n            WAPDA should ensure that progress on institution-building\n            activities takes place along with physical work. Also, any\n            deficiencies or delays on this count should be taken up with\n            senior management at an early stage."}, "docdt": "1996-03-06T00:00:00Z"}
