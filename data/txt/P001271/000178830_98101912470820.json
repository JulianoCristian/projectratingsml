semi-arid areas of the Baringo District. Major components\n            will include the development and extension of suitable\n            management techniques for water and soil erosion control;\n            development of improved cultivation methods; improvement of\n            livestock production through better husbandry, range\n            management, fodder production, water supplies and marketing\n            facilities; improvement of health, education and road\n            facilities; expansion of Government staff in the area and\n            the establishment of a project headquarters; provision of a\n            team of specialists for project planning and implementation\n            and a Development Fund for investments in productive\n            activities identified during project implementation. It is\n            expected that the proposed investments will increase crop\n            and livestock production and help to improve the health of\n            the local population. The project will also offer\n            significant employment opportunities for the local\n            population as well as facilitate the transfer of technical\n            skills and knowledge to Kenyan officials."}, "docdt": "1979-11-30T00:00:00Z"}
