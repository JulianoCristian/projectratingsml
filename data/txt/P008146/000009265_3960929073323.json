           electricity service at least cost and to modernize\n            UTE's management to improve efficiency.  Project\n            objectives include : a) improving the reliability of meeting\n            short to medium term electricity demand; and b) improving\n            sector efficiency by improving UTE's managerial\n            capability and reducing losses.  As part of UTE's\n            investment program for 1990-97, the project will include the\n            following components : 1) installation of a new thermal\n            plant (powered by two gas turbines of 113.5 MW each),\n            including spare parts, control house, substation,\n            interconnection to the existing transmission system, fuel\n            pipeline and tanks; 2) improvements in the Montevideo power\n            distribution network consisting of rehabilitation of the\n            medium and low voltage system to increase the reliability of\n            service to customers, as well as reduce the actual level of\n            technical losses; and 3) implementation of an Institutional\n            Development Program (IDP) consisting of : i) technical\n            assistance for developing adequate procedures, management\n            training and software transfer through a corporate twinning\n            arrangement; ii) purchasing and setting up equipment to\n            support the above; and iii) a training program including the\n            rehabilitation of UTE's training center for technicians\n            and skilled workers."}, "docdt": "1990-05-07T00:00:00Z"}
