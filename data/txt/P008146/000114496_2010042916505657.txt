Dear Dr. Volonte:
            Re:  Uruguay - Loan 3221
      I refer to the Loan Agreement dated August 21, 1990, between the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) and the
Administracion Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Electricas (the Borrower).
      I am pleased to inform you that the Bank agrees to your requests to:
(a) modify the financing scheme for goods and services for construction of
thermal plant under Part A of the Project; and (b) transfer US$1,000,000
from Category (4) to (1).  Accordingly, the table set forth in paragraph I
of Schedule I is hereby deleted and the new table, shown as Attachment 1
hereto substituted therefor.  To have a clear understanding on what goods
and         services under Category (1) of the new table will be financed
by the Bank, attachment 2 has been included.  Please note that the Bank will
disburse under Category I only against expenditures described in said
Attachment 2.
      If you agree with the proposed amendment, please sign and date, on
behalf of the Borrower, the enclosed copy of this letter and its attachment
and return them to us.
      A copy of this letter is being sent to the Minister of Economy and
Finance as representative of the Republica Oriental and Uruguay, the
Guarantor.
                             Sincerely yours,
