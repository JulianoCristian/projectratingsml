                                     PROJECT PAPER


Introductory Statement

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval ofthe ExecutiveDirectors to introduce the
following changes inthe Peru Irrigation Subsector Supplemental Project (Loan No. 7308
0-PE) and accompanying amendment to the Project's loan agreement. The proposed
restructuring would revise: (a) Project outcomes targets and (b) the allocationof the loan
proceeds between expenditurecategories.

Backgroundand Reasonsfor Restructuring

2.      A supplemental IBRDloan (7308-0 PE) for the PeruIrrigationSubsector
Supplemental Project (PSI 11) (P094152) was approved on June 14,2005 and became
effective onNovember 17,2005. The original objective ofthe supplemental Project was
to contribute to increasing the production andproductivity o f irrigated agriculture on
Peru's Coast inorder to improve farmers' well-being andto contribute to poverty
alleviation. The supplemental Project includes the following components:

    0   ComponentA. Rehabilitationandmodernization o f collective irrigation systems
        (total cost US$ 5.47 million). This component supports eligible water users
        associations (WUA) to improve water supply service to farmers through financing
        infrastructure improvements of the collective irrigation system.
    0   Component B. On-farm IrrigationInfrastructure Improvement (total cost US$
        6.17 million). This component provides financial incentives to eligible farmers'
        groups to encourage the adoption o f improved on-farm irrigation infrastructure,
        such as drip and sprinkler systems.
    0   Component C. Capacity Building o f Water Users Groups and Farmers (total cost:
        US$4.12 million). This component supports: (a) the capacity building o f WUA
        intechnical, financial and administrative matters to increasetheir sustainability
        and the quality o ftheir management; (b) technical assistance to farmers to (i)
        preparefeasibility studies for irrigation improvements to be financed under
        components A and B, (ii)  improve irrigationpractices at the farm level and (iii)
        support marketing o f their produce. This component i s expected to improve
        WUA capacities so that, bythe endofthe Project, among the 64 WUA locatedin
        the coastal areaof Peru, at least 47 would become eligible to component A, 40
        would reach the "sustainability" level and water tariff collectionrate would
        average 79%.




                                                                                          2

          ComponentD.Improving Water Resources Management (Total cost: US$4.8
          million), including the formalization o f 215,000 water licenses andtheir
          registration; and
          ComponentE. Project coordinationandmonitoring(Total cost: US$ 1.45 million)

  3.      The first Project restructuring was approved bythe Boardon September 14,2007
  to extendthe Project area to Peru's highland("sierra") region inorder to support the new
  Government's program developing the impoverishedSierra -Programa Sierra
  Exportadora. This requireda change inthe formulation o f the ProjectDevelopment
  Objective to cover the sierra territory and changes inthe expected outcomes targets at end
  o f the Project.

  4.      Projectperformance and expected achievement at Pro-iectclosing. Preliminary
  results indicatethat the Project impact i s very positive: farmers are switchingproduction
  to higher value crops for exports, farmers' incomes are increasing andthe capacity o f
  WUA is improving. However, implementationprogress hasbeenslow due to overly
  optimistic Project expectations extrapolated from a previousproject (PSI I)   which
  operated inthe IrrigationDistricts with highpotential for success. New outcome
  expectations didnot take into account the more difficult environment inwhich PSI I1i s
  operating (Le. poorer, lower capacity IrrigationDistricts) combinedwith stricter -
  conditions for subproject approval, including higher financial contributionfrom farmers.
  This resultedinsevere implementationdelays for components A andB andcost overruns
  for components C and D.

  5.      More specifically, the reasons for implementation delays o f componentsA and B
  are as follows:

       a. The difficulty for WUA (component A) and farmers' groups (component B) to
          gather their cash contributionto subproject investments due to lower than
          expected financial capacity. Inaddition, WUA contributions are substantially
          higher thaninthe previous Project: 20% o f subproject cost under PSI Iagainst
          35% under the present Project.
       b. Preparing subproject feasibility studieshastaken moretime thananticipated
          becausetheir formulation is the responsibility o f WUA andfarmers groups and
          because an additional step "subproject profile", a requirementintroducedby the
          MinistryofFinance, was includedintheprocess.
       c. Additional factor affected the timely implementationo f component Byincluding:
          the obligation for farmers to constitute groups (minimum 6 farmers and 24 ha) in
          order to be eligible for component Bya conditionthat didnot exist under PSI I,
          underwhich individual farmers were eligible.


. 6.      Cost overruns o f component C are directly related to the higher thanexpected
  amount o f technical assistance neededto establish farmers groups (eligibility criterion on
 component B) and to generate good quality subprojects feasibility studies (components A
 and B).



                                                                                            3

7.      ComponentD entails the formalizationo f water rights inboththe Sierra andthe
coastal areas, while PSI I,  the preceding Project, only formalized water rights inthe
coastal area. The time and cost o f formalizing water rights inthe Sierra i s much higher
thaninthe Coastbecause:
    a. Inthe Sierra, many water rights are issuedto a community o f farmers while inthe
        Coast all water rightshave beenissuedto individual farmers. Issuinga water
        rightto a community is more complex andtime consuming as it involves
        identifyingthe irrigationplots o fall farmers withinthe community;
    b. Inthe Sierra, landis not cultivated inwinter, reducingthe time when field work
        can be carried out, while inthe Coast, the landis cultivatedyear around.

8.      Reasons for Project restructuring. Inaccordance with the request received from
the Government onApril 15,2008, a first one year extension ofthe closingdate ofthe
Loan Agreement was approved by the Country Director on May 28,2008 inorder to
enable the Borrower to complete subprojects that are currently under implementation.
The newclosing date is June 30,2009.

9.      Takinginto account the recently approved Project extension, the proposed
restructuring will ensure that uncommittedfunds are put into productive use, fully
disbursingthe loan at Projectclosing, andthat relevant outcomes are achieved. Itwould
include: (a) a reallocationo f loanproceeds betweenexpenditure categories and (b) a
revision o f outcome targets.

10.     A reallocationof loanproceeds from civil works andgoods categories to
consultant services and operating costs would ensurethat there are enough funds to: (a)
continue supporting farmers preparing good quality irrigationimprovement subproject
feasibility studies and gathering their financial contribution; (b) ensure the sustainability
of Project investmentsthrough capacity buildingo f W A Sand f m e r s inthe operation
and maintenance o fthe improved irrigation schemes; (c) continue the formalization o f
water rights, essential to encourage farmers investments, inparticular inirrigation and (d)
continue Project management activities for an additional year.

11.     Finally, it i s proposed to revise outcome targets to better reflect what can be
achieved by Project closing (see table 3 -paragraph 15).

Analysis

13.     The overall Project designremains unchanged. The proposed changeswill not
have a significant effect on the original technical, institutionalor social aspects of the
Project. The proposed changes do not raise the environmentalcategory o f the Project nor
trigger any new safeguards. The proposed changes do not involve any exceptions to Bank
policies.

14.     No economic analysis was carried out for the supplemental Projectat appraisal.
With Projectrestructuring, the Project economic internal rate of return(IRR) is expected
to be 30%, well above the opportunity cost o f capital estimated at 10%. This IRRi s
lower thanthe one that would have beenexpected at the time o fproject appraisal because
the improvedirrigated areawill belower thananticipated while the overall cost of
irrigation improvements (component A, B and C) i s not reduced. It is also clear that if
the Projectis not restructured, therate ofreturnat project closingwould be lower than
30% because: (a) the number o f subprojects implementedwould be lower (there are no
funds left under component C to generatenew subprojects) and(b) agriculturalbenefits
derivedfrom irrigationimprovements (increases inyields and shiftto higher value crops)
would also be lower because farmers would not be trained inimproved agricultural and
irrigation practices (no funds left under component C for this activity). The proposed
restructuringwould also increase the sustainability o f the subprojects by continuing
strengtheningthe capacity of farmers andW A Sinoperating andmanaging irrigation
systems.

BenefitsandRisks

16.      The mainrisks that couldjeopardize the achievement ofthe restructured outcome
targets andproposed mitigation measures are as follows:

         Slow Projectimplementationdueto difficultiesin gatheringfarmers'
         financial contributionand delays inproducinggood quality feasibility
         studies. The risk is low because the Projectclosing date hasjust been extended
         by one year andthe proposed Projectrestructuring reduces component A andB
         targets to reflect more realisticallythe time requiredto collect farmers' financial

  into account existing proposals of subprojects submittedby interested farmers'
  groups, which are already inthe pipeline and well underway to be completed
  before the proposed Project closing date. The targets o f component B have been
  adjusted accordingly. Inaddition, intensive awareness andtraining campaigns for
