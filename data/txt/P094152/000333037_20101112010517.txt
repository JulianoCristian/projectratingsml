1.        Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      Between 2001 and 2005, at the time of Project approval, Peru had enjoyed strong
economic growth and sound macro-economic policies, with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
increasing on average by five percent a year. However, growth had not translated into
significant reduction in poverty. Poverty rate remained at almost half the country's population,
most severe in rural areas where 30 per cent of the population lives and was 20 per cent higher in
the Sierra (highlands) and Selva (jungle) than in the coastal area. More than 60 per cent of those
living in the coastal rural area (the Project area), were considered poor.

2.     The agriculture sector had been a major contributor to Peru's economic dynamism; it
employed nearly one-third of the workforce, contributed close to 10 per cent of GDP and about 7
per cent of total exports. Irrigated agriculture accounted for about one third of cultivated land
and two thirds of agricultural output. Total equipped irrigated areas covered about 1.7 million
hectares (ha), of which about 1.2 million ha was in the coastal area.

3.       While 70 per cent of the agricultural workforce was located in the Sierra, it was mostly
agriculture in the coastal area ­ that is totally dependent on irrigation ­ which generated most of
agricultural GDP and exports. The coastal area was where most people lived and economic
activities were generated, it had easy access to export markets. Soils are very fertile in the
coastal area and when supplied with adequate water, they can produce more than two harvests
per year. The coastal area accounts for 70 per cent of irrigated areas, supplied by some 53 rivers,
flowing west from the Andes to the coast.

4.      It is in the coastal area that public administration is the most present and where large
investments in irrigation had been made and that agriculture had high economic importance, and
therefore where a suitable organization for irrigation management was of strategic importance
for the country. The operation and maintenance (O&M) of the large public irrigation systems
that had been built and managed by the Government were transferred overnight to 64 Water
Users Associations (Juntas de Regantes - WUAs) and 664 Irrigation Commissions (Comisiones

de Regantes-CRs)3 in 1989, without a program to build their capacity. Most WUAs lacked
managerial capacity, basic tools to manage an irrigation system, and financial resources for
adequate O&M. They did not invest in rehabilitation or improvement of the irrigation schemes
which continued to suffer considerable deterioration.

5.      Irrigation infrastructure was deficient: only 20 per cent of canals were lined, 90 per cent
of intakes were rudimentary and there was a general absence of measurement instruments. Less
than 5 per cent of the irrigated land was equipped with improved on-farm irrigation systems,
such as drip and sprinklers. Of a total equipped irrigated area of 1.2 million ha, only about
700,000 ha to 800,000 ha were cultivated, depending on water availability. Of these, about 50
per cent received satisfactory water supply. For the other half, supplies varied from
unsatisfactory to acceptable, subject to annual precipitation in the highlands.

6.      In response to these challenges, the Government of Peru (GOP) launched in 1997 the
Irrigation Subsector Project (PSI I) with a total cost of US$172 million and a Bank loan of
US$85 million. The objectives of the project were to: (a) develop the capacities of WUAs, for a
decentralized and efficient management of irrigation systems; (b) to reduce the role of the public
sector in irrigation; and (c) to ensure the recovery of O&M and partial investment costs.

7.      PSI I closed on June 30, 2004 and was rated by the Implementation Completion Report
(ICR) and Operations Evaluation Department (OED) as satisfactory in relation to achievement of
objectives and components4. However, project targets were only partially accomplished, because
only 72 per cent of the initially foreseen funds were available due to: (a) reallocation of about
US$30 million of the loan for emergency rehabilitation of primary irrigation infrastructure
damaged by El Niño in 1998; and (b) the non-availability of the originally planned Japan Bank
for International Cooperation (JBIC) loan of US$60 million. While the project improved
significantly the performance of most WUAs5, it was considered that about 50 per cent of them
still required intensive training. Also, farmers who benefited from on-farm irrigation
improvements required more training to reap the full economic benefits of infrastructure
improvements. In addition, while the project achieved its targets in terms of infrastructure
improvements, there was further need for it.
8.     On October 2005, a Supplemental Project (PSI II), the Project for which this evaluation is
conducted, was approved to consolidate achievements made under the original project (PSI I),
most importantly to continue strengthening the capacity of WUAs and provide training to
farmers who benefited from on-farm irrigation improvements. Supplemental financing was
considered crucial to ensure the sustainability and economic viability of PSI I. The supplemental
operation had a total cost of US$21.7 million and a Bank loan of US$10.3 million. The closing
date was initially December 31, 2007, but later was extended to June 30, 2009.

3
  Water Users Organizations (WUOs) include both the Water Users' Associations (Juntas de Usuarios ­ WUAs)
and the Irrigation Commissions that compose them (Comisiones de Regantes ­ CRs). CRs manage the irrigation
network at a lower level than the WUAs.

Government of Peru for an Irrigation Subsector Project" ­ Report 29838, World Bank, 2004.
5
  As a result of the project, tariff revenues in the coastal area increased from US$7 million in 1999 to US$19 million
in 2005, the number of WUAs considered "eligible" and "sustainable" increased from 2 to 33 and 10 respectively.
For a definition of "eligible", see footnote #6. For a definition of "sustainable" see footnote #2 and Annex 10.

9.      PSI II was expected to contribute to the following strategic elements of the 2002-2006
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS-Report #24205, 2002): Institutional reforms would be
reinforced by WUOs strengthening as a means to decentralize irrigation management and
support services provided by the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAG). The Project would have a
direct impact on the productive lives of the poor, as more than 70 per cent of potential
beneficiaries were small farmers (less than 3 ha). Also, infrastructure rehabilitation and users
collective actions by users would reduce environmental damages caused by inadequate irrigation.
Finally, partnerships with civil society would be enhanced through the involvement of private
service providers (training, extension services, marketing), as well as beneficiaries / WUAs
participation.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
10.     The original Project Development Objective (PDO) as defined in the main text of the
Project Appraisal Document (PAD) was: "to increase the production and productivity of
irrigated agriculture in the coastal area of Peru in order to improve farmers' well being and
contribute to poverty alleviation." According to the PAD, the PDO was expected to be achieved
through the promotion of the development of the financial and management capacity of WUOs,
improved use of the water resources, and increase in soil use efficiency.
11.      The original key indicators and their targets as approved in the Loan Agreement (LA) are
listed in Table 2 below, and mostly refer to Project component outcomes.

12.     In addition to the indicators included in the LA, the PAD listed the following PDO
related indicators (without target)7.

6
  `WUA Eligibility Criteria' means the eligibility criteria established in order for WUAs to benefit from components
A and B of the Project; i.e.: (a) a technical manager has been appointed for the relevant WUA; (b) a realistic budget
reflected in water tariffs has been adopted allowing efficient operation and maintenance; (c) the advanced water
tariff payment system has been adopted; and (d) at least 75 per cent of said tariff has been paid in advance.
7
  No targets were set for those indicators, most probably because they are impact-level indicators and, therefore,
difficult to estimate.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

13.     The Project had two first-order restructurings. One in June 2007, to extend the Project
area to the Sierra, the second one in August 2008, to revisit outcome indicators and targets.

14.     The original PDO was changed to extend the Project area to the Sierra whose
development was a priority of the new Government. This first-order restructuring was made in
order to pilot, in the Sierra, the Project integrated approach to inform the design of a follow-up
World Bank-financed irrigation project in the Sierra. The revised PDO is to: "increase the
productivity of irrigated agriculture in Peru's Coast and Sierra in order to improve the well
being of farmers and contribute to poverty alleviation". At the same time, the word
"production" was dropped from the PDO, as it was already captured in the word "productivity".

15.      Targets indicated in the LA were modified twice. The first, in June 2007, was to reflect
Project extension to three pilot areas in the Sierra. The second, in August 2008, was in relation
to restructuring of costs to ensure that uncommitted funds were put to productive use, thereby
fully disbursing the loan by Project closing. The final set of indicators and their targets, as stated
in the legal documents, are shown in Table 4. Additional PDO related indicators included in the
PAD were also modified during implementation. These additional indicators had no target and
are listed in Table 5 below.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

16.     Project beneficiaries, as anticipated at appraisal, were: (a) 300,000 farmers in the coastal
area, integrated in 664 CRs and 64 WUAs; (b) 9,000 directors, technicians and other employees
of WUAs and (c) 64 Technical Administrators of Irrigation District (ATDR)8. Project extension
to three pilot areas in the Sierra increased the number of beneficiaries by 700 farmers and 3
WUAs. More than two thirds of the farmers expected to benefit from the Project had
landholdings of less than 3 ha and were considered poor.

17.    The causal links between the Project investments and the benefits expected to flow to
beneficiaries are as follows:

Farmers benefit from:

                 (a) off-farm and on-farm improvements of irrigation due to increased water
                     availability and timing of delivery;
                 (b) capacity building activities expected to improve farmers' irrigation and
                     agricultural practices and marketing strategies.
                     (infrastructure improvements combined with capacity building is key to
                     increasing yields and crop quality as well as allowing conversion to the
                     production of higher value crops for exports and urban markets; thereby
                     improving the overall performance and sustainability of irrigation and
                     agricultural production)
                 (c) formalization of agriculture water rights because it secures water supplies in
                     an increasingly water scarce environment; and encourages on-farm
                     investments, such as irrigation improvement and conversion to production of
                     higher value crops.
                 (d) WUAs and CRs benefit from off-farm irrigation infrastructure improvements
                     and capacity enhancement that is expected to improve irrigation scheme
                     management and sustainability. They also benefit from formalization of water
                     rights because it facilitates easier water distribution and management of water
                     resources.

8
 ATDR were responsible, among other things, for monitoring the performance of WUAs and for the approval of
water tariff.

1.5 Original Components

18.     Component A. Rehabilitation and modernization of off-farm irrigation systems (US$
5.26 million). This component supported eligible WUAs to improve water supply service to
farmers through financing infrastructure improvements of the collective irrigation system. To be
eligible, WUAs had to achieve eligibility conditions (see footnote #4) and be one of the 20
coastal WUAs selected at appraisal (see Annex 2). Each subproject could not exceed
US$250,000. Beneficiaries were required to finance engineering studies and co-finance civil
works at 30-35 per cent.

19.    Component B. Incentive Program for On-farm Irrigation Technology Improvement
(US$ 6.63 million). This component provided financial incentives to eligible farmers' groups to
encourage adoption of improved on-farm irrigation technologies such as drip, sprinkler or
improved gravity irrigation systems. To be eligible, farmers' groups had to include at least 6
members and a total irrigated area of 24 ha. The component was to operate in the same WUAs
as component A. Each subproject could not exceed US$ 250,000 and the maximum irrigable
area per individual farmer was 30 ha. Project subsidies per land owner could not exceed
US$12,000 for pressurized and US$6,000 for gravity systems. Farmers were selected by
competition for the allocation of incentives:

              a. Beneficiaries farming less than 10 ha were required to co-finance at least 30
                 per cent for pressurized irrigation and 20 per cent for improved gravity
                 systems;
              b. Beneficiaries farming more than 10 ha had to co-finance at least 50 per cent
                 for pressurized and 40 per cent for improved gravity systems.

20.    Component C. Capacity Building of Water Users' Groups and Farmers (US$ 3.97
million)

21.     Subcomponent C.1 Capacity, Building of WUAs. The subcomponent financed training
and equipment to strengthen WUAs technical, financial and administrative capacity to increase
sustainability and quality of management. The component operated in the 64 WUAs of the
coastal area, albeit with different intensity in accordance with the degree of capacity already
achieved.

22.      Subcomponent C.2 Capacity Building of Farmers. The subcomponent, which operated in
the same areas as component B under both this Project and PSI I carried out two types of
activities:

              (a) Actions prior to irrigation improvements: raising awareness of component B;
                  promoting formation of farmers' groups; providing assistance in preparation
                  of subproject feasibility studies and business plan; and training of agribusiness
                  operators.
              (b) Actions subsequent to irrigation improvements: such as extension activities
                  aimed at other farmers to achieve a multiplying effect in promoting the
                  adoption of modern irrigation technology and associated crop practices.



                                                6
23.     Component D. Support to Water Resources Management (US$ 4.78 million). This
consisted of three subcomponents executed by the Water Resources Bureau (Intendencia de
Recursos Hidricos -IRH-INRENA) of MINAG.
24.      Subcomponent D.1 Formalization of Water Rights with the objectives of ensuring that
beneficiaries have legal security on the use of irrigation and promoting private investments in
irrigation.

25.    Subcomponent D.2 Implementation of the National Agricultural Water Rights Registry
System financed the implementation, in IRH-INRENA, of the National Agricultural Water
Rights Registry.
26.      Subcomponent D.3 Support to implementation of the Water Resources Strategy. financed
activities aimed at: (a) developing specific and tested solutions for conflict resolutions; (b)
developing a proposal for institutional arrangements for water resources management on a
watershed basis; and (c) supporting further development of Water Law under discussion in
Congress during Project preparation.
27.    Component E. Project Coordination and Monitoring (US$ 1.38 million).

1.6 Revised Components
28.    Changes to Project components were not significant. During the first restructuring, in
June 2007, when Project activities were extended to the Sierra, eligibility criteria and cost-
sharing rules for subprojects (components A and B) in the Sierra were made less demanding than
for subprojects in the coastal area. This is because the socio-economic conditions in the Sierra
are much more difficult than in the coastal area, with a poverty incidence 20 per cent higher (see
para. 1). More specifically, Table 6 below compares cost-sharing rules and eligibility criteria
between the coastal area and the Sierra.

                                        members and a total irrigated area             were eligible
                                                   of at least 24 ha.

1.7 Other significant changes

29.    Implementation schedule and closing date. A 6-month extension to June 30 2009 was
approved on June 2008, due to the slow implementation of components A and B, due to reasons
explained in paragraphs 34, 37-39 and 41.

30.     Reallocation of loan proceeds and change in component costs. Reallocation of the loan
proceeds was done as part of the second amendment to the LA in July 2008. It increased funding
for technical assistance to promote on-farm irrigation improvements and formalization of water
rights, by decreasing funding for components A and B. Table 7 compares the original allocation
(as described in the LA) and the revised allocation at completion. Annex 1 includes a table with
the original component costs as described in the PAD and the revised component costs after both
restructurings.

studies were completed and farmers' contributions available.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Assessment of Project Design

32.    The PDO was clear and reflected essential priorities for rural and social development in
Peru, as identified by GOP "Carta Verde" (2004), the National Irrigation Strategy (NIS - 2003),
and the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy for Peru (CPS, Report No. 24205-PE, August 19
2004). However, with hindsight, it should have focused on the institutional strengthening of
WUAs, instead of higher level objectives, such as increased agricultural productivity, for the
following reasons:

             (a) The objectives of PSI I were basically related to institutional strengthening and
                 capacity building (see para 6) and the main reason for its supplemental Project,
                 PSI II, was to further strengthen the capacity of WUAs and farmers to ensure
                 long-term sustainability and reap the full economic benefits of investments (see
                 para 8).

             (b) Components related to infrastructure improvements, were small in scope and were
                 actually designed as incentives for management improvements9 in the case of
                 Component A (modernization of off-farm irrigation) and "demonstration"
                 subprojects in the case of Component B (on-farm irrigation improvements).

             (c) The Project cannot really be held accountable for increased productivity and
                 production because these are longer-term outcomes that depend on efforts beyond
                 the Project's scope and beyond the control of Project management. Also,
                 identifying the Project contribution to these outcomes (in particular from its soft

9
 The eligibility criteria for Component A (see footnote #6) proved to be a powerful tool to accelerate capacity
improvement of WUAs.


                                                          9
              components which were the core of the Project) would require a rigorous impact
              evaluation, which was not foreseen during Project preparation.

33.    While Project design was relatively complex due to the diverse components, it basically
adopted the same approach and relied on the same implementing agency as PSI I, which had
been a satisfactory operation (see para 7).

       (a)    PSI II followed the demand-driven, integrated approach to irrigation
              modernization, which proved successful in increasing the capacity of WUAs to
              become technically and financially autonomous, as well as increasing agricultural
              production and productivity under PSI I (see para 7 and ICR report #29838), and
              was in line with international good practices. It combined both structural and non
              structural components, all of them already included in PSI I, with the exception of
              the formalization of water rights. The formalization of water rights further
              strengthened the approach because it promoted farmers' investments in irrigation
              and the switch to higher-value crops. The approach was designed to improve
              cost-effectiveness of public investments, taking advantage of the synergies
              between components, so that overall Project impact is greater than the sum of its
              parts. Paragraph 17 above describes the causal relationships between components
              and PDO.

       (b)    An important feature of Project design was to have eligibility criteria for off-farm
              irrigation improvements related to the performance of WUAs. This proved to be
              a powerful incentive to improve WUAs performance under PSI I and was
              confirmed by PSI II. Under PSI II, this was indeed the main objective of
              component A (see para 32.b).

       (c)    Implementation arrangements were well designed. The main implementing
              agency (PSI) had already successfully carried out a similar project (PSI I). In
              addition to PSI, IRH-INRENA, the institution responsible for Water Resources
              Management in the country, was made responsible for the technical
              implementation of component D, while all fiduciary responsibilities were
              maintained within PSI, due to the little experience of IRH-INRENA in those
              themes.

34.      Changes in Project design from PSI I and II that affected Project implementation and
outcomes concern components A and B and, more specifically, the cost-sharing rules, the
eligibility criteria and competitive grant process for component B and the responsibility and
procedures for the formulation of subproject pre-feasibility studies. Those changes, combined
with the fact that PSI II, unlike PSI I, worked with the poorer and weaker WUAs of the coastal
area, resulted in an unrealistic Project implementation schedule and targets that had been set
based on PSI I experience. These changes in the design of components A and B resulted in
substantial delays in the execution of subprojects during Project implementation and in not
reaching some of these components' targets.

       (a)    Cost-sharing rules. Farmers' groups (component B) and WUAs (component A)
              had difficulty in gathering the financial contribution necessary to implement


                                               10
                  irrigation infrastructure investments. Minimum financial contribution was
                  substantially raised from PSI I to PSI II, despite the fact that PSI II worked in
                  poorer WUAs than PSI I10. In the case of component A, WUAs contribution to
                  subproject financing was raised from 20 per cent under PSI I to 35 per cent under
                  PSI II, as required by the Ministry of Finance (MEF). In the case of component
                  B, the minimum contribution from farmers was raised from 20 per cent in PSI I to
                  30 per cent for areas smaller than 10 ha and, 50 per cent for areas larger than 10
                  ha.

         (b)      Eligibility criteria for component B. Under PSI I, individual farmers could
                  benefit from on-farm irrigation improvements (component B). In the case of PSI
                  II, only farmers' groups of at least 6 members and with a total irrigated area of
                  minimum 24 ha could benefit. This change in design was introduced due to
                  regulations of GOP that stipulated that public funds could not be used to finance
                  private infrastructure/individual investments. These conditions discouraged many
                  interested small and medium farmers, especially when they could not find
                  neighboring producers equally interested in the Project. This is one of the main
                  reasons why implementation of component B was slow and its original targets not
                  met.

         (c)      New administrative procedures for the preparation and approval of subprojects.
                  In PSI II, new procedures (National System for Public Investment ­ Sistema
                  Nacional de Inversion Publica-SNIP process) for the preparation and approval of
                  subprojects were introduced. These procedures included an additional pre-
                  feasibility study stage (perfil de proyecto), responsibility of WUAs and farmers'
                  groups. While these new procedures improved the quality of subprojects, they
                  caused significant delays for three reasons: (a) there was an extra study to prepare
                  and an extra approval step to pass; (b) beneficiaries had to mobilize financial
                  resources for the study without guarantee that it would lead to subproject
                  implementation; and (c) initially, WUAs and local consultants lacked experience
                  in the preparation of pre-feasibility studies. Initially, studies prepared were of
                  poor quality, generating several rounds of revisions, before they could be
                  approved.

Assessment of Risks

35.     Risks were correctly identified with the exception of those associated with the changes in
Project design from PSI I to PSI II for components A and B (see para 34). While the risk of not
achieving the required financial contribution was identified during Project preparation, it was
considered moderate. During implementation, this risk turned out to be substantial and resulted
in significant delays in the implementation of components A and B and in the non achievement
of their original targets. During Project preparation, the risks of delays associated with the


10
   The financial capacity of WUAs initially selected to benefit from PSI II was weaker than that of the WUAs which
benefited under PSI I. Indeed, PSI II focused on WUAs that required more time and technical support to reach the
eligibility criteria, including the water tariff collection efficiency criteria, an indicator of their financial capacity.


                                                           11
introduction of the SNIP process for the preparation and approval of subprojects and with the
requirement to form groups of farmers to benefit from component B were not anticipated.

Government commitment and stakeholder involvement.

36.    Government's commitment and stakeholder involvement were adequate. As mentioned
above, the Project adopted a demand-driven approach to infrastructure improvement (component
A and B), as well as to the formalization of water rights (component D). The national water
resources management diagnostic and strategy supported by the Project were also conducted in a
highly participatory way, involving stakeholders' inputs at various stages of the preparation
process.

2.2 Implementation

37.    Project implementation was slower than expected for the following reasons:

(a) Factors outside the control of government or implementing agencies

38.     Oil price increases.     The price of oil increased continuously during Project
implementation, reaching, in August 2008, almost three times the value it had at appraisal. This,
combined with the long time required to prepare subprojects (on average a year in the case of
component B), meant that subproject cost estimates in the feasibility studies were often lower
than at the time of construction. As a result, a number of subprojects were dropped because
farmers' groups/WUAs were not willing, or could not mobilize the additional funds required, for
their construction.

39.     PSI carried out emergency interventions in irrigation perimeters affected by the
earthquake of August 2007 in Pisco. While these activities were not directly financed by the
Project, they caused delays in achieving Project targets, because staff and other resources were
mobilized to respond to this emergency.

(b) Factors generally subject to government control


40.     Delays in receiving funds for Component B. The LA was signed in October 2005, too
late for the Project to be included in Government General Budget for 2006. Only in May 2006,
did PSI get a specific budget allocation for Project implementation. The implementation of
component B was therefore delayed by about six months because, unlike other components, it
did not get any advances of national funds.

41.     Project extension to the Sierra and formalization of agricultural water rights. As per
Government request, the Project was extended to the Sierra. New targets and component costs
were estimated based on the experience in the coastal area. Yet, the time and cost of formalizing
water rights in the Sierra were much higher than at the coast because: (a) in the Sierra, many
water rights were issued to a community of farmers while in the coastal area all water rights had
been issued to individual farmers, and issuing a water right to a community is more complex and
(b) in the Sierra, land is not cultivated in winter, reducing the time when field work can be



                                               12
carried out, while in the coastal area, the land is cultivated year-round. A second Project
restructuring adjusted component targets and cost to reflect those points.

(c) Factors generally subjects to implementing agencies control

42.     New administrative procedures for the formulation and approval of subprojects. As
mentioned above, each subproject under components A and B had to follow the new SNIP
procedures, including the preparation of an additional pre-feasibility study. Initially, WUAs and
local consultants lacked experience in the preparation of these pre-feasibility studies. They were
of poor quality, generating several rounds of revisions before they could be approved. In
response to this problem, PSI organized several workshops aimed at strengthening the capacity
of WUAs and local consultants in the preparation of those studies, which reduced significantly
the time required for subproject preparation and improved overall subprojects quality.

43.     Farmers and WUAs had difficulty in mobilizing their financial contribution to
subprojects. As mentioned above, farmers and WUAs faced difficulty in mobilizing their
financial contribution to subprojects. PSI took the following measures, in accordance with the
World Bank Project team, to alleviate these problems: (a) it expanded the number of WUAs that
could benefit from component A and B, by (i) allowing the WUAs that benefitted from PSI I to
participate in the Project and (ii) relaxing the condition that only farmers' groups belonging to a
WUA eligible for component A could benefit from component B; (b) it supported WUAs and
farmers in requesting financial support from various financial institutions such as Peruvian
banks, COFIDE (Development Finance Corporation) and micro-credit NGOs; (c) it coordinated
with regional and local governments so that they guarantee the loan contracted by WUAs and
farmers' groups to finance their part of the subproject; and (d) it promoted the association
between farmers' groups and agro-export firms to help farmers groups mobilize their financial
contributions.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design

44.     The M&E system was designed adequately to monitor and evaluate component outcomes
with, in general, clear Project component indicators and targets (see Table 9 for the final list of
outcome indicators and targets per component) as well as data sources and collection methods
(with the exception of one indicator for component A: "number of farmers families benefitting
from the component")11. The same is true for expected inputs and outputs of each component.

45.     Evaluation of Project impacts, which in the case of this Project refers to the stated PDO
(increased production and productivity), is difficult from a methodological standpoint, data
intensive and costly because it requires isolating the effects of the Project from those of other
factors and this type of study is usually not carried out for Bank projects. In the absence of such
a study, it is difficult to judge, with accuracy, to what extent the Project led to increased

11
  It is indeed impossible to set a meaningful target for this indicator because the number of beneficiaries depends
on the location of the subproject (the more upstream the subproject, the higher the number of beneficiaries) which
becomes known only during implementation, as a result of demand-driven process.


                                                         13
production and productivity. These problems were partially overcome with: (a) an impact
evaluation of PSI I carried out by IEG12, whose results are briefly described in paragraphs 74-76
and 83-84, and (b) a separate study conducted by PSI13, as part of its final Project evaluation
report, based on a representative sample of subprojects, which is the data source of Table 8 and
Annex 3. This study, however, did not consider control groups and was carried between 1 to 3
years after the subprojects were completed, not enough, in most cases, to appreciate the full
impacts of the subprojects on agricultural production, productivity and farmers incomes. For
those reasons, its findings should be considered as general trends and not definite results.

M&E Implementation

46.     The M&E system was effective in tracking implementation progress of each component.
During implementation, the outcome, output and input indicators for each component were
collected regularly and were of good quality, allowing identification of delays in the
implementation of components A and B and undertaking remedial measures (see para 42 and
43).

47.     During several supervision missions, the Bank recommended collecting impact-related
indicators for each subproject of components A and B during Project implementation, and
prepared a template for doing so. However, those impact-related indicators were only collected
at Project closing, as part of the Borrower's final Project evaluation report, and for a
representative sample of subprojects13.

48.    Although Project results have been disseminated relatively well to international
audiences14, efforts to disseminate quantitative results and lessons learned from the Project
within Peru were limited in scope.

the study refers to PSI I, the activities undertaken by PSI II under components A and B are basically the same,
therefore the estimated impacts of those components are also valid for PSI II.

   The Project results were presented in international journals (e.g. Developing Capacity in Water Users
Organizations: the case of Peru, Irrig. and Drain. 57:300-310, 2008) and at various international events, including
the Bank-sponsored Water Week in 2009.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environment and social safeguards

49.    Compliance with environmental and social safeguards was moderately satisfactory.

Project design

50.    The Project was classified as category B and triggered three environmental safeguards,
notably, OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment); OP 4.09 (Pest Management) and OP 4.11
(Physical Cultural Resources), for which an Environment Management Plan (EMP) and a Pest
Management Plan (PMP) were prepared and disclosed before appraisal. While the Project was a
supplemental Project with similar components as PSI I, its design and safeguards classification
should have been reviewed and endorsed by the Region's Safeguards Advisory Team (SAT)
before its approval by the Board in 2005. This had not been the case and SAT endorsed the
category B classification in November 2005.

Project implementation

51.     The safeguards classification and instruments were completely reviewed as part of the
first Project restructuring because the Project extended its activities to three pilot areas in the
Sierra. As a result, three additional safeguards were triggered by components A and B: OP 4.04
(Natural Habitats), OP 4.37 (Safety of Dams) and OD 4.20 (Indigenous Peoples). Project
category B was maintained. Social assessments were prepared for the three pilot valleys and an
Indigenous People Plan (IPP) was prepared for the Colca Valley where indigenous people were
present. The EMP, PMP and ISDS were revised. The PMP prepared has been considered good
practice by the Bank. All safeguards documents were consulted with potential beneficiaries and
civil society and disclosed before approval of the restructuring package by the Board.

52.     After the first Project restructuring in 2007, PSI hired a full time environmental specialist
to ensure subproject compliance with environmental and social safeguards. He produced a
number of simple guidelines for the preparation and supervision of subprojects (components A
and B) and their compliance with the EMP, various materials related to good agricultural
practices and integrated pest management. He also gave, with the help of short-term consultants,
numerous training sessions to PSI staff and farmers' groups on those themes, as stated in the
PMP. Those activities were mostly financed as part of component C2.

53.     The PMP was implemented for subprojects under component B starting in 2007. The IPP
for the Colca valley included measures that were included in the methodology followed by PSI
to implement subprojects in the area. PSI did not approve any subproject (components A and B)
that did not follow the Peruvian SNIP procedures with regard to environmental assessment
(which were considered adequate by the Bank) and included the preparation of an environmental
management plan for each subproject whose cost and activities were included in the final design
of the subprojects.




                                                 15
Procurement

54.     The management of procurement processes by PSI was satisfactory. Three ex-post
procurement reviews were conducted during Project implementation. The ex-post reports and
the Supervision Mission Aide Memoires included recommendations that helped improve the
management of procurement processes, including: (a) the expansion of the procurement plan
format to incorporate key information relevant for planning and monitoring purposes; (b)
consideration of the Procurement Special Provisions, included in the LA, to avoid procedures
incompatible with Bank Guidelines; (c) avoid the inclusion of requirements not explicitly
specified in the Bank Guidelines for bidding documents; (d) obtaining no objection, when
required, prior to the procurement action; (e) improvement of archiving capacity; and (f) constant
training of procurement staff. These recommendations were included in the action plans of the
ex-post reports which were complied with during Project implementation.

Financial Management

55.    Financial Management was moderately satisfactory.

56.    PSI was experienced with the World Bank financial management procedures as it had
already implemented PSI I and undertook its responsibilities for the management of funds,
within its own structure and procedures. Flow of funds included transfer of funds from PSI to
beneficiaries' bank accounts to implement subprojects (components A and B) and to INRENA to
implement component D. Those transfers of funds required that a robust financial management
system be designed and maintained throughout the life of the Project.

57.     PSI submitted in a timely manner the Project financial monitoring and audit reports.
However, it faced difficulties putting in place and operating effectively adequate financial
management arrangements. Main shortcomings included: (a) the capacity of the financial staff,
(b) some deficiencies in the internal controls, (c) inadequate accounting policies and procedures,
and (d) a weak financial information system that could have jeopardized the reliability of the
financial information required to manage the Project and monitor its implementation. For those
reasons, the Project required close supervision from the Bank financial management team as well
as continuous technical assistance.

58.     Important improvements were achieved in the following areas: (a) the internal control
system for control of funds transferred to the subprojects and INRENA was improved; (b) the
accounting policies and procedures to provide timely and reliable information required to
manage and monitor the implementation of the sub-projects was improved; (c) the capacity of
administrative staff was strengthened in order to be able to set-up adequate arrangements and
controls; and (d) the basis to enhance the financial information system to support the transaction
recording, monitoring, and reporting of Project administrative and financial information were
set-up. However, a key success factor looking forward to the next Project in the Sierra would be
the presence of highly qualified staff to ensure the maintenance and effective operation of those
arrangements, which can effectively support Project implementation.




                                               16
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Post-completion operation of investments financed by the Project

59.    The capacity of WUAs to achieve self-sufficiency in technical, financial and
administrative aspects has increased significantly during Project implementation (see para 68)
and, generally, the sustainability of infrastructure improvements (component A) due to
inadequate O&M is not a concern.

60.     However, many WUAs need further strengthening and, in fact, most WUAs should
receive continuous support in order to continue improving/maintaining the performance of water
service delivery. Three main mechanisms are in place to strengthen the capacity of WUAs, but
they are either incipient or have an uncertain future:

       (a)    The Project promoted the creation, within the WUAs, of a Training and
              Communication Unit (UCC), with a small budget and dedicated staff, responsible
              for continuous capacity building of WUAs and trained local irrigation authorities
              (ATDR) in the monitoring of WUAs, in particular their annual O&M plans and
              training programs. In practice, however, this mechanism is still incipient and
              need; to be consolidated with further support because (a) UCCs have only been
              created in 34 WUAs (53 per cent of WUAs in the coastal area), mostly in the
              stronger WUAs, and they are not always sufficiently financed and (b) the capacity
              of ATDRs is uneven. Their recent transfer to the National Water Authority
              (ANA) should improve this situation because they will not depend on regional
              budgets and priorities and ANA has the power to sanction.

       (b)    In addition to the UCCs that have been supported by the Project, the Peruvian
              National Board of WUAs, created in 1984, has recently engaged in promoting and
              developing capacity development of WUAs, by creating its own incipient
              capacity building unit.

       (c)    Finally, PSI continues supporting irrigation modernization, including
              strengthening of WUAs, but this support is still dependent on the implementation
              of projects/programs financed by MINAG and donor agencies, putting at risk the
              sustainability of PSI support to WUAs in the longer term. Currently two PSI
              projects provide capacity building to WUAs in the coastal area: (a) a JICA
              Project, approved in 2006 that follows the same approach as PSI II and works
              only in the best 15 WUAs of the coastal area and (b) PROCOMAT, a capacity
              building project for WUAs and farmers focused on the areas not supported by the
              JICA project. PROCOMAT is closing in December 2009 and a new, similar
              project should follow. The other projects implemented by PSI, concern the
              promotion of on-farm irrigation improvements or increasing irrigation water
              supply through regulation of rivers and construction of water intakes (component
              A and B type of projects).

61.    The O&M of improved on-farm irrigation systems (component B) is the responsibility of
farmers. The risk that this O&M is inadequate is low because farmers should have the capacity


                                              17
to properly maintain the O&M systems (they received training from PSI and the material
providers) and farmers were highly motivated in installing the improved technologies as they
financed the feasibility studies and a large share of investments. Finally, subproject designs have
been revised by the PSI team whose expertise in this field is strong and the risks that those
systems would fail because the poor design is therefore low.

Extension of PSI activities to the Sierra region of Peru.

62.      Other than the pilot projects carried out under PSI II in the Sierra, PSI only worked in the
coastal area. A follow-up World Bank financed operation is under preparation to extend PSI
activities to the Sierra region, following a similar integrated approach as the one implemented in
the coastal area. This follow-up operation will provide an opportunity for the Bank team to
continue dialogue with the Government on the means to insure continuous and appropriate
support to WUAs in the coastal and Sierra areas. The follow-up project will build on the
experience in the sierra region under the Project and include the lessons learned as outlined in
this ICR.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

63.     Project design (PDO and components) remains highly relevant for Peru because it is
consistent with GOP's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sector
assistance strategies.

       (a)     MINAG's Agriculture Multiannual Sectoral Strategic Plan for 2007-2011
               establishes six strategic objectives, two of which are supported by the Project:

                     1. Strategic objective on Water Management: (i) construction and
                        rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure to guarantee water availability
                        and optimal use; (ii) installation of improved on-farm irrigation systems;
                        (iii) formalization of water rights; and (iv) promotion of the efficient use
                        of water in the coastal area.

                     2. Strategic objective on Market Access: (i) strengthen farmers' productive
                        and entrepreneurial capacity; and (ii) promote the shift to market
                        oriented agricultural crops.

       (b)     Project design also responds directly to two of the three pillars of the Country
               Partnership Strategy (CPS ­ Report #37913, Dec 2006) agreed between the Bank
               and Peru covering the period 2007-11, namely Economic Growth (accelerating
               growth and widening its base, making growth environmentally sustainable) and
               Social Development (strengthening human capital).




                                                 18
64.     In addition, responding to recent GOP priorities to alleviate poverty in the Sierra, the
PDO and Project components were adjusted15 to allow the implementation of pilot subprojects in
three WUAs of the Sierra and, thereby, help design a follow-up operation that would scale-up
PSI activities to the poorer Sierra region.

65.     Finally, Project design is relevant and consistent with the stated PDO, in particular the
integrated approach to irrigation improvement that had already proved successful in increasing
the productivity of irrigation under PSI I and building the capacity of WUAs (see para 7).

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives


66.     The Project achieved its stated PDO. It has indeed contributed to increase the production
and productivity of irrigated agriculture in the Project area, as demonstrated by PSI's final
Project evaluation report13 the results of which are included in Table 8 below.

67.     Increases in production, land productivity and incomes are significant in the Project area,
but cannot be compared to targets (none were set). Also, only the effects of Components A, on
one hand, and B & C2, on the other, could be measured. The effects of the institutional
strengthening of WUAs (component C1) and of the formalization of water rights (component D)
on increased production and productivity could not be estimated, as they would be very difficult
to capture from a methodological standpoint. It should be noted that this study did not consider
control groups and was carried out 1 to 3 years after the subprojects were completed, not enough

in most cases, to appreciate the full impacts of the subprojects on agricultural production,
productivity and farmers' incomes. For those reasons, its findings should be considered as
general trends and not definitive results. It should also be noted that both components A and
B&C2 generated substantial impacts in terms of production and productivity. Indeed, the
benefits of component A are spread over a much larger irrigated area than those of component
B16 which compensate for its smaller impacts per ha (see the financial and economic analyses in
Annex 3).

68.   The Project exceeded its outcome targets related to strengthening the capacity of WUAs
as demonstrated below:

        (a)      Collection efficiency of water tariff during the same period increased from 78 to
                 85 per cent since 2008. Target was exceeded.

        (b)      Revenues collected from the water tariff increased by 42 per cent between 2005
                 and 2008, from US$19 million in 2005 to US$27 million in 2008. No target was
                 set.

        (c)      The number of WUAs that reached the eligibility criteria for Component A
                 increased by 48 per cent, from 33 to 49 WUAs between 2005 and 2009. This is
                 77 per cent of all WUAs in the coastal area. Target was exceeded.

        (d)      The number of WUAs that reached the "sustainability level" increased from 10 in
                 2005 to 41 in 2009. This is 64 per cent of all WUAs in the coastal area. No target
                 was set.

69.     The Project did promote the adoption of on-farm irrigation innovation, but did not reach
the targets related to this outcome (see Table 9 below). The reasons for not reaching the targets
are explained in para. 34, 37-39 and 41 above.

70.     The Project almost achieved both of its outcome targets for the formalization of water
rights (see Table 9 below). The reasons for not achieving the target related to the number of
water licenses issued are due to Project extension in the Sierra where the formalization of water
rights is much more complex than in the coastal area (see para 41 for a more detailed
explanation).




16
  Subprojects of component A (off-farm irrigation modernization) and B (on-farm irrigation improvements) in the
coastal area benefit an average approximately 1360 ha (382 families) and 36.7 ha (10 families), respectively.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

71.     An ex-post cost-benefit analysis was carried out on a representative sample of 28
subprojects financial by the Project. This analysis estimates the Project economic internal rate of
return (EIRR) at 20.5 per cent, corresponding to a net present value (NPV) of US$ 14.7 million
and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) at 16.7 per cent, corresponding to a NPV of US$
7.2 million. Despite the data limitations mentioned in Annex 3, such as the limited number of
years after subproject completion to appreciate impacts and the absence of control groups, these



                                                   21
results demonstrate good returns on investments from both a financial and economic point of
view.

72.     The EIRR and FIRR calculated at Project closing are lower than those estimated during
Project preparation, which were 24.5 per cent and 25.5 per cent respectively. The lower internal
rates of returns are explained by the fact that the improved irrigated area by components A and
B, for which Project benefits are estimated, is much smaller than anticipated, while the overall
cost of irrigation improvements (components A, B, C and part of E combined) is similar to what
was expected at appraisal. In other words, the unit cost of irrigation modernization (US$/ha) is
much higher than anticipated for two reasons: (a) the slow implementation of infrastructure
subprojects requiring much more sensibilization and technical assistance than anticipated due to
cumbersome procedures (see para 34, 37-39) and (b) higher costs of materials and civil works
due to increases in oil prices (see para 38).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

73.     The outcome of the Project is rated satisfactory based on its continued high relevance, the
satisfactory rating given to its efficacy since it achieved the intended objective and the
substantial rating given to its efficiency since the Project achieved an acceptable rate of return of
20.5 per cent.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

74.     Impacts on economic well being and agricultural performance. An impact evaluation of
PSI I carried out by IEG12 shows that the Project had positive impacts on the economic well
being and agricultural performance of beneficiaries: off farm irrigation improvements and
WUAs capacity building increased labor demand and increased wage income. Beneficiaries
hired 27 per cent more agricultural workers than the control group, and reflecting this, wage
income (which on average amounts to 20 per cent of the total income per capita) for farm
households in localities that benefited from those components increased by 47 per cent per capita
relative to farm households in control localities.

75.      Impact on poverty. The value of output per capita, income per capita and agricultural
profit per capita increased for poor farmers relative to the poor in comparable localities where
the program was not offered. In terms of broader economic welfare, poor farmers in beneficiary
localities work significantly less as manual laborers and earn more non-wage income per capita,
likely derived from agricultural activity on their own farm, than poor farm households in control
localities. This finding is consistent with positive impacts on production, agricultural income
and agricultural profit.

76.     The formalization of water rights under Component D, the PROFODUA (Program for the
Formalization of Water Use Rights), is reported to have resulted in greater equity in the
distribution of water rights and a strengthened position of less powerful stakeholders like women


                                                 22
and small producers. The program also embraced other key complementary aspects such as land
property registration and the issuance of national identity cards for the more vulnerable
population groups. These statements on the benefits of the program, however, have not been
quantified or monitored during Project implementation.

77.      Gender aspects. Project design did not foresee any gender dimension or set any specific
gender targets. During implementation, however, two Gender Pilots were carried out in the
Sierra region. Those pilots included a gender diagnosis that helped understand the different
factors that determine the degree of participation of women and men in water management both
at the level of the WUAs/CRs and in the fields. Capacity building activities were also carried out
to improve women's position within WUAs/CRs and their performance as agricultural
producers. Lessons learned from both pilots are being used to incorporate a gender perspective
in the forthcoming PSI Sierra project with the objective to respond to the specific conditions and
needs of rural women in the Sierra.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

78.    One of the most important benefits of the Project has been the strengthening of WUAs
through the combined action of components A and C1, as well as component D (see para 68).
WUAs have also been empowered through their strong involvement in the process of selecting,
designing, executing and financing irrigation subprojects.

79.     ATDRs were also strengthened (mainly through component C1). They were trained to
support and monitor WUAs in their efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in technical, financial and
administrative aspects. With the promulgation of the new water law, ATDRs were recently
transferred from the regional governments to the National Water Authority (ANA). They should
keep their regulatory and support functions vis-à-vis WUAs as stated in the draft application
decree of the water law.

80.     The Project also contributed to the strengthening of IRH, and its recent transformation
into the National Water Authority (ANA), the institution responsible for water resources
management (WRM). More broadly, the Project helped define the new institutional and legal
framework for WRM in Peru. IRH was strengthened through the implementation of the water
rights program, the preparation of the national water strategy, the preparation of the Water
Resources Modernization Program, part of which is now being implemented by the Bank, the
strengthening of the legal framework for WRM which raised the status, power and budget of
IRH as it became an Authority.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

81.    On-farm irrigation improvements carried out by PSI I and PSI II had a demonstrative
impact that contributed to the spectacular development of drip irrigation in the country, which
increased from 7,700 ha in 199817 to 100,000 ha in 200918. Inspired by PSI I and II, the

Government launched in 2006 the program Riego Tecnificado, which, up to now, has finalized
technical studies for the conversion of 6,000 ha to improved on-farm irrigation technologies.

82.    A pool of engineers specialized in the design and supervision of drip irrigation, has been
developed, as well as a group of equipment suppliers. These professionals and entrepreneurs are
contributing to the promotion and expansion of improved on-farm irrigation technologies
throughout the coastal area.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

83.     In July of 2009 the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the Bank carried out the
study An Impact Evaluation of a Multicomponent Irrigation Project on Farm Households in
Peru, which, based on qualitative and quantitative surveys administered to beneficiaries, other
farmers, PSI staff and others, investigated the impacts of the Project on agricultural productivity
and economic welfare. These impacts correspond to PSI I. However, regarding components A
and B, the study can be considered representative of the impacts of PSI II, since in both phases,
activities were similar and there was no repetition of structural activities in the same area. As far
as Component C is concerned, the impacts represent the joint effect of both phases, since it is not
possible to isolate the effects of PSI I from PSI II.

84.    The main conclusions of the IEG study can be summarized as follows:

       (a)     The impacts of components A, B and C2 increased labor demand, increased wage
               income and promoted changes in types of crops produced. Beneficiaries hired 27
               percent more agricultural workers than the control group, and reflecting this,
               wage income for farm households in treatment localities increased by 47 percent
               per capita relative to farm households in control localities. The infrastructure
               component made a greater positive impact on the poor than the non-poor,
               although both groups hire more manual labor to work on their farms. About 40
               percent of persons interviewed perceived the institutional strengthening
               component as the most successful in the program. A primary reason is that the
               training imparted created a culture of respect and compliance with the irrigation
               distribution schedule, helped ensure that fees were used for the O&M of water
               infrastructure, and raised awareness among water users of the importance of their
               economic contributions to further develop and maintain water facilities.

       (b)     On-farm irrigation improvement affected farmers in at least three ways. First, this
               component increased the proportion of agricultural output that was sold in the
               market (versus self-consumed) by 12 percent compared to control farmers;
               second, it increased the probability of growing permanent crops by 15 percent;
               and third, it improved production and productivity when off-farm irrigation
               infrastructure was also improved. The results for farmer extension and training
               are also positive on at least three dimensions; first, clear productivity increases;
               second, increases in the amount of output sold in the market; and third, increases
               in the production of export crops.

       (c)       Impacts of the program differ depending on the initial wealth condition of farm
                 households. Poor farmers are more likely to specialize in cultivating staple crops
                 when off-farm components are implemented, while non-poor farmers are more
                 likely to increase their production of industrial crops. The on-farm irrigation
                 technology investments led poor farmers to increase their production of
                 permanent crops, however, they had no changes in productivity. Lastly, farmer
                 extension led to crop switching towards more export crops and increases in
                 permanent crop cultivation, particularly for poor farmers.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

85.     The overall risk that Project development outcomes (WUAs performance) and impacts
(increased productivity of irrigation) will not be maintained is substantial without appropriate,
continuous support to WUAs.

External risks

86.     Risks associated with increased water demand and climate change are moderate. In the
last decades, water demand in the coastal area increased sharply due to sustained population and
economic growth and irrigation development. Meanwhile, climate change has begun to affect
the supply of water coming from glaciers. In the long term, climate change will most likely
result in increased peak discharges and decreased average discharges of rivers. Combined, these
changes may reduce the availability and increase the cost of water used for irrigation which
could negatively impact land productivity of irrigation (water productivity would most likely be
increased). The Project reduced the vulnerability of irrigation schemes to climate change and
water scarcity risks:

       (a)       Traditionally, peak discharges in rivers cause damages on irrigation intakes (as
                 demonstrated by El Nino events). The Project improved many of them, designing
                 and constructing robust structures resistant to destructive floods.

       (b)       Irrigation schemes are also better prepared to face increased water scarcity
                 because the capacity of WUAs and farmers to manage irrigation systems was
                 improved (component C1) and farmers' water rights were formalized, thereby
                 legally securing their share of the resource (component D).

87.     Risks associated with a drop in agricultural prices are moderate. A dramatic drop of
agricultural prices would negatively affect Project outcomes and impacts, but the probability of
such event occurring is small. Also, up to a certain extent, farmers can respond to price changes
by growing crops demanded by the market, because irrigation networks improved by the Project
were designed with great flexibility, allowing irrigation of almost all kinds of crops.




                                                 25
Internal risks

88.    The capacity of WUAs to achieve self-sufficiency in technical, financial and
administrative aspects has increased significantly during Project implementation (see para 68)
and the risks that those achievements are not sustained is substantial without appropriate,
continuous capacity building support.

89.    For most of the 41 coastal WUAs which attained a good degree of sustainability the risk
of management deterioration is substantial without stronger UCCs (see para 68). As mentioned
in para 60, the Project promoted the creation, within the WUAs, of a Training and
Communication Unit (UCC), with a small budget and dedicated staff, responsible for continuous
capacity building of WUAs. However, these UCCs are still incipient and need to be
consolidated with further support because UCCs have been created in only 34 WUAs and they
are not sufficiently financed. PSI continues supporting the strengthening of those WUAs (and
their UCCs) through JBIC and PROCOMAT projects. The problem is that PSI support to WUAs
capacity building is, up to now, dependent on Government or donor funded projects, and its
support is therefore not necessarily sustainable.

90.     For the other poorer 23 WUAs (accounting for 34 per cent of WUAs in the coastal area),
that mostly did not benefit from components A and B because they did not reach eligibility level,
there is a substantial risk that improved WUA performance is not sustained without adequate,
continuous support. This needs to be addressed through a clear commitment and with specific
support mechanisms adapted to these poorer WUAs. As mentioned in para 59-62, three
mechanisms are in place today to build the capacity of WUAs, but they are incipient or their
future is uncertain:

       (a)       UCCs, but they have only been established in the best WUAs and should be
                 complemented by external support, especially in the case of the least performing
                 WUAs;

       (b)       The Peruvian National Board of WUAs, created in 1984, has recently engaged in
                 promoting and developing capacity development of WUAs, creating its own
                 incipient capacity development unit;

       (c)       PSI continues providing support to these poorer WUAs through PROCOMAT,
                 which will close soon, but should be followed by another project. As mentioned
                 above, an issue is that PSI support to WUAs capacity building is, up to now,
                 dependent on Government or donor funded projects, and is therefore not
                 necessarily a sustainable mechanism in the longer term.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

91.     Bank performance in identification, preparation assistance and appraisal of the Project
was moderately satisfactory. Project design was based on a correct diagnosis of the subsector
and country context, and was in line with GOP priorities and the Bank's CAS. PSI II was a
supplemental project prepared to consolidate achievements made under PSI I and the same Bank
team was in charge of supervising PSI I and preparing PSI II, which facilitated design and
integration of lessons learned. The Project integrated approach to irrigation modernization was
in line with international good practices. The Bank team foresaw correctly future government
requests of studies related to water resources and included a subcomponent aimed at supporting
those. Therefore, PSI II played an important role in updating the Water Resources Strategy, the
preparation of the new Water Law and the formulation of the Bank-financed Water Resources
Management Modernization project, approved by the Board in July 2009.

92.     Notwithstanding, the Bank team was overly optimistic in evaluating the co-financing
capacity of beneficiaries, farmers' willingness and ability to form groups and beneficiaries
capacity to prepare satisfactory pre-feasibility studies, (making it more difficult for WUAs and
farmers to qualify for components A and B as compared to PSI I, while WUAs and farmers in
PSI II area are weaker and poorer than in PSI I) which caused implementation delays and the non
achievement of targets set for components A and B and (see para 34). With regard to the PDO,
the Bank team should have recommended lower level objectives, focused on the institutional
strengthening of WUAs, instead of impacts such as increased productivity which are difficult to
attribute and therefore measure (see para 32). Also, while the Project environmental category
was confirmed early during Project implementation, it was not approved by SAT before approval
by the Board in June 2005 (see para 50).

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.     Bank supervision missions were regular and instrumental in identifying problems, such as
the causes of implementation delays (para 34, 38-41), and in agreeing with the implementing
agencies on mitigation measures, such as the needs for workshops to train local consultants in the
formulation of pre-feasibility studies according to new SNIP procedures (para 42-43).
Supervision reports realistically rated Project's performance in terms of achievement of its
development objective and physical implementation. Supervision mission left detailed Aide
Memoire to the Borrower and implementing agencies with clear recommendations. Because one
of the implementing agencies, IRH, was less familiar with Bank procedures, special attention
was paid to financing management and procurement aspects and staff training in these issues.
However, despite detailed Aide-memoire, supervision missions failed convincing the
Government of addressing the causes for implementation delays by relaxing the conditions


                                               27
related to at least one of the following: (a) the need to constitute group to benefit from
component B, (b) the cost sharing ratio for components A and B, (c) the need for beneficiaries to
prepare pre-feasibility studies and (d) the competitive grant system for component B.

94.     The Bank team formally restructured the Project twice in order to better respond to new
Government priorities (i.e. irrigation development in the Sierra) and adjust performance targets
to take into account delays in Project implementation. It rightly reassessed the need to trigger
additional social and environmental safeguards (e.g. Indigenous People) when the Project
expanded to the Sierra. With hindsight, the Bank team should have seized these restructuring
opportunities to convince GOP to reformulate the PDO, so that it would focus on the institutional
strengthening of WUAs.

95.     The Bank team mobilized Trust Fund financing to: (a) carry out the Project Base line
study, (b) design an Irrigation Benchmarking System (to better appreciate the relative
performance of WUAs), (c) promote the position/role of women within WUAs/CRs in the 3
pilots in the Sierra (Cajamarca, Mantaro and Colca-Arequipa), and (d) to improve the insertion
of small-scale farms in successful agro-supply chains in the Sierra (e.g. milk and dairy chain).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.    The Bank's overall performance is considered moderately satisfactory as both the Bank
performance during Project preparation and supervision were moderately satisfactory19.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

97.     Government performance during Project preparation was moderately satisfactory. It
participated actively in Project preparation. Ownership of the Project concept and approach by
GOP is reflected in the fact that this approach had already been applied under PSI I and was
subsequently applied to a JBIC financed project in the coastal area and to a World Bank financed
Project in the Sierra.

98.  Government performance during Project implementation was moderately satisfactory.
GOP maintained its commitment throughout Project implementation:

           (a)      Its financial contribution to the Project was adequate and mostly timely;

           (b)      After years of discussion, the Water Law was approved in 2009 and the National
                    Water Authority (ANA) was created in 2008. The National Water Right Registry
                    (RADA) was also legally established during Project implementation;

                                                         28
       (c)     In a context of frequent changes in project coordinators, the Government assured
               Project stability by maintaining the same Project director of the overall
               implementing agency, PSI, as well as the Project coordinator of the other agency,
               IRH, and most technical staff of both agencies;

       (d)     Two amendments of the Loan Agreement were processed, albeit with delays on
               June 2007 and August 2008.

99.     However, GOP did not show much flexibility in relaxing some of the conditions that
were the main reasons for Project implementation delays and for not achieving the targets set for
components A and B (see para 34). Also, it is not clear that it will put in place a
mechanism/institution that will provide continuous/sustainable capacity building to WUAs in the
coastal area (see para 89-90).

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

100. The performance of PSI as the Project's main implementing agency and coordinating
agency, and of IRH in charge of component D was satisfactory. They were committed to the
Project and they established good relationships with the beneficiaries through the successful
application of its demand-responsive and participatory approaches. PSI and IRH were
instrumental in adjusting it to some changing circumstances (e.g. extension to the Sierra). They
reacted correctly to unexpected difficulties like complications for formalizing water rights in the
Sierra. They identified correctly the reasons for the slow rhythm of implementation of
components A and B (the weakest point of Project implementation) and undertook corrective
measures that substantially improved the pace of implementation, but could not catch-up with
original targets. IRH, with the Project support, was very proactive in undertaking important
studies related to the Water Resources Strategy, preparation of the Water Law, and the
preparation of three new projects for Water Resources Management, Drainage and Small Dams,
respectively. PSI carried out the Pre-feasibility Study of the new Sierra Irrigation project. Both
agencies collaborated closely with the Bank on these studies. While PSI and IRH carried out
procurement activities in a satisfactory manner, an extra effort should still be made to improve
the procurement planning capacity of both agencies.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

101.   The Borrower's overall performance is considered moderately satisfactory19.




                                                29
6. Lessons Learned

102. For irrigation projects aiming to build the capacity of WUOs and producers' groups, it is
important to focus the PDO on the changes that can be expected in those groups (e.g. financial,
technical, organizational) through the intervention of the Project, and thus avoid setting higher-
level development goals (e.g. increased agricultural productivity). This should be reflected in the
M&E system and indicators. To measure the Project's contribution to a higher-level objective, a
separate impact evaluation study is necessary, and it is preferable, in this case, to have a clear
impact evaluation strategy at Project design, including a baseline and control groups of non-
beneficiaries.

103. The issue of capacity is critical and the scale of need is enormous, but appreciation of the
problem is low. WUOs need to improve their capacity to plan, organize and manage their
irrigation infrastructure and agricultural production systems, especially in a context of rapidly
changing institutional and legal frameworks, and agricultural markets. In order to have a
sustainable capacity building system that can count on reliable and realistic funding, it is
recommended to address the potential role of different players (e.g. National Water Users Board,
PSI, National Water Authority, NGOs, universities etc.) in its design, methodologies, funding
sources (water users, NGOs, public and private sector, international cooperation) and other
support mechanisms. Also, regional and local entities are expected to play an important role in
enabling WUOs to enhance their capacities and effectiveness.

104. The participation of water users in subprojects (i.e. in the process of selecting, designing,
executing and financing) is essential to ensure a sustainable O&M of the off-farm and on-farm
irrigation infrastructure. However, as shown by the Project, there is a risk of overestimating their
capacity to financially and technically contribute, which should be carefully estimated and
verified at Project design, by taking into account the heterogeneous contexts of WUOs (e.g.
regulated versus unregulated WUOs, coast versus sierra, etc.).

105. A competitive grant mechanism for selecting on-farm irrigation sub-projects has the risk
of being slow and cumbersome, as shown by the Project, especially when the demand for on-
farm technology improvement is small. To avoid slow project implementation, an alternative
mechanism would be to select subprojects that meet a clear and widely disseminated set of
criteria, on a first-come, first-served basis.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

Area of Intervention. Component A was initially expected to operate in 20 of the 64 WUAs of
the coastal area, once they had reached the eligibility criteria20. Most of these 20 WUAs had not
benefited from component A under PSI I, and were among the weakest WUAs of the coastal area
in terms of financial, technical and organizational capacity. During Project implementation, in
response to the difficulty to generate subprojects in those WUAs, it was decided to expand the
area of intervention to all the 64 coastal WUAs, as long as they met the eligibility criteria. In
addition, the first amendment to the Loan Agreement extended the Project area to three WUAs in
the Sierra. In the end, a total of 21 WUAs benefited from component A, 18 in the coastal area
and 3 in the sierra. Table 2.1 shows the area of intervention of component A.

   `WUO Eligibility Criteria' means the eligibility criteria established in order for WUO to benefit from components
A and B of the Project; i.e.: (i) a technical manager has been appointed for the relevant WUO; (ii) a realistic budget
reflected in water tariffs has been adopted allowing efficient operation and maintenance; (iii) the advanced water
tariff payment system has been adopted; and (iv) at least 75% of said tariff has been paid in advance.

Outcomes. As can be seen in Table 2.2, three outcome targets were used to assess the
performance of component A. The first two targets relate to the participation of beneficiaries to
subproject cost and the other to the number of farmers' families that benefited from the
component.

  1. Original and revised targets have been weighted in proportion to the share of actual loan disbursements
  made in the periods before and after approval of the revisions.
  2. It is impossible to set a meaningful target for this indicator because the number of beneficiaries depends on
  the subprojects locations, which are only known during implementation as a result of a demand driven
  process.
  3. WUAs contribution followed an increasing scale (from 30 to 35%). At appraisal, WUAs contribution
  target was set at about 30%. After Amendment 2, target was set considering a contribution of 35% (except
  for some small investments in the Sierra for which contribution was 20%).
  4. It is impossible to set a meaningful target for this indicator because the number of beneficiaries depends on
  the subprojects locations, which are only known during implementation as a result of a demand driven
  process.

Beneficiaries' participation in subproject costs was good, averaging 31% of component cost,
broadly in line with subproject cost sharing rules of 30-35%. It represents a total value of
US$1.49 million or 77% of target. The lower than expected total value of beneficiaries
contribution is due to a lower than expected total cost of the component.

The outcome target related to the number of beneficiaries was not reached. Three factors explain
this shortcoming:

       (a)      It is almost impossible to set a meaningful target for the number of beneficiaries
                because it depends on the location of the subproject (the more upstream the


                                                        34
                  subproject, the higher the number of beneficiaries) which becomes only known
                  during implementation, as a result of a demand-driven process.

         (b)      The actual demand for subprojects was lower than expected because WUAs had
                  difficulty meeting their financial contribution to subprojects (30% of subproject
                  cost the first year of Project implementation and 35% thereafter in the Coastal
                  area; and 20% in the Sierra). This was particularly true for the poorest WUAs
                  who generally get their water supply from unregulated rivers and have a water
                  service and financial revenue limited to a few months per year21. In fact, out of
                  65 agreements signed between PSI and WUAs for the preparation of subprojects,
                  more than 50% were canceled because WUAs could not gather their financial
                  contribution. Hence, the level of effort deployed by component C1 to generate
                  interest and to help WUAs develop subprojects was much higher than anticipated,
                  and some funds had to be reallocated from component A to component C1. In the
                  end, only 31 subprojects were actually implemented.

         (c)      The time required to prepare and implement a subproject was longer than
                  expected, due to: (i) the WUAs' difficulty in collecting financial contributions and
                  (ii) the WUAs difficulty in preparing good feasibility studies and technical design.
                  The WUAs were responsible for the preparation of the feasibility studies and
                  technical design of the subprojects. This certainly contributed to strengthening
                  the capacity of WUAs, but at the same time, low-cost engineers were usually
                  contracted and the resulting studies were of poor quality. This required detailed
                  reviews and corrections by PSI staff, a process that significantly increased the
                  time necessary to complete a subproject.

In order to alleviate the problems mentioned above, PSI has (a) extended the area of intervention
of the component (see area of intervention above); (b) assisted WUAs in mobilizing support
from national financial institutions; (c) encouraged regional and local governments to guarantee
loans made to WUAs; and (d) organized workshops and training sessions for WUAs and local
consultants on the preparation of feasibility studies and technical design. This helped speed-up
implementation, but not enough to catch-up with targets.

Contribution of Component A to the institutional strengthening of WUAs. An important result of
Component A was its contribution to the strengthening of WUAs. This was done in three ways:

         (a)      Component A was designed as an incentive for WUAs to strengthen their
                  performance. Indeed, in order to be eligible for component A, WUAs had to meet
                  a number of eligibility criteria related to their performance22. This provided a
                  strong incentive for WUAs to apply the lessons learned from component C1.

21
   WUAs with unregulated river systems have much less financial resources because water users only pay during the
few irrigation months (there is no irrigation during the rainy months) and the water tariff is based on the consumed
irrigation water, through a tariff per irrigation turn or per hectare. Those "unregulated WUAs" have had difficulties
to collect the financial contribution required for component A.
22
    To be eligible, WUA had to: (a) have a technical manager, (b) a budget that allowed appropriate O&M of
infrastructure, reflected in water tariff and (c) at least 75% of the water tariff was paid before water was delivered.


                                                         35
               Component C1, on the other hand, provided capacity building to WUAs to
               improve their overall performance and, in particular, helped them meet the
               eligibility criteria for component A.

       (b)     Subprojects had to be carried out following the community works procedures that
               obliged WUAs to behave in an entrepreneurial manner, strengthening its capacity
               to implement civil works as well as its overall management capacity.

       (c)     Finally, WUAs were responsible for subproject feasibility studies and technical
               design which, as mentioned above, strengthened their capacity, but at the same
               time, delayed considerably the implementation of the subprojects.

Contribution of Component A to the PDO. The component made a significant contribution to the
PDO, as: (a) average income of farmers' households who benefited from this component
increased by 5% in real terms, or US$183 per year (at baseline, the average farmers household
income that benefited from component A was US$3,647 per year) and (b) average productivity
of the land that benefited from the component increased by 4% in real terms, or US$54/ha (at
baseline, the average productivity of the farm that benefited from component A was US$ 1,530
per ha and per year).

Increased household income and land productivity are explained by: (a) a moderate shift to
higher value crops (overall, the cropped area under traditional crops decreased by 1%, while the
area under vegetables increased by 14% and the area under fruit trees increased by 1%) and (b)
increases in yields (vegetables: 0 to 3%; fruit trees: 0 to 5%; traditional crops: 0 to 5% with the
exception of rice and sugarcane whose yields decreased by 8% and 3% respectively). The
increase in total cropped area was insignificant.

Despite higher unit costs than anticipated, the increase in land productivity led to an overall
component EIRR of 16% and FIRR of 15.4% (see Annex 3).

It should be noted however that the data on yields and therefore the component's impacts on land
productivity and farmers' income, as well as component FIRR and EIRR should be considered
with caution because only few years were available to measure impacts (one to three years), and,
as there was no control group available, the evaluation is based on yields before and after
subproject implementation. Therefore, these results should be considered as general trends and
not definite results.

Area of Intervention. Table 2.3 shows the area of intervention of component B, originally
designed to operate in the same 20 WUAs as component A. This condition was relaxed in order
to speed-up the generation of subprojects, and the area of intervention was increased by an
additional 8 WUAs (3 pilot WUAs in the Sierra as a result of first Project restructuring and 5

Písco´s earthquake of 2007). In the end, subprojects were implemented in 17 WUAs.

The average area per farm that benefited from component B was of 3.7 ha in the Coastal area and
0.7 ha in the Sierra. The average farmers' group included 10 members in the Coastal area and
11 members in the Sierra.

Outcomes. As can been seen in table 2.4, five indicators and targets measure the performance of
component B. The first two targets relate to the contribution of farmers to subproject costs, the
second two targets relate to the number of households and irrigated area that benefited from the
component and the last target relates to the amount of subsidy per ha improved.

Farmer contributions to subproject costs were good as they averaged 42% of component cost,
exceeding the appraisal target set at 39%. However, they only represented a total value of
US$2.05 million or 76% of weighted target, which is due to the lower than expected total cost of
the component.

Component B did not meet its original targets in terms of number of beneficiaries and improved
irrigated area. This is mainly due to three factors:

        (a)       A lower than expected demand for component B due to very demanding
                  eligibility conditions:
        (b)       Farmers' groups had to cover 42% of subproject cost, equivalent to an average of
                  US$1,393 US$ per ha. This is a large sum of money for many small and medium
                  farmers, especially in a context of lack of credit. Furthermore, in addition to their
                  financial contribution to irrigation subprojects, farmers were often required to
                  make substantial investments to switch production to higher-value crops. Such
                  additional investments were estimated at US$ 4,000 per ha.
        (c)       Only farmers groups of at least 6 farmers and with a total irrigated area of at least
                  24 ha were eligible for component B. However, constituting a group of farmers
                  with neighboring plots, all interested in improving their on-farm irrigation
                  systems at the same time, has proved very difficult and time consuming. For that
                  reason, a lot of farmers interested in participating were not able to do so.

As a result of these difficulties, of the 82 subprojects that were selected through the competitive
grants process only 34 (41%) materialized.



24
  Component B financed two types of on-farm irrigation improvements: improved gravity systems (through multi-
gates pipes) and pressurized systems (drip and sprinkler). Farmers clearly preferred drip irrigation.
Notwithstanding its lower cost, improved gravity systems represented only 19% of the 48 subprojects implemented.

        (a)      The time required to prepare and implement a subproject was longer than
                 expected25, due to the following factors:
        (b)      The difficulty in collecting farmers' financial contribution (see above);
        (c)      The continued increase of the price of oil and its derivates, reaching in August
                 2008 almost three times its value at the time of appraisal;
        (d)      The competitive grant procedures for selecting beneficiaries, which proved to be
                 excessively rigid and slow;
        (e)      Subproject studies were the responsibility of beneficiaries, who usually contracted
                 low cost engineers. This resulted in studies of poor quality that needed to be
                 reviewed and corrected extensively by PSI staff, causing delays and increasing
                 costs; and
        (f)      The LA was signed on October 2005, too late to include the project in the General
                 Budget of Peru for 2006. While other components received national funds in
                 advance, component B only got a budget in June 2006.

In order to alleviate these difficulties, PSI expanded the area of interventions of component B;
supported farmers' group in mobilizing financial support from various national financial
institutions, encouraged regional and municipal governments to guarantee the loans contracted
by farmers' groups and promoted the association between farmers' groups and agro-export firms
to help farmers mobilize their financial contribution. This has significantly speeded up
subprojects preparation and implementation, but was not enough to catch-up with targets.

Contribution of Component B to the PDO. Component B made a significant contribution to the
PDO, as: (a) average income of farmers' households who benefited from this component
increased by 150% in real terms or an additional US$7,172 per year (the average farmers
household income that benefited from component B at baseline was US$4,683 per year) and (b)
average productivity of the land that benefitted from the component increased by 155% or
US$2,326/ha/year in real terms (the average productivity of the land that benefited from
Component B was 1,470 US$/ha/year before the subprojects).

Component B increased household income and land productivity through the following two
channels (a) a strong shift from traditional crops, whose cropped area decreased by 22%, to
higher-value crops, mainly fruit trees, whose cropped area increased by 58%, and vegetables,
whose cropped area increased by 40%; and (b) a general increase in yields, not only for
vegetables (40% increase for paprika, 36% for asparagus) and fruit trees (33% for avocado, 25%
for lucuma), but also for the small area still dedicated to traditional crops (28% for maize).

Despite higher unit costs than anticipated (cost per ha was on average 50% more than those
estimated at appraisal), the significant increase in land productivity led to an overall EIRR of
51% and FIRR of 37% for the component.

As for component A, it should be noted that the data on yields, impact on land productivity and
farmers' income, FIRR and EIRR should be considered with caution because only few years
were available to measure impacts (one to three years), and, as there was no control group

25
 The average time between the formation of interest groups and the execution of a sub-project turned out to be
more than one year.


                                                        39
available the evaluation is based on yields before and after subprojects implementation.
Therefore, these results should be considered as general trends and not definite results.

An additional benefit of Component B is its demonstrative effects on medium and small farmers.
Component B (both under PSI-I and PSI-II) contributed to the rapid expansion of drip irrigation
seen in Peru over the last decade, expanding from some 8,000 hectares in 199826 to more than
100,000 hectares in 200927.

            "sustainability".

The subcomponent successfully consolidated the improvements achieved under PSI I in relation
to the strengthening of WUAs. It improved the culture of payment for water service and of
financing participation in infrastructure improvements that was introduced under PSI I. It also
improved WUAs management tools and processes (e.g. elaboration of annual O&M plans and
budgets, tariff recovery systems, evaluation of available water resources and planning of the
irrigation season, use of information systems, etc.). As a result, out of 64 WUAs, 49 have
reached eligibility level for component A and 41 have reached the "sustainability" level.
Generally, WUAs qualified "non sustainable" are located in valleys where rivers are not
regulated, and, therefore, have limited incomes through irrigation tariff.

While the subcomponent exceeded its targets, there is a need for continuous capacity building of
WUAs and for putting in place a permanent and formal monitoring and benchmarking system of
WUAs. The improvement of the performance of "non sustainable" WUAs, still requires
additional efforts. Some projects28 are working in that sense, but they have a limited

implementation period. Component C1 foresaw the following mechanism to ensure permanent
support to WUAs: (a) the creation, within the WUAs, of Training and Communication Units
(UCC for its Spanish acronym) responsible for the continuous capacity building of WUAs and,
(b) the training of local irrigation authorities (ATDR for its Spanish acronym) in the monitoring
of WUAs, in particular their annual O&M plans and training programs. In practice, however,
these mechanisms are still insufficient and need to be consolidated with further support because
UCCs have only been created in 34 WUAs and are not always sufficiently financed. It is
therefore recommended that the GOP establish permanent mechanisms for the capacity building
of WUAs and monitoring and benchmarking of their performance.

Due to the difficulty encountered generating on-farm irrigation improvement subprojects (see
section on component B above), the level of effort deployed by component C2 was much higher
than anticipated, and some funds had to be reallocated from component B to component C2.
Component C2 through its initial awareness activities and field demonstrations to farmers,
created 382 interest groups (including 5,437 farmers and covering 18,311 ha), i.e. groups of
farmers expressing their interest in improved on-farm irrigation systems. Out of this, 175


                                                42
farmers' groups evolved into management groups (including 2,485 farmers and 8,170 ha), i.e.
groups formed by farmers in neighboring plots, with a firmer commitment to implementing an
on-farm irrigation improvement subproject and a collective business plan. Eventually, 48 of
those benefited directly from component B (including 476 farmers and 1,468 ha) and 82 groups
(including 833 farmers and 1,169 ha) benefited from on-farm irrigation improvement financed
by the regional government of Arequipa. This process involved supporting farmers groups in the
preparation of feasibility studies and technical design, including the preparation of a viable
business plan.

In addition to generate subprojects for component B, component C2:

       (a)     Provided technical assistance to farmers that benefited from component B,
               including the supervision of farmers' groups business plans implemented by the
               agro-business operators, the supervision of the technical assistance on the O&M
               of the new on-farm irrigation systems provided by the firm that installed the
               system;
       (b)     Carried out an agricultural extension program, aimed at disseminating on-farm
               irrigation technologies and good agricultural practices related to pest
               management, using beneficiaries of component B as demonstration plots. This
               included the systematization of agriculture results obtained after the
               implementation of the subprojects and comparison with the baseline, and the
               organization of field trips (giras agronomicas) and field days (dias de campo).

Component D. Support to Water Resources Management. (US$ 7.16 million, 150 percent of
appraisal estimate)

Subcomponent D.1 Formalization of Water Rights.

As can be seen in Table 2.7 below, two targets were used to measure subcomponent
performance: the number of agricultural water licenses (i.e. permanent water rights for irrigated
areas) issued and, after amendment 1 of the loan agreement which extended the Project area to
the Sierra, the number of irrigation plots with a license. A second indicator was formally
introduced after Project extension in the Sierra to better reflect the increased level of efforts
required to issue an agricultural water right in this region. For the same reason, the target for the
number of water licenses was decreased.

   license (Ha)

While the Project reached its target related to the number of irrigation plots with a water license,
it issued only 85 per cent of the target number of water rights. This is explained by Project
extension to the Sierra. The time and cost of formalizing water rights in the Sierra proved much
higher than in the coast, because:

   (a) In the Sierra, many water rights are issued to a community of farmers, while in the coast
       all water rights had been issued to individual farmers. Issuing a water right to a
       community is more complex and time consuming as it involves identifying the irrigation
       plots of all farmers within the community. As a result, in the Sierra, the number of plots
       with a license is higher than the number of licenses; in the Coast, the number of licenses
       can be higher than the number of plots because some plots have two licenses, one for
       surface water and another for groundwater.
   (b) In the Sierra, land is not cultivated in winter, reducing the time when field work can be
       carried out, while in the Coast, the land is cultivated year-round.

Thanks to the formalization of water rights, WUAs now have an updated registry of irrigators at
the level of the irrigation committee (comite de regantes), along with their irrigated area and
their water rights, which helped improve water distribution and billing and collection of water
charges. In addition, the formalization of water rights is expected to encourage farmers'
investment in their plots and provide a powerful tool to improve water resources management at
the basin level.

The national water rights registry (RADA) was created with its central unit in Lima (ANA
headquarters) and 26 regional units located in the ALA (Administracion local de Aguas) and
approximately 360,000 water rights were registered in its database (about 90% of appraisal
target). The national water registry is considered completed at 75 per cent, because, while the
hardware and software were purchased, RADA is running and the necessary minimum staff was
recruited and trained, the central unit of the registry is still located in a temporary office in ANA
headquarters.

RADA is an essential tool for the administration of water rights and their use for improving
irrigation and water resources management.

Subcomponent D.3 Support to the implementation of the Water Resources Strategy.

Subcomponent D.3 provided technical assistance for: (a) updating the national Water Resources
Management diagnostic and the National Water Resources Management Strategy, pending
approval; (b) supporting the preparation of the new Water Resources Law, which was approved
in March 2009 and (c) the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of a Water Resources
Management Modernization Program whose first phase is being supported by a World Bank
financed Project29 and an Inter-American Development financed Project, both approved in July
2009. This program will support, in pilot basins, the establishment of river basin organizations
(the new institutional arrangements for water resources management at the basin level) and the
formulation of integrated, participatory, river basin plans using the shared vision planning
methodology, a proven tool for conflict resolution.

Through the above mentioned activities, Component D provided technical assistance to the
National Water Resources Institute (IRH) which was upgraded to a National Water Authority
(ANA) in 2008, with increased power, responsibilities, autonomy and financial resources.

                            Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       Main findings

An ex-post cost-benefit analysis was performed on a representative sample of 28 subprojects.
This analysis estimates the Project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) at 20.5 per cent,
corresponding to a net present value of US$ 14.7 million, and the financial internal rate of return
(FIRR) at 16.7 per cent, corresponding to a net present value of US$7.2 million. Despite the data
limitations mentioned further below these results demonstrate good returns on investments from
both financial and economic points of view.

The EIRR and FIRR calculated at Project closing are lower than those estimated at appraisal,
which were 24.5 per cent and 25.5 per cent respectively. The lower internal rates of return are
explained by the fact that the irrigated area improved by components A and B, from which
Project benefits are estimated, is much smaller than anticipated, while the overall cost of
irrigation improvements (components A, B, C and part of E combined) is similar to what was
expected at appraisal. In other words, the unit cost of irrigation modernization (US$/ha) is much
higher than anticipated. This is primariloy due to: (a) the slow implementation of infrastructure
subprojects, which required much more awareness building and technical assistance than
anticipated and (b) higher costs of materials and civil works due to increases in oil prices.

The difference between the EIRR and FIRR at Project closing is explained by the following
factors: (a) the absence of taxes on agricultural produces; and (b) the significant taxes on capital
costs, incremental O&M expenditures and crop production costs. (i.e., investment costs and
agricultural inputs were subject to a 19 per cent value added tax) and the low economic value of
unskilled labor and energy (estimated at only 41 per cent and 66 per cent of their financial values
respectively).

Field visits were conducted in each subproject to collect the information required to estimate
main crop budgets and cropped areas for the "with" and "without" Project scenarios.
Incremental net agricultural benefits for each subproject were estimated from these data. It
should be noted that, in the absence of control group, the situation "before" the subproject was
implemented was taken as a "proxy" for the "without" project scenario. This limitation can
affect the analysis positively or negatively depending on the years considered. Another data
limitation is that the "with" subproject scenarios were calculated from one to three years after
subproject completion, which is not a sufficient time to appreciate full impacts of investments,
especially in the case of new permanent crops. This data limitation underestimates Project
benefits.

Quantified Project benefits are the increase value of agricultural production resulting from: (a)
increased yields and (b) shift to the production of higher value crops. It should be noted that the
Project did not lead to an increase in the cropped area. Detailed net benefits for the main crops
for each sample subproject are available in the Project file.

Increases in yields and shift to the production of higher value crops were particularly marked in
the case of on-farm irrigation improvements (Component B):

    · the cropped area under traditional crops decreased by 22% while the cropped area under
       higher-value crops, such as fruit trees and vegetables, increased by 58% and 35%
       respectively; and
    · yield increases for all types of crops: vegetables (40% increase for paprika, 36% for
       asparagus); fruit trees (33% for avocado, 25% for lucuma) and traditional crops (28%
       for maize).

Quantified Project costs. Additional agricultural production is made possible by the combination
of several Project interventions: (a) the rehabilitation and modernization of off-farm and on-
farm irrigation infrastructure; (b) capacity building to improve irrigation management; and (c)
support to agricultural production and marketing. All costs of these components have been
included in the analysis. Other investments have a less direct impact on output in the Project
area, such as overall Project implementation support. For these components benefits are more
widely spread, so only a portion of the related costs was taken into account. The costs and
benefits related to the formalization of water rights (Component D) were excluded from the
analysis on the basis that they would be extremely difficult to quantify.
Based on the above the following investment and incremental O&M costs have been included in
the overall Project financial and economic analyses: (a) cost of feasibility studies, technical
designs, works and supervision of works linked to the rehabilitation and modernization of
collective and on-farm irrigation infrastructure; (b) replacement costs of the infrastructure
mentioned above; (c) additional crop production and harvesting costs related to increased
agricultural production; (d) cost of capacity building of WUOs, farmers' groups and farmers; and
(e) 74 per cent of Project management costs, excluding the share related to water rights
formalization. The financial and economic analysis of components A and B, when taken
separately, only consider costs (a), (b) and (c) above.
Adjusting financial prices to economic values. The adjustment of financial prices to economic
values was done using specific conversion factors provided by the Ministry of Finance. This
concerns such items as unskilled labor and energy, for which the conversion factors are 0.41 and
0.66 respectively. In these cases, the specific conversion factors were applied directly to
domestic market prices to obtain the economic value of the item. For the social price of the
currency, a multiplying factor of 1.08 was established; for skill labor a coefficient of 0.9.
For the items for which no specific conversion factor was readily available the adjustments made
to convert market prices to economic values included the elimination of the value added tax, the
only direct tax affecting farming. The production of crops considered in the analysis does not
benefit from subsidies.

1. Contexto del Proyecto, Desarrollo De Los Objetivos y Diseño.

1.1. Contexto en la Valoración.

        El Perú es un país mega diverso que abarca una gran variedad de ecosistemas (climas,
        especies animales y vegetales) que lo diferencian del resto del mundo y le asignan
        ventajas competitivas sobre los demás países de la Costa del Pacifico, que junto a otros
        factores, condiciona las opciones tecnológicas a utilizar para el productor agrario. Por
        lo tanto, el sector agrario puede ser caracterizado bajo dos aspectos:

        1. Disponibilidad de recursos naturales enfatizado en la superficie para uso agrícola y
           dotación del recurso hídrico.
        2. Tipología productiva que resulta de la combinación del nivel tecnológico y de
           gestión para el aprovechamiento de estos recursos naturales.

        Nuestro país posee una superficie de 128.5 millones de hectáreas, del cual
        aproximadamente 15 millones de Ha (12% del territorio) corresponde a la región costa,
        de cuya extensión 700 mil Ha representa la superficie agrícola cultivada, con
        importantes ventajas por contar con buena infraestructura de transporte y productiva, lo
        cual ha facilitado el desarrollo del mercado de la agroexportación.

   1.2. Objetivos Originales.

        El objetivo del Proyecto es incrementar la producción y productividad de la agricultura
        de riego en el territorio costero del Prestatario, con el fin de mejorar el bienestar de los
        agricultores y contribuir a la mitigación de la pobreza.

   1.3. Objetivos Revisados.

        Los objetivos iniciales se modificaron, en razón a la ampliación de las metas físicas a
        03 valles ubicados en la región sierra del país, no previstos inicialmente; asimismo,
        debido a la incorporación del componente de apoyo a la gestión de los Recursos
        Hídricos, cuya principal actividad es la formalización de los derechos de uso de agua y
        registro en una base única de datos.

   1.4. Principales Beneficiarios.

        De acuerdo al contrato de préstamo y estudio definitivo, el proyecto se diseñó para
        beneficiar a los usuarios de riego siguientes:

      Mejoras en los Sistemas de Riego y Optimizar la Eficiencia en su Uso.




                                               57
        Se estableció un ámbito de beneficiarios constituido por aproximadamente 19,000
        agricultores agrupados en 20 juntas de usuarios, en una extensión de 51,175 Ha, de los
        cuales alrededor del 98% corresponde a la región costa y el 2% a la región sierra.

      Implementación y Capacitación en Sistema de Riego Tecnificado.

        A través del proyecto se determinó la implementación de 40 sistemas de riego
        tecnificado a nivel parcelario, que beneficiará a 508 agricultores en una extensión de
        1,882 Ha. tanto en la región costa como en una parte mínima en la región sierra del
        país.

      Ordenamiento y Formalización de la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos.

        El proyecto consideró entre sus metas el reordenamiento y formalización para el
        adecuado manejo de los recursos hídricos, para lo cual se determinó la formalización y
        entrega de licencias para el uso de agua para riego a 160,000 agricultores (95,000 en la
        región costa y 65,000 en la región sierra), asimismo se estableció la formalización de
        244,000 predios (95,000 en la costa y 149,000 en la región sierra) en beneficio de igual
        número de agricultores.

1.5 Componentes Originales.

      Componente A: REHABILITACIÓN Y MEJORAMIENTO DE LOS SISTEMAS DE
      RIEGO.
       Se orientó a la ejecución de obras de mejoramiento y rehabilitación de las redes de
       riego existentes incluyendo bocatomas, canales principales y secundarios con sus obras
       de arte, defensas ribereñas respectivas y otras obras menores, con la finalidad de
       mejorar las condiciones existentes de la infraestructura hidráulica, que incrementará su
       capacidad de captación o conducción mediante un diseño acorde con los requerimientos
       y necesidades actuales.

      Componente B: RIEGO TECNIFICADO.
       Consiste en implementar sistemas de riego tecnificado a nivel parcelario, a efecto de
       promover la adopción de técnicas modernas de riego que permitan incrementar la
       eficiencia de aplicación del agua y su consiguiente ahorro, el uso más intenso de la
       tierra disponible, el incremento de la producción y por ende mejorar el ingreso de los
       pequeños y medianos agricultores vinculados y agrupados por sistemas comunes de
       riego.

      Componente C: FORTALECIMIENTO INSTITUCIONAL Y DESARROLLO DE
      CAPACIDADES DE RIEGO.

      Sub Componente C1: Fortalecimiento institucional de las JUs.
       Este sub componente actuará como un medio de aprendizaje en todas las Juntas de
       Usuarios de la Costa, aunque con un grado diferente de intensidad. Para las JUs que ya
       han conseguido la elegibilidad, se diseñará un programa de actividades mínimas



                                              58
        destinadas a consolidar lo ya conseguido, con lo cual la capacitación proporcionada por
        el proyecto se daría por concluida. En todo caso se considera que capacitaciones futuras
        serán asumidas por las propias Junta de Usuarios, a través de su unidad de capacitación.

        Sub Componente C2: Asistencia Técnica en Riego Tecnificado. La difusión en riego y
        asistencia técnica tiene como objetivo fomentar el uso de técnicas modernas en riego,
        así como articular la oferta y demanda de este tipo de servicios, promoviendo la
        asociación de los agricultores, con el fin de lograr mayor producción y productividad.
        Si bien la difusión en riego se ofrece de manera gratuita (más con fines de difusión), la
        asistencia técnica es pagada por el agricultor, con lo cual se desarrolla la oferta de este
        tipo de servicios.

       Componente D: APOYO A LA GESTIÓN DE RECURSOS HÍDRICOS
        Consiste en incrementar el número de productores (190,000 con este programa) con
        derechos de agua con el cual puedan registrarse adecuadamente en su Junta de Usuarios
        o Comité de Regantes lo que permitirá a éstos últimos tener una mejor información
        para su gestión y a los productores una seguridad jurídica que pueda ser utilizada en
        accesos a financiamientos. La actividad incluye el proceso mismo de la formalización y
        el reforzamiento de la infraestructura que permita el registro de un mínimo de 400,000
        predios.

1.6.   Componentes Revisados.

   El proyecto comprende desarrollar actividades elementales y complementarios en diferentes
        valles de la costa y una mínima parte en la región sierra, conforme los detalles
        siguientes:

        El Componente A. Mejoramiento de Infraestructura de Riego; adicional a las obras
        programadas en los valles de la Costa, se consideró la ejecución de 04 obras
        comunitarias en la región Sierra: 01 en Chonta - Cajamarca, 01 en Mantaro - Junín y 02
        en el valle de Colca - Chivay en Arequipa; su financiamiento se estimó en US.$
        320,000 a razón de aproximadamente US$ 80,000 por obra.

        El Componente B. Riego Tecnificado; se consideró la implementación de un
        aproximado de 60 ha con sistemas de riego tecnificado en la Sierra, tentativamente 20
        ha en Chonta-Cajamarca, 20 ha en Mantaro-Junín y las restantes 20 ha en Colca-
        Arequipa con un aporte del proyecto de US$ 162,000 a razón de US$ 2,700 por ha. Se
        utilizó la misma estrategia de ejecución, mediante concursos públicos para riego
        tecnificado.

   En el Sub-Componente C.1. Fortalecimiento institucional de las organizaciones de usuarios
        de agua; se continuó con su propia estrategia y metodología de intervención. Sin
        embargo, dadas las notorias diferencias entre las organizaciones de usuarios de la Costa
        con las de la región de la Sierra, este sub-componente se concentró básicamente en el
        fortalecimiento institucional de dichas organizaciones en lo que respecta a
        organización, adecuación y uso de los instrumentos de gestión; se desarrollo intensa



                                               59
          capacitación-sensibilización en materia de normas legales relacionadas con la gestión
          del recurso hídrico.

          En el Sub-Componente C.2. Asistencia Técnica a los Agricultores de Riego; el PERAT
          a nivel de costa y ampliación de metas en la región sierra, se concentra en los
          agricultores beneficiados con el Programa de Incentivos de Riego Tecnificado.

          En el componente D. Apoyo a la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos; Consideró la
          formalización de 25,000 derechos de uso de agua en el nuevo ámbito propuesto en la
          primera enmienda, dirigido a la región sierra, específicamente en los valles de Mantaro
          en Junín, Chonta en Cajamarca y Colca en Arequipa.

1.7.    Otros cambios significativos.

     A diferencia de las modificaciones en los componentes antes descritos, que modificó
          significativamente el ámbito, presupuesto, metas físicas y otros; no se registró otra
          modificación que haya tenido relevancia para el proyecto.


2.     Factores que afectan la implementación y resultados

2.1. Formulación, Diseño y Calidad del Proyecto.

          El proyecto se diseñó y elaboró con la suficiente característica y consistencia técnica,
          dentro de los estándares establecidos conforme a los lineamientos del organismo
          cooperante y exigencias del SNIP por parte del Estado. Así también, el proyecto
          consideró importantes ingredientes extraídos de las experiencias de otros proyectos
          antes concluidos.

2.2.    Implementación.

          Se obtuvieron importantes resultados conforme lo replanteado en las enmiendas
          validadas por el Banco Mundial; no obstante, haberse presentado algunas dificultades
          durante el inicio de la fase de ejecución, como la demora en la transferencia de los
          recursos presupuestales, significando retrasos en el inicio del proyecto; igualmente se
          presentó dificultades por parte de los beneficiarios en la disposición de la contrapartida;
          así también, los usuarios tampoco presentaron en su debido tiempo los expedientes o
          perfiles, no obstante algunos de ellos contenían deficiencias, que la UCPSI asumió las
          correcciones y viabilización, específicamente para el caso de los Componentes A y B.

        Implementación del Componente A:
          Se ejecutó 31 obras que benefició a 11,062 familias con una extensión de 37,325 ha en
          tierras de cultivos. Durante el proceso de ejecución se dio a conocer que una de las
          principales limitaciones para la implementación de este componente, fue la demora por
          parte de las JUs en contribuir con el 34% en lo que correspondió a su aporte como
          contraparte y en la elaboración de sus expedientes técnicos; en otros casos no consiguen



                                                 60
 reunir sus recursos y renuncian a ejecutar las obras que inicialmente se consideró.
 Experiencia que fue evaluado durante la fase de diseño e implementación para el PSI-
 Sierra.

Implementación del Componente B:
  Sobre las actividades comprometidas, en algunos casos, igualmente registró retrasos
  debido a demoras por parte de los propios beneficiarios, al no entregar oportunamente
  sus expedientes, e incluso en varios casos se tuvieron que efectuar algunas correcciones
  a expedientes técnicos presentados, por detectarse inconsistencias en su contenido;
  asimismo, durante la ejecución se presentó otra dificultad no previsto relacionado al
  incremento del costo de las obras como consecuencia del aumento del precio de
  elementos derivados del petróleo y otros; otro de los motivos de los retrasos fue por la
  falta de entrega oportuna de los materiales adquiridos para la implementación de los
  sistemas de riego.

Implementación del Sub Componente C.1:
  Se logró la elegibilidad de 49 juntas de usuarios; así también, en las organizaciones
  intervenidas se alcanzó un incremento en el nivel de recaudación de la tarifa agraria por
  el orden del 84.5%. Teniendo en cuenta que los recursos se agotó en abril del 2008, y
  con la finalidad de no interrumpir las actividades de este Sub Componente, se requirió
  la reprogramación de un adicional proveniente del Tesoro Público a través de la OPA -
  MINAG. Así también, en 34 JUs se constituyó Unidades de Capacitación y
  Comunicación (UCC), cuyas labores debe garantizar la capacitación permanente en las
  organizaciones de usuarios, y se desarrolló 409 eventos de extensión que permitió
  beneficiar a 5,826 agricultores.

Implementación del Subcomponente C.2:
  Las actividades comprendieron haber desarrollado 838 eventos de sensibilización,
  logrando la participación de 14,838 agricultores. A lo largo del proceso de ejecución
  del proyecto, se conformo 175 grupos de gestión empresarial. Respecto a las
  actividades de extensión se cumplió con realizar 409 eventos extensión en riego
  tecnificado, lográndose la participación de 5,826 agricultores participantes; así también
  se capacitó a 1,358 agricultores como asistentes técnicos.

Implementación del Componente D:
  Las metas del componente consideró la entrega de 160,000 licencias de derechos de uso
  de agua, es decir 95,000 en organizaciones de usuarios de la región Costa y 65,000
  licencias para usuarios ubicados en la Sierra; además de efectuar la formalización de
  244,000 predios, 95,000 en la Costa y 149,000 en la Sierra. Al 30 de junio del 2009 se
  logró efectivizar la entrega de 162,559 licencias (96,306 en la Costa y 66,253 en la
  Sierra), también se logró la formalización de 246,917 predios. Los resultados se logró
  debido a la asignación de los recursos presupuestales considerados en la enmienda 2,
  posibilitando el cumplimiento y superación de las metas comprometidas.




                                        61
2.3.   Monitoreo y Evaluación.

        El monitoreo y evaluación a cargo de la UCPSI, se cumplió adecuadamente; igualmente
        por parte de la Intendencia de Recursos Hídricos ­ INRENA, actualmente Autoridad
        Nacional del Agua ­ ANA en lo referente al Componente D. Parte de las actividades
        significó facilitar información a las misiones del Banco Mundial las veces que efectuó
        supervisión, también generó 02 enmiendas, que cuentan con la respectiva aprobación
        del Banco y se hizo con la finalidad de incorporar otros ámbitos distintos al aprobado
        inicialmente (se amplió a los valles de Mantaro-Junín, Chonta-Cajamarca y Colca-
        Arequipa).

2.4    Cumplimiento de las Salvaguardas.

        Se elaboró, difundió y capacitó al personal involucrado y beneficiarios del proyecto
        sobre el contenido de 02 tipos de cartillas, conteniendo medidas para prevenir o
        minimizar los posibles efectos de impacto ambiental que pudieran generar como
        consecuencia de la ejecución de las obras de los Componentes A y B, contenidas en un
        Plan de Manejo Ambiental, de acuerdo a los detalles siguientes:

        Componente A: Se elaboró la cartilla denominada "Aspectos ambientales a
        considerarse en la elaboración de los perfiles y expedientes técnicos de los
        subproyectos - Componente A", que precisan aspectos para su aplicación en las obras
        a ejecutar, en sus diversas etapas: planificación, construcción y operación y
        mantenimiento de los sistemas de riego a rehabilitar y mejorar, de tal manera que los
        potenciales impactos ambientales adversos sean mitigados, atenuados y/o anulados.

        Componente B: Se elaboró la cartilla denominada "Aspectos ambientales a
        considerarse en la elaboración de los perfiles y expedientes técnicos de los
        subproyectos - Componente B", que precisan aspectos sobre el cuidado del medio
        ambiente en el proceso de ejecución de los subproyectos, en sus diversas etapas:
        planificación, construcción y operación y mantenimiento; de modo que los potenciales
        impactos ambientales adversos, sean mitigados, atenuados y/o anulados. También se
        consideró medidas para el manejo de plagas, uso de fertilizantes y otros (insecticidas),
        de acuerdo a los tipos de cultivos.




                                              62
   2.5. Siguiente Fase de la Operación.

         Los beneficiarios participaron activamente en la ejecución de sus proyectos,
         específicamente en: financiamiento, formulación de sus estudios o expedientes técnicos
         y además en algunos casos participaron con su mano de obra. La capitalización de sus
         esfuerzo más las experiencias y conocimientos obtenidos a través de los diferentes
         eventos de capacitación y sensibilización garantizan que durante la fase de operación
         del proyecto se espera: (i) que utilicen adecuadamente la infraestructura implementada,
         además la operación y mantenimiento; y, (ii) difundan los conocimientos y experiencias
         impartidas durante la ejecución del proyecto; para tal caso la autoridad sectorial local
         en coordinación con las juntas de usuarios coordinaran su cumplimiento.

5   Evaluación del Banco y Prestatario Desempeño.

5.1 Funcionamiento del Banco

         El desempeño del banco fue satisfactorio. El proceso de identificación fue diligente y
         consistente con los objetivos y estrategia del Banco Mundial para con el Perú y con el
         Plan de Desarrollo del Gobierno, en relación con la agricultura en la Costa y Sierra.

         a). Garantía del Banco en la Seguridad de los Desembolsos.
             La implementación del proyecto se realizó en un plazo conforme lo determinado en
             el proyecto, cumpliéndose las condiciones establecidas en el contrato de préstamo.
             Asimismo, la UCPSI durante la fase previa y ejecución del proyecto actuó con la
             debida diligencia, adecuándose con celeridad a los cambios producidos y las
             decisiones acordadas entre el Gobierno y el Banco.

         b). Calidad de la Supervisión
             El proceso de supervisión por parte del Banco fue amplio, oportuno y efectivo;
             durante la vigencia del proyecto se llevó a cabo misiones de supervisión,
             comprendidos entre octubre 2005 hasta el mes de mayo del 2009.

    5.2 Desempeño del Prestatario.

    a). Desempeño del Gobierno.
    Se considera satisfactorio la participación del Gobierno, a través del MINAG ­ UCPS/ IRH,
             durante la fase de formulación, ejecución e implementación del proyecto; no
             obstante se dejó constancia que hubieron algunas demoras durante la
             implementación, que no correspondió a la responsabilidad del prestatario.

    b). Desempeño del Organismo Responsable de la Ejecución.
    El desempeño de la UCPSI y la Autoridad Nacional del Agua ­ ANA (ex Intendencia de
            Recursos Hídricos) fue satisfactorio, conforme las exigencias establecidos en el
            Contrato de Préstamo; teniendo en cuenta que en todo momento se actuó con la

      c).    Justificación del Desempeño del Prestatario.
                La participación del Gobierno y responsables de la ejecución del proyecto,
                cumplieron apropiadamente en todas sus fases, conforme las responsabilidades y
                competencias, bajo las mismas condiciones y experiencias cumplidas durante el
                Contrato de Préstamo 4076-PE-BM.

 6    Lecciones Aprendidas.

      1º La necesidad de incorporar como parte de la ejecución del proyecto a los propios
         beneficiarios sea como co-ejecutores y/o co-financiadores es importante, en razón que
         está demostrado que los sistemas y procesos sólo pueden ser sostenibles si los actores
         forman parte de la inversión, son directo beneficiarios de algún propósito o pasan a ser
         dueños de ellos. Esta afirmación se desprende del hecho que el diseño que el PSI
         consideró el aporte financiero de las organizaciones de usuarios en los costos de las obras
         de rehabilitación y mejoramiento de los sistemas de riego, instalación de sistemas de
         riego tecnificado y la participación del personal en general en el fortalecimiento de las
         organizaciones de usuarios, inédito respecto de otros proyectos similares que no han sido
         sostenibles en el tiempo.

            Existe alta probabilidad que los logros obtenidos se mantengan e inclusive se fortalezcan
            porque existe la clara percepción de los beneficiarios respecto a la confiabilidad de las
            obras ejecutadas y por haber tenido participación y conocimientos directo sobre la forma
            como se han ejecutado las actividades del proyecto.

 2º         El diseño de este tipo de proyectos debe basarse en un diagnóstico exhaustivo de la
            problemática incidiendo principalmente en la caracterización técnica, económica,
            educacional, cultural y social de los actores o beneficiarios (grupo meta). Esta condición
            resulta importante para poder diseñar la estrategia y metodología más adecuada.

 3º         La definición clara y precisa de la interdependencia que debe haber entre sus
            componentes y el ámbito de actuación del proyecto, de modo que converjan sobre dicho
            ámbito y obedezcan a un mismo objetivo común. Esto es una condición necesaria porque
            de esta manera se logran establecer sinergias entre los componentes y se evita que cada
            uno de ellos actúe en forma independiente y se perciban como proyectos separados del
            resto.

4º          El logro de una fuerte identificación y sinergia entre el personal del proyecto con la
            población objetivo es una condición muy favorable para conseguir sus objetivos,
            resultados y metas, que pueden ser obtenidas mediante el trabajo conjunto entre
            ejecutores y beneficiarios.

 5º         La supervisión periódica de agentes especializados externos, es importante para que de
            manera imparcial evalúe y oriente el avance del mismo. Si bien, un proyecto puede ser
            eficiente en su ejecución, existen aspectos y situaciones que pueden limitar su marcha
            normal y que desde dentro de la organización no pueden ser solucionados. En estos casos




                                                   68
     resulta trascendental la participación de dichas misiones que permiten dar soluciones
     rápidas y expeditivas los problemas presentados.

6º   La necesidad que los proyectos incorporen, durante su formulación y ejecución, sea con
     mecanismos de coordinación y/o de participación, a aquellas instituciones públicas y
     privadas que directamente tienen relación con los fines y sus beneficiarios.

7º   La recomendación para que futuros proyectos de estas características trabajen con mayor
     incidencia a nivel de usuarios, es pertinente dado que la cultura tradicional dominante de
     estos actores constituye una debilidad para la sostenibilidad de sus logros y resultados. Es
     necesario reforzar el cambio de actitud de los beneficiarios no solo con procesos de
     sensibilización sino también con otros mecanismos de comunicación y difusión masiva.

           Nota: En millónes de US$.

4°. Los resultados finales de la ejecución física por componentes fue:
    a. Componente A: Se mejoró y rehabilitó 40.01 Km. de canales de riego que benefició a
       11,062 familias en una extensión de 37,325 hectáreas; asimismo se ejecutaron 360 obras
       de arte y 02 de mejoramiento de bocatomas; en un total de 31 obras concluidas.
    b. Componente B: Se implementó 48 sistemas de riego que benefició a 476 familias en una
       extensión de 1468.40 hectáreas.
    c. Componente C con 02 Subcomponentes; el Subcomponente C1: Consolidó a 49 juntas
       de usuarios como elegibles y 41 sostenibles; la eficiencia en la recaudación de la tarifa
       agraria se incrementó en 3.4%, que significa un incremento en la recaudación de 3.5
       millones de dólares por año; asimismo se implementó 34 unidades de capacitación; se
       capacitó a 69,230 usuarios de riego, se desarrolló 565 talleres de capacitación y 15,200
       eventos de sensibilización.




                                               70
      El Subcomponente C2: Posibilitó haber realizado 838 eventos de sensibilización con
      14,838 agricultores sensibilizados, se capacitó a 1,358 agricultores para conformar
      unidades productivas; se conformó 175 grupos de gestión empresarial; y, desarrolló 409
      eventos de extensión en sistemas de riego en beneficio de 5,826 agricultores.
   d. Componente D: Se entregó 163,455 licencias de derecho de uso de agua; se formalizaron
      248,327 predios; se conformaron 4,345 bloques de riego y se conformó 26 unidades

   Prestatario:                       7.407                  9.524                129
   BIRF                              10.260                 10.247                 99.9
   Organizaciones de Usuarios:        5.474                  4.021                 73
   Total                             23.141                 23.792                103

6°. En términos generales el proyecto representa una rentabilidad que crea las condiciones para
    posibilitar el bienestar económico de manera directa a los agricultores beneficiarios
    agrupados en 22 juntas de usuarios del Componente A y 17 juntas de usuarios del
    Componente B; que de acuerdo a las proyecciones el nivel de producción y productividad se
    incrementaría en un 15%, puesto que se incrementa e intensifica el uso adecuado de las
    tierras de cultivos; además que se logra un 85% de eficiencia en la conducción del agua de
    riego. Resultados que se demuestra a través del 16.7% de la rentabilidad financiera y 20.5%
    la rentabilidad económica del proyecto en general.

7°. Durante la ejecución del proyecto, se emite la Ley Nº 28585 que crea el Programa de Riego
    Tecnificado, mediante el cual se fortaleció los niveles de gestión del Programa Subsectorial
    de Irrigaciones - PSI, con dicha norma se fortifica y consolida su condición de promotor en la
    ejecución de proyectos de riego tecnificado a través de los Gobiernos Regionales y Locales;
    la acotada norma le atribuye la condición de Ente Rector del programa.

8°. Los retrasos durante la ejecución del proyecto, se debió básicamente a tres factores: 1)
    limitaciones de los beneficiarios en conseguir recursos financieros para aportar su
    contrapartida y el incremento del precio del petróleo que aumento los costos de inversión de
    los proyectos de riego tecnificado; 2) La elaboración de los estudios de pre inversión y
    definitivos fueron asumidos por los propios usuarios y beneficiarios y en muchos casos se
    tuvieron que reformular; lo que ocasionó retrasos en la ejecución, 3) Demasiado tiempo para
    tramitar la aprobación de las dos enmiendas.

9º Adicionalmente se puede considerar lo siguiente:

   ·   Considerar en la formulación de futuros estudios personal especializado que se dedique a
       la gestión de acceso al crédito de los posibles beneficiarios de los PIPs del componente
       de Riego tecnificado.
   ·   Aplicar, en lo posible, la modalidad de ejecución de "Obras Comunitarias" para los PIP's
       de rehabilitación y mejoramiento de infraestructura de riego, dado que los costos de
       inversión y plazos de ejecución se reducen y las OUA's adquieren experiencia en su
       administración y gestión, generándose nuevas capacidades en ellas.


                                               71
   ·   En riego tecnificado, la modalidad y estrategia de ejecución debe ser flexible, como por
       ejemplo el sistema "Llave en Mano" a través de concursos públicos, permitiendo la libre
       elección de los grupos de gestión respecto del costo máximo de los PIP's, monto de los
       incentivos, número de beneficiarios por grupo de riego tecnificado, tipo de riego
       tecnificado. Considerar establecer la modalidad de ventanilla única (abierta).
   ·   Los mecanismos de control de los indicadores establecidos deben estar claramente
       definidos a fin de llevar un adecuado seguimiento del proyecto y evaluación expost.
   ·   El Manual de Operaciones del Proyecto debe ser de conocimiento de los actores,
       incluyendo a los beneficiarios. Por tanto, el documento debe ser elaborado en forma
       sencilla y práctica para que sea entendible y aplicable.
