the Irrigation Subsector\n            Supplemental Project for Peru were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was\n            substantial, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was also\n            moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: the\n            issue of capacity is critical and the scale of need is\n            enormous, but appreciation of the problem is low. Water\n            Users Organization (WUO) need to improve their capacity to\n            plan, organize and manage their irrigation infrastructure\n            and agricultural production systems, especially in a context\n            of rapidly changing institutional and legal frameworks, and\n            agricultural markets. In order to have a sustainable\n            capacity building system that can count on reliable and\n            realistic funding, it is recommended to address the\n            potential role of different players in its design,\n            methodologies, funding sources (water users,\n            non-governmental organization (NGO), public and private\n            sector, international cooperation) and other support\n            mechanisms. Also, regional and local entities are expected\n            to play an important role in enabling WUOs to enhance their\n            capacities and effectiveness."}, "docdt": "2009-12-23T00:00:00Z"}
