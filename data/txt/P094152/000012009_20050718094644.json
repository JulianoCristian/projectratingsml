It\n            aims to complete and consolidate the objectives and the\n            achievements as well, of the original Irrigation Sub-sector\n            Project. The Supplemental Loan is expected to benefit some\n            farmers and their families, and will support the key\n            components of the original Project which are expected to\n            have a major incremental impact. In addition, it will help\n            formalize water rights, a major move toward the adoption of\n            the Water Law, an advanced version of which is currently\n            under discussion by a special Congressional Committee.
