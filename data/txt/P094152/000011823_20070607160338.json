There is a remote\n            possibility that the execution of project works may cause\n            significant damage to natural resources, environmental\n            preservation and conservation. Nonetheless, some of the\n            environmental impacts are : damage to historic cultural\n            heritage areas; use of agro-chemical products; noise, dust\n            and air pollution from vehicular and construction\n            activities; and potential soil erosion, destruction of\n            landscape, and vegetation. Mitigation measures are :\n            vehicles to comply with local municipality noise and air\n            quality regulations; reject of works with pre-investment\n            studies that lack environmental impact study; stop works\n            whose technical drawings indicate they affect\n            historic-cultural sites; organize community outreach and\n            public awareness campaigns on environmental management\n            issues; affected land and vegetation will be restored by\n            soil leveling and covering grass; and finally; promote the\n            application of adequate agronomic practices and train\n            farmers in pesticide management."}, "docdt": "2007-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
