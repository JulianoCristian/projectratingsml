The restructuring will\n            revise: (a) project outcomes targets; and (b) the allocation\n            of the loan proceeds between expenditure categories. In\n            accordance with the request received from the Government on\n            April 15, 2008, a first one year extension of the closing\n            date of the loan agreement was approved by the country\n            Director on May 28, 2008 in order to enable the borrower to\n            complete subprojects that are currently under\n            implementation. The new closing date is June 30, 2009.\n            Taking into account the recently approved project extension,\n            the restructuring will ensure that uncommitted funds are put\n            into productive use, fully disbursing the loan at project\n            closing, and that relevant outcomes are achieved. A\n            reallocation of loan proceeds from civil works and goods\n            categories to consultant services and operating costs will\n            ensure that there are enough funds to: (a) continue\n            supporting farmers preparing good quality irrigation\n            improvement subproject feasibility studies and gathering\n            their financial contribution; (b) ensure the sustainability\n            of project investments through capacity building of water\n            users associations (WUAs) and farmers in the operation and\n            maintenance of the improved irrigation schemes; (c) continue\n            the formalization of water rights, essential to encourage\n            farmers investments, in particular in irrigation; and (d)\n            continue project management activities for an additional\n            year. Finally, it is proposed to revise outcome targets to\n            better reflect what can be achieved by project closing."}, "docdt": "2008-05-29T00:00:00Z"}
