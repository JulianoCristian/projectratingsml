MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE 
IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR PROJECT 
“PROGRAM TO EXPAND THE IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR PROJECT UNDER THE 
FRAMEWORK OF IBRD LOAN 4076-PE” 
 
THE PROJECT’S ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
From 1997 to 2004, the Peruvian Government put into practice an innovative strategy to: (i) 
develop the capacity of JUs for decentralized, efficient management of irrigation systems; (ii) 
reduc
e
the public sector’s role in irrigation; and (iii) ensure the recovery of irrigation system 
investment, operation, and maintenance costs through the execution of the Irrigation Subsector 
Project (PSI). This project, with the financial participation of the World Bank (Loan N° 4076-PE) 
totaling US$85 million, included the execution of four technical components: 
 
·
Rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation infrastructure. 
·
Institutional strengthening of water users’ organizations. 
·
Incentives for the technification of irrigation. 
·
Emergency dam safety program. 
 
The project complied with its specific, established aim, purpose, and objectives, contributing to the 
increase in extensive and intensive land use, to rural institutional strengthening, and to a lesser 
degree to agricultural production and productivity and thus to the incomes of farmers on the Costa. 
One of the most important achievements has been the improvement in irrigation system efficiency 
(80 to 81% in conveyance, and 70 to 79% in distribution), and at on-farm level (55 to 63% in 
technified gravity irrigation and up to 85% in pressurized irrigation). 
 
Due to the PSI’s success in its first phase, the Peruvian Government has decided to continue with 
the execution of this project. In this so-called second phase of the PSI, whose total investment cost 
is US$22.02 million, four complementary groups of actions will be carried out: (i) improvement of 
irrigation infrastructure in small-scale community rehabilitation works; (ii) implementation of 
infrastructure aimed at the development of irrigation technology; (iii) training in management for 
Users’ Committees and in technical aspects of irrigation for farmers; and (iv) increase in the 
formalization of water rights. In addition, studies will be carried out in a comprehensive manner 
with the aim of planning future interventions in irrigated agriculture on the Costa. 
 
CHARACTERISTICS OF PSI WORKS IN RELATION TO THEIR IMPACTS ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
 
The PSI’s execution during its second stage basically contemplates two types of works: (i) 
rehabilitation and improvement of irrigation infrastructure in existing public irrigation systems; and 
(ii) on-farm technified irrigation. With regard to their environmental impacts, these works are 
considered to be Category B, because of their simple characteristics, relatively low cost, and ease of 
execution, to the point that consideration has been given to allowing the construction of these works 
to be administered by Irrigation Water Users’ Organizations, under the title of “Community Works” 
E1164

in the case of irrigation improvement works, and by groups of beneficiary farmers in the case of the 
implementation of technified irrigation systems. 
 
Because these works are aimed at improving efficiency in the use of irrigation water, they will 
produce highly favorable effects on the environment because they will reduce water losses, thus 
contributing to reduce problems of flooding and soil salinization. Consequently, this will greatly 
alleviate the sanitation and health problems that occur in neighboring towns caused by insects and 
animals that often transmit pests and contagious diseases. 
 
The historical-cultural heritage existing in the region is not expected to be affected by the execution 
of project works, since these form part of existing irrigation systems which, at the appropriate time, 
had to respect the presence of such historical-cultural testimonies when they were built. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PREVENTION AND MITIGATION PLAN, UNDER THE 
IRRIGATION SUBSECTOR PROJECT 
 
There is a remote possibility that the execution of project works may cause significant 
environmental damage, because th
e
project’s design, components, strategies, and modalities of 
execution and its specific activities comprise a Plan aimed not only at complying with the project’s 
specific objectives, but also at achieving these objectives under the framework of natural resources 
and environmental preservation and conservation. The execution of works and their operation and 
maintenance include three specific technical supports: (i) the training program for institutional 
strengthening of irrigation water users’ organizations; (ii) the on-farm irrigation extension program 
and technical assistance for crop practices aimed at farmers, to be implemented with technified 
irrigation systems; and (iii) support for the formalization of water rights, aimed at allocating to 
irrigation users a basic supply of water for agricultural use, in terms of available resources and their 
efficient, fair, and sustainable use. Furthermore, the opinions of specialists conclude that the 
Irrigation Subsector Project will contribute to improving the current environmental conditions in 
areas where the project will have a presence or will intervene. 
 
Another important mention of the subject is the forthcoming execution, with World Bank financing, 
of the Study on “Environmental Analysis in Peru,” which incorporates aspects related to pesticide 
management that will be very useful for diagnostics, risk identification, proposed prevention and 
mitigation measures, surveillance of the implementation of corrective measures, etc. 
 
Should such negative effects on the environment arise or appear as a consequence of the execution 
of works, the following measures will be implemented: 
 
3.1 
Respect for cultural heritage (World Bank Safeguard OPN 11.03/OP 4.11)
This problem may arise from the execution of irrigation infrastructure rehabilitation and 
improvement works. In such cases, the measures are: 
 
Preventive efforts
:
Special care will be taken in reviewing the technical files for those works (due 
to changes in the layout of canals or the location of hydraulic structures in zones with archeological 
remains) that do not affect areas declared or presumed to contain assets that constitute cultural 
heritage. In such cases, these technical files will be rejected, unless they include the respective 
documents authorizing the execution of works, issued by the relevant authority (National Institute 
of Culture-INC). 
Page  3
Mitigation Efforts:
 In fact, INC does not authorize the execution of works in areas declared to be 
of cultural heritage. In areas not declared to be of cultural heritage, if for any reason during the 
execution of the work any pieces or objects are found that constitute cultural heritage, the PSI 
Coordinating Unit (UCPSI) will utilize the procedures established by INC for these cases, i.e. it 
will: (i) notify the respective Regional Office of INC by letter, about the findings; (ii) deliver the 
items of cultural heritage found, to the regional representative of INC; and (iii) prepare document 
verifying the delivery of items, to be signed by the representative of UCPSI and the regional 
representative of INC. 
 
3.2 
Respect for the management of agrochemical products (World Bank Safeguard OP 4.09)
This problem may arise due to the execution of technified irrigation works that involve an area of 
nearly 3,000 ha (0.5% of the irrigated area on the Costa) and with nearly 1,000 farmers. In these 
cases, the measures are: 
 
Preventive efforts: 
By the power granted by the National System of Public Investment (SNIP) to 
UCPSI, to prevent any risk to the environment, UCPSI will not approve the execution of works: (i) 
whose pre-investment studies have not developed the environmental aspects established by SNIP; 
and (ii) whose environmental aspects developed in the pre-investment stage indicate that the 
negative impact on the environment is intensive and that mitigation measures are either insufficient 
or significantly costly and thus affect the subproject’s profitability. 
 
Mitigation efforts: 
UCPSI and the National Agricultural Health Service (SENASA) will supervise 
the application of necessary mitigation measures by each Group of Technified Irrigation Farmers 
responsible for their respective subproject. The possible mitigation efforts to be applied are: (i) 
training for farmers in aspects of pesticide management; (ii) linkage of producers to share 
experiences and validate them in other zones of the region or country; (iii) coordination of actions 
with public and private institutions dealing with pesticide management; (iv) coordination of NGO 
services through strategic alliances with agroindustrial enterprises and purchasers of products and 
with private technicians, to implement adequate pesticide management programs; (v) promotion of 
the use of adequate agronomic practices; (vi) carrying out ongoing evaluations of crop development 
and pest control, and verifying the execution of planned actions in this regard; and (vii) verifying 
that the established agrochemical control is applied on the basis of monitoring of pests and their 
natural enemies and according to the crop’s phenological stage, among others. 
 
A
concrete measure that the project will implement to mitigate the environment impact of pesticide 
management, is to carry out case studies (Pilot Project) on this matter, in one of the major crops 
(paprika) expected to replace traditional crops. The environmental impact of pesticide use will be 
monitored, as well as the effect of corrective measures implemented to counter any negative 
environmental impacts that may arise. The results of these case studies will make it possible to 
extrapolate the results obtained and extend them to other crops that are being considered for 
introduction. 
 
Environmental Monitoring and Surveillance Efforts: 
UCPSI, WUOs, and farmers involved will 
supervise and oversee compliance with provisions, aimed at: (i) verifying that the proposed 
mitigation or correction measures have been executed and are effective; (ii) detecting impacts that 
were unforeseen in the EIA and proposing adequate corrective measures; (iii) checking and 
verifying expected impacts; and (iv) validating the prediction methods applied.
