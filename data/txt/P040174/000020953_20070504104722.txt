F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of a
selected number of barrios (representing 15 percent of total barrio population) in the
Metropolitan Area of Caracas (MAC), through the development and implementation of a
community driven, sustainable and replicable infrastructure improvement program.

  The objective remains unchanged, although with the partial loan cancellation the
number of direct beneficiaries is 40% of what was originally projected.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The project development objective was not revised, with exception of the percentage
change from 15% to 9.8% of the barrio population in Caracas affected by the Project. The
PDO remained relevant despite the instability of the political, economic, and institutional
climate in which the Project was being implemented (see Box No. 1 in Section 1.4).
Though the PDO was not revised, these implementation challenges led to revisions in the
Project with respect to the areas intervention, number of beneficiaries (Section 1.4), shift
in focus to emergency mitigation and community­driven works in place of larger
structural infrastructure works, and ultimately a reduction of the loan and extension of the
closing date (See Section 1.7).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

Venezuela is one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America with 93 percent of the total
population living in cities. An intense period slum formation in the Metropolitan Area of Caracas
(MAC) barrios corresponded with the wave of rural to urban migration between the 1950-80s.
MAC barrios suffered from the: (i) lack of adequately defined property rights; (ii) absence of
collective action mechanisms to resolve the problem of providing public goods; and (iii) lack of
credit to facilitate housing construction. As a result, MAC barrios suffer from a chronic lack of
basic services. The absence of rights-of-way and vehicular access impedes proper implementation
and maintenance of water and sanitation infrastructure, inhibits vehicular-based public services,
increases the costs of delivery of all private goods, and imposes on barrio-dwellers long and
precarious commutes. Access to water is extensive but informal unreliable. Residents are at a
great risk of landslides on steep, unstable slopes due to leakages in the wastewater systems which
undermine the geotechnical integrity of the barrios. And increasingly, families occupy unstable
terrain or steeply sloping hillsides, posing a threat to human safety and advancing the process of
hillside erosion.

The Government of Venezuela took an active role in the 1990s to address the problem of slum
growth through a range of policy and program initiatives including the World Bank financed
Low-Income Barrios Improvement Project (PROMUEBA) which was effective in December
1993 and closed in December 1998. PROMUEBA immediately preceded the current operation
and provided financing to municipalities for barrio infrastructure, linked with municipal technical
assistance. A 1994 Sectoral Plan outlined a comprehensive plan for improving the barrios of the
MAC. In parallel to the above initiatives, and partly stimulated by them, there has been a
resurgence of NGO initiatives in barrio upgrading activities throughout the country. In the MAC,
several pilot projects were undertaken to improve barrios. And together with the Sectoral Plan,
they provided the conceptual framework for this Project, which proposed to scale-up these pilot
initiatives to reach a population of approximately 180,000 in two separate groups of barrios - La
Vega and Petare Norte.

The Project was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Venezuela,
discussed by the Board on May 6, 1997.1 This strategy emphasized continued Bank support to
Government poverty reduction efforts through sustainable economic growth with stability and
increased efficiency in the provision of basic services as well as the specific CAS objectives of: (i)
improving basic infrastructure services; (ii) improving income and social conditions of the most
vulnerable poor; and (iii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The objective of the Project is to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of a selected
number of barrios (representing 15 percent of total barrio population) in the Metropolitan Area of
Caracas (MAC), through the development and implementation of a community driven,
sustainable and replicable infrastructure improvement program. The objective remains unchanged,
although with the partial loan cancellation the number of direct beneficiaries is 40% of what was
originally projected.



1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators (as approved by original approving authority), and
reasons/justification

The project development objective was not revised, with exception of the percentage change from
15% to 9.8% of the barrio population in Caracas affected by the Project. The PDO remained
relevant despite the instability of the political, economic, and institutional climate in which the
Project was being implemented (see Box No. 1 below). Though the PDO was not revised, these
implementation challenges led to revisions in the Project with respect to the areas intervention,
number of beneficiaries (Section 1.4), shift in focus to emergency mitigation and community­
driven works in place of larger structural infrastructure works, and ultimately a reduction of the
loan and extension of the closing date (See Section 1.7).




1.4 Main Beneficiaries
(original and revised; briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The Project targeted inhabitants of two separate barrios in Caracas: Petare Norte in the
Municipality of Sucre and La Vega in the Municipality of Libertador. The target group in these
Project areas was had poor vehicular access, an excessive number of footpaths, no formal
drainage and sanitation systems, no clear definition of individual or condominium land property
rights, and a lack of credit to facilitate housing construction. These two agglomerations contained
twelve distinct barrios with a total population of 184,000 inhabitants, representing 15% of the
total barrio population in Caracas (1.2 million according to the 1990 census). Following the
emergency situation in Vargas State, brought about by the landslides in December 1999, three
additional barrios were included. This increased the number of beneficiaries to 197,000 (Petare
Norte: 102,071; La Vega: 69,804; and La Guaira: 25,000) These numbers were ultimately
reduced as a result of the 40 percent partial loan cancellation in 2004, amounting to a total target
population of approximately 118,000 inhabitants. This final figure corresponds to 9.8% of the
barrio population in Caracas.

                  Box 1: Political, Economic, and Institutional Challenges in Implementation

    The Project was implemented in an extremely challenging political and institutional environment. The
    Loan was approved on October 22, 1998 and did not become effective until December 21, 1999. This
    long delay between approval and effectiveness is attributable largely to a corresponding period of political
    transition. Presidential elections in December 1998 saw a change in Government with current President
    Hugo Chavez winning the elections. Government energy throughout 1999 was focused on constitutional
    reforms and two associated referenda in April and December of that year. Presidential elections were held
    again in July 2000 under this new constitutional order. During much of this period the Government was
    engaged in articulating a new policy vision across all developmental sectors ­ including those for housing
    and urban basic services. The CAMEBA Project was viewed initially as program of the previous
    administration and there was at first little support to continue with implementation. Constituencies within
    the Government committed to the Project spent much of this period advocating that the Project should be
    declared effective, maintaining that the operation was consistent with emerging Government priorities.

    Landslides and flooding in Vargas State in December 1999, resulted in the serious loss of life and
    property and constituted both an opportunity and a serious challenge for the Project. The Bank and
    Government teams responded immediately to the crisis and restructured a portion of the Project to be able
    to meet emergency reconstruction needs. It was in this environment of flexibility and adaptability to a
    devastating natural disaster that the Project obtained support it needed to be declared effective by the new
    government. At the same time, a substantial proportion of managerial and technical energy was diverted
    from the Project's core developmental objective to emergency reconstruction work.

    National political instability persisted during the 2001-04 period in the form of national strikes, opposition
    protests, an attempted coup in April 2002 and a Presidential recall referendum in August 2004. The
    economy entered a deep recession during 2002-03, with GDP contracting from 8.9 to 7.7 respectively in
    these two years, largely a result of the political instability. Inflation also rose to above 30 percent in 2003.

    This environment of macroeconomic and political instability had a clear impact on Project
    implementation. Inflationary conditions complicated procurement where financial proposals frequently
    exceeded budget estimates leading to the cancellation of processes or the protracted negotiation of others.
    Contracts under execution also suffered as contractors sought relief from inflation-driven cost increase
    leading again to delays and in some cases the suspension of works. Political instability manifested itself in
    the form of institutional instability. The Project over a seven year period absorbed four changes of
    Ministries, seven Ministers, seven different Presidents of FUNDACOMUN, thirteen General Managers of
    CAMEBA, seven Technical Managers and 10 and 12 operational managers in La Vega and Petare Norte,
    respectively. This turnover disrupted implementation.




1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The Caracas Slum-Upgrading Project aimed to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants of a
selected number of barrios in Caracas, by developing and implementing a community-driven,
sustainable, and replicable infrastructure improvement program. The project had three
components:

(i) Urban Upgrading, which aimed to finance the design and execution of Communities
Neighborhood Improvement Plans (NIP) including the design and executing pedestrian and
vehicular access, water distribution, sewerage and sanitation, drainage, electricity distribution,



                                                      3

public lighting, and community centers. This component also included financing of resettlement
housing and the costs of community outreach, environmental education programs and land titling.

(ii) Institutional Development, which aimed to finance the start-up and operational costs for the
project management unit, including public dissemination, monitoring and evaluation, technical
assistance and capacity building in several areas including cost recovery, municipal cadastre
updating, development of technical norms and standards for urban projects in the informal sector.

(iii) Housing Microfinance, which aimed to finance the development and operation of a market-
based housing improvement loan fund to provide consumer credit to low-income individuals
residing in the barrios to finance improvements to their housing unit, working through a
partnership between banks and a non-governmental organization.




1.6 Revised Components

Project components were not revised during implementation. However, the existing project
components and subcomponents were adjusted as result of a partial loan cancellation and two
reallocations that took place during implementation. These adjustments are detailed in section 1.7
below.



1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

The Project underwent a number of significant changes which were formally incorporated into
the project design as amendments to the loan agreement (see Annex 2). As outlined below, the
Project changed in regards to the geographic areas covered by the project, a partial loan
cancellation, an extension of the closing date, a decrease in the number of beneficiaries (Section
6.4), a reduction in the number of resettlement cases, and funding reallocations.

Reduction in Structural Infrastructure Investments: A significant change in the project design
occurred with the shift in focus from larger structural works to smaller community-driven works,
which was formally incorporated into project design through a fifth amendment. In particular, the
shift in focus reduced the scope and extent of investments in access and drainage infrastructure
which would have involved significant effort in preparation and execution, and resulted in
considerable resettlement. It is important to mention that some major drainage investments were
made to rehabilitate and expand the capacity of trunk infrastructure linked to project areas.
However, the scale of such investment was far below what was originally planned. The reduction
in structural infrastructure investments enabled the Project and Government to focus on more
immediate demand-driven investments in tertiary road, retention infrastructure, rehabilitation and
extension of footpaths and recreational facilities which proved to be highly successful and had a
positive impact on the level of community participation in the Project.

Change in Geographical and Emergency Scope: The Project was adjusted in 2000 to finance
emergency reconstruction works in La Guaira in Vargas State in response to severe flooding in
December 1999. This change in Project scope created an additional operational area and initially
increased the number of estimated beneficiaries by 13,000.



                                               4

Partial Loan Cancellation: The Loan amount was reduced from US$ 60.7M to US$ 35.7M (fourth
Loan Amendment). Justifications for the reduction included: (i) low disbursement capacity of
CAMEBA; (ii) underestimated implementation periods; (iii) over-estimation of unit prices; (iv)
significant increase in US$/Bs exchange rate (from 535/Bs to 2.150 Bs to the dollar); (v) non-
eligible expenditures resulting from the inability to use Bank procurement guidelines; and (vi) the
reduction of the resettlement sub-component (initially estimated at US$ 22.1m of which the Bank
financing was US$ 7.2m).

Extension of Closing Date: At the request of the Government, the closing date was extended
twice for a total of twenty-four months until June 30, 2006. The Bank determined that the
extension was justified by unpredictable circumstances that led to the delay of disbursements
such as: (a) a change in government between preparation and implementation; (b) the natural
disaster in Vargas State; and (c) the high-turnover of the leadership in the implementing agency.
The Bank and the Government agreed to realign activities to respond to these challenges and take
advantage of the late term successes of the Project by extending the closing date.

Reduction in Resettlement: During implementation, the number of resettlement cases changed
from the original estimate of 2,500 households to the final assessment of 287 housing units due to
the change in scope of the Project outlined above. The reduction in the planned width of roads
from 12 meters to 8 reduced the estimated number of housing units to be resettled by 1,150 units.
These adjustments were adequately reflected in the 2001 Resettlement Action Plan. Additionally,
the scope of other investments was also adjusted to enable a timely implementation and mitigate
adverse social impacts. In particular, the Project: (i) resorted to only partial demolitions of
housing units to accommodate widening; (ii) utilized cash compensation benefits; (iii) reduced
the cost of new construction by using alternative, low-cost technologies; and (iv) both purchased
and upgraded existing structures to accommodate resettled families.

Funding Reallocations: As specified in the amendments detailed in Annex 2, Bank cofinancing
for works was increased from the initial estimate of 40% (1999) to 85% (March 2006).
Additionally, the successive amendments decreased the overall proportion of the Loan dedicated
to works (Categories 1a and 1b) from 66% to the 56% and increased the allocation for consultant
services and technical assistance (Category 2b) from 24.1% to 36.1%.

Microfinance Component: The housing microfinance component was not implemented. The
original model for the component aimed to subsidize microfinance banks for the costs associated
with product development, mobilization and outreach in Project areas. During implementation
FUNDACOMUN informed the Bank that subsidizing commercial and microfinance banks was
not consistent with existing Government policy in the sector and that it sought to develop
alternative models for the component. However, due to factors described above, a revised
component design was not prepared until June 2006.




2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)



                                               5

Project design upon entry reflected a highly innovative and participatory approach which aimed
to meet the most basic needs of slum residents through the provision of infrastructure,
regularization of land tenure, and access to credit. The Project built upon key lessons learned
from the Bank financed Low-Income Barrios Improvement Project (PROMUEBA). In particular,
the Project: (i) took a holistic geographic approach to the planning and design of investments; (ii)
aimed to promote decentralized service provision by working through municipalities; (iii)
included significant community participation in design and implementation; (iv) built upon past
successful strategies for resettlement and the use of appropriate technologies; and (v) aimed to
create access to finance for a large segment of the population without access to formal credit
markets and government housing subsidies.

At appraisal, nine main risk factors were identified and the Project was given an overall `Modest'
risk rating. The task team may have considered a higher risk rating at entry given the ambitious
nature of the Project design and the prevailing political instability at the time of effectiveness.
The Project was given a category `B' Environmental Assessment and the assumptions and risk
mitigation measures associated with natural resources management and pollution control along
with resettlement were clearly spelled out. It was noted that the Operations Manual and
Management Information System were not in place at effectiveness




2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)

Project implementation took place in a challenging political environment resulting in significant
institutional instability. Seven different FUNDACOMUN Presidents and 13 CAMEBA Project
Managers were appointed over a six year implementation period. Additionally, a natural disaster
in Vargas State in December 1999 temporarily shifted the focus of Project implementation to
emergency response activities in 2000. These implementation challenges caused significant
delays and resulted in the eventual amendments and partial cancellation of the loan. Project
implementation improved between 2001 and 2003 ­ a period correlated with stability in
FUNDACOMUN management. The Project implemented a number of `emergency response' and
community infrastructure investments. As of November 2003 the Project had disbursed US$11.35
million (or 19% of the loan amount).

In March 2004, upon Government request and Bank team recommendations, a partial cancellation
of the Loan was approved by the Bank management and consisted of: (i) a partial Loan
cancellation from the initial $ 60.7 million to $ 35.7 Million; (ii) the increase of Bank financing
share of the works from 40 % to 70%; and (iii) an extension of one year of the closing date (now
established at June 30, 2005).

Following this partial cancellation on 2004, the rate of disbursements greatly increased and
Project performance and disbursement improved considerably. The PMU was been considerably
strengthened during this period and witnessed greater stability in key technical and administrative
positions. During the April 2005 mission, the Bank team observed that the quality of
implementation of works and services under the project was Satisfactory and the CAMEBA team
demonstrated a strong commitment to its execution. Nonetheless, it was noted at the time that
disbursement targets were not being met due to delays in contracting and the execution of works




                                               6

contracts. The Government was not able to disburse all Loan proceeds by the June 30, 2005
closing date for these reasons and a second extension through June 30, 2006 was granted.

It is important to note that the overarching policy environment in Venezuela during the period of
implementation was highly conducive to enhancing mechanisms for community participation in
investment Projects. As noted in this report, a strong emphasis in community participation was a
critical factor associated the partial success and effectiveness of the Project. The role of
neighborhood representatives and Urban Land Committees (CTUs) in particular were critical to
the successful implementation of community infrastructure works, land titling and resettlement
activities. These instruments emerged in the overarching policy environment in the country
during the period in which ministries and executing agencies were strongly encouraged to
increase participation in development projects.



2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The monitoring and evaluation system was adequately designed during preparation. The system
envisioned conducting an impact evaluation and also incorporated additional instruments
including: (i) social assessment; (ii) land markets survey; and (iii) quality impact monitoring. The
Project aimed to implement a detailed management information system (SIGMA) that would
allow for regular monitoring of technical and financial information associated with Project
activities. A special M&E unit was to be established within the office of the Project Manager.

The M&E framework outlined in Project design was neither completely implemented nor fully
utilized due to the institutional and management instability that characterized in particular the
early years of implementation. The PMU did not make a significant investment in conducting
planned studies or developing instruments. Neither the social nor land market assessments were
conducted. In periods of management stability the PMU focused more on contracting and
executing works rather than developing and utilizing monitoring and evaluation systems. The first
phase of a comprehensive monitoring system (SIGMA) was designed and installed by an
Argentine firm in 1999 and training was conducted for its use. The system was to combine both
financial and technical modules. However, the technical module was not developed. High
turnover within FUNDACOMUN and continued management instability diminished both the
number of staff capable of maintaining and using the system. Concerns were also expressed by
PMU staff that the system was excessively complicated to use and maintain.

The Project did conduct an ex-post evaluation by contracting a local firm. The evaluation was
comprehensive and aimed to quantify outcomes for each of the Project's components and key
activities. The evaluation was limited, however, by the fact that baseline surveys were not
conducted in Project areas and control groups and those physical targets were not consistently
established and updated at effectiveness and throughout implementation. Nonetheless, the
evaluation provides important findings as to the importance of social organization activities in
Project effectiveness and also to the success of land titling and regularization activities.
Additionally, the Project did develop a socio-economic, legal and physical cadastre in Project
areas in both Petare Norte and La Vega and was used extensively for the purpose of executing the
land regularization and titling activity.




2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance



                                               7

(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Environment: The Project had a significant and positive environmental impact in project areas
through improved storm-water drainage, reduced runoff velocity, and reduced soil erosion. The
Project complied with all Bank environmental requirements and was designed to minimize
potential negative environmental impacts through the: (i) execution of an Environmental
Management Plan; (ii) development of a Manual of Environmental Specifications; (iii)
preparation of guidelines for the treatment and disposal of construction waste generated during
the construction process; (iv) development of general guidelines for the organization of
community managed solid waste collection programs (household solid waste); (v) design of a
community environmental education program; and (vi) identification of additional studies. The
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was effectively prepared in 1999 to deal with possible
negative impacts resulting from the implementation of works and to protect and manage any
environmentally protected areas adjacent to the Project sites. As part of the Environmental
Management Plan, a plan was developed for the Vicente Emilio Sojo National Park for its
preservation and for preventing further occupation.

A Manual of Environmental Specifications was finalized in early 2002, for all small-scale
infrastructure construction projects to be executed in the barrios. In addition, a Plan de
Escombros was also prepared, establishing guidelines for the treatment and disposal of waste
generated during the construction process. Guidelines for the organization of community
managed solid waste collection programs and the community environmental education programs
were also prepared in June 2005, during project implementation. These programs, however, were
prepared and executed late in implementation and may have had greater impact had they been
sequenced earlier. Visits to project sites during supervision noted that solid waste frequently
clogged drainage shafts leading to periodic flooding in periods of high rainfall.

Resettlement: A resettlement and social assistance action plan for housing substitution and
rehabilitation under the Project was successfully executed in compliance with Bank standards. In
January 2006 the project initiated the preparation of Specific Resettlement Action Plans for
Petare Norte and La Vega. According to these Action Plans, the resettlement cases to be executed
under the Project were 287. After reductions in the planned number of resettlement cases due to
changes in Project scope, approximately 86% of programmed resettlement cases were executed
(see Table 3 below). Resettlement activities were executed in a participatory manner utilizing
Urban Land Committees (CTUs) constituted by local residents. The CTUs facilitate the process
of identification and consultation with families to be resettled.

As of Project closing CAMEBA successfully executed 114 cases of resettlement and was
currently processing an additional 134 cases that would be financed by local resources. In total
the 248 cases executed and under process account for approximately 86 percent of the final target
established in the 2006 resettlement action plan. Supervision mission through Project closing
noted that cases executed and in process complied with Bank guidelines and a rapid assessment
of the resettlement program in January 2006 found that residents were satisfied with the quality
and fairness of the process applied.

    2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
    (including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
    present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
    capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

    FUNDACOMUN has made adequate arrangements for post-completion and transition. In
    particular, the Government has made a commitment to continue with CAMEBA implementation
    in the short-term to ensure that existing planned and contracted investments in Petare, La Vega
    and Vargas are completed. A series of contracts for physical investments in project areas were
    initiated in the second-half of 2005 and the first-half of 2006 that could not be completed prior to
    Project closing in June 2006. The Government committed to finance these investments from 2006
    and 2007 budget allocations. An official allocation has been made for MINPADES for continued
    CAMEBA execution under the 2007 budget. This represents an important post-project
    commitment by the Borrower to implement the comprehensive investment plans in each Project
    area. A core CAMEBA technical team remains within FUNDACOMUN to carry out these
    activities.

    FUNDACOMUN and MINPADES have also engaged in discussions on the potential for
    expanding CAMEBA to other Caracas metropolitan area slums given the depth of demand for
    integrated slum improvement solutions. Transition arrangements for the operations and
    maintenance of network infrastructure and basic services financed under the Project have been
    made formally with local municipalities and utility service providers. These arrangements were
    solidified in cooperation agreements signed at the time of implementation. Local civic groups
    have also assumed responsibility for the maintenance of small-scale community infrastructure.



                                                   9

Nonetheless, certain weaknesses in the capacity for both municipalities and utilities to provide
quality O&M exist. These limitations are summarized in greater detail in Section 9.




3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

At the time of completion of the Project, the World Bank Group (WBG) did not have an approved
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) with the Government of Venezuela and the previous CAS
was discussed by the Board in April 1997. A draft Interim Strategy Note (ISN) is currently under
discussion with and outlines a framework for engagement with the Government on Projects with
poverty reduction which responded to the Venezuelan Government's request for the WBG to
reengage during FY2007­FY2008 after a period of very low level of engagement (2002­05).

At the time of the ICR, the prevailing development priorities and circumstances in the ISN were
highly relevant to the work of the Project. As stated in the draft ISN, a key development goal is
to `improve nationwide infrastructure by upgrading urban services and infrastructure, improving
roads and transportation systems'. Additionally, a key social development goal noted in the ISN
is to `create a participatory and empowered society by promoting social networks and
community-based organizations that are able to demand accountability and assume
responsibilities for national development'. In summary, at the time of the ICR, the Project
objectives had a high overall relevance in the context of the draft country engagement
framework.



3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

The Project has improved the quality of life for at least 115,000 inhabitants, representing 97.4
percent of the revised target population of Petare Norte, La Vega and Vargas (118,000 inhabitants)
and 9.6 percent of total Caracas barrio population. In particular, the PDO was partially achieved
through Project investments that: (i) increased access to water and sanitation service in target
areas; (ii) increased vehicular and pedestrian access to the barrios; (iii) facilitated access to
electricity; (iv) supported the construction community service centers; (v) enabled extensive
community participation; and (vi) facilitated access to land titles for informal residents. See
Annex 2 for further details.



3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

Economic analysis conducted for this ICR estimates that Project has had a significantly positive
overall economic impact. Overall Project ERR is estimated at 42.35 percent based on an
evaluation of changes in estimated housing unit prices and 94.11 percent based on the estimated
housing value per m². The latter measure is perhaps more appropriate given that it controls for the


                                              10

expansion of homes that may have occurred as a result of individual household investments. The
Project also demonstrates a strongly positive cost-benefit ratio based on these two measures. See
Annex 3 for greater detail.



3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Relevance: The project outcomes continue to be highly relevant for beneficiaries in Petare Norte
and La Vega in terms the improvement of quality of life through the successful implementation of
a series of investments in basic infrastructure, land titling and related social services. Slum
upgrading in Caracas still remains a high priority for the Government, as evidenced by their
commitment to commit resources for continued implementation in 2007. Additionally, the
Government has agreed to scale-up the CAMEBA experience to other key cities through the
Venezuela National Urban Upgrading Project (PISO), which is currently under preparation.

Achievement of PDOs: The Project was able to partially achieve the development objective
through both physical and social interventions that benefited a total of 115,000 beneficiaries or
approximately 97 percent of the revised number of target beneficiaries of 118,000 presented at
the time of the partial loan cancellation. However, the Project was not officially restructured at
this stage and, when measured against the original target of 184,000 beneficiaries, falls short of
completely reaching the PDO goal. Additionally, the Project did not implement planned
investments in structural drainage, trunk access infrastructure and the pilot microfinance
component that would have likely had a substantial impact on the quality of life of beneficiaries
in Project areas. The partial cancellation and inability to disburse the entire reduced loan amount
also limited the potential quality of life impacts of the Project.
Given these factors, a Moderately Satisfactory rating has been determined for achievement of
Project Development Objectives at the ICR stage.



3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development


Poverty Impacts

No formal poverty impact assessment was conducted under the Project in part due to the inability
to collect baseline data early in implementation (see Section 7.3). Nonetheless, it is estimated that
the Project did have a significant poverty impact based on proxy quantitative measures (e.g.
increase in housing values) and other variables associated with the increase in access to improved
quality basic services commonly associated with the reduction of poverty.

It has been estimated that the average increase in property values per m2 of built area, controlled
for inflation, in both Petare Norte and La Vega as a result of Project investments which was 94.11
percent between 1998 and 2006. As summarized in Section 8.3, changes in housing prices have
resulted from a combination of Project-related investments including those that facilitated the
provision of land titles, improved water and sanitation services, reduced geotechnical risk through
mitigation infrastructure, enhanced transport and access infrastructure, improved drainage and
other related service improvements leveraged through the investment. In this respect the increases



                                               11

in housing values serve as a sound proxy measure for poverty impact in the absence of income
poverty measures.

Additionally, interventions under the Project have demonstrably increased access to and the
quality of key basic services that have a clear impact on poverty conditions. In particular, the
Project resulted in improved access to water, network sanitation, roads, drainage, and public
lighting and electricity services. Urban upgrading projects in Latin America and other regions
have consistently demonstrated the positive impact that the provision of these services have on
overall quality of live and the reduction of poverty. A series of focus group discussions conducted
in the context of this ICR, FUNDACOMUN's independent evaluation of CAMEBA (June 2006)
and a Bank-led social assessment of project outcomes (January 2006) have demonstrated that
beneficiaries consistently report that the Project has had a strong overall positive impact on the
quality of life.

Gender Aspects

While the Project did not have explicit gender equity goals, it has had a significant impact on the
empowerment of women in project areas. Women have disproportionately participated in all
stages of project planning and execution through community consultations, training programs,
directly in the construction of small works, Project field staff and most significantly as
neighborhood inspectors and community organizers. Neighborhood inspectors served in the
critical role of supervising and coordinating local construction works. This critical role involved
the day to day supervision of contractors and laborers. Additionally, these inspectors served as
interlocutors between the communities and contractors, and the laborers and CAMEBA staff to: (i)
ensure that community concerns were adequately communicated to these actors; (ii) adequately
inform communities of the project execution schedule and associated disruptions in services and
inconveniences that might be experienced; and (iii) organize communities to participate in a
range of community activities including clean-up days and small-scale community projects.
Inspectors and associated community organizers also assisted CAMEBA field staff in the
coordination and execution of related implementation tasks. As an extension of these roles,
women in project areas have assumed a broader role as advocates and interlocutors with
municipalities to access related social services and to ensure that existing infrastructure is
adequately maintained.

It is important to note that women benefit disproportionately from the land titling program
implemented under the program. It is estimated that approximately 70 percent of the over 14,000
titles delivered in Petare and La Vega were provided to women ­ a function of both the high
incidence of female headed households and the relative importance of women in social and
economic processes in both barrios.

The Project demonstrates that women are key potential agents in catalyzing urban upgrading
interventions given their interest in solving community problems and participation in deep social
networks. In addition to enhancing the quality and sustainability of physical works, women's
participation has: (i) helped build community institutional capacity in project areas; (ii)
contributed to improved household livelihoods through employment generation; and (iii)
improved household well-being more broadly through women's empowerment, more equitable
decision making and improved gender roles.

Social Development

The Project has also contributed broadly to a range of positive social development outcomes. The
social mobilization sub-component of the operation implemented a wide range of social


                                               12

organization, capacity building and institutional development activities that had a direct impact
on the creation and strengthening of community based organizations (CBOs) and their members.
These institutions have proven sustainable beyond project implementation and remain involved in
a range of developmental activities. In particular, community organizations and leaders are
involved in organizing communities in ongoing maintenance work and have also assumed an
important coordination role with municipal authorities and others service providers to advocate
for improvements in service quality and the extension of new services.

The formation and capacity enhancement of Urban Land Committees (CTUs) is another
important example of how the Project facilitated the creation of strong and sustainable local
social organizations. Approximately 46 CTUs were formed in Petare and La Vega to serve
primarily as key local community actors to facilitate the land titling process. In this capacity,
CTUs and their members engaged in intensive socio-demographic information collection and
validation in association with the development of a local cadastre ­ a primary instrument to
facilitate titling. CTUs subsequently engaged in a range of administrative and coordination tasks
associated with the preparation of individual titling applications and their processing by
municipal and national authorities. Throughout the entire process, CTUs became critical change
agents and continued to operate beyond the life of the Project, both formally and informally as
advocates for new community projects and in the process of social mobilization around local
developmental issues.




(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The Project has had a considerable impact in building community institutional capacity. As noted
above, broadly representative and technically-oriented local organizations have formed under the
Project and appear sustainable beyond implementation. These types of institutional entities are
new to La Vega and Petare Norte where previous community institutions were principally
organized around short-term interests. Community organizations and the local leadership
supported under the Project are also well placed to participate in and take advantage of the current
Government policy under the Ley de Consejos Comunales which aims to direct small amounts of
public expenditure through community associations.

A key objective for the Project was to establish inter-institutional coordination mechanisms
between local communities, municipal governments and external service providers. The results in
this area were mixed. Cooperation agreements were signed with the Municipalities of Sucre and
Liberator, Miranda State, INAVI, CONAVI, HIDROCAPITAL and others which envisioned a
deep collaboration and significant institutional strengthening ­ particularly at the municipal level.
However, the intended depth of cooperation envisioned under these agreements was not realized
primarily due to conditions of political and institutional instability and transition during the early
stages of implementation.

Nonetheless, the Project made progress in establishing cooperative relationships between
community groups, the municipal governments of Sucre and Liberator and the metropolitan water
and electricity utilities (i.e. HIDROCAPITAL and Electricity of Caracas). The key areas of
cooperation with the municipalities involved cadastre development and land titling. And the
community groups, FUNDACOMUN and municipal authorities worked together closely in the
data collection, verification, cadastre development and capacity building in system maintenance



                                              13

and updating. An additional area of cooperation was the Technical Councils which were formed
to coordinate the planning and execution of physical works. Community groups have expressed
satisfaction with the quality of their representation in these forums and have used these
relationships with service providers to advocate for improvements in service quality. Nonetheless,
these Technical Councils most likely lack the sustainability beyond implementation as they were
established solely to facilitate Project implementation.


(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Positive: The Project had three principal unintended outcomes.

First, the land titling program for CAMEBA has had a significant demonstration effect within the
country and has informed the development of a national policy framework for tenure
regularization. In February 2002 a national program and legal framework for urban land titling
was created through decree and later formalized through the Law of Urban Land Titling2 in June
2006. A National Office for Land Titling (ONTT) was also established to execute a broad
national program of urban land titling. The creation of a national framework and program for
urban land titling was largely inspired by the demonstration effect of the Project titling program.
The ONTT has developed methodologies, institutional arrangements and procedures for titling
that build largely on those formalized under CAMEBA. For example, the national program
replicates the use of CTUs as the central community-based mobilization and processing entity
originally developed under CAMEBA.

Second, community members report through focus group discussions and stakeholder
consultation that the Project has had significant impact towards catalyzing economic activity in
the settlements. In particular, residents report a significant increase in household expenditure for
home improvements and expansion as a result of both improved community infrastructure and
secure title. Additionally, community representatives reported a similar increase in small-scale
capital investments by local businesses increasingly willing to invest in expanding facilities and
capacity given tenure security and improved services. In particular, local businesses reported that
increasingly secure, regular and reliable water and electricity service has improved the local
investment climate considerably. The Project monitoring and evaluation system, however, was
not designed to accommodate an empirical evaluation of these observations regarding the
improved investment climate.

Third, the Project had a much broader and critically important impact on public policy towards
slums and informal settlements. In the early years of political transition and consolidation after
1999 key Government officials were not convinced that slum upgrading and regularization were
appropriate policy responses to urban slums. Key ministerial and Government officials were
advocating for slum clearance and large-scale housing construction to address the need for
adequate housing and basic services. The Project ­ through its demonstration effect ­ served an
important role in altering attitudes within the new Government and within a few years an
approach to slum upgrading, incorporating intensive community participation and tenure
regularization, became a key policy position for dealing with urban slums. This broad policy
impact is evidenced by the fact that the Government has decided to continue financing the

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
(optional for Core ICR, required for ILI, details in annexes)

Stakeholder workshops were held on September 28, 2006 in both Petare Norte and La Vega (full
detail of the workshops can be found in Annex 6) in which the communities were interviewed to
describe the results of the Project. The summarized conclusions coming out of the workshops
were: (i) there was low community participation before the implementation of the works began
but increased with the duration of the Project; (ii) overall, resettlement was successful and
completed with satisfaction; (iii) the land titling program incorporated many barrio-dwellers into
the land market; (iv) the maintenance of works and the environment needs to be improved
through the execution of the Environmental Education Programs; (v) social capital was
successfully developed during the execution of the Project; and (vi) almost all participants in the
workshops showed satisfaction for the improvement of the quality of life after the works were
implemented by the Project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The sustainability of physical outcomes realized during the operation relies on a series of
institutional capacity, financial, technical and political factors.

The single most significant risk to the development outcome is the potential for poor or
inadequate operations and maintenance of basic services financed under the Project. The O&M
responsibility for community infrastructure and basic services rests largely with municipal
governments and utility service providers. In particular, municipalities are responsible for the
maintenance of tertiary road networks, pedestrian access, drainage and retention infrastructure
and community and recreational facilities financed under the Project. Additionally, municipalities
bear the responsibility for solid waste collection in project areas. The failure to establish an
adequate solid waste collection system in project areas would have a considerable negative
impact on the working lifespan of roads, drainage and related pedestrian access and community
infrastructure. Similarly, water and sanitation service provision remains the responsibility of
HIDROCAPITAL ­ although constitutionally this responsibility is due to be decentralized to
municipal governments ­ and electricity service provision falls to Electricity of Caracas.

A fundamental obstacle to adequate O&M is the lack of a cost recovery culture for basic services,
particularly in low-income areas. The Government, for example, has frozen water tariffs over the
last few years at levels far below operating costs. Municipalities either lack the ability or
willingness to charge and collect maintenance-related fees or taxes in low-income areas that
would generate sufficient revenue to finance O&M. As a result both utilities and municipalities
rely on central government transfers to finance operating costs. These transfers, while currently
robust due to oil revenue windfalls, have proven historically volatile. A continued resistance to
achieve full cost-recovery for basic services could lead to inadequate O&M and the deterioration
of physical investments financed under the Project. More broadly, macroeconomic shocks related




                                                15

to oil revenues ­ while not anticipated in the short- to medium-term ­ would also negatively
impact the capacity of the central government to subsidize O&M costs.

Independent of financing constraints, the operations, maintenance and commercial management
capacity of municipal and, to a lesser extent, utilities is often weak. This is coupled be the fact
that municipalities have suffered a general political neglect in recent years resulting in a rollback
in technical assistance and capacity building programs that could have a positive impact on the
sustainability of service quality. Additionally, constitutionally mandated decentralization of basic
services and associated capacity building programs have also stalled in recent years. Basic service
sectors require an infusion of investment in improved management, commercial and technical
practices. This is happening to a degree in certain relatively well financed utilities, e.g. water, but
not at the municipal level. The inability to make significant improvements in the management of
basic services in the short- and medium-term could also have a negative impact on Project
investments.



5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Satisfactory


The Bank's performance in the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the Project is rated
Satisfactory. The Project was well designed at entry addressing key technical, social, economic,
financial, institutional and safeguards-related issues.

Primarily, the Project was well conceived in the context of the Government's overall sector
approach to service provision in low-income areas. At the time of preparation the Government
was moving towards increased decentralization to municipalities in basic service provision. In
parallel, the Government sought to integrate urban informal settlements into the physical and
social fabric of `formal' urban areas through investments informed by a hierarchy of strategic
investment plans at the metropolitan (Sectoral Plan), sub-metropolitan (UPF ­ Physical Planning
Units) and local (UDU - Urban Design Units) levels. The Project reflects this approach to service
provision to the urban poor by integrating a more intensive collaboration with municipalities in
subproject planning and implementation as well as linking proposed investments to the integrated
planning framework.

The Bank team adequately reflected lessons learned from past interventions into Project design.
In particular, the previous Bank-financed PROMUEBA operation supported a series of minor
infrastructure works in a range of barrios throughout the country. While evaluated favorably, the
PROMUEBA ICR recommended that future operations in the sector would need to take on a
more integrated approach to investment planning and implementation ­ covering a range of
different services and activities in the same barrio in order to achieve a visible impact. The
Project did in fact adequately reflect this lesson in design through the use of an integrated
investment planning framework described above.

The quality of Bank performance in technical preparation was highly satisfactory. The Project


                                               16

conducted a detailed assessment of eligible areas under the Sectoral Plan, identifying Petare and
La Vega as eligible areas based on an evaluation of objective needs-based and willingness
criteria. The team collected detailed data on access levels and quality of service for water,
sanitation, roads and related services. Based on this detailed assessment, preliminary integrated
investment plans at both the UPF and UDU levels were formulated for potable water, roads,
sewerage, and drainage and risk mitigation infrastructure.

While technically well prepared, these investment plans reflected at the time a new and highly
ambitious approach to slum upgrading ­ never previously attempted in Venezuela. The objective
of financing a comprehensive slum upgrading methodology focused on the physical integration
of slum areas into the formal urban fabric required significant resettlement and extensive
institutional coordination with utility service providers and municipalities. The scale of
resettlement was estimated at between 6 to 9 percent of families in the Project areas at cost of
US$ 27.1m. This involved a massive resettlement program that FUNDACOMUN had not
previously demonstrated a capacity to manage. Similarly, other aspects of Project design were
considered highly ambitious, new and innovative including the land titling subcomponent and the
housing improvement or microfinance component.

The Project design was highly ambitious, demanding a fair amount of institutional capacity
within FUNDACOMUN and intra-institutional coordination across agencies and municipalities
on a range of innovative Project components. At the time of preparation the CAMEBA operation
was considered one of the largest single urban upgrading projects in Latin America with potential
beneficiaries conservatively estimated at 184,000. The Bank team may also have overestimated
the ability of FUNDACOMUN to build and sustain this level of institutional capacity. Given the
need for substantial institutional capacity at the municipal level, the team may also have
considered a more robust Municipal Capacity Building subcomponent under Component 2 ­
Institutional Development. The subcomponent accounted for only US$ 0.8m of an approximate
total US$15.0m under the component. A greater emphasis on municipal capacity building could
have led to enhanced municipal involvement in Project implementation and future operations and
maintenance. Conversely, barring the political and institutional disruptions and challenges faced
during the implementation period, it is possible that the Bank team could have facilitated the
required capacity enhancement given that overall FUNDACOMUN management and operational
performance was assessed as satisfactory under PROMUEBA.

A detailed social assessment was conducted during preparation and a social outreach plan was
developed to ensure that Project design and implementation would adequately reflect community
priorities and respond to evolving or changing community needs. This approach to participation
and social mobilization could be considered best practice at the time of preparation and this
emphasis on community engagement translated into high levels of participation once
implementation got underway.

Other aspects of Project preparation also reflected high technical standards. In particular, the
Project land titling and resettlement components were comprehensively designed. The Project
also outlined clear and detailed implementation schedule for key investments and management
activities. A comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework was also developed with a
land market monitoring system that should be considered best practice at the time of preparation.
Nonetheless, greater investment might have been made during preparation on `installing' this
M&E framework prior to effectiveness as lessons from PROMUEBA suggest that
FUNDACOMUN did not adequately develop an effective and regular monitoring and evaluation
system given the institutional orientation towards execution of works on the former project.



                                              17

A key consideration of this ICR was to assess whether the team adequately identified risks and
outlined sufficient mitigation measures. This is particularly relevant in the context of the
complicated political transition and corresponding institutional instability that took place over the
first three years of implementation. It was not possible for the team to anticipate the extent of the
institutional instability that arose as a result of the election year politics at the time of preparation.
Interestingly, FUNDACOMUN had proven resilient under PROMUEBA to macroeconomic
instability linked to falling oil process and a collapse in the banking sector in the early 1990s.
This ability to sustain strong performance would have created at the time of CAMEBA
preparation a legitimate perception that FUNDACOMUN could withstand another macro-
economic or macro-political crisis. Moreover, given that this instability stemmed from macro-
political factors, it is highly unlikely that mitigating action at the level of the Project could have
had a substantial impact on outcomes.




(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


The Bank's performance during the implementation of the Project is rated Moderately
Satisfactory despite the highly complex and challenging operating environment (see 6.2 and 7.2
for further detail). The Bank committed sufficient budget and staff resources, and the Project was
adequately supervised from the Head Office with important assistance in ongoing monitoring and
client coordination provided from the Caracas Country Office. In over six and a half years of
project implementation, there were approximately 16 supervision missions. The Bank fielded as
many as three missions in years where implementation progress was inadequate.3 Given the
prevailing environment of slow disbursement, management and technical team turnover and
general institutional instability, however, supervision missions frequently took on a trouble-
shooting character in which investment plans and disbursement targets were revised and
projected into the future.

Successive missions dealt with and observed deteriorating managerial and technical capacity
given the extremely high turnover in management and staff positions. The Project over a seven
year period had to deal with four changes of Ministries, seven Ministers, seven different
Presidents of FUNDACOMUN, thirteen General Managers of CAMEBA, seven Technical
Managers and 10 and 12 operational managers in La Vega and Petare Norte respectively. This
amount of turnover was crippling during implementation. As a result, missions expended
considerable time re-establishing relationships and providing orientation to newly appointed
ministers, managers and technical staff.

It is unclear whether the Bank team could have managed its client relationship differently to
mitigate this institutional instability. These problems of high turnover and institutional instability
were not unique to the Project. A joint Bank-Government portfolio review conducted in June


3 It is important to note that the PAD identifies the need for four missions per year in the first two years of
implementation given the complexity of the Project. In 2000 and 2001, effectively the first two years of
implementation, the Bank fielded only two missions per year. Increased supervision attention during this
period may have helped address problems in implementation that arose. However, it is not clear whether
the client was in a position to adequately attend to more Bank missions.


                                                    18

2004 identified high turnover and political instability as negative factors affecting the quality of
implementation of the entire portfolio. Nonetheless, consideration might have been given to
establishing HR-related targets for terms of service and training before authorizing further
disbursements. Bank supervision records do not indicate a consideration of the use of
management performance-oriented targets for future disbursements. It is not clear, however,
whether such a strategy would not have led to further complications in an already delicate Bank-
client relationship during the period.

The reactive focus of these missions also left little opportunity to advance on technical issues and
the development of management systems originally planned during preparation. For example,
key elements of the M&E system were never implemented. The system aimed to conduct
periodic social assessments, land market studies and `quality impact monitoring' on a regular
basis but these instruments were never developed or used. SIGMA, the Project management
information system, was also never effectively used during implementation due to a series of
capacity and system-specific constraints. This did not occur and Bank supervision ­ focused
more on short-term trouble-shooting ­ did not appear to raise M&E system development issues
on a consistent basis. Similarly, as early as 2001, Bank supervision noted the need for a new
approach to the housing microfinance component. The new Government had expressed its
concern that the original model for the component involving a guarantee facility that was not
consistent with its priorities. It was agreed at the time that a study on possible design alternatives
would be conducted. However, this study was only completed in early 2006 as an input for future
potential operations and obviously not useful for a redesign of the Project component. The need
for environmental education plans and a solid waste management strategy was also identified but
these instruments were either not developed or delayed until very late in implementation.

As Project activities began in earnest in late 2000, over two years after appraisal in late 1998, the
focus of the client was on smaller, quick implementing and emergency response infrastructure
investments as a means to demonstrate both to beneficiaries and representatives within the
Government that the Project was having an impact. Bank supervision records suggest a
progressive concern over 2001 and 2002 regarding the lack of integrated infrastructure
investments. However, UDU plans ­ which would have outlined a series of structural
infrastructure investments ­ were not complete until late 2001. Nonetheless, the Bank continued
to authorize this approach and focused during these missions on developing quicker-disbursing
short-term investment plans.

It is unlikely, however, that Bank supervision could have pushed for greater investment in
structural infrastructure given the limited and deteriorating capacity within FUNDACOMUN
during the early years of implementation and the fact that the Government expressed over time a
declining appetite for larger, more disruptive infrastructure investment in slum areas that would
result in significant resettlement. Greater consideration might have been given to a rapid redesign
and formal restructuring of the Project and its operating procedures to formalize what in the end
amounted to ad-hoc strategic changes. This could have taken place around the mid-term review
in 2002 or at the time of the partial loan cancellation in 2004. No significant indication in
supervision documentation, however, exists that such an approach was considered. For example,
the Project Operations Manual was not updated during implementation despite the significant
Project design changes that occurred over this period and a formal consideration of the option to
`restructure' does not appear in supervision documentation.

It is important to note that the Bank supervision was not able to consistently provide: (i) accurate
disbursement targets; (ii) a definitive assessment of the factors associated with poor disbursement
performance; and (iii) successful mitigation and corrective measures to meet targets in


                                                19

subsequent periods. Successive supervision missions outline ambitious disbursement targets
suggesting in each case that conditions were conducive to this achievement. In later years these
targets were used as the basis for extension requests. These targets, however, were rarely met. In
2001, arguably a year of improved project management, the client only disbursed US$1.28m of
US$10.54m in new works and consultant contracts. A March 2003 Bank supervision mission
concluded that only 30 percent of the 2002 disbursement target was met. Projections over 2004
and 2005 made by Bank mission all estimated that the Government would be able to use the
entire revised loan amount of US$35.7m prior to closing. Nonetheless, at Project closing in June
2006, approximately 18 percent of this amount remained undisbursed.

Throughout     implementation,      the   World    Bank  supervision    missions   over-estimated
FUNDACOMUN's implementation capacity. Arguably the fundamental factors associated with
these delays were beyond the control of the Bank team and stemmed from institutional and
managerial instability and diminishing executing capacity. Nonetheless, a range of factors for
slow disbursement identified during implementation did present actionable solutions. For
example, such factors included: (i) delays in the completion of UDU designs and plans; (ii) small
size of bid packages; (iii) over-emphasis on smaller works and consultant contracts at the expense
of structural packages; (iv) inefficient inspectors; (v) delays in preparation of disbursement
requests; (vi) poor cost estimates resulting in overbidding and cancelled procurement processes;
(vii) internal inefficiency within FUNDACOMUN in evaluating and approving procurement
process; amongst other factors.

In hindsight it is difficult to assess what the Bank team could have done better to expedite
disbursements. However, the Project ­ particularly by late 2002 and 2003 ­ would have
warranted an extraordinary and rigorous effort to evaluate and correct disbursement bottlenecks.
This did not happen. A partial explanation does rest on the fact that during this same period,
through to mid-2004, CAMEBA experienced a series of management changes involving the
appointment of over eight permanent or acting General Managers. It was not until mid-2004
when the management rotations ceased and the Project entered its second period of relative
stability.

It is important to note that throughout implementation the Bank team did demonstrate patience,
flexibility and innovativeness in responding to client needs in a difficult environment. The team
worked with the client to structure six amendments including a significant partial cancellation
and reallocation, two extensions and increases in Bank financing percentages. The Bank
responded quickly to the landslides in Vargas by investing in rehabilitation infrastructure in the
affected areas of La Guaira under the Project. Stronger Bank performance in implementation
predictably coincided with the two periods of relative institutional stability within
FUNDACOMUN ­ October 2000 to October 2002 and July 2004 to June 2006. In this later
period the team worked closely with the client to consolidate gains in: (i) community
infrastructure investments; (ii) structural drainage infrastructure downstream from Petare; (iii)
titling and resettlement; and (iv) social mobilization.




(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


Overall Bank performance was Moderately Satisfactory during project preparation, appraisal,



                                               20

and implementation. As outlined above, Project was prepared to high technical standards with
leading and innovative practice incorporated into the design. The Project design - focusing on
integrated investments, titling and high levels of social mobilization - was an innovation for
Venezuela and these design elements have had a lasting impact on informing broader
Government policy despite a non-conducive environment. The team continued to work
constructively with changing ministerial, agency and Project level counterparts facilitating
complex amendments and emergency reconstruction investments in Vargas. More broadly, and
despite instability, the Bank team was able to create and sustain a constituency within the
Government that believed in integrated urban upgrading as a strategy for improving living
conditions in slum areas. The Government has asked the Bank to lead in the design and financing
of a national upgrading program (PISO) addressing informal settlements, building on successful
elements of CAMEBA. Nonetheless, important weaknesses in the quality of Bank supervision
during implementation were also noted including: (i) the lack of consistent focus on management
and information systems; (ii) the inability to focus attention on the implementation of the M&E
system; (iii) consistently appraising inaccurate disbursement targets; (iv) inaccurate assessments
of FUNDACOMUN ability to meet these targets; amongst other factors outlined above.



5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Government performance in preparation and supervision is rated as Moderately Satisfactory,
characterized by contrasting periods of poor and relatively strong performance. The single largest
factor affecting the quality of Government performance relates to institutional instability at the
ministerial and senior FUNDACOMUN management levels. As noted above, the Project
experienced four changes in ministerial assignments, seven different ministers and seven
presidents of FUNDACOMUN. These ministerial and management changes had an obvious
impact on the high turnover in CAMEBA PMU management and technical staff experienced
throughout the Project. It is without question that this institutional instability had a negative
impact on overall Project implementation ­ resulting in a partial cancellation and the inability to
achieve full disbursement of the reduced loan amount.

It is important to note that this environment of institutional instability was not unique to the
Project and reflected a broader series of macro-political and macroeconomic developments. This
environment did correlate with high turnover throughout the public sector and also made it
difficult to recruit individuals with strong technical and managerial skills.    Nonetheless, the
Government bears the responsibility for being unable to better insulate the Project from political
and institutional instability. Fewer and smoother ministerial rotations could have been facilitated
and increased stability at the level of the FUNDACOMUN president over the life of the Project
would likely have resulted in improved Project performance. It is no coincidence that the periods
of strong Project performance (October 2000 ­ October 2002 and August 2004 ­ June 2006) are
associated with stability in Ministers, presidents of FUNDACOMUN and general managers of
CAMEBA.

Nonetheless, it is important to note that the Project received excellent support and coordination
from technical staff within the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Housing and Habitat and Social
Participation and Development throughout the implementation cycle and particularly in periods
of stronger Project performance. These officials were closely engaged in discussions regarding



                                              21

disbursement bottlenecks, extensions and the partial loan cancellation. These officials were also
critical in communicating the potential benefits of the Project more broadly within the
Government throughout the implementation cycle ­ and particularly in 1999 and 2000 when the
Government expressed tepid support for the operation.




(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Project implementing agency was FUNDACOMUN. A PMU within FUNDACOUM was
established to manage the CAMEBA operation. Implementing agency performance is rated as
Moderately Satisfactory, similarly characterized by periods of strong and weak performance.
The implementing agency and technical staff within the CAMEBA PMU exhibited exemplary
performance in a difficult political, macroeconomic and institutional environment. Despite these
challenges the agency was able to make important advances in a number of key areas including: (i)
social mobilization; (ii) land titling and resettlement; (iii) basic services and community
infrastructure; and (iv) emergency reconstruction. These areas are discussed in greater detail in
sections 5.1 ­ 5.5 and Annex 2 in this document.

A few aspects of implementing agency performance require further consideration. First, the
quality of the CAMEBA PMUs social mobilization and community outreach activities were
exceptional. The project evolved an approach to community mobilization and participation that
was new to Venezuela and enabled an observable empowerment of local leaders and residents as
well as a degree of social integration of communities in the broader municipal fabric. Second, the
implementing agency facilitated an exceptional land titling program. The program was extremely
well managed and also evolved an innovative, community-based approach to titling. Third,
despite numerous institutional challenges, the implementing agency was able to deliver improved
quality basic services to over 115,000 slum residents. This is a significant feat in the prevailing
environment.

Nonetheless, certain areas of implementing agency performance require further attention in order
to generate lessons for the improved performance of public sector upgrading programs.
Institutional instability within FUNDACOMUN was the single most important factor that
negatively influenced the quality of the implementing agency's performance. As noted above, the
fundamental responsibility for this instability, associated with high rates of staff turnover and the
weakening of capacity, rests with the Government and can be traced to the multiple changes in
ministerial assignments for the Project, reporting Ministers and Presidents of FUNDACOMUN.
Nonetheless, FUNDACOMUN management did contribute to or enable this environment of
instability by appointing thirteen permanent or interim General Managers of CAMEBA, seven
Technical Managers and 10 and 12 operational managers in La Vega and Petare Norte
respectively. Again, the inability to facilitate greater stability within the agency and PMU was a
significant shortcoming in borrower performance. This high turnover, and the associated inability
to maintain quality and capacity standards, had a general negative impact on implementing
agency performance and can be traced to three key areas of suboptimal performance and
outcomes.

First, the implementing agency was consistently unable to meet disbursement targets ­ resulting
in a partial cancellation and the lack of full disbursement of the adjusted loan amount despite two
years of extensions. A range of exogenous and endogenous explanatory factors were identified
throughout implementation for this slow pace of disbursement. Importantly, even in periods of


                                                22

relative management stability within FUNDACOMUN and CAMEBA, disbursement rarely met
targets. The implementing agency might have focused more attention on resolving bottlenecks
that were within their control. These included: (i) significant delays in approvals of contracts by
the President of FUNDACOMUN; (ii) facilitating improved bid evaluation capacity and
knowledge of Bank procedures amongst the external evaluation committee; (iii) delays in the
delivery of inspector reports; (iv) inaccuracy in contract cost estimates that led to the cancellation
of procurement processes; (v) the lack of a management-oriented focus on reducing the overall
contracting time, which far exceeded the estimated 90-100 days; and (vi) lack of accuracy or
realism in disbursement projections and investment planning. It is important to note that over the
last two years of implementation the Project noted a significant improvement in disbursements.
While still short of ambitious targets of between US$800,000 to US1.0m per month, average
annual disbursements were higher than any other period of Project implementation. A key factor
in this turnaround was the improved management focus at the level of FUNDACOMUN and the
CAMEBA PMU at eliminating procurement-related bottlenecks, identifying and contracting
larger subprojects, better cost-estimates and other relevant factors.

Second, the implementing agency was unable to build adequate management systems. The most
significant areas of inadequate performance were in the inability to: (i) put in place and use in a
sustainable manner a Project information system (SIGMA) for the management of financial and
operational data; (ii) develop and utilize a systematic monitoring and evaluation framework; and
(iii) maintain an accurate and updated operations manual. These issues are discussed in greater
detail in sections 4.3 and 7.1 above. It is again important to note that over the last two years of
Project implementation the CAMEBA PMU and FUNDACOMUN did make a remarkable effort
to address these areas of weaknesses in management systems. While SIGMA was ultimately not
used, the Bank noted an improvement financial and operational reporting as compared to previous
reporting. An independent end-project evaluation was conducted and has provided important
lessons for the development of future upgrading programs. The ability and time to invest in
management systems by this stage in the Project cycle as the operation was focused
disproportionately on maximizing disbursements in advance of the pending closing dates ­ first
extended top June 30, 2005 and later to June 30, 2006.

Third, the quality and scope of certain key technical activities originally planned under the
operation were not adequately achieved. Sections 4.2, 5.2, 5.4 and Annex 2 provide greater detail
on these areas. In particular, the implementing agency was unable to: (i) realize significant
investments in structural infrastructure that would have achieved the physical integration
originally envisioned under implementation; (ii) implement or redesign component three on
housing microfinance; (iii) integrate work on solid waste management or environmental
education into project activities4; and (iv) develop a substantial municipal capacity building
program beyond the development of cadastres. The inability of the client to address these issues
relates obviously to changing and more immediate priorities that emerged during implementation.
Nonetheless, a greater managerial attention and focus on such factors ­ particularly in periods of
increased stability ­ might have resulted in improved project outcomes.



(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



4 Environmental education campaigns were developed only very late in implementation (late-2005 and
early-2006) and piloted in Project areas.


                                               23

Overall Borrower performance was considered Moderately Satisfactory. The most significant
negative factor influencing this rating was the environment of institutional instability to which
both the Government and FUNDACOMUN contributed. This instability had a wide-ranging
impact on the capacity of staff, the inability to build managerial systems and advance in technical
areas originally envisioned under the Project. This instability was also the primary cause for the
partial loan cancellation. Nonetheless, significant success can also be claimed by the Borrower.
As outlined above, the Borrower ultimately implemented a participatory approach to slum
upgrading that was entirely new for Venezuela and is being shared globally now as a best practice.
The Borrower also implemented at scale a successful, complex and innovative approach to land
titling that has achieved acclaim regionally and served as a model for a national program on urban
land titling.




6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Key lessons learned with respect to the Project include:

Social mobilization and community participation are keys to success in upgrading. The Project
demonstrates and reinforces the importance of strong community engagement to the success of
urban upgrading interventions. This finding is consistent with regional and global practice in the
sector. CAMEBA presents a particularly robust example of community engagement in Project
planning, the monitoring and supervision of works and other technical areas like the development
of a municipal cadastre and the land titling program. Active community participation required an
intensive and sustained effort by the CAMEBA PMU throughout the project cycle. This
investment was instrumental to the success of the operation. The Project also illustrates the
limitations of community participation ­ particularly in the area of operation and maintenance of
basic infrastructure where increased municipal engagement is critically required.

Women can serve as catalytic social agents in community infrastructure projects. The Project
represents a poignant example of the catalytic role that women can play in community
mobilization. Women were the Project's principal local partners ­ leading mobilization and
community education activities. In many cases, this social organization activity built on existing
informal social networks maintained and cultivated largely by women. They were also critical
agents in supervising contractors and small works projects, implementing the titling program and
engaging with external actors to advocate for improved services. In summary, the intensive
engagement of female community activists conferred credibility to the Project and enhanced the
likelihood of success.

Land titling can have a broad positive impact in the context of upgrading programs. The Project
provides preliminary evidence to suggest that a well designed land titling program can catalyze
investment in housing and local businesses. No formal or rigorous evaluation was conducted to
determine empirically the scope of this investment. However, strong anecdotal evidence from
focus group discussions confirms this increased investment. The titling program also was a
significant `selling' factor for the Project, motivating communities to participate actively in
design and implementation. Lastly, the involvement of local residents in CTUs has spilled over
into other areas. CTU members ­ having secured titles ­ are working to maintain cadastral

information, advocate for improved services and design and implement their own community-
based projects.

Overcoming political and institutional instability is difficult ­ but patience can pay off. The
Project experienced a level of political and institutional instability that could not have been
anticipated. It is difficult to imagine that the Project could have mitigated the adverse outcomes
associated with this instability. Nonetheless, the Project demonstrates that patience and flexibility
with the client during supervision can create opportunities for success even in the most difficult
of conditions. The Bank team worked with FUNDACOMUN and the CAMEBA PMU to amend
and restructure the Project on multiple occasions. This flexibility and patience created the space
for the Project to: (i) continue implementation of an innovative approach to integrated upgrading
that would have a broad impact on Government policy to urban informal settlements; (ii) respond
to emergency conditions in Vargas state; (iii) implement a land titling program at scale that would
have a significant demonstration impact and inform a national policy framework urban titling;
and (iv) achieve significant physical results in target areas through the improvement of basic
services.

Working with municipalities is critical, no matter how difficult. The Project demonstrates the
importance, particularly in the context of urban basic services projects, of involving
municipalities despite inherent capacity, fiscal and political constraints. Projects of this nature
should aim to incorporate flexible, adaptable and sufficiently robust windows for engagement
with municipalities designed to create the appropriate incentives for municipal involvement.
Technical assistance windows should be conceived broadly enough around the theme of basic
service provision to respond to a range of needs. Additionally, these `windows' may not simply
be limited to technical assistance activities, but perhaps could be expanded to include strategic
infrastructure investments.

Caution is required when planning for large, structural upgrading investments. The Project
initially anticipated a significant investment in structural infrastructure works (i.e. roads and
drainage) with the objective of physically integrating slum areas into the formal urban landscape.
This approach would have also required significant resettlement and compensation. However, the
Project ultimately financed a greater proportion of tertiary or community-level infrastructure.
Significant road-widening did not take place and major drainage investments which would have
required resettlement in large numbers also did not take place. A key factor in the altered
investment strategy was the lack of institutional and managerial stability within CAMEBA and
FUNDACOMUN to enable the preparation, contracting and implementation of these structural
investments. It is also worth mentioning that the community-based nature of upgrading projects
makes disruptive, structural infrastructure investments difficult to implement. That is to say that
the very factor which makes such projects a success ­ community participation ­ also makes it
difficult to build consensus for structural infrastructure investments. Communities long-excluded
from public investments in basic services are distrustful of large-scale public infrastructure
investments and prefer incremental, community-based solutions that least disrupt existing social
and economic networks.

This is not to say that structural investments are impossible in such conditions. These investments,
however, are more feasible when they follow a series of community-based interventions that have
built local confidence and trust. Such `leading' community infrastructure investments would have
affirmed for communities public sector willingness to: (i) engage beneficiaries in earnest and in a
nontraditional manner; and (ii) adequately compensate individuals for losses to property and
assets. The Project ­ reacting to short windows of opportunity to implement the investment
program ­ perhaps never had an opportunity to complete this chain of `leading' and `structural'


                                                25

investments. In summary, Project design might have better anticipated the challenges of
launching a complex and ambitious upgrading program with significant structural infrastructure
investments in an environment of limited confidence in the public sector and the lack of proven
investment programs of a similar nature in the country.

Sustain effort to build management and M&E systems. The Project did not sustain a commitment
to developing key management and M&E systems. Initial investment in a MIS was lost in part
due to staff turnover and related difficulties in institutionalizing the system. The planned M&E
framework was not put in place and operating procedures were not updated as the Project was
restructured. The quality of fiduciary management suffered as a result. Periodic financial
management and procurement supervision concluded a weakening reporting and record
management capacity in these areas. These outcomes were largely a result of the prevailing
environment of institutional instability, high staff turnover and a disproportionate focus on
demonstrating immediate gains and responding to emergency reconstruction needs. Nonetheless,
the Bank team could have focused more supervision attention on the development and
strengthening of management systems. The team might have supported the client more closely
with technical assistance in the strengthening of these systems and maintained a focus on
supervising progress in successive missions.

Build and cultivate local capacity. A key factor that explains the ultimate success of the Project
was a cohort of highly capable and committed PMU staff. CAMEBA ­ particularly during the
two phases of relative institutional stability - was able cultivate a cohort of field and technical
staff that demonstrated enormous commitment to Project success. These staff worked closely
with communities and developed critically important social relationships with beneficiaries.
Operations of this nature in particular should recognize the critical importance of field and
technical staff and build in a series of measures to facilitate their access to learning opportunities,
career development and capacity enhancement.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Urban Upgrading

This component financed the design and execution of the communities' Neighborhood
Improvement Plans (NIP) for the areas of La Vega and Petare Norte. Costs included the
design and execution of pedestrian and vehicular access; water distribution; sewerage and
sanitation; drainage, electricity distribution; public lighting; community centers and
construction of new housing for resettlement cases. It also covered the costs of
community outreach, Social Assistance Outreach and environmental education programs
associated with the development of the NIPs, and the legal and administrative costs
associated with land titling. The subcomponents included:

Sub-component 1.1: Direct physical investments

Initial Objectives: The physical investments were of two types: works which integrated
and improved general conditions of the UPF, and those whose benefits were more
localized, corresponding to the UDU level.

UPF Level Works:
        · Principal Accesses with the objective of minimizing the time and distance
           required, on average, to reach a vehicular street and allowing for adequate
           transit by public transport, solid waste collection, and other services, and to
           guarantee adequate space for the installation of sewerage and drainage
           infrastructure.
        · Potable Water: Investments in primary network infrastructure including
           construction or rehabilitation of pumping stations, transmission pipes and
           storage and compensation tanks.
        · Sewerage: Investments at the UPF level in sewerage were minimal and were
           concentrated in Petare Norte. They included the rehabilitation and
           construction of principal collectors, including standard systems and special
           collectors for wastewater required in areas of steep hillsides.
        · Geotechnical Risk Mitigation: Works include the stabilization of hillsides in
           order to minimize possibilities of disaster due to geotechnical risk.
        · Resettlement Housing: Resettlement of 6.9 % of families was required for
           geotechnical risk reasons and to allow for the execution of works, principally
           the widening and extension of roadways and new access road construction.

UDU Level Works:
        · Secondary Vehicular and Pedestrian Access including new construction and
           improvement of existing internal UDU vehicular and pedestrian access, areas
           for parking. New surface drainage, compatible with the new accesses was also
           included in these works.
        · Additional drainage. This was necessary in areas where the surface drainage
           could not be carried out. Also included is bank stabilization in natural
           drainage areas.




                                          28

       · Local Water Distribution Network which included the construction and
           improvement of local water distribution networks and household connections.
       · Local Sewerage. This was necessary to service areas that could not be reached
           by the primary drainage system.
       · Public Lighting and Electricity. This included increasing the amount of public
           lighting and improvement of the low tension distribution system to the
           household connections.
       · Community Service Centers. This included the implementation of community
           services centers in each of the Project UDUs to accommodate social activities
           in the barrios.

Revised Targets: The PAD did not establish quantitative targets for physical works, they
were left to the preparation of UDU Plans. The PAD but focused on all the barrios in
Petare Norte (102,071 inhabitants) and 6 barrios in La Vega (El Carmen, Vista Hermosa,
Los Naranjos, Los Paraparos, Los Cangilones and San Miguel) with a population of
57,021 inhabitants. Due to the relatively low population densities of Los Mangos and Los
Torres, physical investments in these areas were not justified on cost-benefit and
economic grounds). The targets areas for physical works established in the PAD are
shown in the following table:

Following the emergency situation brought about by the December 1999 floods in La
Guaira in Vargas State two additional agglomerates were added to the Project: La Guaira



                                            29

­ UPF 6 with five barrios: (La Cabrería; Guarataro; Guanape; Punta de Mulatos and
Muchinga) and Catia La Mar with 4 barrios (La Lucha; Mirabal; Via Eterna and Ezequiel
Zamora) with an approximate population of 90,000 inhabitants.

During the Preparation of NIP Plans (or UDU Plans) the Barrio San Miguel (in La Vega)
was excluded from the project and Los Mangos and Los Torres were included according
to the decisions made jointly with local municipalities. For the Vargas State 3 UDUs of
La Guaira were included in the Project (La Cabrería; Guanape and Punta de Mulatos)
with a total approximate population of 25,000 inhabitants. All the barrios of the UPF
Catia La Mar were excluded. Thus, according to the UDU Plans, the beneficiaries of the
Project increased approximately to 197,000 subdivided as follows:

            o Petare Norte: 102,071 Inhabitants        (with 20,013 Families and 18,194
                Housing Units);
            o La Vega: 69,804 Inhabitants (with 13,986 families and 12,634 Housing
                Units);
            o La Guaira (Vargas): 25,000 Inhabitants (no data regarding families and
                housing units were available).

The preparation of the UDU and UPF plans was originally intended to be financed by the
Bank loan but due to a problem with procurement of consultant services, they were
financed using counterpart funds. Even still, civil works projects did not begin until the
second half of 2001. These works were predominantly small-scale, isolated interventions
(ODI) that were intended to garner community support and to build credibility within the
community for the project. As a result, a total of 19 small-scale works were constructed
by mid-2001 benefiting a total of 700 families. By the end of 2001, the Project refocused
the works to larger, integrated works projects that are consistent with the design of the
project.

The quantities established by this new approach within the UDU plans led to
programming a substantial amount of physical work. The new framework was taken as a
baseline for Project evaluation by the Mid Term Review in June 2002 as shown in the
following table:

In this same period, three large resettlement projects went through the bidding process
but were not carried out due to the high cost of the bids, which greatly exceeded cost
estimates.

The target beneficiaries were reduced by the partial loan cancellation in 2004 by 40%
amounting to a total population of approximately 118,000 inhabitants (61,200 in Petare
Norte, 41,900 in La Vega and 15,000 in La Guaira). This final figure corresponds to 9.8%
of the barrio population in Caracas (1.2 million according to the 1990 census) with a
reduction of 5.2 percentage points compared to the original PDO.

The loan reduction also had an impact on the amount of physical works. Estimations of
the reductions are 32.6% for Petare Norte and 66.7% for La Vega and more detail is
given in the following table which constitutes the baseline.

Results of the Physical Investments Sub-Component: If compared to the target quantities
determined by the Loan reduction (March 2004) the Project has reached the following
results by 30th June 2006:

             o 1,630 meters of primary access roads representing 20.32% of the
                  revised target (25.56% if we consider the additional 420 meters under
                  execution at the end of June 2006)
             o 14,353 meters of secondary access roads and pedestrian paths
                  representing 50.32% of the revised target                        (64.31% considering the
                  additional 3,945 meters under execution)
             o 12,696 meters of additional drainage representing 56.90% of the revised
                  target (83.31% considering the additional 5,892 meters under execution)
             o 5,727 meters of water distribution pipelines representing 31.0% of
                  revised target (42.99% considering the additional 2,215 meters under
                  execution)
             o 12,147 meters of sewerage network representing the 59.82% of the
                  revised target (81.52% considering the additional 4,351 meters under
                  execution)
             o 27,004 sq. meters of risk mitigation representing 46.54% of the revised
                  target (53.61% considering the additional 4,099 sq. meters under execution)
             o 2,280 meters of power lines representing 1,193.16% of the revised target
                  (1,245.49% considering the additional 100 meters under execution)
             o 1,600 sq. meters of community service centers representing 44.43% of
                  the revised target (49.43% considering the additional 180 metres under
                  execution)
             o 5,251 sq. meters of community spaces created

The evaluation of this Project has shown weaknesses in coordination with municipalities
and the Project operational and financial management caused by institutional instability
during implementation. Future concerns include:

      · The sustainability of the investments is in question due to a lack of meaningful
         participation on the part of local governments. Greater emphasis has been put on
         the role of the communities but at the expense of the engagement with the local
         government, which is essential for long-term sustainability.
      · Solid waste management has become an increasing problem in the city as a
         whole, but in the barrios in particular. The problem warrants close attention,
         especially as the problem impacts the effectiveness of drainage works and
         hillside stability (especially in La Vega).

Sub-component 1.2 Social Assistance Outreach

Initial Objectives: Community participation was central to the execution of the Project. It
was an essential pre-condition to the successful undertaking of the proposed
neighborhood improvement programs, which in turn was necessary in order to integrate
the barrios into the formal fabric of the city. It was a combination of processes oriented
at incorporating the communities into the urbanization process, in all its phases
(preparation, negotiation, approval an implementation). The sub-component included:




                                            37

      · Design and systematization of a community outreach program previous to
           engaging the community in the design of local improvement programs
      · Development of a process for engaging the community and initiating the
           process of information sharing about the objectives of the Project
      · Supporting and providing technical assistance to the community, so that it can
           effectively participate in the process of formulation and negotiation of
           neighborhood upgrading projects and resettlement plans
      · Providing capacity building to the community so that it can organize and
           maintain a functioning co-management group to lead the process of urban
           design and execution if it so desires.

Based on World Bank experience on pilot projects carried out in the neighborhoods of
Aguachina, El Limon and Quebrada Catuche of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas, the
CAMEBA Project emphasized effective community participation from the beginning and
in all its phases as a key element for its success.

The initial social diagnosis of Petare Norte and La Vega indicated a low level of
community organization and of capacity of common action. During the focus groups held
during the Final Evaluation Mission, some members of the community indicated that
previously to the Project, the community participation and formation of groups were
experienced only on punctual events and once the event was over, so was the
participation.

Keeping this in mind, the Subcomponent of Social Accompaniment was designed with
the following specific objectives:

      · To develop local development strategies focusing on high-priority problems of
           the neighborhoods, through the integration of institutional and community
           efforts in the execution of plans for the local urban improvement;
      · To strengthen the local individual, community and institutional capacities for
           the analysis, planning, organization, implementation and control of the
           interventions for the improvement of the neighborhoods; iii) to establish
           environments     and   mechanisms      of   intergovernmental   and intersector
           coordination; and iv) to transfer abilities to the community to organize and to
           maintain a group of co-administration of urban improvement.

Implementation: Since the Project became effective in 1999, the political and social
context of the country has changed dramatically. The new Constitution of 1999, as well
as multiple laws approved (i.e. The Organic Law of the Municipal Public Power of Local
Administration of June 2005 and the Organic Law for the Planning and Administration of
the Ordination of the Territory of September 2005), have emphasised the necessity to
generate social capital at the community level and to promote the direct and effective
participation of the community in decision-making. This has strengthened the
participatory focus of the Project and contributed to the achievement of the objectives of
the Project when generating a legal and political framework to facilitate social
mobilization.



                                             38

In 2002 the Project carried out a diagnosis of the existing social capital in the
communities, including an inventory of the number and characteristics of the existing
organizations that served as a baseline to determine the direct impact that CAMEBA may
have on the generation and strengthening of the social capital in its areas of intervention.

Based on this diagnosis, the CAMEBA team defined a Social Accompaniment Strategic
Plan that focused on the following operative initiatives: i) Information, communication
and social mobilization; ii) training and technical assistance; iii) social control; iv) inter-
institutional coordination; and v) evaluation and follow-up. The following chapters
describe the actions carried out for each one of the abovementioned initiatives.

Information, communication and social mobilization campaign. The objective of the
information campaign was to sensitize different social actors of the Project, as well as
incorporate new actors into the process, and share experiences to create favourable social
attitudes towards the participation.

From the beginning, CAMEBA was aware of the lack of trust in the neighborhoods
towards the government and launched intense information and communication campaigns
on the Project's objectives and on the participation opportunities. This strategy was
carried out during the 6 years of the Project's implementation, and utilised massive
means of communication such as pamphlets and audiovisual material that, besides
diffusing information on the history of the barrio, emphasised the importance of the
physical works.

At the same time, the Project established Community Groups as a permanent space of
information sharing and social mobilization, where the neighbors directly participated. In
addition, the Mesas de Diálogo y Concertación, have been promoted, where the
community meets to discuss the progress of the Project and where they can participate in
decision making.

An essential role in this process has been the Community Promoters. 70% of these
Promoters are inhabitants of Petare North and La Vega, and therefore are familiar with
the community and facilitating linkages. The Promoters received specialized training
from the Project as well as remuneration for their work.

All these information initiatives and mobilization, and the creation of social promoters,
have allowed CAMEBA to achieve high visibility at the local.

In addition, CAMEBA has established permanent offices inside the Communal Centers in
Petare Norte and La Vega, where the information on the works being carry out in the area
is displayed by means of maps and other material. Equally, the Community Promoters
assist the community in these offices, including the resettled families. These offices serve
equally as meeting spaces of the community.




                                           39

Training and technical assistance. The objective of the training was to give knowledge to
the community organization members of the administration of projects, as well as in the
application of technical norms for urban projects in the neighborhoods. The Project has
trained a significant number of community members in areas of community
administration and technical aspects related to the works. This training constitutes one the
most important results of CAMEBA because it has been the biggest incentive for
participation and has gained high recognition from the communities. The training also
allowed the community leaders to generate abilities in social administration and it has
endowed them with the necessary technical tools to be able to interact with people and
effectively supervise the works.

The training activities included workshops on: administration of projects of urban and
social development; community organization; leadership; social control; formulation,
administration and evaluation of social projects; community management. For this
purpose, CAMEBA professionals have outlined the contents of the workshops and
prepared the material necessary for their implementation, in addition to carrying out the
selection process for participants which has been open to the whole community.
Additionally training has been carried out for community, government and private sector
groups in the application of technical norms for urban projects in neighborhoods area.

Social control. The objective of social control was to increase the community control on
the performances of the different actors involved in the improvement of its well-being
and quality of life, with emphasis in the public administration.

All the works financed by CAMEBA had Local Inspectors who received remuneration.
The selection process of these inspectors was open and after an application process, the
community selects the inspectors and asks for their consent which legitimizes them.
Later on, the inspectors received training on the CAMEBA aspects and on technical
norms of the works. Additionally, the local inspectors are the main mechanism of
canalizing claims and comments of neighbors on the work towards the contractors and
towards CAMEBA.

The Project has qualified 100 local inspectors, many of which are women. This is a factor
assures the sustainability of the project and this mechanism is being used in other
neighborhoods improvement projects in Venezuela.

In addition to the Local Inspectors, the Project has also raised up the figure of the
Community Spokesmen who are important actors to promote the participation of the
community that they represent, they also participate in the Technical Council of
CAMEBA and in the bidding processes of the Project. The Community Spokesmen's
function contributed to reduce the loss of materials through their constant vigilance and it
has also contributed to the selection process of the local manpower and contractors. They
have become one of the most important channels between the neighbors and the public
and private entities involved in the Project.




                                           40

Another social control mechanism created by CAMEBA is constituted by the Local
Committees in which the neighbors may participate before, during and after the work
benefiting them directly, allowing them to know and to participate in all development
phases of the interventions.

Inter-institutional coordination. The objective of the inter-institutional coordination was
to establish inter-institutional coordination mechanisms           between communities,
municipalities, private sector and the Project. It also aimed at developing participation
strategies for the achievement of consensus among the different actors and to promote
inter-institutional initiatives with the purpose of generating methodologies and
instruments for the co-administration of urban public services. Equally, it aimed to
facilitate the systematizing and exchange of learned lessons of the Project and to
coordinate actions with the different instances of FUNDACOMUN with the purpose of
achieving the objectives of the Social Accompaniment Strategic Plan.

CAMEBA has been able to establish coordination mechanisms among the different actors
involved in the Project, including the municipal governments (Municipalities of Sucre
and Liberator), the public services companies (i.e. HIDROCAPITAL, Electricity of
Caracas, etc) and to the community representatives. In particular the Technical Councils
are of particular importance since it has been the place where details of the physical
interventions have been discussed and where each actor had the opportunity to exchange
opinions and to coordinate actions.

These spaces have been of great utility and have allowed important synergies to generate.
The meetings however are organized by CAMEBA and once the Project is finished, it is
not clear if they will continue. The different actors that intervene in the neighborhoods
recognize the importance of this coordination, but the incentives don't seem to be enough
to assure that they will continue once CAMEBA stops the coordination of them.

Work methodology adopted. To implement the social accompaniment, the Project
differentiated the urban technical team from the social technical team. The latter was
formed with consultants with experience in community, and with field personnel coming
from the target communities. However, the social technical team and the urban technical
team work in constant coordination making the technical team fully aware of the
importance of the social aspects of the project. This allowed for constant collaboration to
achieve the Social Accompaniment objectives.

The Project prepared a Guide for the Application of the Social Accompaniment Plan that
summarizes all the principles and steps to continue with each one of its intervention
actions. This Guide is the result of the systematization of the lessons learned during the
Project implementation and, if it is supplemented and it refined, could be one of the main
inputs to repeating this aspect of the Project in other communities in Venezuela.

Results of the Social Assistance Outreach sub-component: The field visits and meetings
with the community focus groups concluded that the implementation of the Social
Accompaniment Sub-component directly contributed to the creation and strengthening of



                                           41

the social capital and the empowerment of the communities of Petare Norte and La Vega
by means of information, mobilization and training activities. From the beginning of the
Project, the community has participated actively in the decision making process,
including the selection of the works and its social control. This has generated a strong
sense of ownership of the Project and of the works the carried out, therefore contributing
to the sustainability of the works in the longer term.

Although the community has not participated in the co-management of the CAMEBA
sub-projects, the experience developed by means of its participation and the technical
training offered by the Project has endowed the community with the necessary technical
tools to tackle this task. In fact, in La Vega, community leaders linked to the Project have
been able to negotiate resources with the Government and to manage to carry out small
projects in their communities. At the same time, in La Vega, the organized community
took the leadership in the land regularization process by organizing the information and
by creating a cooperative, with whom now they are able to provide services to the
Project and extending their reach in other areas in the future.

One of the objectives of the Project was to transfer the identified sub- projects together
with their final designs to the communities before their finalization in order that the
community could directly administer the projects, including the application for gaining
resources from different government bodies (such as the Intergovernmental Fund for the
Decentralization (FIDES), Local Governments, etc). The empowerment of the
communities of Petare Norte and La Vega is reflected by the fact that they have learned
how to organize themselves (under strong leadership trained by the Project) and how to
ask the Government to be included in social programs being implemented at the national
level (denominated Missions by the Government such as the Inside Neighborhood
Mission among others), as well as to have a direct and constant linkage with the public
service companies in order to request the connection or improvement of services for in
the barrios.

According to the members of the community interviewed during the Focus Group
meetings in Petare Norte and in La Vega, the biggest incentives for their active
participation and organization have been:

            o High Project capacity of answering to the community's requests
            o Access to training in social administration and infrastructure works
            o Work opportunities offered by the Project
            o The professionalism and the trust generated by the CAMEBA team

One of the associated groups brought about by CAMEBA, which has been more active
and bigger success both in Petare Norte and La Vega, are the Urban Land Committees
(CTU). They are linked to the land titling process and have expanded their
responsibilities beyond. The CTUs tend to consolidate through the Centers of
Participation for the Transformation of the Habitat (CPTH).

Sub-component 1.3: Resettlement



                                            42

Initial Objectives: The PAD estimated that the resettlement of 2,500 families (Approx.
6.9 % of the total number of families existing in the two original project areas) and of
2,224 housing units was required for two reasons:

i. To undertake infrastructure improvements (mostly road widening and construction,
and drainage canals), entailing in some cases the opening up of space and reordering of
existing layouts; and
ii. To remove housing structures that are either located in high geotechnical risk areas or
which were structurally unsound.

Site-specific resettlement plans for the 12 UDUs were required to be prepared following
guidelines of the reference plan (prepared in 1998), in parallel with feasibility studies and
detailed design of the neighborhood level urbanization projects.

Revised targets: The Resettlement and Social Assistance Action Plan prepared in 2001
provided guidelines to pursue the objectives of the Project. The plan provided insights on
the magnitude in housing substitution required for the works implementation, and the
risks involved. Furthermore, it examined the social and economic characteristics of the
families involved, as an objective of the plan. The legal and institutional framework
summarized the initiatives of slum improvements and population reallocation in
Venezuela, presenting also a brief analysis of accounts already experienced in this subject.

The main objective of the Plan was to guarantee that the resettlement would improve, or
at least re-establish, the living conditions that they had before the resettlement. It laid
down the following parameters:

           o To involve to the community in all aspects of the process of
               neighborhoods improvement assuring that the families being relocated are
               well informed and participate actively in the process of decision taking
           o To carry out complete socioeconomic studies of each one of the families
               and housing units being displaced, and determine the possession,
               occupation and use patterns that will determine the specific menu of
               options for the resettlement and the support mechanisms that will be
               offered to settle down
           o To provide a fair compensation for the loss assets
           o To offer a set of options for the relocation inside the same neighborhood
               that delivers equivalent housing or improvements
           o To prepare appropriate designs and build new substitution houses before
               the displacement occurred, avoiding the use of temporary housings when
               possible
           o To provide legal, organizational, social and economic attendance to the
               families subject to resettlement

Equally, the Plan defined the applicable legal framework, the basic principles and the
steps to continue for the development of Specific Resettlement Plans to be prepared for
each one of the 12 Urban Development Units (UDU) identified by the Project with the



                                           43

studies of feasibility and detailed design of the sub-projects to be carried out in those
areas.

The formulation of UDU Plans significantly reduced the construction of new primary
access roads and narrowed the width of secondary access roads from 12 to 8 meters. As a
consequence, the resettlement cases were reduced to 1,153 housing units. The
Resettlement Action Plan prepared in 2001 took this figure a baseline reference for the
sub-component.

Through careful value engineering and fieldwork, the estimated number of housing units
requiring resettlement dropped again to 731 in year 2002. While a much smaller number,
this number was still quite large and there were concerns about the ability of the project
team to coordinate the construction of new housing for resettlement and the execution of
works that generate resettlement.      This concern became apparent by the unsuccessful
bidding process of three resettlement housing projects in 2001 (totaling 174 housing
units) for bids which were more than three times the estimated per unit costs. As a result
the following measures were adopted:

           o Reducing the number of resettlement housing required by doing only
                partial demolitions of existing housing in cases of road widening
           o Continuing to buy existing housing and make improvements for
                resettlement purposes using more cash compensation options
           o Reducing the construction costs of new housing through the use of
                alternative technologies including some progressive housing and new,
                quick construction methods known locally as VIPAP

The partial reduction of the Bank loan also affected the resettlement framework. It has
been roughly estimated that the resettlement sub-component has been reduced according
to the same percentage of loan reduction for works (32.6%). The resettlement cases
deriving from this new baseline, was estimated at 493 housing units.

In January 2006, upon Bank request, the project started to prepare Specific Resettlement
Action Plans for Petare Norte and La Vega. According to these Action Plans (which have
not been completed yet), the resettlement cases to be executed with the Project were 287.
This number has been taken as a baseline to measure the results of the resettlement sub-
component in quantitative terms

A reconstruction of the chronology of Resettlement sub-component is provided hereafter:

     · 1998-2000: The Project Document (PAD) and PAS preliminarily identify 2,224
          housing units be resettled
     · 2001:         The resettlement team hires a topographer and two Community
          Promoters
     · 2001: The Resettlement Action Plan is prepared (PAR); and uses the
          resettlement of 1,153 housing units as a baseline




                                            44

     · 2001: FUNDACOMUN approves the procedures included in the Resettlement
          Action Plan for which it was necessary to solve basic legal problems, for
          example, how to justify the FUNDACOMUN's purchase of housing units in
          high risk areas for their subsequent demolition
     · 2001: The PAR implementation is delayed because the bids for the construction
          of new housing was declared deserted due to the costs exceeding the budget.
          Alternative solutions were explored to incorporate innovative and low cost
          construction systems but even these ones proved to not be sustainable
     · 2002:      The Resettlement Team has a Coordinator, a psychologist and a legal
          adviser
     · 2002: In February, the first 8 families were relocated due to the construction of
          the access road and waste water collector in Zulia Street in La Vega
     · 2002: In order to respond to the necessity of people being resettled, and given
          the impossibility of building new housings in short time, CAMEBA decided to
          offer substitution housing, existing in the local market as an alternate solution.
          The substitution housing was not bankable for the Bank, as it was the case with
          new housing, therefore these houses were acquired with national funds.
     · 2002: After careful engineering and field work, the housing to be resettled are
          estimated at 731 units (this figure was recorded in the Mid term review)
     · March 2004: The partial reduction of the Bank loan affects the resettlement
          framework.      The resettlement cases deriving from this new baseline, is
          estimated at 493 housing units.
     · 2003-2006: Two resettlement teams are constituted (one for Petare Norte and
          one for La Vega), each one is composed of a lawyer and a psychologist,
          accompanied with the support of Community Promoters.
     · January 2006: Specific Resettlement Action Plans are being prepared which
          foresee a total of 287 resettlement cases
     · 30th June 2006: the Specific Resettlement cases Action plans have not been
          prepared yet
     · 30th June 2006: 79 resettlement cases have been executed representing the
          27.5% of those estimated in the Specific Resettlement Plans. In addition there
          are another 61 Resettlement cases programmed, totalling 140 resettlement cases
          which represents 48.8% of those estimated in the Specific Resettlement Plans.

Implementation: Though the Specific Resettlement Plans were not designed, a
Resettlement Action Plan was prepared by CAMEBA where the principles, approaches
and strategies of the resettlement processes were described. This did not include specific
information on each one of the sub-projects to be implemented, the generated effects, the
census of the families to be displaced and the diagnosis of their socioeconomic conditions
and detailed information required for this type of Plan. During the evaluation of the social
aspects of the Project carried out by the Bank in January 2006, the preparation of a
Specific Resettlement Plan was to requested, which would cover all the sub-projects
already identified according to the guidelines established in the PAD and in accordance
to the safeguard policies of the Bank.




                                            45

Though the Specific Resettlement Plans were not designed, CAMEBA has created
mechanisms to carry out sustainable and effective resettlement cases with social and legal
support that respond to the necessities of the beneficiaries.

In responding to the necessities of resettled people, CAMEBA decided to adjust its
strategy of construction of new substitution housing as the main solution, and now offers
the purchase of used housing (vivienda usada de reposición) within the same community
and selected by the beneficiaries themselves. With this solution, the displacement of
people has been reduced and they remain within their original social environment.

The Team. The initial CAMEBA resettlement team was made up of a topographer and
two Community Promoters. However, in 2002, before starting the relocation of the first 8
families, and according to the criteria established in the PAD and PAR concerning the
need of providing legal and psychological accompaniment to the families, a new team
composed of a Coordinator, a psychologist and a lawyer was formed. This new team,
with the support of the Community Promoters, began a complete relocation process of the
families to their relocation in new houses.

Later on, as the urban upgrading works progressed, another team composed of a
psychiatrist and lawyer was added, and made it possible to dedicate one team to each of
the two communities of the Project (Petare Norte and La Vega). Through these teams,
the Project has been in contact with the resettled families and generated trust between the
community and the team to guarantee better assistance. Additionally, during the
resettlement process, the teams were in close contact with the Community Promoters,
who had well established contact with the families and often came from the communities
themselves. Additional technical support was sought from architects and other experts to
guarantee proper implementation during the valuation stage of the housing to be acquired
and demolished.

A positive result of the resettlement work has been the continued relationship and
collaboration between the Social Accompaniment Team and the Urban Technical Team.
This arrangement allowed for coordinating actions and building positive synergies.

The Process. CAMEBA sub-divided the resettlement process in three key stages: pre-
transfer, transfer and post-transfer, for which clear criteria and procedures were defined
in the Resettlement Action Plan (PAR). As noted earlier, no Specific Resettlement Plans
were prepared which only allowed for the general procedures to be followed until the
social evaluation carried out in January 2006 recommended that Specific Resettlement
Plans be defined, describing the detailed socioeconomic profiles of each family and to: (i)
define alternative solutions; (ii) establish forms of assistance to each family according to
the standards set in the PAD and, (iii) define the human and financial resources to assure
the implementation.

The CAMEBA procedure for the pre-transfer process established that a communication
campaign be carried out with pamphlets and the Local Assemblies which involved the
families to be affected during the all preliminary stages of the project.



                                            46

Later on in the Project, direct contact was made with each family, a family history was
laid out, and a follow-up is done through house visits. Also, if the families wish to have
the option to contact the Project directly, an office was created in the neighborhood or
they brought their concerns to the neighborhood assemblies. Through these mechanisms,
the social and legal accompaniment process started and the socioeconomic profile of each
family was defined together with the relevant legal status of the property. Based on these
assessments various options and solutions were presented to the family, which included
reinstatement housing (construction of new housing), substitution housing (used housing
selected by the family) or compensation in cash. As mentioned previously, the alternative
of reinstatement housing has proved unviable and the substitution housing option was
adopted. Alongside this, a valuation process of the housing (based on the replacement
value) was done. In the case of occupancy of the dwelling, a value of payment for
surrender is recognized, and an additional compensation is given to the families to assure
their access to housing with suitable conditions.

During the transfer stage, the family receives psychological support from the Community
Promoters. The moving is financed by the Project, and in the case of loss of goods due to
a disaster, the State offers housing "kits" that include: bed, refrigerator, washing machine,
among others.      In some cases, when the substitution housing requires additional
improvements (e.g. waterproofing) the project has collaborated with FUNDABARRIOS.
Additionally, through coordination with the public service companies, the regular
connection to services is guaranteed.

In the post-transfer stage of the resettlement process, families have to spend a period of
transition until they can inhabit their new housing. During this period they would receive
social assistance similar to that received during the pre-transfer and the transfer stages.
In the case of CAMEBA, the assistance diminishes once the family moves and is
continue indirectly through periodic visits by the Community Promoters. It was suggested
to the CAMEBA team during the Project that they adjust their process in order to provide
social assistance after the transfer (for a defined period) as well, until the reestablishment
of the families in their new housing is secure and complete. This would also assist to
identify and mitigate early on the problems that might be faced by the families such as
structural problems in the house not detected during the appraisal or problems with public
services. It was also suggested to inform the beneficiaries to communicate through the
Community Centers to find solutions for conflicts and express complaints of the Project.

It was also discovered that a main reason for delays in the delivery of the new property
titles to the beneficiaries was due to bureaucratic reasons. It should be also noted that
CAMEBA established a consultation process with the community in order to identify the
use and transformation of property into public spaces (parks, courts, etc) according to
their needs and desires. The families are relocated in the same area from which they
originate and this has diminished the negative impacts that resettlement can have on their

from the project, even if the moved to another city.

 Results of the Resettlement sub-component: As at June 30th 2006, the results of the
 resettlement sub-component (compared the 287 estimated in the Specific Resettlement
 Action Plans) within the Project Areas are the following:

             o Resettlement executed : 79 (out of which 34 in Petare Norte, 42 in La
                 Vega and 3 in Vargas);
             o Percentage of implementation : 27.5 %
             o Resettlement programmed : 61
             o Total resettlement cases executed and programmed: 140
             o Percentage of executed and programmed : 48.8%

         Outside the Project Area boundaries, the CAMEBA carried out additional
         resettlement work as follows:
             o 35 resettlement cases executed;
             o 73 resettlement cases programmed;
             o Total resettlement cases executed and implemented outside the project
                 areas: 108

 The total number of resettlement cases executed by CAMEBA, when accounting for both
 inside and out of the Project area, increases to 114 (39.7%) and the percentage of
 executed and programmed resettlement cases increases to 248 housing units (representing
 86.4% of the housing units estimated in January 2006). All the above data is summarized
 in Table 10.

 Sub-component 1.4: Land Titling

 Initial Objectives: Ownership of land is a key contributing factor to the improvement of
 living conditions, the welfare of barrio residents, investment in housing improvements
 and incorporation of barrios into the formal city. The objective of this sub-component
 was to regularize land tenure for the families living in the Project areas.

 The initial target established by the PAD for Land Titling was to regularise land tenure in
 all UDUs in Petare Norte and 6 UDUS in La Vega (El Carmen, Vista Hermosa, Los
 Naranjos, Los Paraparos, Los Cangilones and San Miguel) for a total of 381.97 Ha. These
 areas included 159,092 inhabitants, 31,194 families and 28,359 housing units. The
 targets established in the PAD are shown in Table 11.

Implementation: One of the first activities undertaken through this subcomponent was the
preparation of the cadastre of Petare Norte and La Vega, which has become a
fundamental tool used for urban planning. The creation of the cadastre has required active
participation from the community, which in turn has brought about a greater sense of
ownership of the neighborhoods.

In La Vega, some community leaders instantiated by CAMEBA as Community
Promoters, constituted a cooperative to implement the collection and organization of the
information necessary for the titling process. The creation of this type of cooperative was
also in accordance with the National Program for the Regularization of the Land Tenure.

According to the members of the project team and the communities interviewed during
the focus groups, people who have received property titles, both in Petare Norte and in La
Vega, have already used the titles as collateral to request loans from private banks and
invested in home improvements. In very few cases, according to the same sources, people
have sold the property once the title was received.

Most of the titles have been granted by taking into account the importance of gender
equality. When a couple is joined, the title is given in the name of the couple.
Interestingly, according to the communities consulted during the focus groups, more than
70% of the new property titles were given to women.

The new titled plots have been connected to the formal distribution networks (water,
sewerage, power), as a result of the coordination of CAMEBA with the public service
companies. The beneficiaries of land titling are conscious of their new status and actively
committing themselves to pay the services, especially the power, since the water is
subsidized (the % of implementation of power connection has been more than 1,200%
compared to the target established at the time of Mid Term review).

It was also observed that in some cases the beneficiaries of the titles, in spite of being
conscious of the obligation of paying the public services, were not equally informed on
their new obligation of paying taxes on their housings. Therefore, it has been suggested
that the CTU, with support of CAMEBA, make an effort to improve the information
provided to the beneficiaries on their rights and obligations, to avoid future possible
conflicts.

The titling process has gone on parallel with the process of preparation of the Territorial
Special Plans according to the Organic Law for the Planning and Administration of the
Ordination of the Territory of September of 2005. These plans aim to generate a vision of
the use of the territory on the part of the municipalities and to build a strategy that
guarantees an orderly and sustainable growth of the communities. The community has
actively participated in the design of the Plans, and according to the existing law, their
final version has to be submitted again to the community        before their final approval
from relevant Municipal Councils.




                                           50

Regarding the issue of land use, it is important to note that the community groups
committed themselves to activities which aim to control the informal occupation of
territory in their municipality. In La Vega, for example, the community commits itself
(through Border Pacts) to control the areas cleaned by the Project and to avoid their
reoccupation, as well as the occupation of areas belonging to the National Park Vicente
Emilio Sojo.

In addition to the provision of technical tools for the land regularization process (cadastre,
software, team, etc), the Project also contributed to the formation of Urban Lands
Committees (CTUs). According to the law, these CTUs are to be formed by the
inhabitants of each sector in order to acquire land titles. They represent the community
members before the National Technical Office (OTN) which is the body of the Republic
Vice-Presidency in charge of regularizing urban land property.

The CTUs collect and validate the information necessary for the land regularization
process and with their consistent presence in the neighborhoods, have acquired an
important knowledge of the barrios realities and necessities and have become important
channels to raise problems and request solutions. In all of Venezuela approximately
6,000 CTUs have been created out of which at least 1,000 are located in Caracas. In
Petare Norte 46 CTUs have been created with the support of CAMEBA project.

The CTUs are created by polls in a general assembly of the area's inhabitants which must
not exceed 200 housings units. The records regarding the assembly and the elected
members of the CTUS are sent to the OTN for relevant registration. Late, the CTU begins
the cadastral survey of the area. In the CAMEBA project areas, this survey was carried
out by a consulting company which has facilitated the work of the local CTUs. The CTUs
have added data to the existing cadastral information, on the state of the infrastructure
and socioeconomic conditions.

Then the CTUs described the "Letter of the Neighborhood" which contains the history of
the area, expectations of their residents, and project proposals. The initial incentive to
make residents participate in the CTUs was to receive the property titles, but their
sustainability was achieved partly due to the fact that they are flexible organizations that
do not require many bureaucratic steps.

Results of the Land Titling Sub-component: As the Project closing date, June 30th 2006,
the results of the Land Titling sub-component (compared with the targets established by
the PAD) were the following:
            o 45.6% of the land titled (173.99 Ha out of which 59.47 in Petare Norte
                and 114.52 in La Vega)
            o 63.1% of beneficiaries reached (100,048 inhabitants out of which 63,410
                in Petare Norte and 36,998 in La Vega);
            o 86.3% of families benefited (26,926 families out of which 18,117 in
                Petare Norte and 8,809 in la Vega);

    Sub-component 1.5: Environmental Action Plan

    Initial Objectives: The Environmental Action Plan was planned to be finalized during the
    first year of the Project execution and aimed to outline the environmental guidelines to be
    followed during the execution of sub-project works and corollary programs. The project
    was expected to generate substantial benefits to the urban and surrounding natural
    environment. Of concern to the Project was the long-term management of solid and liquid
    waste collection and the control of urban growth towards green protection areas. The
    PAD proposed the following steps in order to minimize potentially negative
    environmental impacts:

             1.       Execution of an Environmental Management Plan
             2.       Development of a Manual of Environmental Specifications
             3.       Preparation of guidelines for the treatment and disposition of solid waste
                      generated during the construction process
             4.       Development of general guidelines for the organization of community
                      managed solid waste collection programs (household solid waste) and
                      design of a community environmental education program
             5.       Identification of additional studies

    Implementation: The Environmental Management Plan ­EMP- (Plan de Administración
    Ambiental) was effectively prepared in 1999 to deal with possible negative impacts
    resulting from the Works implementation and to protect and manage any environmentally
    protected areas adjacent to the Project sites. As part of the Environmental Management
    Plan, a plan has been developed for the National Park, Vicente Emilio Sojo for its
    preservation and for preventing further occupation.

    This National Park has a total area of 1,134 hectares, of which 755.9 are in the parish of
    La Vega and constitutes an important green area southwest of Caracas. The Park was
    created as a "Recreational Park of Open Space and Intensive Use," by National Decree
    913 (May 13, 1975). As of 1998 approximately 4,700 families occupied roughly 123.12
    hectares within the limits of the Park. The invaded land constitutes the barrios of Los
    Mangos, Los Paraparos, Los Naranjos and Las Torres in La Vega UPF.

    Based on the EMP, a Manual of Environmental Specification was prepared between the
    end of 2001-beginning of 2002 for all small-scale infrastructure construction projects to
    be executed in the barrios. At the end of 2001 the Plan de Esgombros was also prepared
    establishing guidelines for the treatment and disposal of solid waste generated during the



                                                   53

construction process. The guidelines for the organization of community managed solid
waste collection programs (household solid waste) and the Community Environmental
Education Program were prepared in late June 2005 during project implementation. Two
local consulting companies were hired to develop the program.

Results: In general, compliance with the environmental Bank policies was accomplished
by the Project and generated substantial benefits to the urban and surrounding natural
environment such as better storm-water drainage, reduced runoff velocity, and reduced
soil erosion.

A weak point has been the late preparation and implementation of the Environmental
Education Programs. During the visits to project sites, it was observed in various cases
that the storm water drainage shafts were obstructed by solid waste and tree branches,
leading to reduced drainage capacity which may cause overflowing during rainy periods
in the future. In addition, it became clear that for the long-term sustainability of the
Works, it will be necessary to develop a solid waste management and traffic management
plans for the two areas of Petare Norte and La Vega.


Component 2: Institutional Development

This component Project financed the start-up and operational costs management of the
Project Management Unit (PMU) including public dissemination monitoring, institutional
evaluation, technical assistance, capacity building (in several areas including cost
recovery, municipal cadastre updating, development of technical norms and standards for
urban projects in the informal sector), the design of the Metropolitan Area of Caracas
Barrio Improvement Agency (MACBIA) and additional relevant studies. The sub-
components were the following:

Sub-component 2.1: Project Management

Initial Objectives: This sub-component financed the PMU as a special unit within
FUNDACOMUN, charged with executing the Project. All functions were to be
contracted and outsourced, primarily to firms. Also to be financed under this component
was a study to determine the feasibility to spin off the PMU into an autonomous
Metropolitan agency (the Metropolitan Area of Caracas Barrio Improvement Agency-
MACBIA) whose responsibility would be to coordinate and manage investment in the
barrios of Caracas and continue its Project management responsibilities in future projects.
Additional studies included project cost recovery, and land markets monitoring.

Implementation: The project has suffered from continuous changes in the administration
of FUNDACOMUN, the key implementing agency, and instability in staffing of the
PMU. The implementation has been marked by two main troubling political periods
which were the election cycle during 1999 and the political instability between April
2002 and February 2003, the natural disasters in Vargas in November 1999 and by
continuous changes in FUNDACOMUN and CAMEBA management. A summary of
these changes is given below:



                                          54

A. Changes in the political environment:
        (1)     A national referendum in April 1999 to convoke a National Constitutional
                Assembly;
        (2)     The June 1999 elections for the National Constitutional Assembly;
        (3)     The December 1999 approval of the new Constitution;
        (4)     Continued election processes throughout the first half of 2000, including
                National Assembly elections (Feb. 2000), "Mega-elections," (July 2000)
                and Municipal elections in September 2000.
        (5)     The political instability in April 2002;
        (6)     The National strike between December 2002 and Mid February 2003
        (7)     Presidential confirmation referendum (April 2004).


B. Natural disaster in the State of Vargas that resulted in reallocation of some loan funds
and a partial diversion of attention from the project's main objectives;

C. High iinstitutional turnover during the overall project implementation period, the
following changes occurred:
        (1)     4 different Ministries to which FUNDACOMUN was ascribed;
        (2)     7 different Ministers;
        (3)     7 FUNDACOMUN presidents;
        (4)     13 CAMEBA PMU General Managers

The first part of 2000 saw not only a new government, but an entirely new political
regime that resulted in a new set of actors in all government agencies and positions. This
caused major delays in the implementation of the CAMEBA project due in large part to
an inexperienced team within the PMU. In addition, delays continued throughout until
the end of 2000, which can be attributed to political problems, natural disasters (Vargas
1999) and poor project management.

The year 2001 marked a turnaround year for the Project and for the PMU. While
disbursements were still slow, due mostly to the fact that the integrated development plan
designs, which were originally to be financed by the Bank loan, were financed using
counterpart funds due to a problem with procurement of these consultant services, the
project made some advances, including in infrastructure development. The year 2001
saw the execution of a number of small, neighborhood-based construction projects (ODI)
that had both living condition impacts as well as symbolic significance. As a result, by
end of 2001, disbursements stood at US$ 3.13 million. Most of the construction projects
undertaken in 2001 were of "emergency" nature, corresponding mostly to small
infrastructure projects that had an immediate impact on either urgent issues of drainage,
pedestrian access or risk mitigation. These were approved on an exceptional basis to
stimulate the project and garner citizen participation, as well as take care of immediate
problems.

The initial months of year 2002 marked a temporary consolidation for the project when it
started to move at a more acceptable rate with the beginning of major priority works in



                                             55

La Vega and in Petare Norte. Then the Project implementation was further delayed by
political instability (Mid April 2002-Mid February 2003). By the end of 2002, dogged
from the outset by a change in government, a long delay in effectiveness, weak
management in the early years and natural disasters, the Project was behind schedule.
Consequently, the Bank and the Borrower started to discuss a possible extension.

During the first half of 2003, despite good planning, the project continued to suffer from
problems of long lapses in procurement processes which caused long implementation
delays. In addition, there was a disconnection between the procurement group and the
technical implementation groups that also contributed to implementation delays. Another
issue was the very poorly coordinated process of valuing progress in works. As a result,
disbursements did not reflect the actual progress in civil works contracts, with physical
outputs far outpacing disbursements. The PMU took some actions to improve these
problems and some progress was seen. Following these actions, the              operational
performance of the project reached a disbursement of US$11.35 million (or 19% of the
loan) by November 2003.

In March 2004, a major partial loan cancellation of the Loan was approved by the Bank
management (upon Government request and Bank Team recommendations) and
consisted of:

            o A partial Loan cancellation from the initial $ 60.7 million to $ 35.7
               Million
            o The increase of Bank financing share of the works from 40 % to 70%
            o Extension of one year of the closing date (now established at June 30,
               2005)

Notwithstanding the partial loan cancellation, the project disbursed very slowly until June
2004 (with average of $200,000 per month) largely because of very high rotation of
CAMEBA and FUNDACOMUN management. The changes agreed on by the relevant
Ministry and taken in mid 2004 (including the naming of the technical manager as the
general manager of CAMEBA) greatly increased the rate of disbursement. Disbursements
in October and November 2004, in-fact, exceeded $1 million per month. At this rate, the
project could disburse all remaining funds by June 2006 (requiring another year
extension). The new Minister of Housing and Habitat asked the Bank mission in October
2004 for another extension of the closing date (from June 2005 to June 2006) in order to
finish projects already under construction or in the process of contracting (using the
remaining project funds). The project team recommended the extension given the radical
improvement in the execution of the Project and rate of disbursement. The extension was
then granted by Bank management and by 2004, the Project was able to commit 97% of
assigned resources foreseen in the annual procurement plan, a significant improvement
over previous periods.

By May 2005, the project was apparently on target to meet its development objectives, as
revised with the reduction in the loan amount in March 2004. The PMU considerably
increased its capacity to effectively implement the project. During the April 2005



                                          56

mission, the Bank team observed that the quality of implementation of the works and
services under the Project was Satisfactory and the CAMEBA team demonstrated a
strong commitment in implementation.

During the September 2005 Bank mission it was noted that, notwithstanding the
extension of the closing date, the Government would not have been able to disburse the
entire loan amount under existing financing parameters. Therefore another reallocation
was proposed to increase the Works disbursement categories up to 100% (retroactive to
January 1, 2005) as a strategy for increasing disbursement rate without another extension.
It was further agreed that the Bank would not support any additional extension of the loan
beyond the existing closing date of June 30, 2006.          The increase in disbursement
percentages (retroactive to January 1, 2005) was then granted on March 2006 but only to
85% (Amendment VI).

As of June 2006, approximately US$7.0 million of the loan remained undisburesd. These
funds were mostly committed with works under contract. The disbursements were slow
due to an arrangement with the Ministry of Finance that has not advanced the counter-
part funding required for pre-financing of contracts and subsequent reimbursement from
the loan. Under these circumstances it was estimated that approximately US$3.0 million
of loan would remain undisbursed.

Results of the Project Management Sub-component: It was evident that there were two
periods during project implementation in which the PMU proved to be highly effective.
These time periods coincide with the periods of political stability. At these times the
PMU understood the need to manage uncertainty and minimize the disruption which the
political instability entailed.

The internal capacity of the PMU in overall project management and coordination needed
to be reinforced several times in order to meet the demands of project implementation.
This applied to the areas of procurement, disbursement, and auditing. Part of this issue
lied in how the Project's financial and project management system (SIGMA), prepared
and installed during the first year of project implementation, was not used as needed.

The Urban (UPF) Master Plans, whose approval was set as a precondition for
effectiveness, were not approved at the project closing date (30th June 2006).

The Bank missions spent considerable time with the PMU in identifying critical paths of
project implementation at each of its phases, identifying milestones and sequencing the
events to be included in a comprehensive Project Evaluation System. Although the
preliminary tools were developed to accomplish this, they were never developed in such
detail, as what was needed for monitoring and evaluation purposes.

In the area of procurement, the need to increase internal capacity came up several times
throughout implementation and management made several recommendations for
additional personnel. Despite these recommendations, procurement (especially during the
first years of implementation) was weak and this lead to considerable delays in work



                                            57

procurement and implementation. In addition, financial management has been another
area of concern, due mostly to the lateness of the receiving audit reports.

In addition, the Bank Missions recommended that the PMU review the Operations
Manual to both eliminate redundancy and superfluous information regarding procurement,
but to also to better identify the procedures for procurement and the responsibilities at
each stage of the process and each level of the PMU. Unfortunately, the Operation
Manual has never been updated and remained an unused tool. The details regarding
Project Evaluation Systems, Project Management Systems and Project manual are given
below:

Project Evaluation System. A framework for monitoring and evaluation was established
at entry. This required the Implementing Agency to design and install an impact
evaluation system including:
            o A system to monitor housing and land markets in the barrios
            o A tool for assessing changes in quality of life
            o An automated financial and physical output indicators system

The implementing agency, in order to determine the impact of the project, vis-a-vis its
development objectives, was also required to establish several quantifiable variables to be
used for assessing the impact of the Project outcomes and constructing a basis for the
development of methodologies for future projects.

During the project implementation a financial monitoring system was implemented
(SIGMA which was designed and installed by an Argentinean company in 1999).
Training courses for using the system were also implemented but at the end of the project
period (June 2006) only one person in CAMEBA was trained to use the system. The
system also had the ability to record physical indicators but a reporting system for the
operation was never put in place to generate physical indicators to be entered in the
system (only recently has one been made).

The SIGMA system was state-of-the-art at the time it was implemented. All this work
was done before the project and was declared effective. The problem was in the lack of a
stable implementing unit within FUNDACOMUN to manage, and thus understand the
system. At only one point in the implementation of the project was the system being used
(between September 2000 and September 2002). During that time there was an attempt to
use the integrated system, including physical monitoring, but once this team turned over,
the use of the system was also lost.

The system itself had many limitations and lacked a user-friendly interface. Despite its
state-of-the-art design, advances in technology since (which evolved quickly over this
period), have made the system obsolete.

The Bank often stressed the need to use the system, but among the many implementation
issues, it did not become a central point of supervision. The Bank instead focused on
getting results on the ground to get the project started. Future projects are recommended



                                          58

to focus more on creating greater institutional capacity, for reasons of sustainability, and
consistency, given the high turn-over tendencies displayed by the institutions.

Only at the end of the Project has it been possible to measure land and housing values pre
and post interventions. This has been done trough the final evaluation carried out by a
Venezuelan private consulting firm (OSG) contracted by the Borrower between
November 2005 and March 2006.

Project Management System. As indicated by the Project Evaluation system, the lack of
implementation of the system was caused by problems with both the system and the
management. In six years, there were at least seven Presidents of FUNDACOMUN. And
with almost every change of the President, a new coordinator was brought in for the
Project, as were key heads of key operational departments. The complications that this
brought with Project execution were constant turnover of key staff in FM, procurement,
planning and technical areas. Many were trained in the use of the system, but they never
stuck around long enough to institutionalize the use of the system.

Operational Manual. An Operational Manual was prepared at the end of 1999 but it was
not updated to account for changes in the Project (for example changes in the
Resettlement approach or changes in the local community organization set-up due to new
laws and political environment). The Bank emphasized the need to update the manual
but more immediate concerns of the Project took precedence. In hindsight this is an area
where the Bank should have insisted on the PMU action, for with the high-turnover in
FUNDACOMUN, the Operations Manual could have served as a mechanism for
continuity through the staffing transitions in the PMU.

Sub-component 2.2: Municipal Capacity Building

Initial Objectives: This sub-component consisted of: (i) an urban cadastre; (ii) technical
norms and standards; and (iii) finance and cost recovery strategies.

One of the objectives of this sub-component was to establish inter-institutional
coordination mechanisms between communities, municipalities, the private sector and the
Project. It also aimed at developing participation strategies for reaching consensus among
the different actors to promote inter-institutional initiatives with the purpose of
generating methodologies and instruments for the co-administration of urban public
services. Equally, it aimed at facilitating the systematization and exchange of lessons of
the Project and to coordinate actions within FUNDACOMUN to achieve the objectives of
the Social Accompaniment Strategic Plan.

Implementation: Although the inter-institutional agreement was signed between
CAMEBA and the other institutions involved in the Project (such as the two
municipalities, the Miranda State, INAVI, CONAVI, and HIDROCAPITAL), there was a
limit to the coordination. Municipalities did not assume ownership of the investments
from the beginning and did not appear to be closely involved with implementation. Only
later in project implementation did this involvement increase.




                                           59

However, in the preparation of the cadastres for example, there was considerable
municipal preparation, as well as direct training of municipalities in this area. The water
companies also had high participation on the technical issues. This includes both
HIDROCAPITAL and the municipal water company of Sucre.

The original plan was to gradually incorporate the municipalities into the Project.
However, municipal capacity has shown weaknesses to manage it and so the idea was not
heavily pushed during preparation or during implementation. Another impediment was
the different views between the central government and the municipal governments and it
made it difficult to incorporate the municipalities into the Project.

Results of the sub-component: Despite the difficulties faced, the Project has been able to
establish coordination mechanisms among the different actors involved in the Project,
including the municipal governments (Municipalities of Sucre and Liberator), the public
services companies (i.e. HIDROCAPITAL and Electricity of Caracas) and the
community representatives. In particular, the Technical Councils are of particular
importance since they have been the place where details of the physical interventions
have been discussed and where each actor has the opportunity to exchange opinions and
coordinate the actions.

These spaces have been of great utility and have allowed the Project to generate
important synergies. These meetings are organized by CAMEBA and once the Project is
closed it is not clear if these meetings will continue. The different actors that intervene in
the neighborhoods recognize the importance of this coordination, but the incentive
structure currently in place does not seem to be enough to assure that they will continue
once CAMEBA is not present to coordinate them.

An important result of the Project has been the implementation of a legal and physical
cadastre of the project areas, in both Petare Norte and La Vega. The cadastre has a
wealth of information and allows for the ability to track changes in the physical
conditions of housing and services, the value of housing, and the legal status of the
dwellings. In addition, the cadastre has been handed over to the municipalities who have
been trained in its use as part of the project's sub-component of institutional development.
The cadastre will have numerous potential uses beyond physical planning for the
municipality and measuring the project impacts and outcomes. Possible uses include
developing an addressing system for the barrios, identifying low-income families for
possible social interventions, and providing socioeconomic and physical cadastre
information to service providers such as HIDROCAPITAL and the electric company.

Component 3: Micro-Credit for Housing Upgrading

Background: In 1998 private financing for housing improvement for families earning
less than 5 times the minimum wage was virtually non-existent. Banks targeted higher-
income populations, excluding over 80 percent of the potential housing finance market.
Low-income households financed their new home construction needs through personal
savings and informal credit sources, including relatives, supplier credits, rotating savings
and credit associations and moneylenders. These sources remain expensive and unreliable,



                                            60

leading families to engage in progressive housing development, resulting in diseconomies
of scale in construction.

Approximately 40 percent of homes in the barrios of Caracas at the time of appraisal
suffered from structural flaws as a result of poor design and construction techniques, as
well as application of substandard building materials. One institution that had a long and
successful track record with housing improvement efforts was Fundación para la
Vivienda Popular (FVP). Established as a non-profit organization, FVP acted as a conduit
for government and donor funding through Asociaciones de Vivienda (ASOVIVs) for
housing rehabilitation credit programs. ASOVIVs, which consisted of 20 to 200 families,
were legally constituted entities as defined in the Ley de Politica Habitacional (LPH) and
served as financial intermediaries for FVP vis-a-vis low-income families. In addition to
funding, FVP provided technical assistance to the ASOVIVs as it related to mobilizing
the community members, training them in the administrative and financial aspects of the
lending exercise, as well as providing individual technical assistance to ASOVIV
members regarding selection of the housing rehabilitation design, preparation of budgets,
selection of materials, and contracting arrangements with the local "maestros". In 1997
and 1998, however, FVP received no funding from Government and its housing
improvement loan portfolio dropped from around US$1 million to only US$125,000,
representing 500 loans.

Initial Objectives: The component aimed to finance the institutional development and
operation of a market-based housing improvement loan fund which to provide consumer
credit to low-income individuals residing in the barrios to finance improvements to their
housing unit, working through a partnership between private banks and a non-
governmental organization (NGO) ­ building on the ASOVIV model outlined above.

Project Design: The components key feature was to establish a guarantee fund to help
`jump-start' private sector interest in the housing microfinance sector. Preliminary design
ideas for the fund were outlined at appraisal and are documented in the PAD. However, a
detailed business plan was to be developed under implementation. Additional key
features of the proposed program included the expectation that:

    · Commercial banks would extend lines of credit to FVP, which would then on-
        lend these funds to ASOVIVs;
    · ASOVIVs would appraise and approve individual housing improvement loans,
        structure terms and conditions and manage the portfolio;
    · FVP was to assist in program marketing in Project communities, as well as build
        ASOVIV capacity in all aspects of administration and supervise the actual
        housing rehabilitation efforts of individual ASOVIV members;
    · Approximately US$200,000 of Project funds were be applied to fund a technical
        assistance program for FVP to upgrade its information and accounting systems,
        train credit officers in loan origination, appraisal and supervision techniques, as
        well as training architects regarding borrower technical assistance programs such
        as housing rehabilitation design, preparation of budgets, etc;




                                             61

   · Loans offered under the program by both the banks and FVP would be priced to
       permit full recovery of related administrative, operating and funding costs;
   · No physical collateral would have been required, rather, the main inducements for
       borrower repayment would have been: (i) joint liability of the individual members
       of the ASOVIVs; (ii) the savings of each ASOVIV pledged as joint collateral for
       individual loans (see Section 4 for more detail); and (iii) the implicit commitment
       by FVP of follow-up loans to ASOVIVs that repaid their loans on time; and
   · To support this pilot program, the Banking Superintendent agreed to provide the
       necessary exemptions relating to bank provisioning requirements for the loans.

Implementation: The pilot micro-credit program was not implemented and hence
objectives outlined above were not met. The lack of political commitment to the proposed
model for housing microfinance was the primary reason. In particular, the new
Government was not willing to support a model which involved financial incentives, in
the form of a guarantee fund, to the commercial banking sector. The lack of Government
willingness, however, was identified as early as 2001 and it was agreed that alternative
design for the component would be evaluated. However, this component redevelopment
study was not initiated until late 2005 and was conceived more in the spirit of informing
future Government pilot programs in the sector.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Background, Methodology and Assumptions

An ex-post economic analysis of the Project was conducted in the context of this ICR.
This annex presents results for that analysis. The analysis was limited to the principal
areas of Project interventions ­ Petare Norte and La Vega in Metropolitan Caracas. The
Project also financed emergency reconstruction activities in Vargas State. However, due
to the emergency nature of these works, adequate baseline data was not collected and
hence conditions for economic financial analysis did not present themselves for these
investments.

The economic analysis relies on two sources of information: (i) ex-ante and ex-post
valuation of housing; and (ii) square meters of actual benefited areas. The source for this
information includes original analysis presented in the PAD and the independent end-of-
project evaluation conducted by a private consulting firm (OSG) for CAMEBA.

The economic analysis is based on an analysis of benefits and incremental costs. In
particular, the analysis aims to determine whether the present value of the total benefits
generated by the project is greater than the present value of all the costs associated with
both the initial Project investment and subsequent operation and maintenance of initial
investments over the estimated life of the investments. Investment life is assumed to by
20 years. Both costs and benefits are discounted at the same rate. Total cost flows -
investment plus operations and maintenance - are estimated based on this principle.
Economic benefits are calculated for both: (i) the valuation of the housing units; and (ii)
the valuation per square meter of land in the Project areas are calculated using the
following indicators:

    · Net present value (NPV)
    · Cost-benefit ratio (CBR)
    · Internal rate of economic return (ERR)

The analysis estimates the benefits and the costs for a 20 -year period, discounted at an
annual rate of 12%. The average annual operations and maintenance costs for
investments are estimated at 4 percent of total investment costs. The analysis used the
U.S. dollar (US$) for the evaluation controlling for inflation in the currency over the
period of implementation. A reduction of 40% was applied to the total area (m²) in Petare
Norte and La Vega assuming that this percentage of land area was occupied by public
areas such as streets, parks, churches, schools, health facilities, etc. that are non-
commercial in nature.

This ICR does not include a financial analysis. The ICR team assumed that the financial
benefits associated with the Project would be negligible given the lack of robust cost
recovery in Project areas for basic services and the `public good' nature of investments
frequently associated with urban upgrading projects. In principle, municipalities and
utilities would charge an adequate tariffs or user fees to cover over time initial investment



                                           63

costs, ongoing maintenance and operations costs and a margin that would enable new
investment. These charges could be applied to water, sanitation and solid waste collection
through direct tariffs or fees and for bundle of additional basic infrastructure services
through either a property tax or betterment fees. In such a scenario the Project would in
principal have a positive net financial benefit. However, in Venezuela as in many other
Latin American countries, the Government is unwilling to charge tariffs and user fees for
basic services that reflect the true cost of service provision. This is particularly the case in
low-income areas where collection rates are often extremely low. This implicit and
explicit policy of below-cost utility fees is based on the assumption that overall social or
public benefit ­ captured in the net economic benefit ­ is from a policy perspective more
important than the potential financial benefit.

Data:

Data necessary for the analysis was obtained from a range of sources. Ex-post
quantitative data on housing and land values was obtained through a sample household
survey in Petare and La Vega. In total, 1020 households were surveyed with 487 and 533
in Petare Norte and La Vega respectively. The surveys were carried out by OSG and the
methodology and results of these surveys were verified for quality by the ICR team. Data
on costs, beneficiaries and the area of intervention were obtained from CAMEBA PMU

Clarifications on Economic Analysis Methodology:

It is important to recognize that the economic analysis conducted in the context of this
ICR has certain inherent limitations given the lack of available data and the significant
changes to Project size and scope through the Loan reduction and other amendments.
Nonetheless, the ICR team, recognizing these limitations, has attempted to conduct the
best possible analysis with available data and information based on the methodology
described above. A few further clarifications are required.

Compatibility with ex-ante Evaluation Methodology: The ex-ante Project cost-benefit
analysis presented in the original PAD conducted an analysis by component for four
principal planned investments: (i) drinking water; (ii) sewerage; (iii) drainage and land
titling; and (iv) transport infrastructure. Willingness to pay calculations were used for
drinking water and sewerage investments. An analysis of economic benefits for drainage
and land regularization was done using estimated changes in property values. Lastly, road
infrastructure investments were analyzed by estimating the economic benefit derived
from reductions in travel times. The analysis estimated a per-capita or per-household
investment cost target for each component beyond which the Project would have an
internal rate of economic return (ERR) greater than 12 percent. Estimated costs per
component, however, were not established at the time as detailed investment planning
was deferred until implementation.

The ex-post economic analysis could simply have verified that actual investment costs
per component were below the previously determined 12% ERR unit cost targets.
However, this was not possible due to a series of factors. First, the Project did not
maintain data on actual investments by original component. This was in part a result of
the integrated nature of the contract packages. Nonetheless, the inability to collect such
data was largely a factor of the poor quality of operational and financial data management
practices. Efforts to conduct an ex-post estimation of component costs at the time of this
ICR were not successful. Secondly, it is important to note that the relevance of such an
analysis ­ comparison of actual costs to estimated 12% ERR unit cost targets ­ would



                                           65

have been limited given the significant reorganization of the investment program under
implementation. Specifically, the Project investment in a far greater proportion of
community-based (e.g. sidewalks, internal roads, recreational facilities, community
centers, etc.) and mitigation infrastructure not consistent with the four investment
components originally subjected to analysis.

Controlling for General Housing Price and Property Value Inflation: The methodology
outlined above for the economic analysis conducted for this ICR estimates the change in
property directly attributable to Project investments. The analysis would ideally attempt
to control for exogenous factors by utilizing ex-ante and ex-post data from a control
group of informal settlements in Caracas not participating in the operation but with
similar initial characteristics. Data collection ex-ante or ex-post on property values,
however, was not collected.

Absent control group data the ICR team aimed to assess whether other data available in
the country could allow the analysis to estimate the real price inflation in housing or
property values in the Caracas Metropolitan area. Venezuela does generate reliable and
regular housing rental price data as part of its overall consumer price index monitoring.
Rental housing prices would in principle over the medium-term increases in overall
property values. These data are disaggregated for the Caracas metropolitan region. The
ICR team analyzed the housing rental price index in relation to the official Government
inflation index, i.e. the aggregate consumer price index (CPI). The analysis found that
that housing rental prices in fact grew slightly more slowly that the CPI or inflation.
Given that all costs and benefits for this analysis are controlled for inflation and housing
values did not seem to increase in real terms, the analysis assumes that all observed
changes in estimated housing values in the Project areas are at least not attributable to
general appreciation real housing values.5

Economic Analysis Results

Results for NPV, CBR and ERR calculations are presented below for both Petare and La
Vega. Attachment 1 to this Annex presents the calculation tables for each analysis for
verification purposes.

Petare Norte:

Table 4 below presents NPV, ERR and CBR analysis for Petare Norte based on observed
changes in overall home or property values during the period of implementation. Based
on these criteria the analysis estimates that the Project has resulted in a return on
investments to the order of 13.95% and a cost-benefit ratio of 1.70, with the net present
value of liquid benefits in the order of US$ 1.4 million.

            Table 4: Cost-Benefit Evaluation ­ Property Valuation



5 This, however, does not eliminate the possibility that: a) other investments or improvements in the
Project area not attributable to the Project account for the difference in values; and b) control groups would
have reflected similar real housing value appreciation based on general improvements in services.

Conclusion

The economic analysis estimates that Project has had a significantly positive overall
economic impact. Overall Project IIR is estimated at 42.35% based on changes in
estimated housing unit prices and 94.11% based on the estimated price per m² measures.
The latter measure is perhaps more appropriate given that it controls for the expansion of
homes that may have occurred as a result of individual household investments. The
Project also demonstrates a strongly positive cost-benefit ratio based on these two
measures.

Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
(if any)

In order to capture the community stakeholder results of the Project, two focus group workshops
were held on September 28, 2006 in Petare Norte and La Vega. The participants included CTU
Coordinators, CTU Members, Neighborhood Inspectors, Community Members, and Social
Promoters. A number of questions were presented to the stakeholders pertaining to community
participation before and after the works, resettlement, land titling, maintenance of the works and
the environment, the creation of social capital, and the improvement of the quality of life derived
from the Project. The results of the workshops are summarized below.

Community participation before and after the implementation of works. The consultations
with the focus groups indicated that though the community participation was low in the initial
stages of the Project, it did form some effective community groups that have positively
contributed to the outcomes. It was concluded from the focus groups that in the planning stages
of the Project, community participation in the decision-making process was scarce and occurred
sporadically when input from the local communities was needed. The focus group meetings also
indicated that the communities did not actively participate in the co-management of the
CAMEBA sub-projects. This lack of participation was due to a lack of trust and low level of
interest. However, the technical training which the Project has offered later on, has given the
community the tools needed to become active participants in the implementation and maintenance
of the works. This was evident in La Vega, when community leaders associated with the Project,
negotiated resources with the Government to carry out small projects in their communities. Also
in La Vega, the community has taken the lead in the land regularization process and now they
provide services to the Project, with the potential to expand their activities to other areas in the
future.

According to the members of the community interviewed during the focus groups in Petare Norte
and La Vega, the biggest incentives for their active participation and organization were:

         o       A high capacity of the Project to answer the community's requests;
         o       Access to training in social administration and infrastructure works;
         o       Work opportunities offered by the Project; and
         o       The professionalism and the trust generated by the CAMEBA team.

Broad consensus existed regarding the success of the Urban Land Committees (CTU). They were
key factors in the success of the land titling process and have expanded their activities by working
with the Centres of Participation for the Transformation of the Habitat (CPTH).

Resettlement. In January 2006, stakeholder consultations were held with resettled families from
the Project areas who were resettled due to infrastructure works or locations in high-risk zones:
18 families in Petare Norte and 12 families in La Vega6. The majority of the people interviewed
stated that they were in agreement with the solutions of resettlement provided by CAMEBA and
verified that they received timely information. They also selected the house in the real-estate
market, with the help of experts acquired by the Project, to replace their house which required
resettlement. In some cases, the resettled families stated that they had still not received their

property titles but this situation was being mitigated by the CAMEBA team. There were two
cases of resettlement in which the community members were placed in undesirable areas of high-
risk or the house had leakage problems but these cases were being revised by the Resettlement
Team to find viable solutions. Despite the few complaints, the majority of the resettlement cases
resulted in new houses that offered bigger spaces than what the occupants had before.

Land Titling. According to the focus groups consultations, people who have received property
titles, both in Petare Norte and La Vega, have already used the titles as collateral to request loans
from private banks and to invest in housing improvements. And only in a few cases, have people
sold the property once they had received the title. When distributing the titles, a fair allocation
between men and women was attempted, and given jointly to couples, however, more than 70%
of the new titles of property were given to women. The result of the titling has been high
satisfaction from the beneficiaries and with their new incorporation into the land market, they are
much more committed to pay for services, such as electricity or water. Community groups have
also organized themselves to monitor and control the free land areas within their zones to prevent
their reoccupation. This has been done through the creation of Border Pacts which also occupy
the areas belonging to the National Park Vicente Emilio Sojo.

Maintenance of the works and environment: During the focus groups it became evident that a
weakness in project implementation has been the late preparation and implementation of the
Environmental Education Programs. During the visits to project sites, it was observed that in
various cases the storm water drainage shafts were obstructed by solid waste and tree branches
leading to a reduced drainage capacity which may cause overflowing during rainy periods. In
order to achieve long-term sustainability of the works, it will be necessary to develop a solid
waste management plans for the two areas of Petare Norte and La Vega.

Creation of Social Capital: The meetings with the community focus groups allow for the
statement that the Project directly contributed to the creation and strengthening of the social
capital and the empowerment of the communities of Petare Norte and La Vega. This was
accomplished by means of information sharing, mobilization and training activities. From the
beginning of the Project, the community has participated actively in the decision-making process.
This has generated a strong sense of ownership of the Project and of the works it has carried out,
and therefore has contributed to the sustainability of the works.

The empowerment of the communities is reflected in the way the communities have learned how
to organize themselves (under the leaders trained by the Project) and how to ask the Government
to be included in social programs being implemented at national level (denominated Missions by
the Government such as the Inside Neighbourhood Mission, among others) In addition, the
communities have established a direct and constant linkage with the public service companies and
display this empowerment in their ability to now request the connection or improvement of
services in the barrios.

Quality of life after works implemented. Almost all participants to the workshops showed
satisfaction for the improvement of the quality of life after the works implemented by the Project.
This satisfaction is found in the way the Project has: (i) increased access to water and sanitation
service in target areas; (ii) substantially increased vehicular and pedestrian access to the barrios;
(iii) introduced electricity in the barrios far above the planned works; and (iv) created important
community service centers.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The following Evaluation Report was provided by the Borrower and summarizes progress
achieved under CAMEBA.

I.- Introducción:

El presente documento recoge las apreciaciones finales sobre los resultados del Proyecto Promueba
Caracas-CAMEBA, a cargo del Gobierno de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela y el co-
financiamiento del Banco Mundial, según el acuerdo de Préstamo VE-4400 para la ejecución del
Proyecto de Mejoramiento de Barrios de Caracas a partir de diciembre 1998.

Con el objetivo general de mejorar la calidad de vida de los habitantes de los Asentamientos Urbanos
No Regulados, mediante la construcción de obras de infraestructura: vial -principal y secundaria-
acueductos, cloacas, electricidad, iluminación pública entre otros, incluyendo la regularización de la
tenencia de la tierra y los planes de reasentamiento de familias y actividades económicas susceptibles
de afectación por la construcción de obras de infraestructura y/o por ocupar zonas de riesgo inminente
-básicamente geotécnico e hidráulico- acompañado con la participación activa de las comunidades de
la Vega y Petare Norte, áreas seleccionadas para las intervenciones urbanísticas.

El proyecto fue concebido como plan piloto de mejoramiento urbano con una visión integral de
desarrollo que superara las intervenciones casuísticas que llevaron a la consolidación de la anarquía en
la mayoría de los barrios del país. La puesta en ejecución de los planes en Petare Norte y La Vega ha
permitido contar con un modelo teórico y práctico dirigido a la superación de la pobreza urbana y a la
integración de estos sectores con el resto de la urbe caraqueña.

El inicio del Cameba coincidió con el cambio de gobierno sucedido después de las elecciones de
diciembre de 1998. La toma de posesión de las nuevas autoridades encabezadas por el Presidente
electo, Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías y la convocatoria a una Asamblea Nacional Constituyente, plantea
un cambio en la estructura institucional y jurídica del país, las cuales tuvieron impacto a lo largo de la
ejecución del Proyecto y comenzando con la tragedia de Vargas en Dic.`99. Además, en el período se
sucedieron una serie de acontecimientos políticos que convulsionaron al país y repercutieron
seriamente en las metas previstas, lo cual llevó a la solicitud de dos (2) prórrogas concedidas; a
reducir el monto original del préstamo y a cambios en la participación (Pari-Passu) de los entes
involucrados: la República Bolivariana y el Banco Mundial. Además, hubo constantes cambios de
autoridades en los ministerios de adscripción y en Fundacomun, que generaron una alta rotación del
personal en la Unidad de Manejo del Proyecto (UMP).

A pesar del entorno cambiante que caracterizó el Proyecto Cameba, el mismo tuvo efectos positivos
para el tratamiento de las carencias de servicios y pobreza de estos dos (2) sectores populares de la
ciudad de Caracas. El Proyecto en la medida que avanzaba en su ejecución, sirvió de referencia para
otras organizaciones del sector público y privado, tanto las vinculadas formalmente con Cameba,
como aquellas que se incorporaron por diversos medios de coordinación interinstitucional promovidos
por el mismo proyecto. Asimismo, la población de las comunidades involucradas contó con medios y
mecanismos para participar en el proceso de toma de decisiones relacionados con el mejoramiento de
sus condiciones de vida.

Los cambios en la legislación venezolana durante la ejecución del proyecto fueron constantes,
repercutiendo en su gestión, por cuanto las mismas propiciaron formas oficializadas dirigidas para
promover los derechos legales y constitucionales de los sectores pobres del país y a transferir poder a
las comunidades populares -en nuestro caso- y las ubicadas en las principales ciudades del territorio
nacional. Entre estas formas jurídicas están: La Constitución de la República Bolivariana de

Venezuela, Ley de Cooperativas, Ley de los Consejos Locales de Planificación Pública, Ley de
Regularización de la Tenencia de la Tierra y Ley de los Consejos Comunales, entre otras.

Los planteamientos sobre los resultados del Proyecto Cameba que se presentan en este informe son ­
básicamente- los recogidos y considerados en la Evaluación Final del Proyecto Cameba, la cual tuvo
su culminación en junio de 2006.

II.- Documento de Evaluación de Préstamo Propuesto para el Proyecto de Mejoramiento de
Barrios de Caracas.

De inmediato se indican los alcances del Proyecto Cameba previstos en el documento de
préstamo. Esta reseña permitirá tener una Visión Gestalt sobre los principales componentes y
metas trazadas por el proyecto originalmente para realizar en el horizonte de cinco años. Los
componentes que conformaron el Proyecto fueron:

     1. Mejoramiento Urbano: Comprendió el diseño y ejecución de obras en las UPFs y
        UDUs. Incluyó la preparación de planes maestros de mejoramiento urbano. Se prepararon
        proyectos y la ejecución de obras de vialidad vehicular y peatonal, acueductos, colectores
        de aguas residuales y aguas de lluvia, electricidad, obras de mitigación de riesgos
        geotécnicos, centros comunitarios. En este componente estuvo incorporado el sub-
        componente de Acompañamiento Social, el Plan de Acciones de Reasentamiento,
        Regularización de la Tenencia de la Tierra y manejo Ambiental.

     2. Desarrollo Institucional: En este Componente se incorporaron              las acciones de
        fortalecimiento de la Unidad de Manejo del Proyecto y la asistencia técnica          y el
        seguimiento, evaluación de las capacidades institucionales de los organismos
        involucrados: alcaldías de los municipios Sucre y Libertador, en las áreas de:
             · Diseño e instalación de 2 catastros integrales automatizados (La Vega y Petare
                 Norte) y equipamiento de las Direcciones de Catastro Municipales de Libertador
                 y Sucre.
             · Recuperación de costos.
             · Desarrollo de normas para la elaboración de planes de mejoramiento urbano en
                 zonas de barrios.
             · Manual de Manejo de Escombros y Gestión de Riesgos.
             · Diseño de un organismo para la atención de barrios en el área metropolitana de
                 Caracas.

     3. Plan Piloto de Micro-Créditos para el Mejoramiento de Viviendas: Creación y operación
        de un sistema de micro financiamiento accesible y de otorgamiento rápido con asistencia
        técnica incluida para la ampliación y/o mejoramiento de las edificaciones residenciales.



III.- Principales Logros por Componentes:

A continuación se presentan los principales logros del Cameba a lo largo de su ejecución y de
acuerdo con los componentes que conformaron el proyecto:

  1. Mejoramiento Urbano:
     La ejecución de este componente desde su fase de diseño introdujo innovaciones en relación
     con las actuaciones que venían ejecutando diversos organismos públicos en los barrios de las



                                               79

principales ciudades del país y en particular Caracas, donde más del 51% de la población
habita en zonas de desarrollo no controlado. A la ocupación espontánea de los espacios
urbanos por sectores poblacionales provenientes de las migraciones internas y externas,
además de las propias del crecimiento demográfico de los centros urbanos y la subsecuente
generación de nuevas familias que requieren viviendas, se unió el desconocimiento oficial por
parte de los organismos de planificación urbana para proponer acciones programadas en pro
de solventar las carencias básicas del hábitat de estos sectores urbanos tradicionalmente
excluidos. Asimismo, los entes públicos a nivel nacional, regional y local realizaron
programas, proyectos y obras de infraestructura sin la debida planificación que definieran
objetivos y metas a lo interno de los barrios y de estos con respecto al entorno urbano del cual
forman parte. Esta situación de falta de previsión contribuyó a la consolidación de la anarquía
de los asentamientos urbanos no regulados y de sus efectos colaterales en el resto del ámbito
urbano.

En este contexto se propone la realización del proyecto piloto Promueba-Caracas Cameba, el
cual plantea abordar de manera integral y organizada las intervenciones urbanísticas en las
UPFs 10 y 4 de La Vega y Petare Norte respectivamente. Desde el punto de vista legal la Ley
Orgánica de Ordenación Urbanística, en su artículo 49 estipula la posibilidad de ejecutar
Planes Especiales de Mejoramiento Urbano en Zonas de Desarrollo No Controlado, lo cual
establece una pauta para la intervención urbanística con el fin de dar coherencia al
ordenamiento urbano en los barrios seleccionados.

A pesar de los planteamientos de introducir racionalidad en las actuaciones previstas en el
Proyecto Cameba, para la Unidad de Manejo del Proyecto (UMP) por una parte y por la otra,
para las poblaciones de las comunidades involucradas, significaba una diferencia sustancial
para la gestión de mejoras en áreas de barrios. La relativa experiencia en este tipo de enfoque
por parte de Fundacomun, hizo actuar con cautela y llevar el proyecto con sumo cuidado para
cumplir las metas y expectativas de la población. Por otra parte estos últimos se movían entre
la necesidad de obtener respuestas rápidas y la incredulidad ante las autoridades del Proyecto
respecto de la ejecución real de lo que se ofrecía. Situación esta que obedecía al abandono y
las frustraciones de las promesas incumplidas constantemente por los gobernantes de turno.
Es por ello que durante el año 1999 y los primeros 9 meses del año 2000 el proyecto fue
sumamente lento. Sin embargo, hubo logros importantes a lo largo de la ejecución, entre los
que se destacan:

1.1 Planes de mejoramiento Urbano:
    1. Elaboración de cuatro Planes (4) Especiales de Mejoramiento Urbano: La Vega,
        Petare Norte, Quebrada Tacagua y La Guaira. En el caso de La Vega y Petare Norte -
        zonas principales de actuación del Proyecto- los planes especiales se formularon con
        base en las intervenciones urbanísticas -primeras obras ejecutadas- lo cual introdujo
        un cierto nivel de incertidumbre en la racionalidad de lo programado. Sin embargo,
        se tienen planes en cada una de las Unidades de Desarrollo Urbano correspondientes
        a La Vega y Petare Norte.
    2. Contratación de 9 Proyectos Integrales (PI) en La Vega y 13 en Petare Norte con un
        promedio de 13 proyectos de ingeniería de detalle por cada PI.

1.2 Obras de mejoramiento Urbano:
Las obras ejecutadas por el Proyecto Cameba contaron con diseños y especificaciones
adecuadas, las cuales aseguran su perdurabilidad en el tiempo, ya que cumplen con el espíritu
de las Normas vigentes por una parte, y por la otra, se incorporan los mecanismos de
contraloría social por las comunidades ejercidos por los inspectores vecinales como veedores


                                           80

del cumplimiento de las empresas constructoras y de la UMP del ente contratante -
Fundacomun-. Sin embargo, es necesario destacar que en general la ejecución de obras en los
barrios de Caracas y en particular en La Vega y Petare Norte se realizaron con dificultad
debido a la densidad de construcción existente, la presencia de población constante,
restricción de espacios y fuertes pendientes, inestabilidad de los terrenos proclives a
deslizamientos y las dificultades de adaptación de las empresas constructoras a estas
condiciones de trabajo. Los principales logros en esta materia fueron:

    · 131 obras ejecutadas hasta marzo de 2006, fecha para la cual se contaban con
         registros de acuerdo a la Evaluación Final del Proyecto CAMEBA, en un tiempo
         efectivo de 4 años y 9 meses de labor. *Anexar cuadro resumen.
    · Calidad en el diseño y especificaciones en los materiales y acabados que aseguran la
         perdurabilidad de las obras a largo plazo. Si no tiene acero de refuerzo, sistemas de
         drenajes y barandas de protección, no es obra del CAMEBA, beneficiando a la fecha
         más de 36.500 familias de 60.000 previstas.
    · Con respecto a los servicios prestados se presenta una mejora según Hidrocapital. En
         cuanto al servicio de agua un 15% de la población presenta un incremento en la
         conectividad, en el caso de La Vega, y según la percepción de la población un 5% de
         mejora en el servicio. En Petare Norte, no se obtuvo información.
    · Vialidad principal: De lo programado se ejecutó un 19,9% en La Vega y un 7,4% en
         Petare Norte -se tuvo que priorizar las obras de estabilización por riesgo inminente,
         antes de ejecutar las obras viales- para un promedio de 14,7% de la programación
         total.
    · Vialidad secundaria y peatonal: la relación entre lo programado y lo ejecutado fue de
         37,5% para La Vega, 37,4% para Petare Norte y 73,4 % para Vargas. La relación
         total entre lo programado y lo ejecutado supera el 40 %.
    · Aguas de lluvia: La relación entre lo programado y lo ejecutado para todo el Proyecto
         fue de 45,9% en promedio.
    · Aguas Residuales, se alcanzó un 48,3% y en Agua Potable el 23.4% para la fecha de
         cierre de la evaluación final en todos los ámbitos de acción.

Es necesario señalar que la ejecución de obras previstas por el Proyecto Cameba tenía una
doble finalidad. La primera completar los servicios de hábitat correspondiente a la
infraestructura básica y la de crear los vínculos físicos con la estructura formal de la ciudad y
promover su integración urbana. Dada las carencias de los barrios intervenidos, los
obstáculos presentados en el entorno del proyecto y los constantes cambios institucionales de
Fundacomun y de los órganos de adscripción, la reducción de las metas físicas acordadas y
las implicaciones de la cantidad de reasentamientos que conllevaban la ejecución de la obras
estructurantes éstas no fueron ejecutadas como estaban previstas, sobre todo las
correspondientes a la accesibilidad contempladas en los proyectos de vías principales.

1.3 Consultorías y estudios:
El Proyecto Cameba incluyó un número de 213 consultorías programadas de las cuales se
había completado el 57,5% a la fecha de la evaluación final del Proyecto.

1.4 Sub-componente de Acompañamiento Social:
En este sub-componente se incluyen la participación social comunitaria, reasentamiento y
regularización de la tenencia de la tierra.

1.4.1 Participación Social Comunitaria:



                                            81

La participación social comunitaria fue incrementada sustancialmente durante la ejecución
del Cameba. Según los resultados de la Evaluación Final del proyecto las formas asociativas
comunitarias aumentaron en un 20 % en Petare Norte y en un 50 % en La Vega.

En la etapa inicial del proyecto se realizaron actividades de difusión del mismo con el
contenido de los componentes y sub-componentes y objetivos y metas planteados. En esta
labor de información a las comunidades involucradas, intervinieron los promotores sociales
comunitarios y los supervisores de acompañamiento social, a quienes les correspondió
promover y motivar a la población para participar en los eventos comunitarios programados,
para los que se utilizaron diversos medios de divulgación para asistencia a las asambleas,
reuniones y eventos: invitaciones escritas, volantes, papelógrafos y notificaciones verbales
con vecinos, entre otros.

Un hecho importante a destacar en la participación social comunitaria lo constituye la
elaboración de eventos con los proyectistas contratados para la realización de los Planes por
UDUs, lo cual conformó una fortaleza por cuanto le dio sustentabilidad social a las
propuestas formuladas en los planes. La población -fundamentalmente a través de sus líderes-
tuvo oportunidad de participar en los planteamientos referidos a los principales problemas
que confrontaban sus vecindarios y definir las aspiraciones en relación a las obras de
infraestructura básica que se llevarían a cabo con el fin de mejorar su ambiente.

Es necesario destacar, que el proceso de participación social comunitaria en las etapas
iniciales no fue masivo. Existía dispersión y falta de integración entre las diversas formas
asociativas existentes. A su vez estas no contaban con una participación activa de los
habitantes a los cuales estas organizaciones representaban y sus líderes, se mantenían en sus
cargos directivos sin realizar las legitimaciones periódicas necesarias para fortalecer la
participación social.

Concomitantemente, desde la realización del proceso constituyente que se efectuaba en la
nueva Asamblea Nacional se envían mensajes importantes que se recogen en la nueva
constitución donde se define como principio el criterio de democracia participativa y
protagónica, lo cual constituye el elemento rector para que todos los sectores -los populares
en particular- se incorporen decididamente en los procesos de toma de decisiones en relación
a las acciones conjuntas con organismos públicos y privados para mejorar su calidad de vida.

Dado el peso otorgado ahora a las comunidades, se realizó a través de la Fundación de
Gerencia Social adscrita al Ministerio de Planificación y Desarrollo un programa para la
formación y certificación de 105 gerentes sociales comunitarios incluyendo la participación
de 40 promotores sociales del Proyecto y 65 líderes de Petare Norte y La Vega lo cual deja
una importante capacidad instalada en estos dos ámbitos.

En paralelo con la formación de los líderes sociales comunitarios se realizó un trabajo de
asistencia técnica legal especializada para actualizar las formas asociativas existentes y la
constitución de nuevas asociaciones ajustadas a las necesidades y aspiraciones comunitarias.
Asimismo, desarrollar capacidades organizativas y de gestión, con el fin de que sean capaces
de asumir corresponsablemente las funciones de cogestión de sus comunidades, en las áreas
de intervención del Proyecto Cameba. La realización de este trabajo abarcó el diagnóstico de
las capacidades organizativas de 124 organizaciones comunitarias: 84 en Petare Norte y 40 en
La Vega, con miras a la conformación de Grupos de Cogestión Local, tal como estuvo
planteado en el PAD.



                                           82

Otro aspecto a destacar en relación con la participación social comunitaria se refiere a la
implantación de mecanismos de contraloría social y rendición de cuentas. En tal sentido
durante el año 2001 y 2002 se realizaron licitaciones para la ejecución de obras. En los
procesos de licitaciones participaron miembros de las comunidades donde se realizaron las
obras, como veedores de los actos de apertura de sobre de las ofertas técnicas y económicas.
Igualmente, participaron conjuntamente con los miembros de los comités en las evaluaciones
de las ofertas, para finalmente recomendar sobre la selección de empresas ganadoras de los
procesos licitatorios.

También formó parte de la contraloría social el nombramiento de inspectores vecinales para
el seguimiento de las obras en ejecución a nombre de las comunidades quienes los postulaban.
Estos recibieron una capacitación previa sobre los principios de contraloría social en general
y de obras en particular. En este último caso, se capacitaron a los inspectores vecinales en las
actividades de: elaboración de presupuestos, definición de partidas, cantidades de las partidas,
precios unitarios, rendimientos, análisis de precios y costo total de la obra prevista/obra
ejecutada. Asimismo, se incluyó en los talleres de formación de los inspectores vecinales los
cronogramas, la ubicación y las características de las obras a realizar. Este mecanismo de
contraloría social de obras constituye una de las mayores fortalezas del proyecto en cuanto a
participación social. En ella se articularon las intervenciones de los representantes de Cameba,
las empresas contratistas, los ingenieros inspectores y las comunidades a través de los
comités vecinales y los inspectores vecinales. Se destaca este aspecto por cuanto la
realización de obras en los barrios se caracterizó en el pasado, por no cumplir con las
especificaciones técnicas correspondientes, incumplimiento manifiesto de los contratos y
falta de transparencia en cuanto al uso de los recursos asignados para estas obras, muchas de
las cuales fueron pagadas sin haber sido nunca construidas.

En conclusión la participación social estuvo signada por dar cumplimiento a los principios de:
empoderamiento, definida como la transferencia de poder en la población para participar
como gestores de su propio desarrollo y de; generación de capital social, entendida como la
condición de lograr normas de convivencia, confianza y capacidad de organización social.

1.5 Plan de Acciones de Reasentamiento:
El Plan de Reasentamiento se previó como respuesta a la Política de Salvaguarda del Banco
Mundial 4.12, que plantea la necesidad de elaborar mecanismos para manejar el
reasentamiento involuntario generado por el proyecto. El desplazamiento involuntario se
realizó en principio por dos motivos: 1) por las obras previstas de infraestructura por el plan
especial, principalmente construcción de drenajes y ampliación de vialidad. 2) para eliminar
estructuras de viviendas ubicadas en áreas de alto riesgo geotécnico; por último para atender
las emergencias con ocasión de las lluvias inusitadas en febrero de 2005, que según los
registros es el mes de mayor sequía en el territorio nacional. Esta última causa no prevista en
el PAR original, dada la emergencia, se aprovechó la experiencia desarrollada por la Unidad
de Reasentamiento del proyecto, para dar respuestas rápidas y efectivas a los grupos
damnificados que en la capital superó las 1000 familias damnificadas.

Durante la ejecución del proyecto se redujeron las metas iniciales de reasentamiento previstas.
Para el año 2002 se había estimado un total de 572 viviendas susceptibles de afectación, pero
con ajustes y reprogramaciones disminuyeron en más del 60 %.

Esta propuesta significó un cambio radical en relación al tratamiento del tema de poblaciones
desplazadas por obras de desarrollo o por estar ubicadas en zonas de riesgos geotécnicos,
geológicos e hidráulicos. Estos procesos no se manejaban con previsión metodológica ni


                                           83

sensibilidad hacia las familias involucradas, las cuales eran impactadas en forma negativa al
perder sus viviendas, mobiliario, arraigo, integración familiar y lazos vecinales. Además -en
algunos casos- ocasionaron las pérdidas de actividades económicas vinculadas a sus
viviendas; así como, el acceso a los equipamientos urbanos de educación y salud, entre otros.
Los lugares donde en ocasiones fueron obligados a trasladarse, tampoco contaban con las
adecuaciones para vivienda y servicios conexos para su alojamiento temporal o definitivo.

El objetivo del Plan de Reasentamiento consistente originalmente en proporcionar viviendas
de sustitución a núcleos familiares propietarios de bienhechurías susceptibles de afectación
tuvo que ser revisado también por solicitud de los mismos vecinos.

Así, las primeras acciones de reasentamiento en La Vega, contemplaban la transferencia de 7
familias ubicadas en la zona de construcción del Colector de Valle Alegre, a las que había
que reubicar en el mismo ámbito, en viviendas similares a las que ocupaban en ese entonces,
toda vez que las viviendas de sustitución sufrieron retraso (9 meses) por la declaratoria
desierta de dos (2) procesos consecutivos de licitación pública nacional. El reasentamiento de
las 7 familias ubicadas en la zona de interferencia del colector de Valle Alegre se logró para
finales del año 2002 después de un frágil y lento proceso. Considérese que dada la resistencia
de los vecinos involucrados, por desconfianza en las acciones de reasentamiento, fue
necesario extremar los mecanismos que permitieran la generación de confianza y credibilidad
por parte de los afectados.

Conjuntamente con la ejecución del colector de Valle Alegre se decidió la construcción y
ampliación de la Calle Zulia. En esta última obra se estimaba que serían afectados 41
inmuebles. Logrado el reasentamiento de las primeras siete (7) familias se produjo un efecto
demostración, que permitió allanar el camino para continuar las acciones de reasentamiento
en la calle Zulia, que se redujo de 41 a 11 inmuebles, previa revisión y cambio del alcance del
proyecto general (recomendación de los especialistas del Banco). Asimismo, permitió al
equipo de reasentamiento, contar con experiencia que sirvieron de base para continuar con el
resto de las actividades previstas en el Plan de Reasentamiento.

Para el reasentamiento en ambas UPFs se tenía prevista la construcción de viviendas de
sustitución. De estas viviendas de sustitución se comenzó la construcción de 60 unidades en
terrenos cedidos por Cementos La Vega. Una vez iniciada la construcción de las primeras
veinte unidades, se produjo su paralización por problemas con el contratista y su posterior
invasión por parte de familias vecinas de La Vega, quienes aducían encontrarse en situación
de riesgo y hacinamiento, por lo que, viendo la paralización de la obra, optaron por ocupar las
construcciones inconclusas, situación que persistía al momento de la evaluación final. Los
demás proyectos de viviendas de sustitución no pudieron ser ejecutados por la no
disponibilidad de terrenos, la resistencia manifiesta de vecinos y por la reformulación de
algunas obras y del Plan de Reasentamiento respectivo.

Aprovechando la experiencia desarrollada por el equipo de reasentamiento, y ante la
necesidad de reasentar a los afectados por la ampliación de la Calle Zulia se acordó continuar
con la consecución de lo que se denominó "viviendas de reemplazo". Viviendas similares,
pero en mejores condiciones que las ocupadas en ese momento por familias sujetas a
reubicación. Esta decisión generó un inventario de viviendas en venta (mercado secundario)
en La Vega, que llegó a conformar una oferta inmobiliaria de 3 a 1 en dichos sectores.

Al continuar las acciones de reasentamiento se contrataron los primeros avalúos, para lo cual
se utilizó el método de valoración basado en costos de reposición, que consiste en determinar


                                           84

el valor de los inmuebles con base en los costos de construcción actualizados, depreciándolos
por el tiempo transcurrido desde la construcción y el estado actual de las edificaciones.

La política implementada por el Proyecto Cameba en relación al Plan de Acciones de
Reasentamiento contempla como factor fundamental la previsión y resolución de conflictos
que se presentan entre la unidad ejecutora y los afectados debido al desplazamiento.
Los lineamientos se pueden resumir en lo siguiente: definición de la vocería, generación de
confianza, arreglos con base en acuerdos entre los involucrados, asesoría permanente de los
afectados y atención de reclamos.

Para el momento de la Evaluación Final del Proyecto Cameba, el número de familias
reasentadas por el Proyecto era 115, de las cuales 85 familias se ubicaron en el sector UPF-
04 Petare Norte y 30 familias en el sector UPF-10 de La Vega, cuyas viviendas estaban en
situación de riesgo inminente geotécnico o afectados por ejecución de obras, o por vialidad.
En Petare Norte, del total reasentado se realizaron indemnizaciones monetarias en el 10% de
las familias afectadas, se reemplazaron 18% por riesgo geotécnico, el 41% se reemplazó por
ejecución de obras, al 30% se le hicieron arrendamientos y no hay información del 1%.

En la UPF-10 La Vega, se notaron niveles de insatisfacción con el reasentamiento, vinculadas
principalmente, a las mejoras de habitabilidad, porque consideraban que se mantienen los
riesgos geotécnicos y presentan algunas filtraciones y deslizamientos de tierras por lluvias.
Otro aspecto señalado fue la titularidad de la tierra, en cuyo otorgamiento se presentaron
retrasos o lentitud en el proceso de adjudicación, hecho evidente en un proceso inédito para el
País.

Para el sector de UPF-04 Petare Norte, hay familias con alto grado de preocupación por que
no han sido reasentados sino de forma provisional, lo cual perciben como una solución
temporal a sus problemas. Igualmente, se quejan de las malas condiciones de la edificación,
servicios eléctricos, drenajes de lluvia y aguas servidas.

1.6 Regularización de la Tenencia de la Tierra:
El proceso de Regularización de la Tenencia de la Tierra -previsto en el convenio- se ve
impulsado con la promulgación del Decreto Presidencial 1.666 de fecha 4 de febrero de 2002.
Posteriormente y producto de negociaciones con la empresa privada, el 30 de octubre de ese
mismo año la Fundación para el Desarrollo de la Vega -FUNDAVEGA- otorga en donación
pura y simple a Fundacomun, 107 hectáreas antes propiedad de la Fábrica de Cemento La
Vega, dividido en seis (6) lotes determinados en el documento respectivo, condicionado a que
fueran transferidos a los legítimos ocupantes de parcelas sin ningún costo para estos.

Para llevar el proceso de titularidad Fundacomun contrató a la Consultora RTT Guerra y
Asociados para realizar el levantamiento de información y las adjudicaciones de tierras en
trabajo con los comités de tierras urbanas (CTU).

En una primera etapa, en los años 2002 y 2003, se realizaron dos actos de adjudicación de
tierras urbanas en la UPF-10 La Vega. El primero de ellos coordinado por la UMP, donde
fueron entregados 1.122 títulos de tierra y el segundo por la empresa consultora RTT Guerra
y Asociados, que para mediados de 2003 formalizó la entrega de 1.294 títulos de tierra.

Para marzo de 2004, a fin de optimizar el proceso de adjudicaciones y que este fuera
protagonizado por la comunidad organizada, se constituyó la Cooperativa Visión Urbana 82
RL, responsable de coordinar las acciones finales para regularizar la tenencia de la tierra en


                                            85

La Vega y las parcelas pendientes de adjudicación en terrenos cedidos por FundaVega a
Fundacomun y de articular los procesos con 185 comités de tierra que actuaban en esa fecha
en esa UPF. Esta cooperativa logró registrar en el año 2006, 1.156 títulos de tierra.

El número de parcelas adjudicadas en La Vega fue de 3.567, que al multiplicarlo por un
factor de 2,25 para establecer la densidad poblacional, resultan en 8.026 familias beneficiarias.
Esta cifra representa el 41 % del total de 19.770 familias de la UPF-10 La Vega.

Conviene destacar que el proceso de regularización de la tenencia iniciado en La Vega
catalizó el proceso de participación comunitaria. En tal sentido, se conformaron los comités
de tierra urbana, quienes representan a las comunidades en la titularización de la tierra. Estos
comités son elegidos en asambleas por las comunidades y representan a un máximo de 200
viviendas. Entre las funciones que cumplen están: realizar los censos de pobladores
localizados en su poligonal urbana, efectuar un inventario de las viviendas en la zona,
certificar la residencia de los pobladores y ayudar a conformar los expedientes de cada
familia a ser titularizada.

Para la fecha de promulgación del decreto 1.666, Cameba efectuaba los catastros integrales y
los censos socio-económicos de La Vega y Petare Norte, realizados por el Consorcio
Congede-Econ y por el Consorcio Proconsult-Estereofoto respectivamente. El catastro y el
levantamiento socio-económico bien avanzados en La Vega, fueron determinantes en la
realización del proceso de titularidad, al servir como base para determinar los beneficiarios,
tamaño de lotes, el número de inmuebles y pisatarios con derechos legítimos a serles
otorgadas las parcelas en un porcentaje equivalente a la proporción de ocupación del
inmueble.
Como parte del proceso de regularización de la tenencia de la tierra, correspondió a
Fundacomun-Cameba la elaboración de los documentos de propiedad de los terrenos cedidos
por FundaVega y los títulos de propiedad a los beneficiarios para su presentación y posterior
protocolización ante el registro para su formalización y transferencia a los legítimos
ocupantes.

El proceso de adjudicación de títulos de propiedad de la tierra en Petare Norte se inicia el año
2004, para esa fecha se habían fortalecido las relaciones con las comunidades, lo que facilitó
la conformación de los CTU y la asistencia técnica por parte de Cameba.

En consideración que los terrenos de Petare Norte eran propiedad del Municipio Sucre y en
virtud de que la Alcaldía al momento había realizado muy poco aporte financiero en obras
como contraparte de esa municipalidad a la ejecución del Proyecto Cameba, se llegó a un
acuerdo mediante el cual los aportes de esta municipalidad se incrementarían con la
transferencia de los terrenos de Petare Norte mediante la figura de dación en pago. Con el fin
de agilizar este proceso se convocó a un Cabildo Abierto en el Coliseo La Urbina con
asistencia de los concejales y con la participación clave de las comunidades de Petare Norte,
donde los concejales -originalmente se resistían- se comprometieron públicamente a ceder los
terrenos a Fundacomun, para que este organismo -a través de Cameba- procediera a efectuar
el proceso de regularización de la tenencia de la tierra a los legítimos ocupantes residentes en
el sector.

Para la fecha del levantamiento de información del estudio de Evaluación Final del Proyecto
Cameba se habían conformado 134 Comités de Tierra Urbana y otorgado 3.452 parcelas, con
una densidad poblacional de 2,7 se beneficiaron más de 9.320 familias equivalente al 28% de
las 33.720 familias de la UPF-04 Petare Norte.


                                           86

   Un aspecto a destacar como resultado de la experiencia de Cameba en la gestión de la
   regularización de la tenencia de la tierra, es la transferencia de las metodologías de este
   proceso a la Oficina Técnica Nacional de Tierras Urbanas (OTN) ente adscrito al Ejecutivo
   Nacional. Asimismo, la capacitación y asistencia técnica prestada por el proyecto a
   funcionarios de Fundasucre organismo adscrito a la Alcaldía del Municipio Sucre, la cual se
   habilitó técnicamente para adelantar el proceso de entrega de títulos de propiedad de la tierra
   en las otras comunidades de este municipio.

   1.7 Percepción en cambio de calidad de vida:
   Según los resultados de la Evaluación Final del Proyecto Cameba, la cual contempló y
   ejecutó sesiones con grupos beneficiarios del proyecto -denominados Focus Group- estos
   señalaron que hubo cambios sustanciales en sus comunidades gracias a las mejoras
   introducidas por Cameba. Los líderes entrevistados señalaron: estímulos generados hacia un
   nuevo liderazgo, apoyo continuo del acompañamiento social y preparación de la comunidad
   en el conocimiento y la inspección de obras. Sin embargo, se presentaron quejas respecto a la
   velocidad de la construcción de obras, problemas con las empresas contratistas y otros por
   obras inconclusas o con retraso -23 obras de 131- en los lapsos originalmente previstos.

   1.8 Plan de educación ambiental:
   Los planes de educación ambiental fueron elaborados el año 2000, pero fueron implantados el
   2005. A pesar del retraso en el inicio de las actividades relacionadas con la elevación de los
   niveles de conservación ambiental, se pueden considerar logros positivos en la ejecución del
   plan, concebido de manera extensiva e intensiva. Extensiva en cuanto a abarcar a la mayor
   cantidad de población e intensiva desde el punto de vista pedagógico a fin de transmitir
   conocimientos y generar actitudes y conductas favorables hacia el ambiente en general y en
   particular hacia el medio modificado. Para lograr el primer objetivo se estableció una
   metodología que abarcó el inventario de las principales obras ejecutadas por el Proyecto
   Cameba y la población ubicada en su área de influencia, clasificada por edad y sexo. Ello
   permitió definir el contenido de los programas y promover las acciones para el
   mantenimiento y conservación de las obras por parte de las comunidades involucradas. Con
   respecto al contenido pedagógico, el mismo se realizó mediante charlas, talleres y
   operaciones de mantenimiento y limpieza con la participación interactiva de la población.

   El manejo de los desechos sólidos y los inconvenientes de los organismos de recolección se
   presenta como el principal problema ambiental en las zonas donde el Proyecto intervino, lo
   cual representa un peligro para la sustentabilidad -a largo plazo- de las obras ejecutadas.

2. Desarrollo institucional:
   Tres aspectos se incorporaron en el desarrollo institucional. El primero incluye las acciones
   dirigidas al fortalecimiento en la gestión de los municipios Sucre y Libertador con el fin de
   generar capacidades para la planificación urbana de los asentamientos urbanos y su
   incorporación como objetos y sujetos al resto de la urbe formal. La regularización o
   formalización de estos procesos se inició con la realización de los estudios catastrales y
   encuestas socio-económicas en Petare Norte y La Vega. Aunque el desarrollo de ambos
   instrumentos fue diferente en ambas alcaldías, es importante señalar logros en cuanto a: la
   actualización de la sectorización de los catastros, el desarrollo e implantación del Sistema
   Integral Geográfico y Catastral Automatizado (SIGCA), la dotación de equipos de
   computación, plotters, impresoras y licencias de Auto Cad-Maps Info. Asimismo, se adiestró
   al personal de las direcciones de catastro en la operación del SIGCA y en el manejo de la
   ficha catastral y el archivo. Otros aspectos del fortalecimiento municipal comprendieron la


                                             87

   realización de los planes especiales de mejoramiento urbano en zonas de barrios con sus
   respectivas ordenanzas, los cuales contienen las bases para atender de manera integral,
   planificada y participativa las acciones dirigidas a mejorar la calidad de vida de esos sectores,
   mediante la dotación de infraestructura y las previsiones para actuar en un horizonte probable
   de 20 años. Sin embargo, es necesario acotar que para el momento de la evaluación final del
   Proyecto Cameba estos instrumentos de planificación en su fase final, aún no habían sido
   aprobados por los concejos municipales respectivos. También, como parte de este
   fortalecimiento institucional se transfirieron tecnologías sociales para llevar adelante los
   procesos de regularización de la tenencia de la tierra entre otros aportes.

   Un segundo aspecto desarrollado por el proyecto se refiere a la creación de mecanismos de
   coordinación interinstitucional lo cual permitió generar sinergias entre los organismos de
   actuación física y social en ambas UPFs. Esta coordinación se llevó a efecto en tres niveles:
   1) Las mesas de diálogo y concertación entre los organismos y representantes comunales.
   2) Los consejos técnicos entre los organismos presentes, tanto en La Vega como en Petare
   Norte y una representación comunal seleccionada por las propias comunidades. 3) Los
   consejos consultivos, los cuales contaron con los representantes de máximo nivel directivo de
   los organismos presentes en el convenio del Proyecto Cameba. Los dos primeros niveles de
   coordinación estuvieron vigentes hasta la finalización del proyecto. No fue el caso de los
   consejos consultivos que no se efectuaron con regularidad entre el 2003 y el 2004. Todos
   estos mecanismos de coordinación potenciaron las obras y programas sociales en los ámbitos
   de actuación.

   El tercer aspecto del fortalecimiento institucional estuvo dirigido a la Unidad de Manejo del
   Proyecto, tanto en Fundacomun como a lo interno de la estructura organizacional de Cameba.
   Esta unidad presentó dificultades, principalmente por la alta rotación del personal tanto
   directivo como técnico, lo cual trajo dificultades en la curva de aprendizaje organizacional,
   efecto este, que tuvo consecuencias en los alcances de las metas del proyecto y dificultades
   en el acoplamiento del personal. Asimismo, se presentaron cambios en el organigrama y las
   funciones no estuvieron necesariamente referenciadas a un manual de organización.

3. Microcréditos para el mejoramiento de viviendas:
   Este componente del Proyecto Cameba no fue desarrollado como estaba previsto. Varios
   factores influyeron para que los objetivos planteados fueran diferidos. Cuando se estableció el
   alcance del componente se acordó fijar una garantía de un millón de dólares -provenientes del
   aporte local- para avalar las operaciones crediticias del organismo responsable de los
   empréstitos para que las familias beneficiarias contarán con los recursos económicos que le
   permitieran mejorar sus viviendas en aspectos como unidades sanitarias techos y fachadas,
   ampliaciones, mejor distribución de los espacios para evitar el hacinamiento, ventilación e
   iluminación, entre los principales. Con el mejoramiento de las viviendas se pretendía ampliar
   las condiciones residenciales que complementarían la mejora integral de las condiciones de
   vida o hábitat dignos para las familias de Petare Norte y La Vega. Otro objetivo colateral de
   este componente se refería a ampliar las posibilidades de empleo en las zonas de intervención
   del Proyecto Cameba. Ello en virtud de la gran cantidad de población y de viviendas en estas
   áreas, lo que significaba beneficios adicionales en la economía local.

   Entre los principales factores que impidieron la implantación original del Plan de
   Microcréditos para Mejoramiento de Viviendas estuvo: la cambiante situación legal en el área
   de microfinanzas y la proliferación de organismos de créditos para los sectores populares.
   Estos dos factores influyeron decididamente en que se acordara posponer la ejecución de este
   componente para cuando las condiciones del ambiente financiero popular decantaran, por


                                              88

    cuanto, al plantear un mecanismo de carácter financiero para mejorar viviendas adjudicado a
    una entidad, pública, privada y/o mixta, con los cambios en proceso, generarían importantes
    expectativas que entorpecerían el manejo financiero y el logro de los objetivos del
    componente.

    Todavía para la fecha de culminación del proyecto las reformas legales se estaban
    produciendo. En efecto, para marzo de 2006 ­año de cierre del proyecto- se promulgó la Ley
    de los Consejos Comunales, dirigida a canalizar e implantar las transferencias de
    competencias y de recursos económicos a las comunidades para efectuar programas de
    desarrollo social. En esta Ley se incluye la figura de los bancos comunales los cuales
    efectuarían el manejo financiero de los recursos que se les transfieran a las comunidades.



IV. Gobernabilidad Institucional y Política Durante la Ejecución del Proyecto

        4.1 Interna:
                · Fundacomun y UMP
                · Cambios en Junta Directiva
                · Cambios de Gerente General
                · Rotación de personal
                · Aplicación del Manual de Organización, Método y Procesos.
                · Integración UMP con Fundacomun: Enclave o Integración.

Como se ha señalado, durante el Proyecto se presentaron circunstancias que repercutieron
negativamente en el logro de los alcances de metas programadas inicialmente. En este sentido, a
lo interno se pueden mencionar factores institucionales en la Unidad de Manejo, propiamente
dicho y el organismo de adscripción: Fundacomun, que influyeron en la ejecución. Entre estos
estuvo la alta rotación del personal directivo y gerencial. En efecto, durante la realización del
Proyecto se nombraron 13 Gerentes Generales y 7 presidentes de Fundacomun con las respectivas
juntas directivas. Estos cambios retrasaron el proceso de toma de decisiones, por cuanto, los
nuevos administradores requerían de tiempo para familiarizarse con los objetivos y alcances
propuestos en el Cameba, a la vez que establecer mecanismos de interacción con las autoridades
de organismos

vinculados con el Proyecto, tales como, los ministerios de Planificación y Desarrollo, Finanzas,
las Alcaldías de los municipios Sucre y Libertador, Conavi e Inavi, entre los principales; además
de las relaciones con el Banco Mundial. Este último organismo en cada oportunidad que se
efectuaban cambios envió misiones para informar sobre los alcances del Convenio entre ese
organismo y el Ejecutivo Nacional y al lado de los departamentos de Multilateral de Min
Planificación y Desarrollo y Min Finanzas jugaron un papel importante sobre todo en las
evaluaciones de cartera donde se hacían recomendaciones en pro de mejorar la performance.

Otros aspectos relacionados con la gobernabilidad del proyecto a nivel interno se refieren a la
falta de adecuación de los procesos administrativos con un manual de organización y métodos
que orientara las acciones administrativas de manera consistente, coherente e integralmente,
evitando actividades descoordinadas entre el personal y las distintas unidades administrativas.

Por último debemos señalar que a lo interno de Fundacomun se produjo una tensión
organizacional entre la UMP y el resto de la organización. Funcionarios de Fundacomun se
mostraron recelosos de las actividades de Cameba, por cuanto consideraban que en el Proyecto



                                              89

los niveles de actuación eran privilegiados administrativamente en relación al resto de la
institución. Por otra parte, en Cameba se presentaba un clima organizacional de diferenciación
con el resto de la Fundación. Estas circunstancias administrativas se movieron en una tensión
constante entre la integración y el enclave organizacional durante la ejecución del Proyecto.

        4.2 Externa:
               · Organismos Coparticipantes
               · Nivel de compromiso de los organismos co-participantes en el Proyecto:
                   económico- financiero, obras y proyectos,
               · Entorno cambiante: económico, político y legal.

Con respecto a los factores externos que influyeron en el desempeño del proyecto se encuentran
como principales los siguientes:
      · La tragedia de Vargas, la cual obligó a Fundacomun, en gesto de solidaridad, canalizar
          recursos hacia los sectores afectados de Quebrada Tacagua y La Guaira, en procura de
          la reconstrucción de las zonas afectadas por el deslave en diciembre de 1999.
      · Los acontecimientos políticos producidos en el país durante los años 2002 y 2003.
      · La poca participación económica-financiera de los organismos firmantes del Convenio
          del Proyecto Cameba.
      · La promulgación de leyes -que aunque contribuyeron a darle mayor legitimidad a las
          actuaciones con los sectores populares urbanos- obligaba a adecuarse a un escenario
          cambiante desde el punto de vista jurídico y legal.
      · Los cambios de adscripción de Fundacomun a cuatro ministerios: MinFamilia, Minfra,
          MinVivienda y Habitat y finalmente Minpades.

Otro aspecto a destacar se refiere a los convenios y compromisos contraídos por CONAVI,
INAVI, HIDROCAPITAL en coadyuvar con sus recursos en la realización del proyecto
CAMEBA. En cuanto al CONAVI, se cumplieron importantes aportes ­aproximadamente US $
10 MM- en cuanto a        las acciones    para   financiamiento de los planes    y    proyectos de
mejoramiento de los vecindarios
­previstos de ser financiados 100% aporte externo- los cuales no pudieron ser avalados por el BM
por no haberse cumplido las normas del Banco establecidas en el convenio. Se firmó por tanto el
acuerdo SAFIV-FUNDACOMUN-CONAVI para cubrir con aporte local los compromisos
adquiridos con las firmas consultoras que fueron seleccionadas mediante el sistema de Concurso
de Ideas (método válido en las leyes venezolanas) pero, no previsto en las normas del ente
multilateral.


HIDROCAPITAL si ejecutó importantes obras (estructurantes) según lo acordado, a saber: la
Repontenciación del la estación de bombeo Coche-Caricuao- que suministra agua potable a La
Vega con el cambio de las 4 bombas antiguas (de menor potencia, capacidad y rendimiento) por 5
nuevas de mayor potencia; ampliación de la capacidad de almacenaje y suministro más confiable
de agua a partir del sistema TUY II y III (antes obtenida del embalse "La Mariposa") dejando esta
última como reserva para distintos sectores de Caracas en casos de averías o emergencias.
También se completó la remodelación del tanque de almacenaje sub-estación sistema
Panamericano que surte de agua a las partes altas de La Vega, así como, el cambio completo (2
Km.) de la tubería de 12" del surtidor principal calle San José (suministra agua potable a las
partes bajas) construcción de la red surtidora para la parte baja de Valle Alegre y un número
importante de obras de aducción y sustitución ejecutadas conjuntamente con el Proyecto a nivel
de los vecindarios. Con respecto al INAVI, debido a las fluctuaciones económicas y políticas del



                                              90

país esta institución tuvo limitaciones para cumplir con sus obligaciones en cuanto a la ejecución
de las viviendas de sustitución en La Vega, como resultado de ello se produjo una reducción en la
cantidad de obras y proyectos a realizar, disminuyendo evidentemente el impacto de bienestar en
los barrios objeto de atención del CAMEBA. Igual referencia podemos reseñar de la Gobernación
del estado Miranda (no aportó tampoco) y de las alcaldías de los municipios Sucre del estado
Miranda y Libertador en el Distrito Capital lograron aportes promedio equivalentes al 20 % y 25
% de lo programado en obras equivalentes a las ejecutadas por el proyecto en Petare Norte y La
Vega.



V. Dimensión económica-financiera:

El monto del préstamo convenido entre el Banco Mundial y el Gobierno de Venezuela fue de US
$ 60.700.000,oo (Sesenta Millones Setecientos Mil Dólares) a una tasa de cambio de Bs. 537 por
dólar. Este acuerdo de préstamo sufrió varias modificaciones durante la ejecución del Proyecto
por la inclusión de nuevas categorías de inversión, cambios en el monto del préstamo y ajustes de
los pari-passu. En mayo de 2005 se pactó una reducción del 41% en el monto del préstamo, lo
cual en definitiva alcanzó un monto de US $ 35.707.000,oo a ejecutar finalmente con una tasa
cambiaria de Bs. 2.150 por dólar. El comportamiento de la dimensión económica financiera
refleja el proceso de aprendizaje y evolución del Proyecto. En efecto, entre el año 1999 y 2002 se
presentaron bajos niveles de desembolsos que comprometieron el desenvolvimiento expedito del
Proyecto. Es a partir del año 2004 cuando se incrementa considerablemente el ritmo de ejecución
de las obras y proyectos y se aumenta la relación entre lo programado y lo ejecutado con una
mayor utilización de recursos económicos, tanto internos como externos. Asimismo, se obtuvo
una mejor pericia y control en el manejo de los fondos.


      El próximo cuadro presenta el análisis de los desembolsos desde el año 1999 hasta Ene.

VI. Mecanismos de Seguimiento, Control y Evaluación del Proyecto

El Proyecto Cameba en su formulación contenía variables e indicadores referenciales para el
seguimiento, control y evaluación de su desempeño. Sin embargo, la utilización del Programa
para el seguimiento de la programación financiera Sigma presentó dificultades para su
implantación debido a ser poco amigable. En este caso influyó también la rotación del personal
adiestrado para tal fin y las características técnicas y especializadas del sistema que impidió un
aprendizaje expedito por parte del personal adscrito a la unidad de Planificación y Control del
Proyecto.

Otro mecanismo para el seguimiento del proyecto lo constituyó el Sistema de Indicadores de
Gestión elaborado por la empresa Diagonal Urbana, el cual no logró aplicarse. Además de los
factores de rotación del personal influyó la poca disponibilidad de tiempo para recabar la
información por parte del personal y la falta de instrumentos de recolección para sistematizar la
información. Asimismo, no se contó con un sistema de archivo adecuado que permitiera contar
con una base de datos para efectuar el seguimiento del Proyecto en todos sus componentes
durante la vigencia del mismo.
