State Agricultural\n            Development Project will support the Borno State Government\n            in providing improved services to the southern third of the\n            state. It would aim to improve the supply of agricultural\n            inputs, strengthen the extension service and develop small\n            scale irrigation. Local communities would have access tracks\n            upgraded, enabling them to be passable for a greater portion\n            of the year. Some 135km of new tracks would be constructed\n            to open up areas with irrigation potential. Rural\n            communities would be provided with materials and skilled\n            artisans to line hand dug wells. Project management would\n            assist with the development of a more coherent long term\n            organization for state agricultural services during the\n            course of the project."}, "docdt": "1986-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
