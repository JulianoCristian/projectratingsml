sustainability\n            was likely, Bank performance was highly satisfactory, and\n            Borrower performance was also a highly satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included:  to ensure compliance with\n            provisions of the loan and project agreements on project\n            implementation, authorizing the federal ministry of finance\n            to permit the central bank of Nigeria to deduct counterpart\n            funds at revenue source should be a major condition of loan\n            effectiveness. Provision of rural infrastructure can enhance\n            the rate of adoption of agricultural technologies and\n            agricultural production, and the design and location of\n            these facilities should be done in consultation with the\n            farmers. The supply of farm inputs is best left to the\n            private sector. Seed contract out growers with proper\n            assistance can become independent and self-reliant\n            suppliers. Also, farmers can independently source credit\n            from financial institutions, but need initial assistance\n            with loan applications and references. The problem of poorly\n            performing monitoring and evaluation units is a generic one\n            for many projects and the Bank needs to seriously review its\n            approach in this area, with the aim of improving the situation."}, "docdt": "1995-06-13T00:00:00Z"}
