manufacturers of the units used in Bolivia or in Bolivia's neighboring countries.

its comments, the text of the invitations to bid and the specifications and other
bidding documents, together with a description of the advertising procedures to
be followed for the bidding, and shall make such modifications in the said
documents or procedures as the Bank shall reasonably request. Any further
modification to the bidding documents shall require the Bank's concurrence before
it is issued to the prospective bidders.

a final decision on the award is made, inform the Bank of the name of the bidder
to which it intends to award the contract and the reasons for the intended award
and shall furnish to the Bank, in sufficient time for its review, a detailed report,
on the evaluation and comparison of the bids received, together with the

concurrence, materially differ from those on which bids were asked.

application for withdrawal of funds from the Loan Account in respect of such
contract.

Loan and not governed by the preceding paragraph, the Borrower shall furnish
to the Bank, promptly after its execution and prior to the submission to the Bank

of such contract, two conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis
