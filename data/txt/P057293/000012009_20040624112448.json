modest. The main lesson highlights the\n            fact that, despite countries affected by conflict, with\n            institutions weakened by years of institutional decline and\n            conflict, the design and implementation of programs, with a\n            visible impact on the human scale is attainable. The bold\n            project approach contributed significantly to the peace\n            process, in that it provided a perspective of renewed\n            cooperation, and return to economic growth, supported by a\n            political leadership, and commitment to the implementation\n            of reforms, the drafting of legislation, and\n            institutionalizing reforms in key areas of governance, and\n            finance. The appropriate identification of the\n            country's specific needs through the Bank's\n            strategy - the transitional support strategy (TSS) -\n            conduced to stabilization, followed by the adjustment\n            program, and, served as an instrument guiding, and ensuring\n            consistency of the project objectives. Upon the\n            authorities' concern on delays regarding the transfer\n            of funds, and, in response to this issue, the Bank agreed -\n            that given the functional problems in the banking system,\n            and, under a follow-up operation to this project - funds\n            would be deposited directly into well-regulated commercial\n            banks, subject to appropriate fiduciary arrangements already\n            in place."}, "docdt": "2004-06-18T00:00:00Z"}
