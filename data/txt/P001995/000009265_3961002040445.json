designed to strengthen agricultural services,\n            livestock and environmental protection extension with a view\n            to generate increased agricultural production and sustained\n            growth of farmers' and herders' incomes.  The\n            project builds on experience gained during the\n            implementation of a pilot project.  The main elements of the\n            program are: (i) efficient organization of extension\n            services, provided with adequate human and physical\n            reosurces, at the farmer, regional and national levels; (ii)\n            regular and continuous training of staff at all levels by\n            means of a system of fortnightly, monthly and annual\n            training sessions; (iii) better linkages between extension\n            and the national and regional agricultural research; (iv)\n            strengthening of relations between crop farming, livestock\n            and environment services; and (v) functional literacy and\n            numeracy training for both men and women.  Investment will\n            be in:  (a) civil works; (b) vehicles and equipment; (c)\n            incremental operating costs; (d) training; and (e)\n            short-term technical assistance to establish and\n            periodically supervise a project accounting and budgeting system."}, "docdt": "1992-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
