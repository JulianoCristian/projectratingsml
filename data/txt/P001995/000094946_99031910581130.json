The key lessons learned are: 1) It is\n            essential to define and phase project objectives by stating\n            clearly at appraisal the short-term, medium-term, and\n            long-term objectives of the project and related performance\n            indicators. 2) It is essential to ensure that external and\n            internal monitoring and evaluation systems use adequate\n            performance indicators, are properly staffed, are allocated\n            timely and adequate resources for operation and training,\n            and are not adversely influenced by national project\n            managers. 3) Stability of project management must be\n            encouraged, by ensuring that managers are recruited more on\n            the basis of technical and managerial competence than on the\n            basis of political affiliation. 4) Multidisciplinary\n            training of extension agents is feasible and shows potential\n            to be an effective way of reducing costs of extension\n            services to small farmers. 5) Participatory diagnosis is a\n            critical factor in improving the pertinence of extended\n            technologies, and therefore the efficiency and the impact of\n            extension services."}, "docdt": "1999-02-10T00:00:00Z"}
