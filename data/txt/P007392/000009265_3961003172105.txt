MORANDUM AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECIMUTM DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO TU3E REPUBUIC OF HONDURAS
FOR A NUTRTON AND HEALTH PROJECT
1.         I submit for your appoval the following memorandum and recommeon on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Honduras for SDR17.8 milion (JS$25.0 million equivalent) to help fiane a
Nutrition and Heath project. Ibe credit would be repayable on standard IDA terins, with a maturt of 40
yes, including 10 yea  of grce. Ihe project would be co-financed with other donors for US$17.0
million equivaent Te tota project cost is esdmated at US$54.2 million eq"ivalent.
2.                     Honduras, with an estmated populuon of 5.1 million in 1991, is one of the
poorest countres in dte Western Hemisphere. Its 1991 gross national product (GNP) per capita of US$570
is higher only than that of Haiti, Guyan, and Nicagua in the Westen Hemisphere. Althou  social
indcato  have inproved over the last 20 years, hy are stll very low: between 1972 and 1991, estmates
of average life expecta   increased fiom 53.1 years to 66.3 yeas and infant moraity declined from 124.9
to 50.0 per 1,000 live births. Extreme poverty affcts over 50% of the national popu:;ion and nearly 80%
of the rural powlaon. The pwerty problem is aggraved by the rapid populton growth of about 2.8%
per yea, arising from high fertility raes (5.2 cildren per woman of childbi  age). Mantiton
among children aged 0-5 incesed from 38% in 1987 to 46% in 1990 and 20% of the cildren are born
undevegh; 38% of households lack apppriate excreta disposal and 36% do not have aoess to safe
water. The prmary health care system reaches about 60% of its trget population; and the populabon is
generally ignot about hygiene, corrt nutritional pracdtes and preventive health cae. Maternal
morlity is estmated to average 221 per 100,000 live births.  hese indiato  are much worse in rural
areas. Across popuation groups, AIDS has smufaced as a seious public heath threat, par larwly in the
northwestern coastl region of the country.
3.         Since March 1990, the Honduran Goverment (GOH) has carried out a comprehensive
economic stabilization and adjus_m program designed to correct distortions  ng from past
_ac           mimanmi_ q-   I  mand to lay the foundaton for sutaied economic grwth over te medium-
tm. Good            pc rfrmace during 1991 suggest tsat the economy is recoverwg from Ihe
1990 recession and atess toD the GOlfs sasfatory  i p    of the economic reform progms.
4.         Implemeion of te sabilization and adjusment program has had a derse im p    n
differt sectors of the economy and on te popuaion. Liberaization of the exhage rate and decontol
of agricultal prices have increased earnings forgrulture and importitug inustry woers,
while causing purchasing power losses for uban dwellers and net consmers of food in rual areas. The
impact of these facts on the real income of te poore famiies has raised profound conerns that: o)
heath and nutrition indcators may declin in the shortem, prculady amog pregnant and  nn
mothers and  den under five, who are most vuna; and (h) parens may wiraw children from
school and put them to work.  he sness of sich poteti develoments, when viewed agat the
backgrud of Honduras' undelying chonic poverty, spured the GOH to establish two innovaive safy
net programs in 1990: the Honduran Social Inestnent Fund (FH), which finances labor-intensive social
and eoomomic .  in uctmo, social series, and iformal sectr subprojects; and the Famiy Asstance
Pgam  (PRAF), which provides nutitio   asstace through food coupons for the most vunerble
groups of the population.
5.         PRA   FoodCQo"            . The GOH establised the PRAF in March 1990. A fis
pilot food coupon program began in May 1990, directed towards poor primary schoo  hildken of women-
heads of hoeholb s(Bow Mi#erJeft de FoamIa, MF), and distibutd    gh the Mumay of
ucation (MOE) in prm   sdcools in sevon d q . In 1991, the BMF benef±ed sm  120,000
sdiool cildren, with food coupons equiv t to US$37 per year for each child, financing about 17% of



their food requrement. A second pilot food coupon program targeted to poor dhildren under five and
pregnant and mnsing mothers (Bono Materno Ilf , BhM  was stated in December 1990 with IDA
mipport provided under the first Honduran Social _nvesm  Fund Project H ) (Cr. 2212-HO). The
BMI is distributed rough the Mnistry of Health (MOH) prmary heath care centers on a monthly basi.
in 1991, the BMI rewhd   about 56,000 women and chfldren in three departments, with food coupons
equivalen to US$44 per year fot each cild and mother, financing aboti 20% of dteir food requirements.
The food couons ae used by the beneficiaries to purhase food and oter basic necessities at local stores.
The PRAF food coupon eeditues in 1991 amounted to about US$6.0 million equivalent
6.         Lessons From Previous Bank Grurm Tnvolywn. A review of past experience of Bank
Grotp projects, shows that success  health projects had: (i) a reklively simple dtszgn Cfn) lbiity to
accommodate changes during im)ple on; and (ii) ases of long term sustainability though cost
recovery mechanims established on affordable basis. SuccesUl nutrition projects were chaactezed by:
(0 use of good tagetig crria; () combination of mntion Ineventom with health care and eduAin;
and (Mii) provision of nutrition assistance reaching the earliest phases of infancy and childhood, including
assistance to pregnant women, to benefit cildren before manutrition may cause pmanent damage. The
design of the proposed project incorporates the above lessons as wel a specfic lessons on nution
assistance leaed from previous Bank Group fi g of pilot food copon progmras and support for
policy on food stamps. Ihe evaluation of a pilot food coupon progam under FHIS-I has shown that
program expanson is jusied and that the PRAF food coupon programs are more cost-effec   to provide
nutrition assistance in Hondura  an in-ldnd food distribution programs. Bodt the BMI and the BMJF ae
well-targeted, have positive impacts on family income, fost ieased use of prmay he   and education
services by the target groups, and have led to a shift in the demand for health services towards preventive
services, which are cost-effective and poverty oriented. Under the BMI, preventive health care
consultations rose by 131% at participaing falities in 1991, compared to the same period in 1990.
Among primy schools participaig in the 3MJF, enrollment rates rose on avge by about 12%,
compared to a historic annual increase of 3%. Education performance has also imroved through lower
dropout and repetition rates. The evaluation also showed that the GOH should: Oi imprve the quality of
te MOH health services and facdites to sustai the Icreased demand for priay heath services; and C@)
develop and implement a comprehensive long-ntm nutrition str .
7.          I b i OWgUM. The proposed project world help achieve the following objectv: (a)
prot  groups pariclarly vulnerable to the economic adjustment process by dchnig nutrition ce
to impv the nutrition status of children and pregan and nursing women among the poorest semens of
te population; (b) supo the development and impl   on of lon-M nutrition policy for
Honduras; (c) reduce matenal, child and ifnt mority and mofbidity rates by improvw  acess to basic
health services and safe water supply and santtion, improvig the qalty of services provided by the
MOH, and by supportng heath, nutrition, and family planning educatn acdvities; (d) strengthen the
iutional capacity of the MOH, the PRAP and the Social Cabinet Executiw Seretat (CES) for
sector planning, progm formulation, monitoring, and evauaton, and improv effiecy in the
prourementof drugs; and (e) contol the spread of AIDS.
8.         Rationale for ]DA Involvem. IDA involvement In the proposed project follows te
successfil BM  fod coupn plot pogram (pa. 6). The proposed project is onsse  with IDA's
county and social secor assistance sategy to spport GOH ef  to alleviate povrty and prevnt a
deteroration in the nutritional status of the populon most at rik to the impact of the economic adjustme
program, whfle strengthening the adminisaive capaciy of the line mises. It is in line with the GOH0
policy letter of November 18, 1992, descrIbing its main objectivds and broad s for the nutrition ad
health sector. Furhermore, the project would foster more efficien allocation of resoures in the health and
nutrton sectors, and promote the deivey of nutrition asitance on a sustainable basis. IDA support
would also assist GOH effrt to mobilze dono assistance to contl the pread of H1V inlfction and
AIDS.



9.           P     m ie   Ihe project would prode for: (a) n_Da 1g nutrtionasstne
devlpinfg a lgrmnutritI  olicy (US$32.2 million equiaent to 59% of total project cost) through:
(i) formation and Implemention of a longer-term nutrition policy (0.2%); oi) expion of the PRAF
food coupon programs to about 255,000 poor, pregnant and nursing women, children under five, and
primy shool  ildren in the 13 departnents with the highest malnutrition rates (55%); (iii) technical
assistance to stengthen PRAF's institutional capacty to adminster the progrm in the project area (2%);
(Iv) nutrition education for health staf, communiy workers and mothers focusing on breast-fe   and
weaning and early childhood feeding practices (2%); and (v) annual nutrition censuses at public primary
scools (1 %); (b) strenheing the delivery of basic 4ealth servie (JS$16.7 million equivalent to 31% of
total project cost) including: (i) rehabilitation of about 130 health care centers and construction of an
etmated 30 additional health centers in priority rural areas where services are curenty not available
(7%); (1) improvement of MOH institional capadt through additional staff, staff taining and supevision
and insudtonl support to the project unit of the MOH (6%); (iii) basic drugs for the primary health care
nework and technical assistance to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutcal procurement (13%); and (iv)
support of the formulation and implementation of a medium-term national AIDS con:rol program (4%)X (c)
jngnWpmL f fl v   (S$4.1 million equivalent to 7% of total project cost) through: (1)
provision of rura water supply and sanitation supported by commuiity participation, benefitW  about
60,000 people in poor unserved communities in fbur departments (7.9%); and (ii) a medical waste disposa;
taiing program (0.1%); and (d) Moigtrng, evauationa  auditin (US$1.2 million equivent to 2% of
ttal project cmst) including institutional strengtheniag of te SCES.
10.        The project cost is esimated at US$54.2 miltion equivalent with a foreign exchange
a 'ponent of US$21.9 miltion (40%). The proposed IDA credit of SDR17.8 million (US$25.0 million
eqAlent) would represent 46% of tot project cosL A breakdown of costs and th finaing plan are
slown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procrement and dibursenent and the dibursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the stabus of Bank
Group operaions in Honduras are given in Schedules C andc D, respectively. Ihe Staff Apprs Report
No. 11235-HO, dated December 14, 1992, is also attached.
11.        Proiectalilv. Helth and envirornental health services provided under the project
would be susaned over time thmugh: (I) collecton of fees by local water boards to ensure opea   and
mantean  of water and sanitaton services, and seting up of user charges by local health units to cover
part of their eaing costs; Cu) budgetary provisions to ensure aproe fnding for ru t primary
health care ependitures, to be reviewed in anual project reviews; and (il) improvements in proement
of esenti drugs to permit meeting minirmum requirements at lower cost. Sstinablit of nutioion
asssn  would be ensured through: (i inceased partcipation of the Government In program finding
over the project life; (d) clear tgeting and exit criteria that would limit the nuber of program
beneficiaries; (ii) mobilization of additional resoums for the PRAF food coupon program from the donor
cmmmunity to sustain the program beyond the life of the project; and (iv) implementadon of a long-em
nutrition assistance policy.
12.        Project hnplemenbonT  project would be implemented over thrse yeans. The project
executing agencies would be the PRAF, the MOH, and the SCES. PRAF would implement the food
coupon program. IThe MOBH woud inplement the health services, health studies, includIg formulation of
a longer-term nutrition policy, envroental health, and nutriton education components of the project
through a project unit already operating i its Planning Department, and woud delegate the admin
of the civil works for the rehilitation and construcdon of health cenrs under the project to the FHIS
through an executing agency agreement. To assist in the impleention of the nutrition education
component, the MOH would contract technical assistance from the United Nations Children's Emergency
Fund UNCEF) and a specialized Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), the Breast-Feeding Le     of
Hondua (BFLH). The Government has presented a signed 4reement between MOH, BFLH, and
UNICEF st_sfcty to IDA to support the implemtaton of the  tition education component For the



-4-
procurment of drugs, the MOH would use the services of UNICEF and would receive technical assistance
under the project. The Government presented a schedule for the procurement of drugs for 1993,
sasfctory to IDA. The SCES would be responsible for coordinaing project Implementation, reporting to
IDA, implementing the annual nutrition censuses at public primary schools, and would receive tchnical
assistance under the project.
13.        Actiors Agreil. IDuring nedations, agreements were reached that: tO the Borrower,
through MOH, would formulate a long-term nutrition policy by November 15, 1993, discuss it with IDA
during the firt annual review of the project, prepare an action plan, satisfactory to IDA, and implement it
by December 31, 1995; (ii) PRAF would carry out the expansion of the food coupon programs with due
diligence and efficiency and in conformity with appropriate administrave, public health, technical,
managerial and finmcial practices, and in accordance with PRAF's Operational Manual, satisfactory to
IDA; ffii that the following criteria would not be modified without IDA approval: [a] targedng and
expanding the food coupon progrms which would be incrporated in PRAF's Operational Manual; Nb
selection of health cers to be upgraded and location of health centers to be costucted; and [cl selecdon
of localities for constrction of water supply and sanitation systems that would be incorporated in the Water
Supply &nd Sanitation Maual; (iv) MOH would ensure that the Project Unit is at all times headed by a
qualified professional and asisted by qualified and adequate staff, satisfactory to IDA; (v) MOH would
conduct procurement of drugs financed by IDA from UNICEF, according to procurment schedues
satisfactory to IDA; (vi) MOH would enter into contracts with and set tariffs to be chaged by Local Water
and Sanitation Boards (YUNTAs), supervise their operations and fmances, test the quality of the water at
least once a year, and take remedial actions, if necessary; (vii) MOH would carry out a study of cost-
recovery of health services satsfory to IIDA by no later than December 10, 1993, discuss the
recommendations of the study with IDA during the fis annual review of the project, prepare an action
plan, satsfctry to IDA, to implement these recommendations by January 31, 1994, commence
implementation immediately thereafter and complete it no later than December 10, 1995; (viii) the
Borrower would provide US$11.2 milion equivalent in countepart funds according to a schedule
sasfctory to IDA; moreover, the Borrower would obtain additional donor fining totaling US$3.5
million equivalent for the food coupon component by Sepember 30, 1993, and that if unable to do so, the
Borrower would provide such amount as incremental counterpart funds out of its 1995 annual budget; (ix)
SCES would ensure coordination of project implementation in acrdanc  with project pformamce
indicators and would submit to IDA semi-anual reports, not later than March 31 and September 30 of
each year, covering project implementation indicators satisctory to IDA; and (x) the Borrower would
underake annual project implemettion reviews, in collaboration with IDA, not later than December 10 of
each year, and prepare an action plan, acceptable to IDA, by January 31 of each subsequent year, and
wold implement it thereafter.
14.        Codion of Ef         l would be: .) appoval and adoptdon of a sasfactory Opeatona
Maal for the Food Coupon Programs by PRAF; (i) approval and adoption of a saiactory Water
Supply and Sanitation Operational Mana by MOH; (ii) signatre of an agreement between FEIlS and
MOH for administraion of civil works under the project, acceptable to IDA; and (lv) signamre of financing
agreements totalling US$13.5 million equivalen for the project wih other diors.
15.        Conditiom gf U isbusenment woud be: (i) for the AIDS Control Progm, the Borrower
would provide IDA with a sasfcry AIDS Control Program and finacing plan for the 1993-1995
period; and (i) for the dnrgs componet, a purchasing agreement between MOH and UNICEF Gm the
procurement of drugs would have been signed.
16.        Proect lkneff". The main beneft of the project would be to: (J) prevent a deroration in
the nutritional status of the popuation most at risk to the impact of the economic adjustment program,
through the distbution of food coupons; (ii) support longer-tm mrition and health sectr policy
formulation and implementation; (IlII) reduce maternal, child and infant morWtay and mobidity rates by



Improving access to basic healh services and safe water supplies and sanitation; (iv) increase the coverage
and efficiency of primary educaton  rugh increased uroliment and lower repetiion and dropout rates;
(v) Improve poor children's capacity to learn drough better nutrition and greater school atendance; (vi)
strenghen the nstional capacity of the MOHN SCES and PRAF; and (vii) help curtail the spread of
ADS.
17.        Enviromune   s.The project would have a positive impact on the environmert by
increasing the supply of potable water and basic sanitation albeit on a relatively small scale, and would have
a B rating. The project would: (1) protect water sources supplying the systems built; (ii) use standard safety
procedures in all project works involving rehabilitation, instlation, and operation of medical equipment;
and (iii) provide for the safe handling of hazardous medical wastes.
18.        Support for Women. The project would have a positive impact on women, benefitting
direcy about 120,000 pregnant and nursing women in lower-income households at risk of malnutrion and
mothers of children attendig grades one to three of primay school. Women beneficiaries would gain
income transrs in the form of food coupons that would increase their resources to buy food and better
feed themselves and their families. Moreover, the health stats of women would be improved as they
would gain increased access to preventive health services, especially nutrition and family planning
education, comprehensive prena   and postnat care, scheduled scr6aning and treatment for risk facors,
and proper guidance as to the benefits of breast-feeding and appropriate weaning practices. The project
would improve women's chances to avoid high-risk pregnancies, helping them gain adequate weight during
pregnancy and have safer deliveries, thus minimizing the chance of having low-weight babies with poor
svival proects and dying of childbirth complications.
19.        Ris&. The main risks associated with the project are: O) management constraints affecting
PRAF's operational capacity to administer expanded food coupon programs, and to adjust them to the
Government's longer-erm nution policy; the project would reduce this risk through Imstitional
sgthening of PRAF; (i) delays in improving the quality of basic health services in the project area due
to instittional constraints facing the MOH; the project would reduce or eliminate this risk through
institutional sarentng of the MOH, annual reviews of project implementation, and improved health and
nutrition expenditure conmls and budget plaming at the MOH. Risks (i) and (ii) would also be addressed
through close IDA supervision, especily in the food coupon program, which is a new area for the Bank
group; and (jii) uncertain sustainability of the PRAF fDod coupon programs beyond project support; this
risk would be reduced by: (a) assisting the GOH in securing donor participation for the formulation and
implementation of a long-erm national nutrition assistance strategy; and (b) attactg additional donor
assistance for furter support of the PRAF food coupon programs.
20.        Recommeion. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Associaion and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it
