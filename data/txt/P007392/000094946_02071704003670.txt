3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The project aimed to: (a) protect groups particularly vulnerable to the economic adjustment
process by channeling nutrition assistance to the poorest children and pregnant and nursing
women; (b) support the development and implementation of a longer-term nutrition assistance
strategy for Honduras; (c) reduce maternal, child, and infant mortality and morbidity rates by
improving acceqq to basic health service- and safe water s pnlv and sanitation by imnroving the
quality of services provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH), and by supporting health, nutrition,
arnd faLCily FlaLrIningr edUc%a.l;LI ac.A;vities;0 (d) DUeng1UIVen UV,ul :.ns+.L.^U.6;olal c,apacil.y VI vuhelxvl  he%.IL l,
Family Assistance Program (Programa de Asignaci6n Familiar, or PRAF) and the Social Cabinet
Executive Secretariat (SCES) for sector planning and programming, monitoring, and evaluation,
and improve efficiency in the procurement of drugs; and (e) control the spread of AIDS. Specific
targets for improved outcomes were not set at appraisal, reinforcing the main tenant of the project
as an instrument to prevent deterioration of nutrition, health and education conditions among the
most vulnerable segments of the population.
As the Government launched an extensive economic adjustment program in the early 1990s, it
was aware of uiLe likely 1Va.L1Ve  VIet   ULosh aUJU0tlV,1lL pLrULalil VIL ULe real :ncIUr.V VI uil
poorest families, with potentially serious health and nutrition consequences, particularly among
poor pregnant ana nursmg mothers ana children under five. It was feared that the welfare of
children from poor families might deteriorate as parents faced increased economic pressure, and
withdrew children from school to put them to work. The seriousness of such potential
developments, against the background of the country's underlying chronic poverty, spurred the
Government to establish two innovative safety net programs in 1990. First, the Honduran Social
Investment Fund (Fnndn Hnndurefin de !nv.veiin Snral Or ForTHTS) which financed
labor-intensive social and economic infrastructure, social services and informal sector subprojects.

most vulnerable groups. The PRAF has pioneered demand-side interventions in Latin America by
combining supporting desirable healith and education outcomes thorough providing incentives to
mothers to take their children to health centers for well-child care and to keep them in school,
while at the same time supporting the objective of reducing child malnutrition. The incentives
took the form of food coupons distributed to poor mothers: the Bono Materno-Infantil
(matemal-child coupon) and the Bono Escolar (coupon for school-age children). Both the FHIS
and thie PR AF w ere endnorsed and supported by TDA

Parallel financing would be provided byUSAID, the World Food Program, UNDP, UNICEF,
PAHO and other donors, as well as project beneficiaries.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The Supplemental Credit was prompted by hurricane Mitch, the most calamitous natural disaster
affecting the country in this century. In particular, additional funding was required to prevent
famine, epidemics and massive deterioration of health conditions. To respond to this new
situation, the Supplemental Credit, like the original Credit, aimed to reduce matemal and child
mortality and morbidity by increasing access to basic health services and to water and sanitation

services; to improve nutritional services for the poorest segment of the population; and to
strength.en the institutional caparity of the MOH to control the spread of communicable diseases.

emi-ergencey au'e inncidenlce of' cole,u-il m  laiaruaa derlglie, 1eptosp:.. oss and .ueclswsrs-g
The project also aimed to support vector control and disease prevention activities. Thus, the
original project objectives were reinforced but not changed.
A Supplemental Credit of SDR 7.5 million, equivalent to US$ 10.4 million, was approved by the
Board on January 28, 1999, less than three-month following hurricane Mitch. At that time, the
closing date for the project was extended by one year from 12/31/1999 to 12/31/2000, and
subsequently by ana dditional six months to Tune 30, 2001, in order to permit comnietion of
project activities.

short-term aims proved to be more achievable than the longer-term goals.
In subsequent sections, this report uses project cost figures that aggregate the original and the
supplementa> credit amounts. Tn qom- cases, Supplemental Compnnent B2 to B are combined, in
order to facilitate comparisons between appraisal and actual figures. Total project cost at

3.S Quality at Entry:
The project was designed before routine quality assessments were instituted, thus there is no
QAG rating. However, for the purposes of this report the project's quality at entry is rated as
satisfactory. The project design was consistent with the 1991 Population, Health and Nutrition
Sectnr Review; and built on the IDA's active involvement in the Government's povertv alleviation
efforts, including support for the FHIS, for a water supply project, for the Living Standards
Measurement S-v-,ey as well as for tec,hcal assistance provided to P Alp r.nr to nroject
inception. The preparation of the original project was supported at both political and technical
. I-  -  I  --    -- _ -- in~1 -    ~A   --- _ -J
levels, and incorporated reievant iessons. it represented the first project in ule Latin tArenca and
the Caribbean region in which demand-side incentives (food coupons) were combined with
strengthening the supply side (MOH institutional capacity-building) to form a coherent social
protection strategy. The design innovations of the project have became a model for social
protection interventions in other countries. With respect to the Supplemental Credit, its main
virhte was that of a clear focus on controlling the spread of communicable diseases and it
opportune timing. It represented a quickly and appropriate response to the post-hurricane health
-Al .-.u;.fion needs~, c1ara-terived b caef!! valaM4--o ofng=ro.yi..<r.;on  ime at
minimizing the risks of an epidemic and famine.
For both the original and the supplemental credits, the development objectives were realistic and
consistent with the Government's strategy, which addressed the priority needs in the nutrition and
health sectors. The Bank correctly identified sector policy issues, and addressed the main
institutional and policy constraints in the design of the project. By including water and sanitation,
nutrition, and basic health services within one project; the design demonstrated an understanding
of the multiple determinants of health. This broad view of the health sector implied a high degree

Overall nutrition, health and basic education impact. Project outcomes show stable or
improved conditions in key nutrition, health and education indicators (Annex 1). Thus the project
did reach its the desired objective of avoiding the risk of a deterioration of social conditions in the
face of economic adjustment and massive natural disaster. The improvements noted can be traced

linking health posts in isolated rural areas with hub hospital facilities for the first time in the
history of the country. This network, was strategically important during the time of emergency
following hurricane Mitch because it proved the only means to reach many flooded and otherwise
cut-off areas of the country. The network was utilized not only by the MOH but by several
government institutions to locate victims of disaster and arrange for remedial action. The
sustainability of this valuable achievement will require further support, as noted below.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The achievements and shortcomings of each of the components are described below, combined
the original and the supplemental credits. Additional information can be found in Annex 1.

areas covered by this component - nutrition policy formulation, expansion of the PRAF food
coupons, strengthening of PRAF's institutional capacity, nutrition education, and nutritional
censuses in schools - and most output targets were achieved or exceeded. These outputs justify
the satisfactory rating of the project performance with respect to this component.

creation of the PRAF. Tne elimination oI general iood subsidies was part oI the economic
adjustment program for Honduras in the early 1990s and a condition for the appraisal of this
project.
During project implementation a long-term nutrition policy was formulated and a corresponding
Action Plan was completed by Anril 19R8. The main feattires of the National Nutrition Policy
reflected in the Action Plan were: (i) focusing interventions in areas of extreme poverty; (ii)

an important step, prospects for future implementation at the national level are uncertain,
particularly on account of the shortage of professional staff and the complexities attached to a
large inter-institutional coordination effort that the policy entails.
PRAF coverage expansion targets were surpassed during the proiect. By 1998, PRAF covered
about 144,000 beneficiaries of the Bono Materno-Infantil and 170,000 beneficiaries of the Bono
Escolar - eyceeding the onrginal project tnrget of 255, 000 tnt! beneficiairies While the

2001) based on the eighth school census for children ages 6-9 concluded that, on average,
malnutrition decreased from 40.6 to 36.2 percent between 1997 and 2001. It is reasonable to
assume that some of this improvement is attributable to the existence of the PRAF food coupons.
The yearly nutrition school census is in itself an important achievement, as not systematic measure
of stunting existed in Honduras prior to this proiect. Five census were carried out, instead of the
planned three.
Nutrition education objectives were attained, with a strong focus on training for health personnel,
cor-0ritaiLY WULorikr and IVUVulHrS in breusi-Ieedung, n-uio UUdI-uwing weaning and nutrition of
preschool children. With the intervention of a specialized NGO supported by the project, 20,000
women were trained in breast-feeding techniques, and more than 7,000 health personnel and
medical students also received breast-feeding training. The project worked with the
Breast-feeding League (Liga de Lactancia Materna) in two training centers until 1996; the MOH
then took over the responsibilities and extended activities to all maternity hospitals in the country.
Curricular changes were set in motion in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing and Nursing

eduationa; materials on breast-feeding directed at motUhers who work ou'side tuhe home.
As part of this component, a comprehensive child health care program was implemented in the
Pediatrics Department of the San Felipe Hospital. In addition to monitoring growth and
development, this program included early stimulation and food and nutrition education with the
narticination of community personnel (100 community monitors), as well as house calls by
psychologists and social workers. As a teaching center, the hospital has transmitted this children's

The impact evaluation of the PRAF coupon programs needed not be financed by the project,
because IDB funding was provided to conduct the evaluation, which was successfully completed
during pro9ject implementation. The activity was therefore cancelled.

success of the project with respect to the activities planned for tnis component was mixed, as not
all interventions to improve the physical quality of health centers, the MOH institutional capacity,
the distribution of pharmaceuticals, and the control of the spread of AIDS were fully successful.
On balance, the results can be rated marginally satisfactory.
The project achieved its aouantitative targets for construction of health centers. but fell short on its
objectives for rehabilitation. Some 28 new facilities were built or replaced in priority rural

rehabilitation works, performance was less than satisfactory for the following main reasons: (a)
construction designs were not prepared and contracts were issued on tne basis oI an inventory oi
needs; (b) the selection of contractors did not follow performance criteria; and (c) supervision was
scant. As a result, the FHIS, acting as the general contractor for the works, found that much
more extensive rehabilitation and expansion was needed in the selected health centers than
originally anticipated. These additions cause the average investment per center to increase from
an estimated US$ 7-000-1 0-000 to annroximatelv US$ 30,000. The higher costs in turn led to a
56 percent reduction in the number of centers rehabilitated from 130 to 57. As a result of poor

was found to be lacking in about 10 percent of the centers. A technical audit of the works cited
three factors contributing to the quality problems: (i) poor technicai documentation; (ii) poor
supervision of works; and (iii) participation of contractors with insufficient experience and
support to complete the works successfully. Finally, a large share of the centers selected for
rehabilitation were located in semi-urban areas, rather than the priority rural areas originally
foreseen.
Under the Supplemental Credit, UNDP was given responsibility for administering procurement.

Compared to the execution under the original credit, implementation periods were shorter and
unit costs were lower. Tne Supplemental Credit also was more successful in iargeting
rehabilitation efforts to isolated rural areas. Nevertheless, the planned Clinicas Maternas were
not built because the GOH had difficulties obtaining property rights, despite assurances to the



contrary during apnraisal. and as a result funds had to be reallocated to basic health facilities.

the objective of building MOH institutional capacity under this component was largely achieved.
Approximately 430 persons were recruited under the project (45 pnysicians, 82 nurses, 194
nursing assistants, 44 health promoters, 9 breast-feeding instructors, 11 laboratory technicians, 16
Project Implementation Unit (PIU) staff and 46 others). They were assigned to carry out specific
project functions, mostly at the primary care level. In-service training was preceded by an analysis
of the problems existing in the health services, and a training strategy was developed in response
to those Droblems. The strategies used were workshops, scheduled visits with suDervision, and a
system of "induction training," lasting three to five days for new personnel entering the service.
Special co,rses .,ere developed in are mornor affecteAd by shortage of nursing assistarnts, i.ncludin.g
certain indigenous areas. Personnel in a new resource category, called "Environmental Health
Technician,"- also were trained.
The staffing increases planned and carried out led to greater availability of trained personnel in
underserved rural areas. New staff target exceed appraisal targets by 44 percent and, it is
important to note, new hires were concentrated in non-medical personnel, as originally planned.
Nevertheless, in assessing the long-term impact of the staffing increments it is important to note
that while there are serious staffing deficits in some geographic areas, the Honduras health sector
as a wvhole suffers from orverstaffilng an.d associated budget pressires: the MOH has a relat+ively
large payroll (16,000), with many staff eligible for (or actively seeking) compensation
arrangements En-ai ave placed tremendous press-ures on uihe public sector budget, and impede tie
flexibility and efficiency of the system. Thus, while the addition of 431 new staff has probably
improved the quality of and access to specific services under the project, the overall effect on the
health sector may have been less positive.
As expected. the proiect improved communications capacity of the health system. It connected
approximately 150 primary care centers to a radio communications network, and established the

yet available. The project financed an initial network capacity based on 70 fixed stations, 80
portable radios and i i repeaTer sites. Tnis covers 10 percent oa health establishmnents in ihe
country. The targeting was good, as 95 percent of the stations provide coverage to health
establishments where there is no other system of communication. Activities related to
strengthening communication networks under the Supplemental Credit did not fare as well,
possibly due to an over ambitious expansion plan, but also to technical difficulties and lack of
ownershin on the nart of the MOH. These factors mav compromise the long-term sustainabilitv
of a very valuable communications network if not additional support is provided.
With respect to improvements in the highly deficient domestic pharmaceutical procurement
system, results were aiso mixed. Although technical and administrative personnel were hired,
computer equipment and transport were financed, and technical assistance was provided for the
design of pharmaceutical procurement and distribution procedures, there is little evidence of
improvement in the efficiency of pharmaceutical procurement. This remains a goal of the MOH
and a challenge for the incoming administration.

The study of cost recovery of health services was not carried. The main reason for failure in this
case was that the reauest for proposals from consulting firms resulted in very poor proposals,
none of them worth funding. As other competitive uses for resources were pressing, a decision

The main objective of improving the instruments available to prevent communicable disease was
achieved. Overall, the percentage of child (0-5) mortality due to diarrheal disease declined by 62
percent, from 20.6 percent in 1992 to 7.9 percent in 2000. In addition, a mass program for the

communities when possible. These investments contributed significantly to curtail the incidence
of diarrheal diseases.

project activities were carried out by the respective executing agencies, but overall supervision
and coordination was provided by SETCO, a ministerial- level in charge of monitoring the
implementation of projects financed by external credits and grants. A special unit was created at
SETCO for monitoring the project. SETCO's responsibilities included: (i) applying monitoring
and evaluation indicators of project implementation; (ii) coordinating inter-institutional activities
and linking theses with financial institutions, NGOs and donors; (iii) providing statistical reports
and perinodic monitoring and follow-up information; (iv) carrving out annual operating reviews

The primarv external factnr was Hirricane Mitch in 19Q8R which severely disnrpted the health
sector, damaging infrastructure and increasing the threat of communicable disease.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
By and large, the project was implemented as planned and benefited from strong support and
o.wnevnhrch;p on the part of the governmetnt However, in, the casef i-crtain a 'c"iHoo a uernmnt
could have given more attention leading to better results. This is particularly the case of

personnel leading the AIDS efforts; baseline indicators to permit measurement of results of AIDS
prevention campaigns were not developed; and there were delays in the provision of counterpart
funds for the AIDS activities and lack of procedures to manage funds assigned to NGOs. These
shortcoming indicate that from inception, project design underestimated the complexity of
launching an effective AIDS control program.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Although the project implementation agencies were not familiar with Bank procedures and that
caused delays in the initial phase of project implementation, this problem was effectively resolved
and the nerformance of the executinz agencies was generallv effective. Manayement staff at both
MOH and PRAF, although changed with the change in national Administration, proved effective;

however, was the difficulty encountered by all executing agencies in ensuring the reliability of
project monitoring indicators. Progress was made in this direction, but deficiencies stil remain. A
clear deficiency on the part of the MOH and FHIS was to ensure adequate supervision of*
infrastructure works. Finally, under less pressure from external factors and increased access to
qualified staff, the project executing agencies would have been able to document better the very
useful innovations in institutional strengthening, quality improvements, nutrition and health
management nractices-
5.4 Costs and financing:
The total proiect cost was US$73.5 million, or 12 percent above the appraisal estimate. The
increase is due to increased coverage and was financed by additional funds from the Government
and frnm nther dinnnr.. Tt i9 f-nmmPnd2h1e that T-Inndirnq wns able tn mnhili7e RI nercent mnre

supplemental IDA Credits were fully disbursed; the last disbursement having been made on June

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
ICR Rating: Likely. The sustainability of the project benefits is enhanced by the fact that the
GOHl policies in uLe areasb Ul hel-thU, IIn-uLuitio adIl Unvrnnirertal alihealti-, lhave been-- s-ust,a-in,ed ard--U
are receiving continued support. The key technical agencies involved in the project - the MOH
and P-RAF - have expressed commitment to continue many of the project activities, consistent
with Government strategy, although difficulties remain to be surmounted particularly in the area
of trained personnel.
From a financial perspective, the picture is generally good. Currently, all of the human resources

activities are incorporated in the regular activities of the MOH.. Procurement of medicines and

For nutrition activities, expansion of the PRAF coupons now is financed by an increase in the
Value Added Tax from 7 to 12 percent. Annual anthropometric censuses are likely to be
maintained with support from the Ministry of Education and other donors. Renewed effort to
curtail the spread of AIDS are being carried out with funds and technical assistance provided by
externnal dininnrs i11r1cudin. PAT-A aindi TR aswel a ' eiCpl .rm..an, Spnnidh, I U  a  ndthfFr hilatp-ral
donors. This effort may very well compensate for the less than satisfactory performance of this
aspect of the project implemi,erntation.
In components where there has been a high level of community participation, the structures
continue to work and are supported by central and regional structures. For the water and
sanitation improvements, a comprehensive training program was conducted and a complete set of
technical and administrative tools are in place, permitting community councils to maintain and
repair their water supply and sanitation systems. Additionally, this component developed a pilot
expernence in medtical unstp Aineal, xvhich. u,11 bei. e.yxpndued to the inatinn2l l-vel urith finsain.4,

Although the largest investments under the project are likely to be sustained, there are
sustainability might be at risk. That is particularly the case of infrastructure maintenance, the
expansion and maintenance of the radio communication network, and vector control program.
Although the project contributed significantly to preparing manuals and providing tools for
infrastructure and eauipment maintenance. trainine and develoDment for a sustainabilitv stratepv.
funds are lacking in the MOH to effectively carry out these activities. An aggressive policy on the

budget allocations. In addition, the sustainability of the improvements in the communication
network, whnichn piayed such an important role during project impiementation, is iikely to required
additional financial and technical support on the part of the Government. The MOH currently
does not have a strategy to update and maintain the system, implying that the network might
deteriorate quickly if remedial action is not taken. Vector control programs, although

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Most of the activities supported by the project have been incorporated into the regular program of
the MOH an.d of PR.^A. Water and sanitation improvements are the responsibility of
communities, which have been adequately prepared to accept them, and FHIS has adopted
comm-unity participation as uhe preferred modei for rurai water supply investments. Tnus,
transition arrangements are in place and bode well for the sustainability of the project benefits.

ICR Rating: Satisfactory. The Bank supervision effort consisted of a total of 18 full and partial
missions. A midterm implementation review was successfully carried out. For tne most part,
supervision missions were well prepared and resulted in timely delivery of progress reports,
although they tended to be more oriented toward discussions with the PIUJ than field supervision.
During most of the implementation period, the environmental health component benefited from
the presence in Honduras of IDA's regional specialist in rural water supply; the specialist made
remilar field visits to commiinitie- involved in this enmponent.

implementation problems, such as: (i) unsatisfactory counterpart funding; (ii) delays in the
implementation (procurement, personnel, operational agreements); (iii) implementation issues
related to NGOs and FHIS; (iv) uneven implementation of the training activities; and (v) the need
to reformulate the implementation strategy of the infrastructure component. Each supervision
mission ended with a well documented aide-memoire, which typically included a matrix indicating
the main implementation issues identified, the solutions agreed, the unit/person responsible for its
implementation and the target date. These docmments served to guide actions on the part of both
the Borrower and IDA, and to monitor progress.
A positive aspect of supervision performance was the rapid and appropriate response to emerging
priorities. Notably, the Supplemental Credit was processed very quickly between October and
December 1998, and proved to be well designed.
The turnover of task managers - five, over the course of nine years - was within the typical range
for IDA operations, but has been identified by the Borrower as a cause of some difficulties for

implementation. Task manager changes implied the need to establish new working relationships,
and sometimes led to periods when the IDA was not sufficiently responsive to project

7.4 Preparation:
ICR Ratina: Satisfactory. The Borrower was fully engaged in the preparation process, on both
policy and technical levels and made valuable contributions to the design of the project.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
ICR Rating: Satisfactory. The project's achievements are largely due to the willingness of the
Government to institute an aggressive nutrition and health policy aimed at improving child and
maternal health and nutrition, and controlling epidemic outbreaks. Throughout the

project aims and methods, consistency in strategy, compliance with covenants, rapid signing of
the Supplemental Credit and provision of counterpart resources, the latter way in excess to tne
amount originally estimated.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
ICR Rating: Satisfactory. MOH, PRAF and SETCO, all performed well during project
implementation. These agencies were able to make necessary adjustments as the project
developed, showing a flexibility that proved to be critical in allowing for added technical support
in areas of environmental health. infrastructure, and the maternal and child food coupons. Most
notably, these additional activities were performed without any significant changes in the number
of personn.el or admQinitrntiup costs T*n, fart, atirnin;ctration costs are estimrated at less than 7
percent of total project cost. The stability of many of the senior technical staff and minimal
political interfeHrence With the relevant appoiltment s are also note-woruiy.
The designation of SETCO as the external agent responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of
the project contributed to the successful implementation of the project. During the first phase,
SETCO acted as a liaison between the implementation units, freeing the MOH and PRAF from
coordination responsibilities; in the supplementary phase it was a valuable factor in achievinz
post-hurricane project objectives. It is also worth noting that UNDP played an important role in

During the implementation of the project, external financial audits were conducted and
ascertained the appropriate use and application of credit resources, as well as satisfactory
implementation of the recommendations of each audit . The GOH is in compliance with IDA
requirements as to timeliness and associated observations.
An external audit of the procurement processes carried out during project implementation showed

satisfactory results. During the June 2001 mission, the IDA specialist conducted a random sample
review of approximately 30 percent of the water and sanitation infrastructure contracts, nearly all
of the eauipment and goods contracts. and all of the services contacts- This review was
complemented by field visits, and yielded satisfactory results.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

8. Lessons Learned
The key lessons learned from the experience of this project are the following:
Demand-side interventions are an important tool to provide effective social protection. The
PRAF food coupons program was the first in Latin America to address the problem of how to
project the most vullnerable groups of the populatnion frntm. pe,+pntia11,y r.efath,e mpa  of
economic structural adjustment, and more generally from the most long-ranging effects of acute
poverty. Tlhe mvrodel estblished by PrnFt and perfected utereafter by many other countries,
including Mexico and Brazil, shows that providing financial incentives to poor families for
keeping their children in school and taking them periodically for health checks, has a significant
impact in improving the nutrition, health and education conditions of the family. The project
experience also shows that demand-side interventions need to be accompanied by strengthening of
the supply side in public social services, to ensure that quality is maintained and improved under
the fast and significant increase in coverage that is generated by the demand incentives.
Well-structured community participation can contribute to sustainability. The long-term
sust-ainability of investimntLs in water and sanitatlion is fostered by the structures tat are now in
place at the community level. The community water councils have the right level of authority, as
well as the full range of administrative, tools necessary to fulfill their role in maintaining the water
systems. Four of the key elements of success in water and sanitation under this project were:
training and community participation; community involvement in the provision of spare parts and
supDlies (including chlorine): use of apDropriate technologv (e.g.. pour-flush latrines): and
nomination of promoters to maintain the momentum in the councils, as well as to ensure that the
cor.. ty isi.nf^orr. about11 health1 m"affairer anr.d r.e%.;.vafd to oeateard  Auar.w; t2exios.er
For future sustainability, it will be important to ensure that the water councils receive appropriate
guidance from the promoters.
A coordinating body facilitated the implementation of a complex set of activities. The
involvement of a high-level authority (SETCO) with liaison, coordination, monitoring and
evaluation functions was a key factor in ensuring that implementation occurred in a timely and
synchronized fashion. SETCO's involvement signaled that health and nutrition issues were
viewed by the Government as being of concern outside (as well as within) the health sector. The

Greater continuity in the Bank's task management would contribute to better
implementation. In the view of the Borrower, frequent turnover of task managers hampered

of maintaining an on-going relationship between key players on the side of both the Borrower and
The links between nutrition and education should be reinforced. Tnere are three important
aspects to the links between nutrition and education. First, successful nutrition programs depend
on nutrition education focused on breast-feeding, rather than solely weaning practices. Second,
the positive impact of nutrition assistance (i.e., the food coupons) depends on sound and on-going
nutrition education for mothers. Third, the education sector can be an important partner in
addrevzinr malnutritionn both throu gh the cnndlct nf the anthrnnnmetriG ceniises, and hv
exposing children to messages about good nutrition.
More strategic attention to infrastructure activities could improve outcomes. Arrangements
for future operations should focus on: (i) the implications of changes in health policy for
infrastructure planning, specifically related to identification of the communities to be served,
whether staff and other inputs will be made available, and how maintenance will be financed and
provided; (ii) selection of a procurement method that is more attractive to experienced
contractors, and more competitive than direct contracting; (iii) establishing packages of works
organnied by region, rather than individlanl contracts through local muiniipalities that may not
have the capacity for quality control; (iv) preparation and use of terms of reference for

an extensive and consistent plan for building maintenance; and (vi) accuracy in estimating costs at
appraisal for worics that can be defined a priori. Regardless of whether impiementation is
managed by a private agency or a public one, as was the case in the original project, high
standards for supervision and technical support should be enforced.

Additional Comments from the Borrower: The FHIS responded extensively to the critique of
its performance presented in this report. The Spanish text of this response is available in the
proiect file, and a summary of it is presented below.

Omissions include: (a) 28 new health centers were built on schedule, in the locations that were
planned and in accordance with the preliminary designs provided; (b) the health centers
rehabilitation target of 131 was reduced to 57 due to the higher cost of rehabilitation and
expansion carried out in most centers; in other words the real needs for rehabilitation/expansion
were poorly identified during project preparation; while the average cost of rehabilitation was

the application of FHiS cost analysis methnodology.
Quality of construction problems: Approximately 10 percent of the works are reported to be of
deficient quality due to poor selection of builders, deficient supervision and inadequate detailed
construction designs. As a response, FHIS notes that the construction agreement entered into
with the MOH called for the utilization of local materials and labor; this covenant affected the
quality of the works. The construction agreement also specified that the MOH would carry out

building design and execution. For that, the MOH had 10 percent of total construction budget,
while FHIS had i percent. MOH did not comply with the supervision clause, as it carried out less
than half the supervision visits planned. During the project implementation period, mayors were
in charge of appointing builders, thus FHIS had not discretionary power to choose the best
builder. Most importantly, architectural plans for rehabilitation of health centers were not
provided to FHIS, but only general evaluation of needs, which proved fully unsatisfactory for
construction nurnoses.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
An economic analysis was not conducted either at appraisal or upon project completion. The main benefits
expected from the project were: (a) prevent a deterioration in the nutrition status of the population most at
risk caused by the economic adjustment program; (b) reduce maternal, infant and child mortality rates; (c)
increase primary education enrollment and improve the capacity of children to learn through better
nutrition; (d) improve environmental conditions through increased water supply and basic sanitation, and
the safe handling of medical waste; and (d) curtail the snread of AIDS. All these benefits have occurred
except for the expected curtailing of the spread of AIDS, as explained in Section. 4 of this ICR. Thus, it is
reasonable to exnect that the prmiect hnrachievedanposit.ive.ost-benefitratio. Even m.ore than originally

a/ The budget system does not track staff weeks and distinguishes only two phases of the project cycle:
lending (combining identification, preparation, appraisal and negotiations) and supervision
(combining supervision and ICR).
b/ Detailed project cycle figures are estimated. Total lending and supervision reflects actual data.
However, because the preparation, negotiation and approval of the supplemental credit took
place during the period classified in the system as "supervision" the above estimates do not
reflect expenditures by project cycle correctly.
