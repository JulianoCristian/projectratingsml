With regard to measures of environmental protections ail sub- A
projects are reconstruction projeots having, the same influenoe on
environment.So we hnve worked out the same oluseaCto see appendix 1) .
but there exist difterenoes among the three organizations In charge of
the aotivities of enviromental protection  and  the  three  monitoring
Institutes.But influence of sub-l projects on enviroment. bowever. is
limlted.The enforcement plan of enviromental protootion Is to be
carrimd On sooording to the version whioh the World lank has agreed
and adopted.
1  Praotioe of environmental protection and monitoring institutes.
I.At design stage.design institues take charge of the pratlice of
environmental protection of the seven sub-B projeots. At construction
stage.oonste'otors In obarge it aocording to the clauses.At operation
stage that Is traffic departments In various areaas.
2MUnder the guidance of Fujian Enviroment Project unlts,the seven
sub-projects are to be carried out by Nighways Network Reconstruction
Administration office affiliated to Fujian bighway Administration
Bureau enstrusting Fujian Highway Engineering Consultation Supervision
Organisation with supervising the practioe of environmental protection.
3.With the assistance of monitoring institues of environmental
proteotion in Fujiinavarious areas take charge of their own praotioe
and monitoring of enviromental protection at actual spot.

II.Enviroamental projection training
I.This can be seen in the whole training planahaving been reported
to the World Bank).
2.Trainiag abroad.The environmental administrators wilt be trained
on Engilah and environmental science for three months in China betore
they are trained abroad .inoluding two-part training.one In theorypthe
other in actual operation to conduct theoretical and practical training
about noise.duzst.waterquality.atnosphere and other respects and master
not only theory but also have on-the-Job training.
1.Tralaing subject.including those will probably take part In
environmental management In the future and staff members who will be
transferred to administraotive post of onvirosental projection.
1 From point of view of Fujian Highway Administratioe Bureaus  we  not
only bave  the  guarantee  of  organizations, but  the  management  of
environmental projection In various areas at actual spot. Under the
efforts of design Institutes and contractors the plan of enviromental
projeotion can be carried out satisfaotorily.

and/or planting of vegetation as soon as possible( eopeotally during
rainy seasons)s
Materials stores(espeolilly fuel storage and dispensing areas)
should be protected by a ring drain and collection pit to prevent
spills and mobilization by runoff water.AII bitumen. cement. chemloals
and fuels sbould be properly stored and oovered to prevent spills and

surrounding land uses
Provide traffic control at areas where road oonstruotion support

quarries/borrow areas could cause traffic impacts. Post and control
speed of construction related vehioales along access and within the OW,
Ensure all construction equipment is fitted with proper equipment
for the control of noise and englae exhausts
Construction activites in seasitive areas(for example. residential
areasphospitals.bird nesting and other areas wbere noise and human
activity may disrupt animal life cycles) should be limited and/or
probibited during eveving and early morning hours:
Prohibit poaohing under terms of employment of construction ctaff:

THE  PLAN  FOR  BUIT.DING   DEMOLISHMENT  AND   REMOVAL  AND
RESETTLEMENT OF THE.PROGRAM OF UPGRADING THE MEDIUM AND LOW
CLASS RUAL ROAD IN F1UJIAN CHINA BY USING THE WORLD BAHK LOAN
The plan for building demotishment and resettlement -has been
worked out according to the version agreed by the World Bank
delegation after negotiation. We have also worked out the number of
buildings to be pulled dowrn and removed and the amount of land to be
requisitioned and population to be affected. and compensation  about
the projects Al, A2,A3(to see the following tables).To carry out the
plan smoothly and satisfactorily, we have laid out a sc.hedule of
building demolishment  and  removal  and  resettlement  and  decided
appraisal methods and established executive and supervisory units.
First: Supervisorv Units and Executive Units
1. Supervisory Units,.
Fujian  Highway  A4ministration  Bureau  and  Fujian    Land
Administration  Bureau  take  jiont  charge  of suoervising    land
requisition, building demollshment,removal and .rescttlement of every
project.specific measures.as following:
(1) Executive units in charge of each project should report the
progress of land requisition. building demolishment and removal to
highlevel to be examined.
(2) To examine ocqasionally the progress on the spot.
(3) To conduct s dden selective examination to see whether the
residents will have blen resettled properly and gotten compensation
or not.
(4) The whole ptan having been carried out, we will organize the
related departments to compare and appraise the projects.

wilt have gotten compensatiVn or aot



3. To see whether land requisition and buitdirj demolishment and
removal satisfy the need of constructioni or  not.  above  all,   land
requisition, building demolishment removal and s.ttlement, all  this
shouldn't hold back constructors' construction activities.
4. To inspect actual sites with constractors in order to satisfy
