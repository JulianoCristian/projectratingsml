{"cdata!": "The ratings for the project were as\n            follows: the outcome was satisfactory, the sustainability\n            was likely, the institutional development impact was\n            substantial, and the Bank and borrower performance were both\n            satisfactory. The lessons learned indicate that clearly, the\n            province's priority was the construction of the\n            expressways. The Provincial Transport Department (FPECD) was\n            placed directly under a Vice-Governor of the province and\n            became de-facto on par with, rather than under the (FPTD).\n            The one-year delay in project completion is attributable to\n            the delay in the electrical and mechanical (E&M)\n            procurement and works. Toll rates on the project expressways\n            are high. They are comparable to rates charged for instance\n            in France with a much higher level of income than China. As\n            a result, diversion to the expressways is only half as much\n            as forecast, about 40% instead of 74%. This lower than\n            expected diversion is also due to the wide spacing of the\n            interchanges (15 to 18 km)."}, "docdt": "2004-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
