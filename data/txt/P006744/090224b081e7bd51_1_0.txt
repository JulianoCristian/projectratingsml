﻿- 18-
2.   The disbursement percentages have been calculated in compli-
ance with the policy of the Bank that no proceeds of the Loan shall
be disbursed on account of payments for taxes levied by, or in the
territory of, the Guarantor on goods or services, or on the impor-
tation, manufacture, procurement or supply thereof; to that end,
if the amount of any such taxes levied on or in respect of any
item to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan decreases or
increases, the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, increase or
decrease the disbursement percentage then applicable to such item
as required to be consistent with the aforementioned policy of the
Bank.
3.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 above, no with-
drawals shall be made in respect of:
(a) expenditures prior to the date of this Agreement; and
(b) sub-loans made by any Participating Institution (other
than CAJA) until:
(i) a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the

ceptable to the Bank, showing that the Subsidiary

and delivered on behalf of, the Borrower and the
ParticipaTing Institution and is legally binding
upon the Borrower and the Participating Institution
in accordace with its terms.
4.   Notwithstanding the allocation of an amount of the Loan set
forth in the table in paragraph 1 above, if the Bank has reasonably
estimated that the amount of the Loan then allocated to any Category
will be insufficient to finance the agreed percentage of all ex-
penditures in that Category, the Bank may reallocate, at the
request of the Borrower, to such Category, to the extent required
to meet the estimated shortfall, proceeds of the Loan which are
then allocated to another Category and which in the opinion of
the Bank and the Borrower are not needed to meet other expenditures.
5.   If the Bank shall have reasonably determined that the procure-
ment of any item in any Category is inconsistent with the procedures
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, no expenditures for
such item shall be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan and
the Bank may, without in any way restricting or limiting any
other right, power or remedy of the Bank under the Loan Agreement,
by notice to the Borrower, cancel such amount of the Loan as, in
the Bank's reasonable opinion, represents the amount of such ex-
penditures which would otherwise have been eligible for financing
out of the proceeds of the Loan.
