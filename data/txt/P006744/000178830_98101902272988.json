from local resources, and\n            particularly, to increase the domestic supply of\n            carbohydrate and protein foods in support of the\n            Government's efforts to improve dietary standards\n            through the National Food and Nutrition Plan; (b) increase\n            the availability of inputs for industry from the\n            agricultural sector; (c) continue agriculture's\n            substantial contribution to export earnings; and (d)\n            increase employment opportunities, particularly in rural\n            areas, by creating jobs on farms and in agro-industries."}, "docdt": "1976-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
