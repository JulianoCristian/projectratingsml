The project outcome of the\n            Enterprise And Financial Sector Technical Assistance Project\n            (TAL) is moderately satisfactory; sustainability is likely;\n            institutional development impact is modest; Bank performance\n            is satisfactory; and Borrower performance is unsatisfactory.\n            For the Capital Markets Development Project (CMDP), outcome\n            is rated moderately unsatisfactory; sustainability is\n            unlikely; institutional development impact is modest; and\n            both Bank and Borrower performance are unsatisfactory.\n            Lessons of general applicability include the following: 1)\n            Without complementary measures for facilitating entry and\n            exit, maintaining hard budgetary constraints, and imposing\n            corporate managerial accountability, privatization is\n            unlikely to produce significant growth or productivity\n            benefits. 2) Troubled banks should be liquidated or\n            privatized quickly, and their lending strictly controlled\n            while in that process. 3) The experience with the EFSAL\n            suggests that, although additional delays may be incurred\n            and costs increased, on balance long-run development\n            benefits are likely to be enhanced by canceling projects\n            with major design flaws and addressing the reform needs with\n            a superior instrument. 4) Development of domestic capital\n            markets makes little sense, until basic issues for private\n            sector development, such as privatization and financial\n            stabilization, have been resolved."}, "docdt": "2004-07-09T00:00:00Z"}
