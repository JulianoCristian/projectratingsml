Bank performance is rated\n            satisfactory overall. Borrower performance overall is also\n            judged satisfactory given the positive outcome and high\n            probability of sustainability of the reforms. These were the\n            lessons learned: 1) the use of technical assistance to\n            support both preparation and implementation is crucial\n            especially in complex operations such as this one. The EFSAL\n            would have benefited from a well-crafted communications\n            strategy and a supporting social sector operation. It would\n            have improved implementation and the social consequences of\n            the reform would have benefited from greater analysis and\n            perhaps a supporting operation to alleviate the impact on\n            vulnerable groups. 3) The coverage and importance of EFSAL\n            reforms requires a coordination mechanism that is also able\n            to signal to all levels of government the importance of the\n            reforms. Using the council of ministers, or a subgroup\n            within the council, as the coordination mechanism, supported\n            by technical assistance, is one model that has worked in at\n            least one other ECA country with similar reforms. This may\n            mitigate the risk of lack of commitment of certain parts of\n            the government and will likely imrpvoe implementation. 4)\n            the nature of the program, the time period involved for\n            implementation, and the uncertain environment make a\n            programmatic approach more appropriate since it is more\n            flexible in design."}, "docdt": "2002-06-25T00:00:00Z"}
