The loan will\n            provide fast-disbursing funds for balance of payments\n            assistance in support of the government's reform\n            program. The government will aim to maintain a stable\n            macroeconomic framework within which essential structural\n            reforms can be implemented. The main  components of the\n            enterprise and financial sector reform program include: (1)\n            accelerating the  privatization of the former socially-owned\n            enterprises; (2) restructuring and privatizing public\n            enterprises; (3) rehabilitating and privatizing the banking\n            system; (4) providing key elements of the enabling\n            environment for enhanced corporate and bank governance; and\n            (5) supporting the above reforms with fiscal measures."}, "docdt": "1997-04-09T00:00:00Z"}
