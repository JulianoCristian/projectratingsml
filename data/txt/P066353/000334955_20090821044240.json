         Project for Cote d'Ivoire were as follows: outcomes\n            were satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low\n            or negligible, the Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was satisfactory.\n            Some lessons learned included: as distinct from the Global\n            Development Learning Network (GDLN) center in other\n            countries including Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Uganda and\n            Ethiopia, the Ivory Coast GDLN center (CED-CI) has benefited\n            from a strong and constant support from the government which\n            helped the Development Learning Center (DLC) team achieve\n            the project development objectives. Strong Government\n            support is another key success factor for a GDLN center to\n            become a well recognized and well utilized capacity building\n            facility, since the primary target audience of a GDLN center\n            consists of senior policy makers within the public\n            administration. In Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, the\n            governments have provided continuous support through the\n            sponsoring of learning activities and the promotion of the\n            center's services across the ministries and the major\n            administrations. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)\n            activities are an important part of a Learning and\n            Innovation Loan (LIL) initial design. Otherwise, the\n            assessment of the success (or failure) of the pilot cannot\n            be carried out. This is particularly important for project\n            with qualitative indicators which usually require a lot of\n            resources to evaluate."}, "docdt": "2009-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
