A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The main objective of the project is to test the viability and sustainability of distance learning as a means
of increasing access to high-quality, up-to-date and cost-effective training for public and private decision-
makers and implementers in order to improve their capacity to design, plan and manage economic and
social development policies. A secondary objective is to establish a center of excellence in the region for
distance learning and exchange of information and experience. The project will accomplish these
objectives by providing access to high-quality training and information on latest advancements through
distance learning using the state-of-the-art communications technology.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
Performance indicators will measure progress towards achievement of project objectives, including the
effectiveness of Distance Learning Center (DLC) management. These indicators, which measure the
sustainability and effectiveness of the DLC, and its comparative advantage over the other types of training
delivery, include: (a) demand for utilization of DLC services (both local and regional); (b) relevance and
quality of courses; and (c) ability to cover operating expenses through fees (100% of operating expenses
to be covered by revenue generation by the 4 year of project implementation). Over the long term, the
project is expected to improve the capacity of decision-makers to formulate, implement and monitor
economic policy and sector strategies, which could be measured by the productivity of senior civil
servants, quality of policy formulation and implementation, timeliness of economic and sector strategy
implementation, effectiveness of community organizations and private firms. These latter indicators will
be measured by an annual survey of trainees and those with whom they work and through Bank sectoral
reviews including CPPRs.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 17007-IVC; Date of latest CAS discussion: September 11, 1997
The 1997 CAS emphasizes the need to build up capacity and to broaden the participation of Ivorian
constituents. Performance benchmarks include: (i) design new training strategy and suitable evaluation
mechanism for civil servants; and (ii) increase capacity of and training opportunities for NGOs,
communities and professional associations.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Government development strategy was defined in a September 1995 document entitled " Cote
d'Ivoire, the Elephant of Africa". The strategy seeks to achieve double digit growth through an export
diversification drive and the strengthening of Cote d'Ivoire as a regional hub. One of the main constraints
to the accelerated growth agenda is the high level of illiteracy (60 percent), the low enrollments in basic
education (net enrollment rate is 51 percent) and the limited number of adequately trained people in all
sectors of the economy. A National Capacity Assessment was completed in 1996. It recommended to
build up capacity, particularly in industry, the tertiary sector, public administration and education, and to
better use existing capacity through more effective management.
In the late 1980s, the Government has implemented a strategy focusing on unit cost reductions in the
higher education subsector, but in the absence of measures to improve productivity, the net result has
been a deterioration in quality and overall efficiency. The Government has prepared a National Education
and Training Development Plan (NETDP) for the period 1998-2010. The Plan was presented to a Donor
Round Table in September 1997. In the Plan, the development strategies for technical and higher
education were not sufficiently developed, and the Government agreed that more work was needed. In
the meanwhile, the Government has initiated implementation of its Plan in the basic education subsector
with IDA assistance. It is committed to increase the share of education and training expenditure in
primary expenditure from 31.6 percent in 1996 to 39 percent in 2000, and give priority to basic education,



Page 2
the share of which should not drop below 45 percent of sector expenditure. To improve the quality of
higher level training and increase the number of trainees, the Govemment is keen on using modem
methods of teaching, including distance learning.
The Government is strongly committed to providing professional and continuing education for decision-
makers, and, with donor support, allocates a significant amount of resources for this purpose (between
US$3 to 5 million annually according to preliminary estimates). Most of these resources, however, are
spent on travel and accommodation of trainees in developed countries (about 80 percent), little on content
development. In 1998, because of the high unit cost of sending trainees abroad, less than 3 percent of
senior civil servants benefited from a training opportunity overseas. Junior and less qualified staff did not
receive in-service training abroad. By using training services delivered through distance learning, the
Govemment is confident that it will considerably increase the effectiveness of its training budget.
3. Learning and development issues to be addressed by the project:
The project will help the Govemment benefit from the experience of distance leaming and develop a
broader program to improve the cost effectiveness of professional and continuing education through the
use of modem technologies, as a key element in its capacity-building strategy. The project will apply the
methods of distance leaming to a small part of the professional and continuing education system to gain
experience that could be replicated and broadened in a subsequent phase. The emphasis in the first phase
will be put on the training and retraining of the decision and public opinion makers in modem economic
development issues. Project beneficiaries will be exposed to the latest developments in that discipline and
be able to interact with well known specialists world wide. It is expected that this exposure will greatly
facilitate the development of a broad strategic agenda for the country, including the education sector.
The project is designed as a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL' to test the sustainability of distance
leaming in the Ivorian context. It will assess the viability of cost-recovery mechanisms in higher
education and the willingness of donors to switch a significant part of their training budgets to the
distance leaming mode. It will also test the ability of the private sector to develop distance leaming as a
sound business. Finally, the project will help define appropriate arrangements for a fruitful cooperation
between the public and private sectors in the training and retraining of professionals. As many
parameters cannot be known at the outset (demand, acceptance and effectiveness of distance learning), the
LIL approach will allow these variable to be tested and corrections to be made during project
implementation.
The project fits within and benefits from the World Bank's Global Distance Learning Network. The
World Bank Institute (WBI) and the information Solution Group (ISG) have developed distance learning
courses and the technologies by which these courses can be disseminated. The proposed project is one of
10 pilots to develop distance learning capacities in Africa and Latin America. As such, it takes advantage
of product development, knowledge of technological choices and bulk procurement offered by GDLN to
facilitate project start-up and provide needed support throughout implementation. Due to time constraints
imposed by the bulk procurement for all pilot centers, project preparation is fast-tracked. For this reason,
certain project components are being implemented during preparation, with the financing through a
Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance.
The project builds on the following lessons learned from existing professional training systems in C6te
d'Ivoire including the African Virtual University: (a) in-country training is more cost-effective; (b)
training technology should be flexible to respond to country context, and supply and demand for training;
(c) long-term business plan for training center should be developed sooner rather than later; (d)
sustainability of distance learning center must be built from the beginning through targeted marketing; (e)
a pipeline of relevant course content must be developed well in advance to respond quickly to demand
and facilitate marketing.

4. Learning and innovation expectations:
[X] Economic: The economic viability of distance learning is to be established. Cost-effectiveness
analysis undertaken during project preparation showed that distance learning costs per day and per trainee
would be 45 percent lower than the current system (see Annex 4). It is expected that the project will
demonstrate an economically viable method of delivering high quality training to replace either training
missions or import of trainers. If by its fifth year of implementation, DLC utilization reaches 60% of its
capacity, the project will enable a larger number of trainees to have access to high-quality and cost-
effective training in a wider variety of fields, thereby satisfying higher demand at a lower cost.
[X] Financial: The appropriate mechanisms to ensure financial viability of distance learning are to be
defined. Financial viability hinges on market development and cost recovery. IDA project funds will
finance a declining share of DLC operating costs during the first three years of implementation to allow
for gradual market development and changes in training practices and financing. The DLC is expected to
be financially self-sustaining by its 4th year of operation.
[X] Technical: Distance learning equipment needs to be operated and maintained adequately. A similar
technology, installed in the Bank's Office in CMte d'lvoire, generally functions well, but with some
disruptions in service. Appropriate training for Information Technology staff will be provided under the
supervision of Bank Information Systems Group staff to ensure proper equipment operation and
maintenance. A stand-by generator will be installed to protect against power failures. The technology
was chosen in part for compatibility with the Bank GDLN to fully benefit from the expertise and capacity
gained through development of this network (technical capacity of ISG and training capacity of WBI).
Future equipment upgrading and replacement would, to the extent possible, seek compatibility with
domestic and Bank communication systems.
[X] Institutional: The Distance Learning Center will be created as a public entity, Etablissement Public Li
caractere Industriel et Commercial (EPIC), with financial and administrative autonomy initially. Over
the course of the third year, its status will be changed to that of a private company with a public
participation. Arrangements will be sought for close partnership between the public and private sectors,
the donor and global education communities, as well as the civil society. The DLC is expected to
strengthen Ivorian public, private and community organizations by providing wider access to a greater
range of training for the leaders and staff of these organizations. If successful, the Distance Learning
Center could become a regional center of excellence for training, providing training to professionals in
neighboring countries.
C: Project Description Summary
1. Project components:
The project would include the establishment of two classrooms, one of these with video conferencing
facilities and access to high density telecommunications, and the other with computer equipment for 30
participants. Existing buildings will be refurbished to accommodate the classes and equipment.
Operating costs for a car would be provided to the project team to facilitate the outreach.
The project also covers the operating cost on a declining scale of the unit in charge of the project for a
period of three years, including the salaries of a project manager, a chief financial officer, a training
coordinator, and a technician, the fees of consultants (about 3 to 4 persons on a part time basis), the
charges for power and telecommunications, and the consumables and parts needed. The project would
also include the services of consultants to be selected for the monitoring and evaluation of results, and for
the preparation and audit of the project accounts. World Bank Institute (WBI) would provide its core
courses and short teleseminars, initially at no cost to support the proof of concept. Other providers of
courses would be invited to participate. WBI would help the host country gain access to an increasing
body of distance learning services. The salaries and stipends of staff while in training would be financed
by their employers.

The project will be implemented over a five year period: September 30, 2000 - September 30, 2005.
2. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
A project unit will be established within the DLC for implementing the project in accordance with the
action plan agreed with the Government. The project unit will report to a Board including representatives
of the public and private sectors in equal numbers. The Board will elect a chairman. Annual work plans
will be prepared by the project unit for approval by the Board. These plans will detail the courses to be
offered, and identify the beneficiaries and the expected contributions of participating institutions. The
staff of the project unit will be recruited on a competitive basis. Its conditions of employment will be
similar to those of the private sector. The accounts of the project unit will be established by a chief
financial officer and audited once a year. The cost of accounting and auditing will be covered by the
credit.
3. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements
The project unit will prepare a business plan based on a survey of training requests from the public and
private sectors and will detail the courses to be offered, identify the beneficiaries and the expected
contributions of participating institutions. The business plan will be updated on an annual basis and
submitted to the DLC Board for review and approval and to IDA for review. The financial component of
the business plan will detail operating expense financing, to specify, among other things, loan fund
proceeds and the capital mobilized by the DLC itself. This should accord with the project financing plan
specified above.
The DLC will submit a quarterly activity report to the DLC Board and IDA within 30 days of the end of
each quarter. The quarterly report will provide complete information on DLC operations and progress

made in implementing the business plan. The report will also highlight any problems encountered and
include updated performance indicators on DLC operations.
D: Project Rationale:
[This section is not to be completed in a LIL PAD]
E: Summary Project Analysis:
(detailed assessments for those analyses applicable to LIL are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic: (supported by Annex 4)
[ ] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$   million; ERR=  %
[X] Cost Effectiveness Analysis: [ ] Other (specify)
The cost-effectiveness analysis consists of comparing the cost of delivering training through the proposed
DLC to the current training and course delivery system for the "target market" (high-level government
officials and private sector and community leaders). At a capacity utilization rate of 60%, the average
DLC training delivery cost amounts to US$1 10/student-day as compared to US$296/student-day for the
current system for training of at least 10 days.
2. Financial: (See also Annex 5)  NPV=US$   million; FRR=   %
The DLC is expected to attain financial sustainability by its fourth year of operation, by generating
enough revenue, through user fees, to fully cover operating costs and equipment replacement. Financial
simulations determined that the financial break-even point will be achieved when the average rate of
installed capacity reaches 60%. This corresponds to about 5000 person-days of training per year. For the
first 3 years, DLC revenue is expected to cover 20%, 40% and 60% of operating costs for each successive
year. The cost of training through the DLC is expected to be $100 per participant per day, which is lower
than the cost of training delivery under current systems in C6te d'Ivoire (approximately $250 per
participant per day).
3. Technical:
The technology involved is quite advanced and requires a local capacity to operate and maintain it. While
the project will provide DLC technical support staff with intensive training in operation and daily
maintenance, World Bank information technology staff in the C6te d'Ivoire Resident Mission,
experienced with this and similar technology, will also be available to provide some support. Equipment
maintenance will be contracted out to local qualified firms or representatives of the equipment suppliers.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agency: The Distance Learning Center will be initially established as an EPIC, a public
entity with financial and administrative autonomy, governed by a Board made up of a broad stakeholder
representation (The DLC is already established). The project will gradually scale up the activities of the
DLC to allow it time to increase its capacity. In addition, project component 2 is dedicated to providing
assistance to the DLC to ensure that it can handle its functions adequately.
b. Project management: The project management team will be hired on the basis of competition.
Compensation will be market based. The team will report to a Board with equal representation from the
public and the private sector. Monitoring and evaluation, including beneficiary and client surveys will be
contracted out. A satisfactory assessment of the capacity of the project management unit to handle the
accounting and procurement system is a condition of credit effectiveness.

6. Environmental assessment:         Environmental Category  [ ] A    [ ] B   [X] C
The project will have no environmental impact.
7. Participatory approach:
A working group representing all categories of potential beneficiaries (representatives of the public and
private sectors, education and vocational training communities, civil society and donors interested in
supporting this initiative) will be set up to help prepare the proposed operation. The Board representing
all stakeholders will be designated during project preparation to give guidance on the center's marketing
and development policy, implementation of its business plan and training activities and curricula, as and
when needed. Contractual arrangements will be developed with the representatives of the major groups
concerned.
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups: Primary beneficiaries will be senior civil servants,
private sector managers, the education community (especially those providing education to ministries),
NGO community and the journalists. Training courses for less qualified personnel will be delivered to
define parameters specific to this category of beneficiaries for expansion of the system at a later stage.
Training will be delivered in short modules, making it more effective. Training courses will be designed
with the active participation of beneficiaries through annual market research conducted by the DLC
Director. Trainees from the public and private sectors and civil society will benefit from access to a
wider selection and higher quality of cost-effective training than is currently available. Educators will
benefit from being able to present courses to a larger audience and to learn from their trainees about the
Ivorian experience and context.
b. Other key stakeholders: Private sector, donor community, NGOs, Media.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects: None.
There are no discernable controversial aspects. However, there is a local private distant learning center
with similar technology financed by a French company for private and public technicians. This could
create the perception of competition although the target audience and contents of training are different.

ANNEX 2: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
CMte d'lvoire: Distance Learning Project
By Component:
A. Project Component I - Distance Learning Center Retrofitting - US$ 1.02 million
This component comprises:
(a) upgrading facilities made available by the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) for establishment
of the DLC, including:
(i) a videoconference room with a 30-person capacity,
(ii) a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations (hardware, software and internet hook-
up)
(iii) a technical and administrative center
(iv) mechanical outfitting such as installation and/or upgrading of electrical and telephone wiring
(b) equipment of the DLC including:
(i) a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) (satellite communication terminal)
(ii) video, telecommunications and microprocessor equipment
(iii) office and classroom furniture
(iv) various other equipment for DLC operation and security
B. Project Component 2 -Support for the DLC Operation - US$ 2.53 million
This component aims to assist the DLC begin operation and become financially viable. It includes:
(a) financing of DLC operation costs on a decreasing basis over the first 3 years of operation
(b) purchase of a vehicle to facilitate transport and marketing of DLC services
(c) technical assistance for the training of Center staff, periodic evaluation of Center operation
and management effectiveness and establishment of financial accounts and their annual audit.
Project Implementation Framework
Given the nature of the project which encompasses a multitude of sectors, it was agreed that the Ministere
d'Etat charge de la Planification, du Developpement et de la Coordination du Gouvernement (MEPDCG)
will take on the overall responsibility for the preparation of this project, in close collaboration with the
Ministry of Labor and Public Service. Some of the key activities tied to the above preparation will
include the establishment of the DLC and its Board (legal procedures, recruitment of the DLC Director
and staff) and preparation of the site (classrooms, videoconference room, computer room, administrative
offices, etc).
The DLC will be initially established as an EPIC (Etablissement Public a caractere Industriel et
Commercial), a public entity with financial and administrative autonomy. The DLC will be governed by



2
a Board of Directors, comprising representatives from the Ministries of Planning, Labor and Public
Service, Finance, Education and Foreign Affairs, etc., Ivorian academic institutions, the private sector
and civil society (cultural associations, the media, etc). The board will elect a chairman among its
members.
Project Implementation: The project unit established for the implementation of the project and daily
management of the DLC will be headed by the Director who will be selected on the basis of proven
experience in the management of a private enterprise and/or similar educational entities. He/she will be
assisted by a team consisting of a technician (computer specialist with telecommunications knowledge), a
training coordinator, an experienced chief financial officer and an office assistant. All the personnel shall
be recruited on a competitive basis.
The project unit will prepare a business plan based on a survey of training requests from the public and
private sectors and will detail the courses to be offered, identify the beneficiaries and the expected
contributions of participating institutions. The business plan will be updated on an annual basis and
submitted to the DLC Board for review and approval and to IDA for review. To this effect, the ongoing
responsibility of the project unit will be to assess demand for training and the services of the DLC,
identify and program appropriate training courses to increase its visibility and use in locally and abroad.
For the first year of project implementation, most training courses will be selected from those offered by
the World Bank Institute through its Global Distance Learning Network. However, over the first year, the
DLC management team will identify and establish contacts with a variety of other training institutions
capable of providing training over the GDLN. Over subsequent years, the DLC will match demand for
training to the most appropriate supplier institution, both in terms of course content and schedule
availability.
The Board will be responsible for monitoring the DLC, managing and establishing the DLC development
policy, approving the annual business plan and program of activities, assessing the DLC financial
statements and providing recommendations to help the center become financially self-sustaining. In
addition to the annual report, the Board will be kept informed of the DLC activities by a quarterly report
submitted by the project unit within 30 days of the end of each quarter.
Project Financing: To facilitate project implementation, a special account will be established by the
Borrower in the name of the DLC of C6te d'Ivoire in a commercial bank on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. The DLC will operate this special account.
The IDA credit will finance DLC retrofitting and equipment and consultant services and training related
to DLC start-up. Over the project implementation period, the IDA Credit will also finance, on a
decreasing basis, DLC operating expenditures. As the market for its services develops, the DLC is to
mobilize an increasing share of financing for its operating expenses, to achieve self-sufficiency within the
project implementation period. It is expected that the DLC will cover 20% of operating expenses in the
first year, 40% in the second year, 60% in the third year, and be completely self-financing in the fourth
and final year of project implementation.
The DLC will submit a quarterly activity report to the DLC Board within 30 days of the end of each
quarter. At the end of its fiscal year, but no longer than six months after its completion, the borrower and
DLC will present to IDA financial audit reports of: (i) the Special Account as well a special opinion on
the SOEs; and (ii) DLC accounts and financial statements.
DLC will prepare the usual financial statements (income and expenditure account, balance sheets, sources
and uses of funds) for its entire operations. An accounting and financial management system will be set
up in DLC prior to the project effectiveness. In addition to its financial statements, DLC agreed during



3
negotiations to submit a quarterly report, one month after the end of each quarter, presenting a summary
of sources and uses of funds, procurement/contracts schedule and statement and summary of expenditures
by component and by category. Assurance has been obtained from the Borrower that the project unit's
accounts and financial statements, and the Special Account maintained by the Distance Learning Center
will be audited annually in accordance with international audit standards by experienced and recognized
audit firms satisfactory to IDA.
Financial Management and Reporting: As the implementing agency for this project, the DLC, is a new
entity, the project will begin with traditional financial management and disbursement arrangements
through a Special Account and SOEs. As noted below, the DLC will produce quarterly activity reports.
After one year of project implementation, the financial management system and reporting system will be
assessed for compatibility with the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI); the appropriate
changes will be made to the systems to make them LACI compliant, including reworking the quarterly
reports into Project Management Reports (PMRs).
3. Monitoring and evaluation arrangements:
The activities of the DLC will be monitored through the business plans and quarterly reports as specified
above.
Consultants will be hired to monitor and evaluate results. At the end of each course a questionnaire will
be filled out by participants. Another questionnaire will be filled out by participants six months after the
course. A first assessment of the financial and economic viability of the scheme will be carried out at the
end of the first year of operation. The consultants will also survey participating institutions and make
recommendations to the project team for adjustments as appropriate. At the end of the first three years,
the consultants will make an in depth assessment of the scheme and revisit the issues above.

ANNEX 4: COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS SUMMARY
C8te d'Ivoire: Distance Learning Project
1.    The cost effectiveness analysis is based on comparing the cost of delivering training courses
through the Global Distance Learning Network with the current training and course delivery practice in
its "target market". Currently, there are four main methods of in-service training of professionals: (a)
international training, i.e. outside Africa, (b) regional training, i.e. in another African country, (c) local
training by local trainers, and (d) local training by international trainers.
2.    Main Assumptions. In the absence of reliable and comprehensive data on the training market in
C6te d'Ivoire, preliminary data gathered in the field make it possible to estimate the following distribution
of in-service training of professionals (mainly public sector employees who were trained in 1997-1998):
45% of professionals are trained internationally, 15% are trained regionally, 20% are trained locally by
local staff, and 20% are trained locally by international staff.
3.     Capacity: By design, the C6te d'Ivoire distance learning facility will have a capacity of 30 seats
each for the conference and computer rooms. The Center may operate over 260 working days per year.
In the long run (by year 5), capacity utilization is estimated to be around 60%, corresponding to a
production level of 4680 student-days. For the first four years, a steady annual increase of the capacity
utilization rate is projected as follows: 14%, 25%, 39% and 44% respectively for each successive year.
4.     One of the indicators for comparing costs of course delivery in the current system of in-service
training of professionals with the one proposed in the GDLN is the unit cost of course delivery per
student-day. This indicator reflects all measurable components except the "quality and convenience of the
proposed system" as it will provide easier and wider access to state-of-the-art knowledge and information.
In a comprehensive evaluation these benefits need to be taken into account although they are difficult to
quantify.
5.    Cost of the Distance Learning Center: The unit cost of course delivery per student per day is
defined as total operating cost without depreciation (i.e. total OC) divided by the total number of students
trained over an average course length. The estimated cost structure of the DLC is detailed in annex 5. The
annual cost is determined to be around US$500,000. Fixed cost represent 85% of total cost, indicating
that a high level of expenses will be incurred by the Center irrespective of the level of utilization of its
facilities. The cost per day and per student depends on the level of demand, and hence the rate of use of
the proposed facilities. The table below shows that the cost per student and per day is very sensitive to
the rate of capacity utilization. Unit cost decreases sharply when utilization of the center facilities
increases whereas the operating cost is remains largely unchanged due to the importance of fixed costs.

effective marketing tools and attract enough clients to ensure DLC competitiveness and financial

sustainability. Preliminary market data suggest that an utilization rate of 60% may be attained by the fifth
year of operation corresponding to a reasonable unit cost of US$107 per day per student. This will require
an intensive marketing endeavor by the DLC management team aiming at: diversifying Center products
and services and winning the customer loyalty through steady high-quality service, competitive pricing,
and training content relevant to expressed demand and client expectations.
7.    Unit Cost of the Existing Training System: cost of in-service training was determined for each
delivery method currently used and based on unit costs gathered in the field and including, when
applicable, the following expenses: travel plus subsistence for students or teacher (when training is
provided locally by intemational trainers), local expenses (for locally delivered training, other costs when
identified (see details in project documents). It is worth noting that no course charge (fees) was taken into
account as no such fees were included in the GDLN system (operating costs assume that GDLN content is
free of charge for the first years). Based on the above data and assumptions, the table below presents the
unit cost (per day and per student) of the current in-service training system:
Number of Course Days
Unit Cost of Training Category    % of total training  5 days         10 days
International Training (US$)              45%            910             530
Regional Training (US$)                   15%            410             280
Local Training by Local Staff  (US$)      20%             35              35
Local Training by Inter. Staff  (US$)     20%             75              43
Total Unit Cost of Current System (US$)    100%          493             296
8.    Combining the four components of the current training system in Cote d'Ivoire gives an estimate
of the average unit cost for the current training system. Depending on the lengths of the course (and - for
simplicity - assuming that local courses are delivered by only one international trainer) this yields a range
of unit cost of the current training system in Cote d'Ivoire of US$296 for a 10-day course and US$493
for a 5-day course.
9.    This range of cost shows that the proposed Global Distance Learning Network (GDLN) training
system will be much more cost-effective than the existing system which lowest possible cost (US$296 for
10 days course) is higher than the GDLN start-up unit cost (US$247 in the second year). In the long run
the estimated unit cost of the proposed GDLN (US$107) will be about 36% of the cost of the current
system in its most favorable condition.

1.     A financial analysis was conducted to determine the terms of financial viability of the proposed
project. In the absence of adequate and reliable data regarding the training market in Cote d'Ivoire, we
propose to determine the financial goals (pricing policy and cost sharing principle) and market goals
(level of demand and capacity utilization to be targeted) to be accomplished by the DLC management
team if the Center is to be financially self sustaining by the medium term (fourth year of operation). More
market research is needed to have better information on characteristics of C6te d'Ivoire's training market
and a precise understanding of its dynamics to help design an appropriate marketing policy for the Center.
Therefore, during the project preparation phase, a consultant will conduct a detailed market study which
will be available to the DLC management team once it is in place later this year. The main use of the
market study is to serve as a key input to business plan design by the DLC management team. The
business plan will be drafted over the first two months of start-up of Center operations.
2.     Main assumptions.
Revenue.
Income generation: the most crucial set of assumptions pertains to the revenue generation patterns. Given
the rapid pace of project preparation, only a very preliminary understanding of the market dynamics has
been obtained. An alternative approach (admittedly sub-optimal) for deriving a set of precise revenue
projections would have been to use training supply to determine the requirements for the center to be
financially viable and then analyze whether these requirements are reasonable from the demand side in
the context of C6te d'Ivoire. Training supply is relatively precise as most of the DLC courses will be
provided by the WBI at least for the first two years. The main assumption regards the utilization rates for
Center facilities, which are projected, over the first five years of operation, to be 14%, 25%, 39%, 44%
and 60% for each successive year. The maximum capacity amounts to 4680 student-days of training at a
60% utilization rate. The training fee is set at around US$100 per student per day: as this price seems to
be competitive and affordable for most public and private institutions (see Annex 4) and is therefore
expected to attract more students.
Otherfinancial revenue: the amount of financial support to the DLC to balance its operating cost over the
first years of operation is determined by the extent to which the Center can generate its own revenue.
Hence, it is defined as the residual between the revenue generated and total funding required to cover
operating costs before depreciation.
Operating Cost.
Satellite Bandwidth Rent: the satellite bandwidth cost includes the yearly rental cost for the bandwidth
and a corresponding service charge. Bandwidth costs are fixed costs, i.e. they don't depend on capacity
utilization rates. Annual cost is estimated at US$138,700 on the basis of existing rates provided by the
supplier.
Personnel: we have assumed that the center has eight local staff including a manager, a training
coordinator and a technician. Annual salary per staff is based on current market data for similar positions
and responsibilities.
Maintenance: the estimated maintenance costs are based on the following assumptions: locally procured
equipment (PCs, furniture, etc.) and civil works have a yearly maintenance of 10% of initial investment
cost; internationally procured equipment (equipment for videoconferencing room) has a yearly
maintenance cost of 20% of initial investment cost. This high rate accounts for possible contracting out
maintenance activities of sensitive equipment to a qualified foreign or regional company.



3
Utilities: utility costs include expenditures on electricity, telephone and water, which were estimated to
cost US$15,000 annually by comparison to similar computer services in CMte d'Ivoire.
Variable Operating Cost. These mainly comprise costs related to training and office supply, and depend
on capacity utilization. A flat cost of US$25,000 per year has been assumed (which is roughly US$500
per student per day at full capacity utilization.
Depreciation: equipment is assumed to depreciate at different rates in accordance with national
accounting standards in CMte d'Ivoire .
Fee/Interest and debt service: the government of CMte d'Ivoire suggests to carry the interest and principal
repayment in lieu of the Center to allow for sensible and attractive training rates. However it is envisaged
that the Center assumes reinvestment and renewal cost of its equipment.
3.     Financial Statements and Results. Based on the above assumptions, basic financial statements
of the Center have been established for the first five years of its operation. Table 5.1 presents the income
and cash flow statement as well as its projected balance sheet. It shows that under the above assumptions
the Distance Learning Center will be economically viable and self sustaining (reach its break-even point)
once its capacity utilization rate attains or exceeds 44% (or 3465 student-days per year are sold). This is
the equivalent of 700 professionals attending a 5-day training per year. From the market perspective, this
requirement seems to be achievable: (i) a rate of US$100 per day per participant compares very favorably
with the average cost of the current training practice (US$296, see Annex 4); this attractive rate will allow
for more participants within the same overall budget; (ii) 700 professionals trained annually represents
around 20% of the high-level civil servant population in Cote d'Ivoire; however private sector managers
and community leaders will also take training, either reducing the number of civil servants who would
need to be trained to maintain the assumption of 700 students per year, or increasing the number of
students who could be trained in a given year above 700.
4.     The income statement suggests that the break-even point (operating cost minus depreciation) will
be attained in the fourth year, when the capacity utilization rate reaches 44% (at a unit cost of US$107
per day per student). The overall equilibrium (including depreciation to allow for reinvestment) is attained
in the fifth year at an utilization rate of 60%. To achieve this goal, an intensive marketing campaign will
be needed from the Center management team to: diversify DLC products and services and win customer
loyalty through steadily improving quality of service, competitive pricing, and providing training courses
that meet expressed demand and client expectations. This emphasizes the importance of a qualified
business-oriented manager to develop effective marketing tools and attract enough clients to ensure
Center competitiveness and financial sustainability.
5.    Initial pricing of the Center's services aims at promoting DLC products and attracting more
professionals and decision makers to strengthen their management and policy formation capacity, which
is difficult to quantify in economic and financial terms. Consequently, the operating deficit of the first
three years will be covered through special Government support through IDA credit proceeds from this
proposed LIL. This financial support will match the exact deficit (without depreciation), projected to be
around US$410,000 for the first three years, making up 67% of generated income over that period. This
support will be provided over this 3-year period 80% of operating. As the initial training rate, US$100
per person, is in the low range, it may be raised in relation to the market demand for certain high-demand
courses. A flexible market-driven pricing policy should improve the financial viability of the project.

allocation will be FCFA 50 million and will cover about four months of eligible expenditures. Upon
effectiveness of the LIL, IDA will deposit the amount of FCFA 25 million representing 50 percent of the
authorized allocation into the Special Account. The remaining balance will be made available when the
total commitments issued amount to the equivalent of USD 500,000. The Special Account will be used
for all payments below FCFA 10 million. Replenishment applications will be submitted monthly.
Further deposits by IDA into the Special Account will be made against withdrawal applications supported
by appropriate documents.
