Community Development Infrastructure Project\n            for Cote d'Ivoire are to: (a) facilitate land tenure\n            security over rural land; (b) strengthen local capacity to\n            plan, make decisions, govern and manage affairs at the local\n            level; and (c) support small-scale investments for\n            sustainable natural resource management, agriculture and\n            infrastructure development, to be undertaken collaboratively\n            by government and local communities. There are five\n            components to the project. Component one: clarifying land\n            tenure. This component will remain intact. That is, it will\n            help secure land rights and develop private and government\n            capacity to survey land and provide titles to interested\n            right holders. Component two and three: enhancing local\n            management capacity and financing of local investments. The\n            component on local participatory planning (enhancement of\n            local management capacity) and the related financing\n            component (local investments) will be combined. Component\n            four: supporting decentralization and project coordination.\n            Activities related to support Cote d'Ivoire's\n            decentralization process will be omitted in the restructured\n            project because this process has been stalled due to crisis.\n            Component five: boosting rice production. In the face of the\n            recent \"food price crisis\" in Cote d'Ivoire,\n            a new component will be added to help vulnerable farm\n            households in the north and west of the country by\n            stimulating rice production."}, "docdt": "2008-07-29T00:00:00Z"}
