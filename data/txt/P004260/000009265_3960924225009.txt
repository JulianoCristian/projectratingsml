NINTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1808-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
Loan 1808-MA in the amount of US$50 million equivalent was made to
the borrower, the National Electricity Board, to help finance the foreign
exchange cost of a portion of its power system development program.  .he
project was designed to exploit the country's economic hydropower potential,
strengthen its grid network and assist NEB in improving its financial and
institutional performances. The principal components of the project were (a)
construction of hydroelectric power stations of 72 and 120MW capacities at
Bersia and Kenering respectively; (b) construction of Temengor - Tanah Merah
275KV line, Tanah Merah-Kota Bahru 132KV line and associated substations; and
(c) consultancy to conduct an energy resource study. The project scope was
subsequently expanded to include:
(a) the regrouping of remote operating controls for Bersia, Kenering and
Temengor at Bersia;
(b) a study of the feasibility for coal-fired power generation; and
(c) a study of the feasibility of rehabilitating the Chenderoh
hydropower station.
The loan was approved on March 30, 1980 and was fully disbursed on May 6, 1987
after cancellation of US$5 million on July 2X, 1985. The loan was closed on
August 31, 1987.
The following were the project objectives, which were fully
accomplished:
(a) Augmentation of NEB's generating capacity through least cost
development of the country's hydroelectric resources;
(b) Establishment of vital transmission links in the north;
(c) Strengthening of the Government's capabilities in the optimum
development of domestic energy resources;
(d) Improvement in NEB's financial performance through observance of
financial covenants; and
(e) Development of trained manpower for NEB's operational requirements.



This project completion report (PCR) was prepared by Asia-Country
Department II, Industry and Energy Operations Division, on the basis of
completion reports prepared by NEB, documents and reports in Bank files and a
PCR mission to Malaysia in July 1988.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited bY OED staff.
OED sent copies of the draft report to the Borrower for its comments.
Comments received have been taken into account in preparing the final report
and reproduced as Attachments to the PCR.

NINTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1808-MA
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
1.        Loan 1608-MA in the amount of US$50 million was approved on
March 13, 1980 to assist the borrower, the National Electricity Board (NER),
finance a part of the foreign exchange cost of the Bank's Ninth Power
Project. NEB is an autonomous government-owned corporation responsible for
electric power generation, transmission and distribution in Peninsuiar
Malaysia. The project comprised a segment of Malaysia's electric power
expansion program. The major project components were: (i) construction of a
hydroelectric power station at Bersia and at Kenering, rated at 72 and 120 MW
respectively, on the Perak River in northwest Malaysia; (ii) construction of
two major power transmission lines with associated substation facilities to
connect the western electric power network with the east coast; and (iii)
preparation of a study on the optimum use of available energy resources.
2.        The project was appraised in January 1978, but negotiations were
delayed by a lengthy disagreement over a covenant in the BLnk loan agreement
which required NEB to realize an 8% rate of return on its net revalued fixed
assets in operation from 1980 on. The issue was settled in January 1980 by an
agreement whereby in lieu of the rate of return covenant NEB would be required
to finance from internally generated funds a minimum portion (15X in FY80, 25Z
in FY81-84 and 30% FY85 on) of its annual capital expenditures. The loan then
became effective on November 6, 1980.
3.        Although delayed by close to a year because of the rate of return
issue, once project implementation got underway it proceeded smoothly wituout
undue problems or difficulties. The Bersia hydropower plant was fully
commissioned in August 1983 and the Kenering plant in March 1984 in accordance
with the SAR implementation schedule but about 11 months later than had
originally been planned by NEB. During commissioning all operating units
equalled or exceeded performance and efficiency guarantees. Commercial
operations have proceeded according to plan except for Bersia No. 1 turbine
unit which has required two unscheduled shutdowns for minor repairs but is now
in satisfactory running order.
4.        The project cost was overestimated by US$47 million or 20X as a
result of which US$5.0 million had to be cancelled from the loan because no
eligible disbursements were available for this amount. This emphasizes the
importance of avoiding excessive contingencies especially when, as in this
case, quotations for major contracts are on hand. A coament by the Government
on the PCR for the Eighth Power Project, which also had a loan cancellation,
states that the Government is of the view that large project cost underruns
result from the high percentage allocated to contingencies and that this point
be noted in preparing cost estimates for future projects.



- vi -
5.        NEB's financial position except for FY80 and 81 was significantly
better than expectations at project appraisal. A 35Z tariff increase
authorized by the Government for 1981 and a further 10% increase between 1981
and 1983 substantially mitigated the impact of high fael oil prices in the
late 1970's. Overall, NEB's financial performance has surpassed forecasts by
a wide margin. Earnings have grown such that a 10 tariff decrease was
introduced in 1986 followed by a 7.5Z reduction in 1987. After these price
reductions NEB's self-financing ratio was 4,A and the rate of return 11.6Z for
1987 which was also the first year, over this period, that NEB had to include
a sizeable provision for taxes.
6.        The economic benefits of the project remain essentially as
determined at project appraisal. The economic internal rate of return has
been reevaluated to be 13.5% which is close to t}e 13.8% appraisal evaluation.
7.        The loan was fully disbursed on May 6, 1987 and can be considered to
have successfully accomplished its objectives. Its overall successes can be
summarized as follows:
(a) The hydropower plants are operating to specification and are
contributing their assigned share to the country's energy
requirements (para. 4.2);
(b) The transmission lines and associated substations formed an
important link with the east coast and are contributing to stable
operation of the network which interconnects the entire Peninsula
(para. 4.4);
(c)  The energy resource study vas a worthwhile project component and now
constitutes an important planning tool (para 3.10);
(d)  As a result of NEB's comprehensive training and career development
program earlier concerns over a serious shortage of qualified
personnel are no longer felt (para. 6.2);
(e)  The displacement of human activity by the Bersia and Kenering dams
was minimal and was adequately compensated; so far no adverse
environmental impact has been noted from the flooding of the two
reservoir basins (paras. 3.21 and 3.22); and
(f) Two separate studies financed by the Bank loan have resulted in a
project for the rehabilitation of the Chenderoh hydropower station
and in the implementation of Malaysia's first coal-fired power
station at Port Klang (paras. 3.10(b) and 3.10(c)).
8.        Agreement on a self-financing loan covenant in lieu of the Bank's
standard rate of return requirement was vital to clearing the way for Bank
financing of the project. It is interesting to note, however, that NEB mnet
the former 8% rate of return covenant with a comfortable margin from FY81
onward, one year earlier than it complied with the required self-financing
ratio (paras. 2.5 and para 5.4).



- vii -
9.        Experience in exe.uting the project suggests the following lessons
(paras 9.1-9.5):
(a) A comprehensive training and career development program is an
essential element for producing project implementation skills;
(b) Single responsitt'ity supply and install contracts can be effective
in promoting timley project implementation, but it is necessary to
ensure that such zontracts are awarded to highly qualified
contractors;
(c)  An expert panel is a worthwhile implementation addition in tne
design and construction of large hydropower projects;
(di  A realistic assessment should be made of contingency provisions to
avoid excessive cost overestimates and the necessi ', i6.s cancel
undisbursed loan amounts; and
(e)  An early project activity should be to concentrat  tn right-of-way
and access acquisitions.

MALAYSIA
NINTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1808-MA)
I. INTRODUCTION
The Sector
1.1       Malaysia is amply endowed with commercial-scale oil and natural gas
reserves and hydroelectric power potential.  These energy resources are   1/
developed under the direction of a high level Cabinet Committee on Energy._
The committee is supported by "The Official Committee on Energy" chair.d by
Chief Secretary of the Government and the members comprising Secretary General
Ministry of Finance, Director General Economic Planning Unit, Secretary
Geueral Ministry of Trade and Industry, Secretary General Ministry of Energy
Telecommunications and Posts, President Petronas, General Manager National
Electricity Board and Director General Nuclear Energy Unit.
1.2       Power sector development and operations are the responsibility of
the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunication and Posts (MOE) and the three
government-owned power utilities, NEB, the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and
the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO). NEB is responsible for
power generation, transmission and distribution in Peninsular Malaysia and SEB
and SESCO serve the same functions respectively in the two states on the
island of Borneo. MOE serves as the official channel between the utilities
and the. Cabinet Committee on Energy.
1.3       At the time thia ..roject was prepared and implemented NEB's power
generation program depended on hydropower plants to meet peak demands and
oil/gas/coal fired thermal plants to generate base-load needs. With the onset
of commercial natural gas production in 1983 and the large reserves which had
been discovered, it became apparent that natural gas would become an important
energy resource for future power generation. This conclusion was confirmed by
a Bank sponsored sector review study (Report No. 6466-MA) in 1986 which
demonstrated that based on the economic cost of production natural gas was the
least cost solution to electric power generation at least over the next 15
years.
The Project
1.4       The project in-luded (i) the construction of two dams and hydro-
electric power stations in the upper reaches of the Perak River, (ii) 136 km
of 275 kV and 38 km of 132 kV transmission lines with associated substation
facilities and (iii) preparation of a study for optimizing development and use
of domestic energy resources. In addition to the Bank loan, financing was
supplied by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, the Canadian
International Development Agency, the Commonwealth Development Corporation and
the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. Ltd.
1/   The committee was formed in 1980 and consists of the Prime Minister, the
Deputy Prime Minister, the Ministers of Energy, Trade and Industry, and
Science Technology.

1.5       The eight previous loans to Malaysia's power sector, amounting to
US$231.2 million (net of cancellations), helped NEB increase its generating
capacity from 141 MW in 1958 to 1320 MW in 1979 when the project was being
prepared. Similarly, over the same period the transmission system was
developed from a simple network to a multi-high voltage sophisticated system
of lines and cables. The project continued this contribution to NEB's energy
needs which were then forecast to grow at a minimum rate of 10% per year for
the near future. Of particular importance were the transmission lines which
the project provided as a first step toward an interconnection in the north of
the western network with the eastern system. The interconnection was an
essential element in the government's subsequent rural electrification and
regional development program.
The Borrower
1.6       The borrower, NEB, is an autonomous government-owned corporation
established in 1949, responsible to the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunication
and Posts. It is an operating agency and has the legal power to set
tariffs. Until 1984, NEB was also a regulatory agency with the power to grant
licenses to independent electricity works. Since January 15 1984, NEB's
Inspectorate Division was converted inco a Federal Government Department and
integrated with the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts. NEB is
a well established entity with competent management. Its major operational
and policy decisions are made by the Board of Directors whose members are
appointed by the Minister. The Chairman of the Board is the Chief Secretary
of the Cabinet and the General Manager is the Deputy Chairman.
1.7       This PCR is based on (i) information available ir. Bank iiles,
reports and data submitted by NEB, (ii) completion reports by NEB and
discussions with NEB staff during a visit to Malaysia during June 1988.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin of the Project
2.1       In 1964 NEB commissioned a study to evaluate the hydroelectric power
potential of the upper Perak River. Three sites were found to be suitable for
exploitation: Temengor, Bersia and Kenering. A severe storm in January 1967
caused extensive flooding of the Perak River and its tributaries. This event
led to a series of flood prevention studies and a decision in 1971 to proceed
with the Temengor hydropower project for both its power generation and flood
control capacity. With the Temengor project underway, there arose an
increased interest in developing Bersia and Kenering, especially in light of
the escalating petroleum prices in the early 1970's.
2.2       NEB appointed two expatriate firms, hereafter referred to as the
Hydropower Consultant and the Transmission Consultant which were associated
with developing Bersia and Kenering from the initial project preparation stage
to project management, design, engineering and construction supervision. The
Hydropower Consultant carried out the early (1964) evaluation and
preinvestment studies and the geo-technical investigations followed by the



- 3 -
project preparation activities connected with the dams and generating
facilities. The Transmission Consultant was similarly involved in activities
connected with power transmission. Preliminary design got underway in August
1977.
Project Appraisal
2.3       The Bank preappraisal mission visited Malaysia in October 1977 and
the appraisal mission in January 1978. By this time, design and engineering
had reached the stage where bid prices were available for civil works and
major equipment contracts. As a result of the advanced state of project
preparation, the appraisal proceeded smoothly up to scheduling loan negotia-
tions when a serious snag developed.
2.4       Under inscruction from the Loan Committee a 'oan covenant  _quired
that NEB achieve and maintain an 8% rate of return on net revalued assets by
appropriate adjustments of its trriff rates. The Government took issue with
this requirement. It took the view that it had already allowed adequate
adjustments in tariffs through fuel cost variation charges and that it was not
proper to impose tariff increases at a time when there was mounting pressure
in the country for reducing tariffs to promote foreign investments and to make
electricity affordable to the poor. The Government proposed fiscal measures,
such as equity contributions, subsidies and tax exemptions, as a means for NEB
to achieve a reasonable level of cash flow. However, the Bank had reserva-
tions over the economic efficacy of a plan not based on the premise that
tariff increases should be the principal way of achieving the required rate of
return.
2.5       This impasse lasted until January 1980 when the Government and the
Bank agreed to adopt self-financing ratio as a means of financial contrcl in
lieu of a rate of return requirement. It was agreed that NEB would produce
funds from internal sources of not less than 15% for FY80, 25% for FY81-84 and
30% for FY85 and thereafter of its average capital expenditures for
electricity operations excluding rural electrification. This agreement opened
the way for the loan negotiations which started on January 28, 1980 and were
satiFfactorily concluded on February 5, 1980.
Project Description
2.6       After the Temengor project the next logical step was to develop the
downstream potential of the Perak River to utilize the regulated flow from
Temengor. This rationale for the project was reinforced by the fact that an
analysis of generating costs showed the project to offer Lhe least cost
solution for introducing additional generating capacity.  The project as
conceived at appraisal consisted of the following:
(a) The construction and placing into operation of a concrete gravity
dam about 244 meters long and 32 meters high at Bersia, on the Perak
River, with a conventional above-ground powerhouse including three
generating units (3 x 24 MW) and associated ancillary electrical and
mechanical equipment.



- 4 -
(b)  The construction and placing into operation of a composite earthfill
and concrete gravity dam about 503 meters long and 48 meters high at
Kenering, on the Perak River, with a conventional above-ground
powerhouse, including three generating units (3 x 40 MW) and
associated electrical and mechanical equipment.
(c) The construction, installation and placing into operation of the
following associated transmission and sub-station facilities:
(i) about 136 kilometers of 275 kV transmission line between
Temengor and Tanah Merah;
(ii) about 38 kilometers of 132 kV transmission line between Tanah
Merah and Kota Bahru;
(iii)  a sub-station with two 180 MVA, 275/132 kV transformers, two
30 MVA, 132/33 kV transformers and two 7.5 MVA, 33/11 kV
trar 3rmers at Tanah Merah; and
(iv) a sub-station with two 45 MVA, 132/33 kV transformers and two
30 MVA, 132/11 kV transformers at Kota Bahru.
(d) Preparation of a study for optimizing development and use of
domestic energy resources.
Role of the Project in the Sector
2.i       As noted in the Introduction, the main objectives of the project
were to assist NEB's continued expansion program to enable it to keep pace
with the growing demand for electric power in Peninsular Malaysia and to
establish a back-bone transmission system to the east coast for subsequent
regional developmenc and rural electrification. In addition to equipment and
the control center, the Bank loan funded essential consulting services for
carrying out sector studies and assistance in implementing the project. An
important sector contribution was the mobilizing of project finance through
the Bank's own loan, co-financiiig, and attracting the interest of commercial
banks which were ready to supply project loans along with the Bank as a
participant.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-up
3.1       The Loan was approved by the Board on March 13, 1980, and it was
signed on May 21, 1980.   Loan effectiveness, however, was delayed until
November 6, 1980, the time taken for the Government to agree to the necessary
tariff increase and fiscal relief needed by NEB in order to comply with the
self-financing loan covenant. As already noted, the early start in project
preparation was partly nullified by uncertainties over project financing
brought about by the lengthy deadlock between the Government and the Bank over
NEB's rate of return. Physical work on the project was initiated by the award
of the civil works contract on March 10, 1980, and the award of the first



turbine and generator units on May 27, 1980. These contract award dates (see
Annex 2) are about 8 to 11 months later than planned in NEB's original master
schedule, but they are roughly in line with what was jxpected at project
appraisal.
Changes in Project Scope
3.2       Spillway Capacity:  A reevaluation of the hydrological data by the
Hydropower Consultant concluded that storm conditions could be more severe
than those postulated on the basis of the January 1967 flood event and used as
the basis for spillway design at that time. The consultant's calculations
showed that a long period of heavy rainfall centered over the immediate
drainage area between Temengor and the two project sites could cause the
Bersia dam to become overtopped and dangerously limit the free board allowance
at Kenering.  The consultant, therefore, recommended that an additional/
spillway gate be installed at each of the two dams. The Review Panel -
supported this design change and further recommended the placement of a 2.5
ft. high. parapet wall on the concrete dam section at Kenering. The
recommended changes were approved by the Bank and NEB in time to be
incorporated in the design of the dams without excessive extra installation
costs.
3.3       Transmission Line Addition:  NEB requested that the Jerteh-Tanah
Merah transmission line included in the Tenth Power Project be added to the
scope of this project. The change was requested because the line fit in well
with the transmission line installations included in this project as well as
the anticipated sizeable underrun in disbursements from the Ninth Power
Project Loan.  The transmission line was not installed, however, because of a
subsequent change of plans concerning power transmission and distribution in
the concerned area. It was replaced by a new transmission line, Tanah Merah
to Pasir Puteh financed by the South Korean Exim Bank which, it was said,
offered better terms than the Bank loan.
3.4       Regrouping of Operating Controls:  In the original operating scheme,
Bersia and Kenering stations were to be remotely operated from the Temengor
Station. However, because of the remote location of Temengor, which at the
time was under 24 hour curfew due to terrorist activities, and because of
concern for the security of its personnel, NEB proposed and the Bank agreed in
1985 to converting Temengor to an unmanned station. The operating change
included regrouping all automatic controls at Bersia which was favorably
located for this purpose. All hydrostations on the Perak River can now be
remote operated from the Bersia Group Control Center.
3.5       Chenderoh Rehabilitation Study:  The Bank also agreed in 1985 to
NEB's request to use proceeds of the loan for a feasibility study on
rehabilitating and upgrading the four 10 MW unit Chenderoh hydropower
2/   A panel of hydropower experts covenanted by the loan agreement; see para.
3.9.



station.  All aspects up to and including the preparation of bidding documents
were included in the study.
3.6       Loan Amendment:  The project changes were incorporated in an
amendment to the loan agreement dated September 9, 0985 as follows:
(a) Allocated US$2.5 million3/ for regrouping the hydrostation controls
at Bersia;
(b) Cancelled US$5.0 million from the loan effective as of July 21,
1985;
(c) Added the preparation of a feasibility study for rehabilitation of
the Chenderoh hydropower station;
(d) Cancelled financing of the study of domestic energy resources
(financed by the Government to expedite the appointment of
consultants); and
(e) Extended the closing date to August 31, 1986. (The closing date was
subsequertly further extended to August 31,1987.)
Implementation Arrangements
3.7       All NEB projects are carried out by the Major Projects Department
which is headed by a deputy general manager and includes separate divisions
under chief engineers for transmission systems, thermal and hydro projects.
Since the project included both a hydroelectric and a transmission system
component, two separate teams were involved in project implementation:
(a) the hydro team for the dams, turbines, generators and associated
mechanical and electrical equipment and (b) the transmission team for the
substations and transmission lines. The functions of project management,
design, engineering, construction supervision and commissioning were assigned
to consultants, the Hydropower Consultant and the Transmission Consultant
(para. 2.2) respectively. NEB's role included guidance and general overview
of the consultants' activities and responsibility for procurement and other
important project decisions. Equipment expediting, inspection and cesting
were contracted to organizations specializing in these services. A main
feature of the implementation effort was that all major equipment items were
procured through supply and erect (or install) contracts. This arrangement is
seen as having expedited project implementation by shifting responsibility for
procurement and equipment deliveries from NEB to the respective contractors
and by reducing NEB's supervision and coordination load.
3/   The final amount financed from the Bank loan for this item was US$4.2
million.

Implementation Performance
3.8       The project experienced its share of procurement and construction
problems, delays in land and right-of-way acquisition and site access. The
iriplementation teams were able to cope with these situations and keep delays
to a minimum. Also, the implementation teams coordinated the various project
activities effectively which, along with the cooperation of the contractors,
made it possible to complete the project efficiently and on time, except for
the project components which were added or revised at later stages of the
project. The operating and associated transmission and substation facilities
in the original project scope were all completed ahead of the August 31, 1984
Bank completion schedule. Bersia was commissioned in September 1983 and
Kenering in March 1984. The project components added later were completed as
follows:
(a) Regrouping of automatic controls: April 28, 1987; and
(b) Study for rehabilitating and upgrading Chenderoh hydrostation:
August 1986 (recommendations are umder implementation).
3.9       A loan condition required that the panel of experts which NEB was
forming for the Trengganu multi-purpose project should also review the
project's design and make periodic inspections. The panel of experts,
referred to as the Review Panel, consisted of three members (one each from the
UK, Canada and Australia) who were widely recognized experts in hydropower
development. Altogether, the Review Panel conducted nine site visits
interspaced through the construction phase. Their final report, in July 1983,
when Bersia was in the commissioning stage, stated that the Review Panel was
satisfied with the technical adequacy and quality of construction at both
dams. They noted further that both dams appeared to be performing
satisfactorily but that it was important that the dams' behavior be monitored
with regular inspections by surveillance staff in accordance with the
Engineer's Operations and Maintenance Manual.
Studies Conducted Under The Project
3.10      The following studies were carried out under the project:
(a) Study for Optimizing Development and Use of Domestic Energy
Resources: Originally to be financed from the Bank loan, the study
was subsequently carried out at the Government's expense by Swiss
consultants in collaboration with a local consultant. The study
examined the alternative energy supply and demand scenarios in the
context of the purpose stated by the study title. Its primary
objective was, and still is since it is an ongoing effort, to supply
the essential data and tools for realistic national planning in the
energy sector.
(b) Prefeasibility Study on Coal Utilization for Power Generation: In
October 1981 the Bank agreed to NEB's request to include a coal
utilization study in the project. The objective of the study was to
determine whether coal commercially available from foreign sources



- 8 -
(mainly Australia and China) was a viable option for generating
electricity. In this context the study examined all aspects
connected with coal importing, such as sources of supply,
procurement, shipping, storing and handling and made an economic
comparison with alterrative electricity generating plants including
nuclear power. The finding was that with the developing world and
regional coal trade, imported coal is a candidate fuel source for
electricity generation in Malaysia. The study was assigned to a
Japanese consulting firm assisted by a local firm-in November
1982. Its findings have culminated in the current commissioning of
a 300 MW coal fired unit at Port Klang.
(c)  Chenderoli Rehabilitation Study.  The study, undertaken by the Hydro
Consultdnt in June 1986, consisted of two phases: (i) a feasibility
study to examine the alternative rehabilitation schemes and select
the optimum system and (ii) preparation of draft procurement
documents. The Bank ag-eed in August 1986 to recommendations of the
study, chiefly comprising the installation of new turbines and
generators and a remote control system at a cost of about MS$65.0
million.  Draft bidding documents were completed in April 1987 and
project implementation is in progress.
Reporting
3.11      NEB forwarded to the Bank monthly technical reports which were
useful in monitoring progress of the project.  NEB also forwarded a project
completion report which it had prepared and a similar report from the
Hydropower Consultant. These reports did not fully cover the subject matter
nor supply all the information generally included in a Bank project completion
report, but they were detailed and contained much interesting and useful
information.
Procurement
3.12      Works and goods contracts financed under the Bank loan were procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Pre-qualification was required for prospective
bidders to be eligible to participate in the bidding for civil works
contracts, and bidders for equipment and machinery had to demonstrate the
required financial and technical capabilities. Machinery and equipment
procurement was on a supply and install basis. Having these suppliers be
responsible for meeting the required installation deadlines proved to be an
effective way to maintain the overall construction schedule.
3.13      Except for a dispute over a lighting contract, procurement proceeded
without undue difficulties or problems. The dispute centered around payments
for two change orders. The contractor refused to have his case settled by
arbitration and instead filed a suit in the Malaysian High Court in Kuala
Lumpur against NEB and its field engineer. This litigation was not settled at
the time this report was prepared.



-9-
Project Cost
3.14      The following Tables 3.1 and 3.2  compare the actual project costs
with the SAR estimate in US dollars and in Malaysian ringgits.
3.15      The US dollar comparison shows the total project cost is
US$202.2 million compared to the US$232.9 million SAR estimate. On the basis
that withdrawal from Bank financing of the energy resource study is
essentially cancelled by the addition of the coal utilization and Chenderoh
studies and excluding US$12.3 million, the actual cost of interest during
construction and US$4.2 for the Bersia Group Control Center which were not in
the SAR estimate, the project cost underrun was 20%. In a similar manner the
cost underrun in ringgit terms is 16%.
3.16      As shown in the cost comparison tables, all component costs were
overestimated, especially the turbine and generator estimates which were off
by more than 100% even when combined with the ancillary mechanical and
electric components (some of which would be included with the turbine and
generator procurement packages). There is no ready explanation for this large
price variance. By contrast, NEB's original project estimate compared to
actual costs in Annex 1 shows only a 8% cost underrun, and the combined
turbine, generator and mechanical and electrical ancillary estimates are
within reasonable limits of the actual costs. The Bank cost estimate was
based on the NEB estimate which presumably already included unidentified
contingencies which the Bank's physical and price contingencies further
inflated by about 30%.
3.17      Despite transfering approximately US$9.2 million 41 of the Bank loan
to items not in the original allocation, US$5.0 million had to be cancelled
for lack of a project component eligible for disbursement. This situation
illustrates the importance, as noted above, of avoiding overinflated project
cost estimates. It should be mentioned in this connection that the Government
in its comments on the Bank prepared PCR for the 8th Power Loan (which also
had a portion cancelled) remarked about the need to take note of large
contingencies on future project cost estimates.
4/   Allowing for the fact that the energJ resource study largely offset the
cost of the coal and Chenderoh studies, this amount comprises the
following:

Sources of Finance
3.18      The sources of financing for the project are given in Table 3.3
below. A loan of Y 10.0 billion from Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. Ltd. was
raised in August 1982 to finance the turbines rnd generators. The stations
were commissioned in August 1983 and March 1984 for Bersia and Kenering
respectively. All payments to Messrs. Hydroart SPA, Italy and Siemens
Aktiengesellschaft, West Germany contractors for turbines and generators, had
already been made from the Board's funds at the time the loan was raised. To
save foreign exchange loss by converting the Yen to Malaysian Ringit to
reimburse the payments made to 'he contractors, it was considered prudent to
leave it in Bank Bumiputra Tokyo Branch to meet Yen liabilities of LLN.

Disbursemen.
3.19      Annex 3 presents the estimated biannual disbursements of the Bank
loan and the actual amounts disburbed over the same time periods. It can be
seen that actual disbursements lagged by as much as 40% of the amounts which
had been forecast at project appraisal and that it took almost an additional
two years to fully disburse the loan. The principal reasons for these
shortfalls were the overestimated cost of the project components financed from
the Bank loan and the financing of additional project components which were
started and completed late relative to the original project implementation
schedule. US$5.0 million could not be appropriately utilized and was

cancelled on July 21, 1985. Loan closing was extended twice from August 31,
1985 to August 31, 1987 to complete disbursing against the components added to
the project scope. The loan reallocations are shown in the following table.

Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.20      The performance of consu'ltants engaged for the project was
satisfactory. Except for the claims of one contractor (para. 3.13) which it
could not consider, NEB was entirely satisfied with the contractors and
suppliers who participated in the project. Their work was generally of a high
quality and delivery and installation schedules were adhered to withi few
exceptions none of which seriously impacted project execution.
The Environment
3.21      The Bersia and Kenering reservoirs are relatively small, a surface
area of onLy 570 hectare (ha) for Bersia and 2,430 ha for Kenering. It was
concluded from environmental studies prior to appro%al of the two dam sites
that no single ecological consequence or combination of consequences of any
significant importance should result from construction of the two dams. This
has been the case; so far no adverse environmental impact has been observed.
Concerns expressed in the environmental consultants' report.)/ have been
5/   See para. 4.24 of the SAR.

monitored by NEB; the current status is as follows:
(a) Studies carried out by the Institute of Medical Research have not
shown sanitary conditions of villages situated in the lower reaches
of 3ungai Kendrang to be affected by liquid wastes around Grik.
(b) To date there is no evidence of sedimentation which could affect the
Kenering reservoir. NEB is monitoring this potential problem and
will institute remedial action i' a problem does develop.
(c) Application of fertilizer should not be a concern in the Bersia and
Kenering area since the agriculture practiced is mainly devoted to
rubber and palm oil. Sanitary waste control was a recommendation,
but there seems to be no practical way to institute such a system
considering the life style of the local inhabitants and the sparse
scattered population.
(d) Regarding the limestone cliff, only one cave was discovered, but it
contained no archaelogical remains.
3.22      There were no settlers nor privately held land in the Bersia
reservoir basin and consequently no compensation was involved. Within the
Kenering reservoir basin two agricultural developments were displaced from an
area of somwe 110 ha of rubber tree cultivation. The area comprised a recently
established cooperative scheme sponsored by the state government with the land
being leased to share croppers. Compensation cost to the share croppers
amounted to approximately M$420,000 for loss of income. No settlements,
buildings nor private land requiring compensation were in the affected area.
In the Kendrong basin near the upstream end of the Kenering reservoir a total
area of about 130 ha of privately held land was affected and reqaired
compensation costs of about M$1.62 million. No resettlement of people was
necessary.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1       The Bersia hydroelectric development has a total inbtaLled nominal
capacity of 72 MW provided by three 24 MW generator units installed at this
site. Each unit comprises a Kaplan (adjustable blade propeller) hydraulic
turbine with an output of 24 MW at a design heal of 87 ft of water and a
synchronous umbrella type generator rated at 11 kV, 29.5 MVA, 0.9 p.f. and
50 Hz. At the Kenering hydroelectric development the installed nominal
capacity is L20 MW provided by three 40 MW generator units at this location.
Each unit comprises a Francis hydraulic turbine with an output of 40 MW at a
design head of 114 ft of water and a synchronous umbrella type generator rated
at 11 kV, 49 MVA, 0.9 p.f. and 50 Hz. During commissioning, the turbine and
generator units at both sites equalled or surpassed the specified performance
and efficiency guarantees.
4.2       The Bersia and Kenering stations along with the converted Temengor
station are now remotely operated from the central control center located at
Bersia. The Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system installed



- 15 -
under the project regulates the distribution of power from the three stations
in a manner designed to extract the optimum hydro energy from the river
flow. Table 4.1 which follows gives the annual power generation data for the
two dam sites. It can be seen that river flow was greatly reduced during 1985
and 1986.

4.3       The Bersia and Kenering generating stations have operated
satisfactorily since start-up except for two operating problems with Bersia
Unit No. 1. The first incident occurred in July 1985 when the hydraulic oil
piping controlling turbine runner blades failed. NEB staff assisted by the
turbine and generator suppliers put the unit back into operation after a down
time of 5 months. More recently in September 1986 a worn shaft sleeve 0-ring
caused excessive water leakage and had to be replaced. It was subsequently
discovered that a more extensive 0-ring repair was required; this overhaul
operation was carried out between February and June 1987. Other than these
two problems with the No. 1 Bersia unit both power plants have performed
satisfactorily and up to expectations.
4.4       Concerning the substation and transmission system, there are no
reports of any malfunctioning of the equipment installed under the project.
The system is functioning satisfactorily and in accordance with
specifications. The only adjustment required was the installation of reactors
to control a high voltage condition at the Tanah Mehra end of the 275 KV
transmission line.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Financial Results
5.1       NEB's financial performance, comparing actual results with project
appraisal forecasts, for the period FY80 to FY87 is given in Annex 6 and



- 16 -
suzmarized in the following Table 5.1. The period covers NEB's emergence from
the financial difficulties it experienced because of inadequate tariff rates
during FY79 and 80. Based on present projections, however, NEB can be
expected to continue the satisfactory financial performance it has achieved
since FY82.
5.2       At project appraisal energy sales were forecast to increase at an
average rate of around 10.5% per year over the period FY79 to FY85, but actual
sales only grew at an annual rate of 8% over this period. The lower than
estimated sales undoubtedly reflected, to some extent, energy conservation
measures prompted by the tariff adjustments introduced in FY78, 79 and 80 and
the steep price rise of M% in December 1981. Until FY79, the government had
allowed NEB to recover 100% of its fuel cost increases through a fuel cost
variation charge levied on industrial customers. In FY80 in lieu of this
charge. the government allowed a 15% rate increase (from Mc 13 to MC 15 per
kWh) and exempted NEB from taxes and dividend payments during FY80 to 84.
However, these measures were not sufficient to keep NEE from incurring a net
loss for that year. The December 1981 rate increase (from MC 15 to MC 20.2
per kWh), along with an additional 10% increase during FY82-83 restored NEB's
financial health. By the end of FY81, it was able to post a M$ 125.8 million
nct income compared to the net M$7.8 million loss the previous year.
Moreover, the rate of return on net revalued fixed assets was 9.3%,
comfortably above the 8% Bank requirement on previous loans to NEB. Operating
revenue, costs and income exceeded projections by considerable margins over
the FY80-85 comparison period. Capital expenditures were also greatly
underestimated, particularly for FY82-85 when actual annual average
expenditures were more than twice the forecast. After FY82 net income
substantially surpassed projec.ions; in tact by FY85, when NEB had to provide
for tax and dividend payments, the net income was almost twice the estimated
amount. Largely as a result of lower fuel costs, by 1987 NEB's tariff rate
was decreased by 18% (from the MC 23.3 per KWH highest rate in FY85 to MC 18.8
per KWH) and its tax burden amounted to M$260.7 million. Nevertheless, its
net income for the year was M$462 million which was higher than any of the
forecast amounts over the comparison period.
Financial Covenants
5.3       Until FY80, Bank financial covenants required an 8% minimum rate of
return on net revalued fixed assets.  This requirement was removed under this
project in favor of a self-financing ratio of 15% for FY80, 25% for FY81-84
and 30% for FY85 and orwards. The rationale for the change was that in the
case of an organization like NEB with an expanding asset base, self-financing
was a better indicator of financial performance than rate of return. Also,
since the basic concern was NEBs cash generating capacity and its ability to
finance a reasonable proportion of its expansion program, the self-financing
ratio was an acceptable substitute for a rate of return covenant since it
would directly reflect NEB's level of cash generation. The loan agreement
also introduced a new covenant requiring that NEB's current liabilities not
exceed 33% of its cash operating expenses for the preceding fiscal year. This
covenant was subsequently replaced, in 1983, under Loan 2146-MA (Tenth Power
Project), by one which required that NEB maintain its ratio of current assets
to current liabilities equal to 1.1 or higher at all times. The loan

agreement further mandated that NEB not incur debt which would raise its total
debt to more than 601 of the sum of its total debt plus equity.
5.4       Actual performance is compared with financial covenant requirements
in Table 5.2 which follows. NEB could not achieve the self-financing ratios
for FY80 and FY81 because of the constraints on its revenues caused by the
inadequate tariff rates to cover escalating oil prices; however, from FY82 on
higher rates enabled it to exceed the required ratios by a wide margin.
Considering the two year stalemate between the Bank and NEB on this issue, it
is interesting to note that NEB's rate of return comfortably exceeded the 8Z
requirement for every year from FY81 onward. NEB had no problem complying
with the 601 debt equity ratio covenant throughout the comparison period.
However, NEB could not comply with the 331 current liability and cash
operating expenses limitation in effect during FY80-82 nor the 1.1 minimum
current ratio, which replaced it, during FY83-84. These shortfalls were
mainly caused by the large payables of retention accounts on projects under
completion. From FY85 on, NEB has been able to maintain the current ratio at
1.1 or above. Given the current financial outlook, NEB should be able to
continue its present full compliance with the financial covenants.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.1       A copy of NEB's current organization chart appears in Annex 4.  At
appraisal NEB was a financially sound, well-organized and efficient public
utility which had proved itself to be capable and efficient in previous
dealings with the Bank. However, the Bank did have two areas of concern which
it addressed during loan negotiations. First, there was the difficulty NEB
had been experiencing in hiring and retaining adequately qualified staff in
the financial and technical disciplines. NEB assured the Bank that it would
fulfill the staffing needs through intensive recruiting and training; events
have shown that NEB was largely successful in this endeavor. In addition, the
Bank felt that the Internal Audit Unit should be given a wider scope of
operation and more independence and recommended that the unit report directly
to the General Manager instead of the Chief Accountant. NEB agreed with this
recommendation and promptly instituted the change.
6.2       NEB carries out both an intensive and an extensive training program
for its employees. Its well equipped and staffed training institute turns out
annually about 4,000 trainees with upgraded skills in all phases of activities
of the electric power industry ranging from the crafts to the various
financial and engineering disciplines. Seminars and special courses at home
and abroad are made available to enhance managerial skills and keep abrsast of
developments in the industry.  A program of student sponsorship at diploma,
graduate and postgraduate levels in foreign and Malaysian universitieg,
continuously brings new blood and fresh talents into the organization-'  It
6/   To appreciate the scale of this part of NEB's training program, it is
worth noting that in 1988 approximately 250 NEB sponsored students were
attending overseas universities.

can be seen from Table 6.1 below that the training program is enabling NEB
achieve the objectives of increasing the ratio of skilled to semi-and
unskilled employees and to increase the number of customers per employee. By
1987, the number of customers per employee had reached 100; the goal of 120 by
1990 seems achievable.

6.3       With the growth in scope and complexity of NEB's operations, it
became increasingly apparent that too many activities revolved around
headquarters and that the organization was overcentralized. DecisionIs
affecting critical field activities were meeting costly delays, and conversely
field referrals to headquarters were encountering aimilar delays. To cope
with this situation NEB management decided in 1985 that it would decentralize
the organization over the next 4 to 5 years in three steps by (i) studying the
various practical plans, (ii) preparing the required organizational changes,
and (iii) implementing the selected plan. The Bank's Energy Efficiency and
Plant Rehabilitation Project (Loan 2772-MA) provides technical assistance to
the NEB's Department for Management Services and Development which is viewed
as playing a key role in preparing for decentralization.



- 21 -
6.4       The following important institutional components which are covered
under the Bank's Energy Efficiency and Plan Rehabilitation Project will
contribute further to NEB's institutional development:
(a) human resources study;
(b) introduction of a computerized maintenance management system for
thermal and hydroelectric generating plants;
(c) distribution system planning study; and
(d) installation of a computerized materials handling and inventory
control system.
VII.  ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
7.1       The SAR evaluated the internal economic rate of return (IERB) as the
discount rate which equalized the stream of costs and benefits attributable to
the project. Project capital costs were net of taxes and duties and included
the full cost of the associated transmission and substation facilities. The
OhM cost was assumed at a level of M$2.2 million. Project benefits were
calculated using the average tariff (after due allowance for distribution
costs) as proxy for benefits. On this basis an IERR of 13.8Z was calculated.
7.2       A similar approach was adopted for this economic reevaluation which
calculated the IERR on the following basis:
(a) Costs and benefits were converted to constant 1987 Ringgits using
the following inflators which are those used by NEB for the
reevaluation of its assets:
Fiscal Year             Inflation Rate            Inflation Index
(2                        (Z)
1980                         8.7                      91.09
1981                         5.6                      96.19
1982                         1.4                      97.54
1983                        -0.2                      97.34
1984                         0.6                      97.93
1985                         0.6                      98.51
1986                         0.5                      99.01
1987                         1.0                     100.0
(b) Actual energy generation data was used for the period FY 1983
through FY 1988 inclusive. Energy generation in subsequent years
was assumed equal to the average generated in this period;



- 22 -
(c)  Energy sales were assumed at 85% of energy generated to allow for a
total system loss of 15%;
(d) Benefits were based on the average sales tariff (in constant FY1987
prices) less 7% to account for distribution system costs. In che
first two years benefits were evaluated in terms of fuel savings at
MC1O per kWh sold;
(e) Operation and maintenance expenses were assumed at 1% of the capital
cost; and
(f) All machinery and plant equipment were assumed to be replaced after
25 years in the 50 year life span of the project
7.3       Annex 7 tabulates the resulting cost and benefits streams, namely
(i) capital costs, (ii) electric power sales, (iii) O&M expenses, (iv) gross
and net revenues from sales and (v) the net cash flow. The reevaluated IERR
on the basis described above is 13.5%, which is very close to the 13.8% SAR
value.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1       The Bank has been associated with Malaysia's power sector from 1956
to the present. The interim period has seen tremendous growth in NEB's power
generating, transmitting and distributing systems, and NEB itself has grown
into an efficient modern electric power utility. Some measure of credit for
these accomplishments can be attributed to NEB's association with the Bank.
The Bank nlayed an important supportive role throughout this period with the
supply of funds along with advice and assistance essential for NEB's technical
and institutional development. The Bank's insistence on an 8% rate of return
loan covenant (para. 2.4) did cause a year's delay in project implementation
and severely strained relations with the government and NEB. However, it must
also be noted that the financial covenants in Bank loans contributed
substantially to NEB's excellent financial performance in subsequent years.
8.2       Since Malaysia is a resource surplus country, Bank lending has aimed
at institution-building and helping the country expand its capacity for
implementing development programs to benefit the low income groups, especially
in rural areas. The Bank's role in the project was consistent with this goal;
the transmission and substation components included in the project provided
the basis for subsequent accelerated rural electrification in the north.
8.3       Despite the earlier rate of return controversy, a very cooperative
relationship was maintained by Bank staff with government and NEB officials
during implementation of the project. NEB confirms that Bank procedures and
requirements created no significant problems. Bank staff undertook seven
supervision missions from August 1980 through January 1986 which along with
the quarterly reports submitted by NEB were adequate for effective supervision
of the project.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1       The project illustrates that NEB has developed the skills and
capabilities to carry out a relatively complex project in a competent and
expeditious manner. Allowing for the delay caused by the rate of return
issue, the project was completed on time and accomplished its primary
objectives, namely:
(a)  The Bersia and Kenering hydro plants are operating according to
specification and are contributing their share to the country's
growing energy requirements;
(b)  The transmission and substation components of the project are
operating satisfactorily and have provided an important link between
the western network and the east coast; subsequent transmission
additions, some of which have been Bank financed, have contributed
to the interconnection of the entire Peninsula into one network;
(c)  NEB's comprehensive training and career development program has been
successful in enhancing the skills of its employees and has
essentially eliminated the Bank's concern, at the time of project
appraisal, over a possible shortage of qualified personnel;
(d)  The energy resou.ce study was a worthwhile project component; it has
developed into an ongoing effort and constitutes an important tool
for national planning in the energy sector; and
9.2       There is a need for a more realistic assessment of contingency
provisions in project cost estimates, especially when quotations for major
systems have been received at the time of appraisal to avoid excessive cost
overestimates and the necessity to cancel undisbursed loan amounts.
9.3       The project has demonstrated that employing an expert panel is a
worthwhile implementation addition in the design and construction of large
hydroelectric projects.
9.4       NEB's experience with procurement of the various plant components
with single responsibility supply and instal.l contracts shows this meth.od to
be an effective means for promoting timely project implementation without
unnecessarily increasing project cost.  However, it is essential that
procurement documents ensure that only highly qualified contractors are
eligible to bid.
9.5       Although no serious time losses were incurred, project report.£
indicate that sufficient right-of-way and access problems were encounteied (a
recurring issue on all projects in Malaysia) to emphasize the importancf of an
early start on these activities.
