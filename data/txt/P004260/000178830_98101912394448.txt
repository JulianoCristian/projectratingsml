1. THE SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The principal sources of energy in Malaysia are petroleum, natural
gas and hydroelectric potential. No significant deposits of coal or uranium
have yet been found. The proven commercial energy reserves are estimated to
be 32 x 101" Btu; of which about 78% are natural gas, 19% petroleum and 3%
hydropower.
1.02      Natural gas and oil have been found off the coast of Sabah and
Sarawak and, more recently, off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia. In
1978, domestic crude production was 78.8 million barrels (about 216,000 bar-
rels per day) and domestic consumption, 48.6 million barrels. Malaysia has
been a net exporter of petroleum products since 1973. It is expected that
in 1980 petroleum output would average 116 million barrels a year (317,000
barrels per day). The country is endowed with a sizable amount of natural
gas estimated at about 25 x 1015 Btu or 0.71 x 1012 cu m. The export of
liquified natural gas is estimated to reach about 6.4 million tons a year
(22.7 million cu m a day) after 1983.
1.03      The hydro potential in Malaysia at 13 economically exploitable
sites is estimated at about 1.9 million kW in capacity and 7,669 GWh in
energy, equivalent to 13 million barrels of oil a year (Annex 1).
Role of the Sector in the Economy
1.04      Electricity revenue accounts for only about 1.8% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which amount to 20% and 5% of GDP and 21% and 13% of merchandise exports
respectively.
1.05      The growth of the power sector has kept pace with Malaysia's econo-
mic development. Between 1970 and 1978, when GNP grew at an average rate of
about 7.5% in real terms, total electricity consumption grew at an averge
rate of about 13.4%. The elasticity coefficient of 1.8 is reasonable and
comparable to those for countries at a similar stage of development.
History of Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.06      The Bank has made eight loans to the National Electricity Board of
the States of Malaya (NEB), aggregating US$236.2 million (net of cancella-
tions). The first loan (210-MA) of US$28.6 million was made in 1958 for the
first stage of the Cameron Highlands Hydroelectric Scheme. A second loan
(350-MA) of US$51.1 million made in 1963 financed the second stage of the
Cameron Highlands Scheme, the first stage of the Prai Thermal Station and the



- 2 -
expansion of transmission facilities. In 1966, a third loan (458-MA) of
US$27.7 million was made for the first stage of the Port Dickson Thermal
Station, the installation of additional generating units at the Cameron High-
lands Scheme, the second stage of the Johore Bahru Thermal Station, and the
expansion of transmission facilities.  The fourth loan (579-MA) of US$8.5 mil-
lion in 1969 was for the second stage of the Port Dickson and Prai Thermal
Stations and for further expansion of transmission facilities. In 1970, a
fifth loan (700-MA) of US$20.0 million financed the third stage of the Port
Dickson Station, together with transmission facilities and the sixth loan
(1031-MA) of US$43.3 million in 1974 provided funds for transmission faci-
lities associated with the Temengor Hydroelectric Development (4 x 87 MW), a
load dispatching center and an extension of the transmission and distri-
bution system. The seventh loan (1178-MA) of US$35.0 million, made in 1975,
covered the final extension of the Prai Thermal Station (3 x 120 MW), the
expansion of transmission and distribution facilities to two rural areas and
consulting services for a rural electrification study. The eighth loan
(1443-MA) of US$22.0 million was made in 1977 for the construction of a new
thermal power station at Pasir Gudang (2 x 120 MIW), together with the
further expansion of transmission facilities.
1.07      The projects under the first six loans have been completed and are
operating satisfactorily. The first unit of 120 MW under the seventh loan
was commissioned in September 1979; the project construction is on schedule.
Works financed under the eighth loan are presently in the early stage of
construction and no difficulties in project execution are expected.
1.08      A project performance audit report, made in 1979 for the fifth
loan, indicated that the project was completed with a cost overrun of about
15% and about three months behind schedule.
1.09      The primary objectives of the proposed project are:  to assist NEB
in expanding its generation facilities through the development of indigenous
hydro resources; to connect the western network of Peninsular Malaysia to
the east coast for regional development and the Government's program of
rural electrification in the northeast provinces; to continue the Bank's
role in institution building; and to assist NEB in obtaining funds from
other'sources including commercial banks through co-financing arrangements.
Sector Organization
1.10      Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous Government-
owned entities. The largest of these is NEB, serving Peninsular Malaysia
with the exception of part of the State of Perak which is supplied by the
Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company (PRHE). The two states on the
island of Borneo are supplied by Government-owned statutory authorities - the
Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation
(SESCO).
1.11      NEB was established in 1949 under the Electricity Act of that year
to:



(a) generate, transmit, transform, distribute and sell energy in bulk
or to individual consumers in any part of the states of Malaya;
(b) purchase, construct, reconstruct, maintain and operate supply
lines, generating stations, transformer stations, buildings and
works;
(c) acquire electrical plant and property; and
(d) assemble or manufacture electrical equipment and fittings.
1.12      PRHE and its distribution subsidiary, Kinta Electric Distribution
Co., Ltd. (KED), generate and distribute electricity within their concession
area in the State of Perak to some 85,700 customers; the bulk of the output
being sold to the mining industry. PRHE is a profitable operation. The
company is incorporated in the United Kingdom and operates under a concession
granted by the State of Perak in 1926 for a term of 80 years with a break
clause after 50 years. The Government has acquired all the ordinary
shares and is now the sole owner of PRHE. The General Manager of NEB is
a director on the board of PRHE. The final integration of PRHE with NEB is
scheduled to take place in 1980. This will improve NEB's operation.
Supply and Demand of Electric Power
1.13      The generating capacity installed by the various entities as of
end-FY78 is as follows:
Entity               Installed Capacity (MW)
NEB                           1,439.8
PRHE                            103.0
SED                             127.0
SESCO                           133.0
Total                   1,802.8
Of this total, 379.4 MW is hydro (21.0%); 1,046.0 MW (58.0%) steam; 20 MW1
(1.1%) gas turbine; and 357.4 MW (19.9%) diesel. In addition, there are a
total of 19.5 MW of diesel units and 1 hydro plant of 2 MW owned by 65 small
electric companies which supply power on a licensed basis. The total number
of captive generating units was about 116 at end FY78.
1.14      For Peninsular MIalaysia, total energy generated in FY78 was
7,432.1 GWh, of which 7,106.8 GWh was generated by public utilities, 44.2
GWh by mining installations and 281.1 GWh by private industries. Hydro-
electric plants produced 831.8 GWh or 11.2%; steam power plants, 6,061.8
GWh or 81.6%; diesel units, 538.5 GWh or 7.2%. Per capita generation was 663
kWh.



- 4 -
1.15      Consumption per capita in FY78 was 570 kWh.  Of the total energy
consumption of 6,384 GWh in FY78, 1,276.9 GWh or 20.0% were used by
residential consumers; 4,175.3 GWh or 65.4% by commercial and industrial
consumers; and 931.8 GWh or 14.6% by mining installations.
Access to Electricity
1.16      In FY78, NEB had 1,012,830 consumers, of which 274,954 were located
in the central region; 316,278 in the northern region; 272,975 in the south-
ern region; and 148,623 in the eastern region. In addition, PRHE had about
85,700 consumers and other licensed public suppliers had about 27,700.
Access to electricity is estimated to be about 52% in Peninsular Malaysia.
The degree of electrification by regions is shown in Annex 2.
1.17      Access to electricity is about 72% for the central region, 74%
for the northern and southern regions, 66% for the eastern region, 34% for
the PRHE area and only 8% and 14% respectively for the areas served by the
isolated rural stations and other licensed suppliers. These rural stations
and licensed public suppliers are scattered all over the Peninsula and are
distributed by regions as follows:
Rural Stations      Licensed Public Suppliers
Central region               6                        4
Northern region             14                       36
Southern region            16                        22
Eastern region             98                         5
Total                134                        67
Rural Electrification
1.18      Rural electrification in Malaysia began in the 1950s when a large
number of the rural population was concentrated in villages during the emer-
gency. These villages were electrified from diesel generators to provide
perimeter lighting for security reasons. Originally, the installations were
operated by NEB's predecessor organization (the Central Electricity Board)
on the basis of cost reimbursement from the Government. After the emergency,
the majority of the small systems were sold to private licensees as they were
uneconomic on a full NEB service basis; 65 such licensees still exist.
1.19      Rural electrification as a social objective began in 1957 and by
the end of FY78, 4,600 villages covering 370,000 consumers had been electri-
fied. These rural consumers represented about 40% of NEB's domestic consum-
ers. The number of villages newly electrified was 205 in FY75, 310 in FY76,
400 in FY77, and 1,150 in FY78.
1.20      While it is the Government's intention to electrify rural Malaysia
to the greatest extent possible, the current program is unplanned. Villages
make application to the State Governments for supply; state administrators



-5-
select villages from these applications on a rather arbitrary basis for
recommendation to the Federal Government; and the Federal Government approves
the program according to the availability of funds. The capital cost of the
program was financed 1/3 by NEB and 2/3 by the Federal Government. From
FY80, the Government will finance 100% of capital expenditures for rural
electrification.
1.21      Under the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA), a rural electrifi-
cation study was included in the loan package in order to formulate a compre-
hensive rural electrification plan and to review its technical, economic and
financial implications. The study was completed in August 1978 by the
Middle West Service Company of Chicago in association with the Perunding
Bersatu Sdn. Bhd. of Kuala Lumpur and is being used by the Government
in formulating the rural electrification program for the Fourth Malaysia
Plan (FY81-85).
1.22      Due to NEB's staff constraints, difficulties in obtaining
wayleaves and shortage of materials, there has been a considerable backlog
of rural electrification projects, especially in the northeast states of
Kelantan and Trengganu. NEB launched a crash program by setting up a
rural electrification department in its head office under the charge of a
chief engineer and by organizing a task force to coordinate staff
mobilization, material supply and wayleave compensation. The progress has
been satisfactory.

2. THE BORROWER
2.01      The Borrower will be the National Electricity Board of the States
of Malaya (NEB), an autonomous Government-owned corporation established in
1949. NEB reports to the Ministry of Energy, Telecommunications and Post and
operates in Peninsular Malaysia.
Organizational Structure
2.02      NEB is both a regulatory and operating agency and gives advice to
the Ministry on all matters relating to the generation, transmission, distri-
bution and use of energy. NEB has the legal power to set tariffs and to
grant licenses to independent electricity works.
2.03      All members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Minister
of Energy, Telecommunications and Post who establishes their terms. The
Chairman of the Board is the Chief Secretary of the Cabinet and the Deputy
Chairman is the General Manager. In addition, there are ten /1 principal
members, of which three are public officers, one is a representative of the
National Union of Plantation Wiorkers and the remaining six come from the
private sector.
2.04      The organization is divided into four departments: Corporate
Planning, Major Projects, Operation and Administration. In addition, there
are a Special Services Unit, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Electrical
Inspector and the Chief Engineer for Rural Electrification, reporting
directly to the General Manager. NEB's operation is organized in four
regional areas, with 4 to 6 districts in each, totaling 20 districts. Each
area is responsible for operation and maintenance activities within its
boundaries, the remaining functions being centralized in Kuala Lumpur.
2.05      The present organization has demonstrated that it is efficient and
well managed. However, the Internal Auditing Unit, which now reports to the
Chief Accountant lacks the necessary independence and a broader scope which
it would acquire if it were to report to the General Manager. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that by December 31, 1981, NEB's
internal auditing unit will be placed directly under the General M4anager.
The present organizational structure is shown in Annex 3.

2.06      By the end of FY78, NEB had a total of 15,590 employees; the
average growth rate for the past five years has been 9.0%. The top and
middle level managerial and technical staff are experienced and well quali-
fied. Nevertheless, in recent years, the need for a more equitable distribu-
/1 Two members not yet appointed.



tion of job opportunities among different races, the competition from the
private sector, and the Government policy of retirement at age 55, are making
it increasingly difficult for NEB to hire and retain qualified personnel.
Shortage of key personnel is felt mainly in the financial and technical areas.
2.07      NEB operates a training program which includes scholarships in
Malaysia and overseas, as well as on-the-job training. Since 1960, NEB has
sponsored about 1,260 students, of which about 572 are still studying,
183 of them overseas. NEB has also given opportunities for on-the-job train-
ing to almost 2,025 technicians, fault finders, linesmen and draftsmen.
In 1978, NEB completed the construction of a training institute which is
now in full operation. To ease the shortage of linesmen arising from
intensification of the rural electrification program, a crash training
program was undertaken and 270 trainees completed their training.
2.08      Assurances were obtained during negotiations that NEB will (i)
recruit sufficient qualified and experienced staff to meet its immediate
manpower requirements; and (ii) continue its vigorous training program for
long-term needs.
Management Systems
2.09      For several years, NEB has been using budgetary systems for capi-
tal and operating expenditures. The budgets are prepared on a yearly basis
and their execution is monitored on a regular monthly basis.
2.10      There is a well-staffed and equipped Data Processing Center.
Payroll, inventory control and billing for one district are computerized.
The computer is also used for engineering studies. NEB plans to expand com-
puter billing to other districts and to introduce additional accounting and
financial applications.
2.11      Accounting systems are well designed and provide adequate informa-
tion, but there have been some delays recently in the preparation of finan-
cial reports as a result of shortage of experienced personnel. NEB is
taking steps to reduce and eliminate these delays.
Audit and Internal Control
2.12      NEB accounts are audited by Price Waterhouse and Co. and a local
firm, Hanafiah, Raslan, Mohamad and Partners. Both firms have been accepted
by the Bank in previous loans to NEB. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that NEB will continue to employ independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank and to send its audited financial statements to the Bank within
six months of the end of each fiscal year.
2.13      Internal control is performed by the Internal Audit Unit under the
Chief Accountant. The unit now covers only some of the financial opera-
tions.  It has been agreed that the unit will report directly to the General
Manager and that the scope of its work will be expanded to cover other areas
of operations (see para. 2.05).



-8-
Taxation
2.14      Since 1970, NEB has been paying corporate tax and development tax.
For the past five years, after the application of a complex capital allow-
ance system, these taxes averaged 19% of NEB's pretax income. In addition,
it had to pay import duties on certain equipment and materials such as
structural steel, switchgear, conductors and cables, 5% surtax on all
imports, 5% sales tax on both local and foreign purchases and a fuel tax of
M$17 per ton. Effective from January 1, 1980, the Government, as a part of
a set of measures aimed to improve NEB's financial position (see para.
5.05) has exempted NEB from payment of corporate tax, development tax,
custom duties and other taxes.
Billing and Collections
2.15      Billing is made monthly by district offices.  In all districts,
except the one computerized, the meter readers themselves prepare bills
on-the-spot and hand them to customers. This procedure, although placing
some burden on the internal control, accounts for the comparatively low
level of receivables outstanding (38 days at the end of FY78). Collections
are made through district offices, post offices and collection agents.
Overdue accounts from Government and large consumers are reported to the
central office where procedures are followed to accelerate collections.
Dividends
2.16      NEB pays dividends to the Government on the equity invested.  The
amount paid is decided every year by the Board of Directors. The
Electricity Act, 1949 set a limit of 6% on NEB's equity as the maximum
dividend payout. Actually, NEB has been paying 5% since 1963.
Insurance
2.17      NEB has taken insurance policies to cover the most common risks
related to the operation of a utility. Coverage is periodically reviewed
and updated. Present arrangements are satisfactory.
Tariffs
2.18      NEB's basic tariffs have not been changed since 1958.  A fuel cost
variation charge was introduced in 1975. In FY78, NEB's average tariff per
kWh was US¢4.70 which compares with Thailand (US¢3.90), Korea (US¢4.60) and
Indonesia (US¢4.40).  Domestic consumers a.rge _sbdjzed_by the exemptiopn of
the first 150 kWh/month from thefueli-, ostvariatioit-cMarge.  The tariff
structure was however cumbersome involving 23 categories, but has since
been rationalized following a recommendation made by Electrowatt (Swiss
consultants) by consolidating the number of categories of consumers to
seven.  In the last Dower loan (1443-MA), NEB agreed to exchange views with
the Bank on any changes proposed-in its tariff structure, and that covenant
will be continued in the proposed loan.



-9-
Industrial Investment
2.19      NEB has a 60% investment participation in a cable factory.  Opera-
tion started more than two years ago and the current cable production rate is
over 300 km a year. The transformer factory will be put into operation in
1980. NEB is now organizing a meter factory in which it would have similar
participation. To avoid overstretching of NEB's cash resources the last
loan to NEB included a covenant that limits investment in industrial
activities to a maximum of 1% of its gross fixed assets as revalued each
year. This covenant will be repeated in the proposed loan.
Facilities of NEB
2.20      NEB's total generating capacity as of end-FY78 was 1,439.8 MW,
made up of 352.4 MW of hydroelectric plant, 970 MW of steam plant, 97.4 NW
of diesel plant and 20 MW of gas turbine. Details of the existing plant are
given in Annex 4.
2.21      By the end of FY78, NEB's transmission system consisted of about
372 km of 275 kV, 1,545 km of 132 kV, 541 km of 66 kV and 887 km of 33 kV
overhead lines, as well as 34 km of 132 kV, 4 km of 66 kV and 206 km of 33 kV
underground cables. Distribution is carried out at 22 kV and 11 kV by 471
km of overhead lines and 6,593 km of underground cables, as well as 483 km
of lines and cables at lower voltages. 5,264 substations with a total
capacity of about 8,146 MVA are in commission.

3.  THE MARKET AND GROWTH OF SUPPLY
Past Trends
3.01      NEB's consumers can be categorized into five major categories:
residential, commercial, industrial, mining and bulk supply to PRHE,
representing about 14.3%, 30.1%, 36.4%, 5.2% and 14.0% respectively, of the
total consumption for FY78.
3.02      The power market served by NEB has had a long history of steady
growth, average annual increase in total sales from FY70-78 being 13.4%.
Even during the years of the energy crisis, the growth remained substantial,
being 13.6% in FY73 and 11.5% in FY74.  Shown below is the past trend of
NEB's power consumptions:
Year          Consumption         Growth Rate
(GWh)                (%)
1970            2,178               12.3
1971            2,401               10.2
1972            2,766               15.2
1973            3,141               13.6
1974            3,502               11.5
1975            3,982               13.7
1976            4,543               14.1
1977            5,297               16.6
1978            5,934               12.0
Load Forecast
3.03      The energy forecast for the period up to FY85 has been prepared by
an analysis of trends of sales to different major consumer groups -
residential, commercial, industrial, mining and bulk supply to PRHE over the
past ten years and through market surveys.  The growth rates vary in each
category.  The actual and forecast sales of energy are given in Annex 5.  On
aggregate, the growth is likely to continue at an average rate of about
10.0% p.a. up to FY85.
3.04      NEB system's maximum demand in FY78 was 1,082.4 MW.  Should PRHE's
generation demand be included, the total would be 1,162 NW. The estimated
maximum demand by regions is given in Annex 6. It is forecast to increase
to 2,215 MW by FY85, with an average growth rate of about 9.5% p.a.
3.05      NEB reviews and revises, as required, its load forecast each year.
As a result of the recent increases in oil prices and world economic
situation, the actual energy sales in FY78 and 79 are lower than original
forecast. A further review of the load forecast will be carried out by
NEB shortly in the light of latest development both on a macro and micro
basis.



Growth of Supply
3.06      In order to meet the increasing load growth, the system has to
be expanded continuously. NEB's policy is to:
(a)  ensure a proper balance between the demand and supply of power
with a reasonable amount of reserve capacity;
(b)  promote the use of locally available energy resources; and
(c)  use hydroelectric plants to meet the system's peaking requirements
and oil/gas-fired thermal plants to meet base-load requirements.
3.07      The balance of system load requirements and the capabilities avail-
able to meet these demands are given in Annexes 7 and 8.  The development
program is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. The system's available reserve
margin and firm energy are tabulated below:
Dependable  Available  Minimum                    Available
Maximum   peaking      reserve   reserve       Energy         firm

/a   Firm energy of hydro plants is defined as the annual energy output
that would be available 95% of the time; firm energy of thermal
units is calculated at a capacity factor of 75%.
3.08      Because of the delays of about one year in the implementation of
Bersia, Kenering and Trengganu hydroelectric projects, the system will be
short of firm energy in FY84 and 85. The retirement of Penang (40 IfW),
Malacca (40 MW) and Sultan Ismail (30 MW) thermal plants would therefore
have to be deferred to FY85 after commissioning of Port Klang No. 2 unit
(300 1MW), or some additional gas turbines would be required.



- 12 -
3.09      The reserve capacity is based on the criteria that the system will
maintain supply to consumers with the two largest units of 120 MW out of
service (one for scheduled maintenance and the other for forced outage).
After installation of the first 300 MW unit at Port Klang power station in
1985, this criterion will be modified to allow a margin covering outage of
one 300 MW unit and one 120 MW unit elsewhere. After the completion of
Temengor reservoir, with four units of 87 MW in operation, the system is now
more flexible to operate and the reliability level improves substantially.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
4.01      NEB's development program, 1975 through 1983, is based on the least
cost sequence of development following extensive studies of the generation and
transmission system made by Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of UK. This study
has now been reviewed and refined by NEB's own staff and extended to FY85
using computer programs available in-house (IAEA's WASP package and CEGB's
General Purpose Generation Scheduling Program)./l
Generation
4.02      NEB's generation development program has been planned to provide
reserve margins consistent with sound utility practices (see Annex 7 and
para. 3.07). The program following Port Dickson Stage III (3 x 120 MW) up
to FY85 is given in chronological order as follows:
(a) to develop Temengor Hydroelectric project (4 x 87 MW) which was
already completed in FY79;
(b) to extend the Prai Thermal Power station by installing three addi-
tional 120 MW units for completion Ln FY80,
(c) to develop a new thermal power station in the south at Pasir Gudang
with 2 x 120 MW units for completion in FY81;
(d) to develop Bersia (3 x 24 MW) and Kenering (3 x 40 MW) hydro sites
on the Perak river downstream of Temengor for completion in FY83
and FY84 respectively,
(e) to establish a new high-efficiency base-load thermal power station
at Port Klang near the load center with the first and second units
for completion in February and August 1985 respectively; and
(f) to develop Trengganu multipurpose project on the east coast (4 x 100
MW), scheduled for completion in FY86.
4.03      The Temengor hydroelectric project consists of a rock-fill dam
approximately 114 m high which will create a reservoir of 5,680 million cu m
in gross storage capacity. It is financed by the Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan for the civil works and electrical and
mechanical equipment, and by the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) for the engineering services. The Bank is financing the 275 kV
Temengor-Prai transmission line under the eighth power loan. The civil works
were completed in FY78 and all four units were installed by FY79 as scheduled.

Transmission
4.04      The proposed expansion plan for transmission lines and substations
is based on PCR's report "Transmission System Studies, 1976-85" of October
1976 and more recent, "Extension of Supply to the East and Northeast of
Peninsular Malaysia, 1978-85" of October 1977. It includes construction of
about 687 km of 275 kV, 826 km of 132 kV transmission lines and 1,905 MVA of
transformers in about 15 substations. The major transmission lines included
in the program are as follows (see Map for locations):
275 kV double-circuit lines  Prai-Temengor (119 km)
Temengor-Tanah 1Aerah (136 km)
Trengganu-Paka (145 km)
Woh-Rawang (120 km)
Kuala Lumpur (North)-Kg Awah (130 km)
Kuala Lumpur (North)-Port Klang (37 km)
132 kV double-circuit lines  Tanah Merah-Kota Bahru (38 km)
Tenah Merah-Kuala Trengganu (129 km)
Trengganu-Kuala Trengganu (40 km)
Trengganu-Dungun-Kemaman-Tg Geland (173 km)
Tie line with Thailand (47 km)
4.05      Thus, the entire Peninsula will be interconnected into one network
by 1984/85. One of the objectives of the above program is to establish the
backbone transmission system throughout the Peninsula to facilitate regional
development and initiate rural electrification program for less developed
areas, particularly the east coast. The 115/132 kV tie line between
Mlalaysia and the southern part of Thailand will be completed in FY80. NEB
is currently importing 18 MW of power via two 22 kV cables from Singapore.
Subtransmission and Distribution
4.06      The program provides for the extension of 66 kV and 33 kV subtrans-
mission lines to distribute power to various load centers, and the extension
of overhead lines and underground cables at medium (22 kV and 11 kV) and low
voltages for general distribution.
The Project
4.07      The project includes the Bersia and Kenering hydroelectric develop-
ments located in the upper reaches of the Perak river, about 20 km and 70 km
respectively downstream of the Temengor project and 136 km of 275 kV and 38
km of 132 kV transmission lines and associated substations to link the
western network from Temengor to the east coast. The project involves
construction of the following works (Annex 9 provides project detail):
(a) Bersia. A concrete gravity dam, 32 m high, consisting of a gated
spillway section and an integral intake and powerhouse section. The
dam will be about 244 m long at its crest with a total concrete
volume of about 150,000 cu m. The powerhouse is a conventional
above-ground type with three generating units (3 x 24 MW) and
associated electrical and mechanical equipment.



- 15 -
(b) Kenering. A concrete gravity dam with earth embankments, 41 m high,
consisting of a gated spillway section and an integral intake and
powerhouse section. The dam will be about 610 m long with a
concrete volume of approximately 300,000 cu m ane' sn earthfill
volume of 450,000 cu m. The powerhouse is also a conventional
above-ground type with three generating units (3 x 40 MW) and
associated electrical and mechanical equipment.
(c) Associated Transmission and Substation Facilities. Temengor-Tanah
Merah, 275 kV D/C transmission line (136 km); Tanah Merah-Kota
Bahru, 132 kV D/C transmission line (38 km); Tanah Merah substation
equipped with 2 x 180 MVA 275/132 kV, 2 x 30 MVA 132/33 KV and
2 x 7.5 MVA 33/11 kV transformers; and Kota Bahru substation
equipped with 2 x 45 MVA 132/33 kv and 2 x 30 MVA 132/11 kV trans-
formers.
(d) Consultancy services of a study for optimizing development and use
of domestic energy resources.
Project Cost Estimate
4.08      The estimated cost of the project is summarized in the table below

- 16 -
4.09      The cost estimate is at end-1979 price levels, based on bid prices
already available for civil works and major equipment. Physical contingencies
were estimated at 10% for civil works and 3.5% for associated mechanical and
electrical works and transmission and substation facilities. These are
considered reasonable given the known site geological conditions and the
fact that the project design has already evolved to an advanced stage. The
price contingencies for items already tendered were based on terms and
conditions quoted in the respective bids. For items yet to be tendered, the
following annual escalation rates were used both for foreign and local
costs: 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% for 1983-85.
Financing Arrangements
4.10      The proposed Bank loan of US$50.0 million will finance the foreign
exchange costs of associated electrical and mechanical works, transmission
and substation facilities and consultancy services. The civil works and
turbines are proposed by the Government to be financed by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), Japan using Yen Credits. The generators
will be financed by bilateral or suppliers' credits. CIDA will finance the
major part of the foreign cost of engineering services. The Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC), has offered a loan of US$13.0 million
equivalent to finance any contracts under the project. The financing gap of
about US$7.5 million would be met by loans from commercial banks. Based on
experience with previous loans, NEB will have no difficulty in obtaining
commercial bank loans at reasonable terms.
4.11      The proposed financing arrangements are as follows.

Procurement
4.12      All equipment and materials financed under the proposed Bank loan
will be pr--ured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. All equipment will be
procured on a supply and erect basis.
Disbursement
4.13      Disbursements on equipment and materials will be made against 100%
of foreign exchange costs of directly imported items; 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory) for items manufactured locally; and 70% of total
expenditures for imported items procured locally. Disbursements are expected
to be completed by August 31, 1985. The estimated disbursement schedule is
given in Annex 11.
Engineering and Supervision
4.14      The feasibility report on the Upper Perak Eydroelectric Development
was first prepared by the Shawinigan Engineering Company Limited (SECO) of
Canada in 1966 and later updated in 1976 in a report entitled "Preinvestment
Study - Bersia and Kenering Hydroelectric Developments". In 1976, NEB engaged
SECO, financed by CIDA, for the engineering study, detailed design, prepara-
tion of tender documents and evaluation of bids for the main civil works and
mechanical and electrical equipment and for the construction supervision of
the project. As SECO performed well at Temengor and is familiar with
local conditions, this arrangement is acceptable. Services for engineering
and detailed design were estimated at US$5.0 million for about 835 man-months.
The average man-month cost (including salary, costs and fees) is US$6,000.
Services for construction supervision were estimated at US$3.9 million for
about 355 man-months of expatriate staff and 2,500 man-months of local staff.
The average expatriate man-month cost is US$6,400 (including in addition
international travel and subsistence) and the average local man-month
cost is US$650.
Consultancy Services
4.15      The Government asked the Bank to finance under the project a study
for optimizing development and use of local energy resources. The study will
require about 90 man-months of services and have an estimated total cost of
US$1.5 million. The average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees,
international travel and subsistence, is expected to be about US$9,000. In
addition to these personnel costs, the contract cost will include the cost
of vehicles, equipment, field survey and investigation. It was agreed during
negotiations that the Government will furnish to the Bank for review and
comments not later than July 31, 1982, a report prepared by consultants whose
terms of reference and qualifications should be satisfactory to the Bank.



- 18 -
4.16      NEB uses PCR to provide the consultancy services for design, pro-
curement and supervision of transmission lines and substations at a
negotiated lump sum price of about US$0.5 million, 2.2% of the estimated
construction cost of these facilities.
Engineering Safety
4.17      Geological investigations have indicated that the bedrock at both
sites will provide adequate foundations with no evidence of significant
structural weakness. No unusual difficulties in'construction are foreseen as
the physical site conditions have been well investigated and the conceptual
design and scope of construction are straightforward.
4.18      For the 400 MW Trengganu multipurpose project on the east coast,
NEB is in the process of forming a panel of experts to review project designs
and make periodic inspections during construction. This panel will also be
used for the proposed project. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that NEB will maintain the panel of experts for reviewing project designs
and problems which may arise during construction.
4.19      During negotiations, it was also agreed that NEB will implement a
program of inspection and maintenance of the works satisfactory to the Bank,
throughout the operational period of the project.
Implementation Schedule
4.20      Tenders for main civil works were opened in October 1979; and those
for turbines and generators in April 1979. Contracts are expected to be
awarded in early 1980. Construction of civil works will start first on Stage
I river diversion in mid-1980 with the reservoirs ready for impounding by
March 1983 (30 months) for Bersia and January 1984 (40 months) for Kenering.
The project is expected to be completed by August 1984. Detailed
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 12.
4.21      Bids for transmission lines and transformers were opened in November
and December 1979 respectively with awards to be made in early 1980 and
completion in 1982.
Environment
4.22      Bersia and Kenering are low-head developments with relatively small
reservoir capacity. The surface area of the reservoir is only 570 ha for
Bersia and 2,430 ha for Kenering, compared to 15,500 ha for Temengor. In the
Bersia reservoir area, virtually no lands are presently in use, although
evidence of historical use probably by illegal squatters for single-crop
tobacco growing exists on some of the less steep banks. There are only few
settlers at present in the proposed Kenering reservoir area. No more than
400 ha of agricultural land will be flooded, with 80 ha being cultivated as
rubber plantations.



- 19 -
4.23      A comprehensive resettlement program has been carried out for the
124 families in the Temengor reservoir area. They have been settled in the
Air Ganda area along the Perak River about 13.5 km south of Grik. Each family
has been provided a house, 4 ha of land planted with rubber and 1.6 ha of bare
land for fruit trees and grazing. Common facilities such as roads, water
supply and electricity services, school, clinic, community hall and mosque
have also been provided. Resettlement of families residing in the Bersia and
Kenering hydroelectric development areas will also be carried out in the Air
Ganda area under the same program. The number of families involved in these
areas would be much less.
4.24      Important recommendations made by SECO regarding the ecological
aspects are:
(a) A topographic survey should be undertaken to confirm whether a full
supply level of 111.3 m might affect the sanitary condition of
villages situated in the lower reaches of Sungai Kendrong by
liquid waste from settled areas around Grik./l
(b)  In order to prolong the life of the Kenering reservoir, measures
should be taken to reduce the sediment load from the Klian Intan
tin mine located on the tributary of Rui, more than 50 km upstream
of the Kenering reservoir.
(c) Sanitary waste control, careful application of fertilizers and
good agricultural practice should be implemented to minimize the
effect on aquatic growth; and
(d) An archaeological reconnaissance of the limestone cliffs in the
Kenering reservoir should be carried out during the early stages
of the project.
4.25      There appears to be no single ecological consequence or combination
of consequences of significant importance to preclude construction of the
project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that NEB will carry
out the recommendations proposed by the consultants.
Risks
4.26      The project does not present any unusual technical risk.  Some
terrorist activities took place during the early stage of construction of the
Temengor project, but no further disturbances have been experienced since
December 1974. Since the Bersia and Kenering sites are further downstream
from Temengor, closer to the main road, and NEB has gathered the support of
local residents by developing a mutually satisfactory resettlement program,
it is believed that no difficulties will arise during project execution.
/1   The survey was completed; further study is being carried out by the
Institute of Medical Research. It is not expected that the full
supply level of Kenering project would be affected.

5. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Finances
5.01      A summary of the salient features of NEB's financial performance
for the period FY73 through FY78 is given below:
FY73     FY74      FY75      FY76      FY77      FY78
----------------- (M$ million) ------------------
Operating revenue             253       292       370       501       586       666
Operating expenses            144       210       318       391       474       518
Net income                     109       82        52       110       112       148

Net fixed assets
(revalued)                  989    1,145    1,245    1,527    1,705    2,195
Rate of return (after
taxes) (%)                  9.9       6.3       4.1       7.8      5.9      -7.3
Annual debt service
coverage (times)            2.7       2.4       1.9       2.8      2.4       2.5
Debt/equity ratio (%)       47/53    46/54    48/52    50/50    50/50    47/53
Since FY73, NEB's earnings have been erratic with the rate of return on
revalued net fixed assets fluctuating between almost 10% in FY73 and 4% in
FY75. The disallowance in FY74 and FY75 by the Government (as an anti-
inflationary measure) of the application of NEB's fuel adjustment charge to
industrial and commercial consumers affected NEB's profitability. The need
to make retroactive salary adjustments in FY75 and FY77 in compliance with
Government decrees entailed payments of M$25.3 and M$32.0 million
respectively in those years.
5.02      The following table shows NEB's investments during the period
FY73-77 and the related sources of finance; for comparison purposes, the
forecasts made at the time of appraisal for Loan 700-MA (1970) are also
given.

5.03      NEB's investment during the period FY73-77 was more than double the
appraisal forecasts for the fifth power project. This higher level of invest-
ment was met from better than expected internal cash generation, higher
Government contributions, larger additional borrowing and a heavy reduction
in working capital.
Present Position
5.04      NEB's financial position as of the end of FY78 is summarized as
follows:
M_ million
Net fixed assets (revalued)                         2,195
Work in progress                                      478
Investment in industry                                  5
Current assets                                        334
Total Assets                                   3,012
Equity and consumers' contributions                 1,655
Consumers' deposits                                    50
Current liabilities                                   403
Long-term debt                                        904
Total Equity and Liabilities                   3,012
As of August 31, 1978, NEB's debt/equity ratio of 47/53 was adequate. How-
ever, its current ratio of 0.8 resulting from a large reduction in working
capital (para. 5.03) was unsatisfactory. Provision for improvement in the
current ratio has been made in the financing plan for FY80-85.



- 22 -
Earning Requirements
5.05      To help improve NEB's future financial position, the Government
approved in September 1979 a set of measures that include: implementation
of a more rational tariff structure, exempting NEB from corporate tax,
development tax, import duties and other taxes; Government subsidy for
losses incurred in the operation of rural and diesel stations; financing by
Government of the rural electrification investment programs; and Government
equity injection. In addition, the Government authorized NEB effective
since November 1, 1979 a tariff increase of M-12.6 per kWh to reflect the
higher fuel cost incurred by NEB in FY79. The application of this fuel cost
variation charge had been withheld by Government since June 1979.
5.06      Under Loan 1443-MA, NEB was required to earn an 8% (after tax)
rate of retiurn on revalued assets. This is equivalent to a before tax rate
of about 10%.  NEB's rate of return in-MY78-was 7.3%.  However, the
6-vernment requested the Bank to adopt a self-financing ratio as a measure
of financial control for the project in lieu of a rate of return. The
Government maintains that for a dynamic organization like NEB where the
asset base is constantly expanding, the concept of self-financing is a
be7tter indicator of financial performance than the rate of return measure.
A recent loan approved by the Asian Development Bank for a hydropower
project in Malaysia also contains a self-financing covenant. Since the
Bank's objective is to ensure the financial strength of NEB and  its ability
Co finance a reasonable proportion of its expansion program, the self-
financing ratio is an acceptable substitute for a rate of return measure as
it directly reflects the level of cash generation. Besides, NEB's
investment program is not expected to have wide variations from one year to
another, thus eliminating the "lumpiness" problem assoclated with the
self-financing ratio. During negotiations, it was agreed that NEB will earn
revenues adequate to meet at least the following self-financing ratios on
the basis of a three-year sliding investment average: 15%_in FY80, 25% in
FYs 81-84 and 30% in FY85 and thereafter.  These percentages are satis-
1Tctory in comparison with other power utilities with large expansion
programs. During negotiations, it was also agreed that the Government and
NEB will review, at least three months before the end of each fiscal year,
the adequacy of NEB's revenues to produce, on the basis of a realistic
forecast, the agreed self-financing ratio for the following fiscal year. On
the basis of this review, the Government and NEB will determine the measures
required to achieve these ratios and will implement them before the
beginning of the following fiscal year. The financial projections
(para. 5.12) show that with a small 2% increase in tariffs in FY80 and
implementation of the fuel adjustment clause (para. 5.05), NEB will achieve
its agreed self financing ratio.
Financing Plan
5.07      A summary of NEB's investment requirements for the period FY80-85
and the sources from which they will be met is presented below:

Total Sources of Funds                        3,814.6    1,733.9       100
5.08      About 57% of NEB's financing requirements for 1980-85 will be met
from borrowing and its own internal cash generation will provide about
24%. The remaining 19% will come from Government equity contribution (13%)
and from consumer's contribution (6%). About half the amount to be borrowed
has been already contracted and the balance corresponds to future projects
(Trengganu, Port Klang and major transmission lines) for which borrowing will
be arranged in due course.
5.09      The financing plan is reasonable.  It assumes that NEB will
achieve the covenanted self-financing ratios of 15% in FY80, 25% in FY81 to
84 and 30% in FY85 and onwards. During negotiation the Government agreed
that it will provide adequate funds to help finance NEB's development
program including an equity contribution of M$150 million (US$68 million) in
FY80.
5.10      The financing plan includes US$140.6 million in borrowing for the
proposed project (see para. 4.12); inclusive of the proposed Bank loan of
US$50 million which would be for 17 years with 4 years of grace at the Bank's
current lending rate.



- 24 -
5.11      Apart from the investment in the proposed Bank-financed project,
NEB's program includes US$1.2 billion for other investments and US$183 mil-
llion for additional working capital.
Future Performance
5.12      A summary of NEB's financial indicators for FY79 through FY84 is
given below. Further details are presented in Annexes 13 through 16.

5.13      The financial projections show that NEB's financial performance
over the period FY79-84 will be satisfactory. NEB's liquidity is expected
to improve, although the improvement will not obviate the need for short-
term borrowing from time to time which would be available from local banks.
Debt service coverage would be satisfactory, remaining above 1.3 during the
projected period.
Debt Limitation
5.14      Loan 1443-MA requires NEB to maintain a debt/equity ratio not
greater than 60/40. This covenant will be continued for the proposed loan.
However, in order to clarify the application of the covenant, the following
definitions will be used for the proposed loan:
(a)  the term "total debt" shall mean all debt contracted by NEB to be
repaid after one year of the date it is incurred; it shall exclude
the current maturities of that debt; and
(b) the term "equity" shall include NEB's paid-in capital (Government
contributions) and earned surplus; it shall exclude surplus from
revaluation of fixed assets.



- 25 -
5.15      Loan 1443-MA also requires NEB to limit short-term debt to not more
than 5% of long-term debt. In order to improve monitoring of NEB's current
position, this covenant would be amended for the proposed loan by requiring
that from FY81 onwards, NEB's current liabilities will not exceed 33% of
its cash operating expenses for the preceding 12 months. For this purpose,
the following definitions will be used:
(a)  the term "current liabilities" shall include accounts payable to
suppliers of goods and services (except those related to capital
expenditures), accrued interest on loans, declared dividends,
provisions for taxation, bank overdrafts and short-term loans

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least Cost Solution
6.01      The Bersia and Kenering hydroelectric developments will have the
following contributions:
Average
Dependable         Firm      annual
Installed capacity    peaking capacity    energy    energy
(MW)                  (M{)           (GWh)       (GWh)
Bersia                     72                    70            190         238
Kenering                  120                   120            340         456
Total                192                    190            530         694
6.02      Investigations for other hydro projects have not been advanced to
a stage that such projects could be completed in FY83/84 when additional
capacity and energy is required. After completion of the Temengor reservoir,
the next logical step is to develop the downstream potentials to fully utilize
the regulated flow from Temengor. The only realistic alternative would be a
thermal development, consisting of an oil-fired unit of 120 MW and a gas
turbine of 70 MW, the capabilities of which are comparable with those of the
Bersia and Kenering developments. The two alternative programs with and
without the project are:
Program A                             Program B
1983     Bersia        (72 MW)                  Thermal      (120 MW)
1984     Kenering    (120 MW)                   Gas turbine  (70 MW)
1985     Port Klang  (300 MW) No. 1             Port Klang  (300 MW) No. 1
1986     Trengganu   (200 MW) Nos. 1 & 2        Trengganu   (200 MW) Nos. 1 & 2
6.03      The comparison was made on a constant price basis by comparing the
total present worth of investment, operation and maintenance and fuel costs.
Generation scheduling computer program (COSTOL) of the Central Electricity
Generating Board of England was adopted to calculate the fuel costs by
merit-order operation on a system basis. Efficiency prices were used as
follows:
(a)  taxes and duties were excluded;
(b)  there was no shadow pricing for foreign exchange costs as the stan-
dard conversion factor is approximately equal to 1 in Malaysia;
and
(c)  the conversion factors for the skilled labor and unskilled labor
were assumed to be 1.0 and 0.5 respectively.

6.04      Program A with Bersia and Kenering developments was found to be
the least cost solution for discount rates up to 17% (Annexes 18 and 19).
The present worth of these two alternative programs at different discount
rates are as follows:
Discount rate            Program A               Program B
(%)                (M$ million)            (M$ million)
8                    373                     757
10                    349                     587
12                    330                     470
14                    314                     387
16                    301                     326
6.05      Sensitivity tests for variations in capital costs and fuel costs
give the following results:
Equalizing discount rate
(a)  On basic assumption                              17.3%
(b) Project cost increased by:
10%                                            15.7%
20%                                            14.4%
(c) Fuel cost increased by:
10%                                            18.3%
20%                                            19.3%
Internal Economic Rate of Return
6.06      The internal economic rate of return of the project (IERR) is the
discount rate which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable
to the project. The project costs and benefits streams are shown in Annex
20. The costs are net of taxes and include the full costs of the associated
transmission facilities (275 kV line was recommended by PCR to accommodate
future hydroelectric developments in the northeast region). Ideally, the
benefits should be measured in terms of consumers' willingness to pay, but
since this is practically impossible to evaluate, the incremental revenue of
the project was used as a proxy for total benefits. This is a minimum mea-
sure of the benefits as consumers' surpluses and additional peaking contri-
bution of the project are ignored in the analysis. On this basis, the IERR
is 13.8%.

Assumptions in Financial Forecasts
Income Statement
1.        Revenues from Electricity Sales.  It has been assumed that the
fuel cost variation charge will be implemented automatically to recover any
increase in fuel cost. No increase in basic tariff is expected except about
2% resulting from the implementation of the new tariff structure in FY80.
2.        Other Operating Revenues.  Include reconnection fees, repairs,
interest received and government subsidy toward losses in rural and diesel
stations.
3.        Operating Expenses.  The forecast considers the requirements for
a larger scale of operations plus price escalation.
4.        Depreciation.  NEB uses straight-line depreciation.  An average of
3.3% per year on revalued assets was used.
5.        Corporate and Development Taxes.  Starting with FY80 NEB was
exempted from corporate taxes (40%) and development taxes (5%). Due to
large deductions allowed on the basis of the investments made, no provision
for taxes was required in FY79.

6.        Dividends.  Represents the forecast prepared by NEB following the
practice of previous years.
Statement of Sources and Applications of Funds
7.        Consumers' Contribution and Deposits.  Include expected contri-
butions from consumers, both in urban and rural areas, according to the cost
to NEB for supplying the service.
8.         Equity Contributions.  The Government agreed during negotiations
to increase NEB's paid-in capital in M$150.0 million in FY80.
9.         IBRD Loan.  The proposed Bank loan of $50.0 million was assumed
with a repayment period of 17 years including 4 years of grace, an interest
of 8.25%, and a commitment fee of 3/4 of 1%.
10.       Investment in Industry.  It was assumed that no additional invest-
ment in industry will be made after FY82 when the cable, transformers and
meter factories are expected to be fully operational.
11.       Increase in Working Capital.  It was assumed that in the future
NEB will be able to improve its liquidity position from a negative net work-
ing capital of M$124 million in 1980 to reach a positive net working capital
of M$141 million in FY85.
