The primary objective of the\n            project is to utilize fully the flow of the Perak River\n            regulated by the recently completed Temengor Project (348\n            MW) 20 km upsteam of the Bersia site. The associated\n            transmission/substation facilities will provide the basis\n            for accelerated rural electrification to be implemented in\n            the near future. Co-financing is arranged with CDC (UK),\n            CIDA (Canada), OECF (Japan) and commercial banks. There are\n            no significant risks or technical difficulties associated\n            with the project."}, "docdt": "1980-02-29T00:00:00Z"}
