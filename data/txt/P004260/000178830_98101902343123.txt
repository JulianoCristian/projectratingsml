REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD OF THE STATES OF MALAYA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF MALAYSIA FOR THE NINTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the National Electricity Board of the States of Malaya (NEB) with the
guarantee of Malaysia for the equivalent of US$50.0 million to help finance
the Ninth Power Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at 8.25% per annum. The Malaysian
Government has obtained the commitment of the Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF) of Japan to provide US$17.6 million for this project and is
currently negotiating an additional OECF contribution of US$34.5 million;
terms and conditions of these loans have yet to be determined. The
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) has agreed to lend to NEB US$13.0
million, for a term of 20 years, including four years of grace; the interest
rate is yet to be determined. The Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) has provided a grant of US$6.8 million for engineering services. A
group of commercial banks will provide US$7.5 million on terms and con-
ditions to be determined shortly.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report, "Malaysia:  New Perspectives on the
Third Malaysia Plan" (No. 1594-MA), is dated October 14, 1977. Since that
report was circulated, a book has been prepared, at the request of the
Government, which reviews the overall performance of the Malaysian economy
since 1960, discusses current issues and assesses future prospects.
Entitled "Malaysia: Growth and Equity in a Mlultiracial Society," the book
is scheduled for publication in April 1980. Detailed data on Malaysia's
economy are shown in Annex I.
3.        By most economic indicators, Malaysia has done well in the past.
The per capita income of US$1,090 in 1978 is among the highest in Southeast
Asia. During the past two decades, the Malaysian economy achieved an
average real growth of GNP of about 7% a year. This sustained high growth
rate is basically a reflection of the country's wealth in natural resources,
especially its ample reserves of cultivable land; an outward-oriented growth
strategy; good, albeit cautious, economic and financial management; and, not
least, stable social and political institutions. Three specific factors
were important: sharp rises in productivity in the rubber sector - rises
which cushioned the effects of steep price declines and helped maintain
the Malaysian share in the world rubber market; a big push for export
diversification through rapid expansion of the production of palm oil and
the extraction of timber; and rapid manufacturing growth, which has averaged
about 13% a year since 1968 and has been increasingly oriented toward exports.



- 2 -
4.        A look beyond the macroeconomic aggregates reveals that Malaysia
has been trying to overcome a serious poverty problem. Since 1960, signi-
ficant improvements have been made in raising production in agriculture,
diversifying output and improving social services. However, the impact of
these improvements on the incomes of the poor has been offset to a
significant extent by other factors. Continuing rapid population growth has
substantially reduced the impact of production increases on per capita
incomes. In addition, MIalaysia suffered a serious and sustained terms of
trade loss during the 1960s which further reduced average real income growth
during the period. As a result, a serious poverty problem persists: the
Government estimates that almost 40% of the population has incomes insuffic-
ient to provide minimum requirements of food, shelter, clothing and other
basic needs. Further, this problem is complicated by considerable racial
inequalities in income and employment. Malay income on average is only
about 40% the income of Chinese and about two thirds the income of Indians.
MIalays still predominate in employment in agriculture and non-Malays in the
industry and services sectors.
5.        Because the problems of poverty and racial inequalities are both
serious and persistent, the Government has given top priority to solving them.
Thus, the twin objectives of the New Economic Policy, introduced by the
Government in 1971, are to eradicate poverty and to reduce the racial
imbalance in income, employment, and the ownership of assets. More
specifically, it is targeted that by 1990 the incidence of poverty will be
reduced by two-thirds, that the pattern of employment will reflect the
racial composition of the population, and that the share of bumiputras /1 in
the ownership of the corporate sector will increase from 2% in 1970 to at
least 30% in 1990. The New Economic Policy emphasizes the need for rapid
growth in the industrial and services sectors as the principal means by
which the objectives will be attained. The Government's long-term plan is
based on the requirement that about 2 million, or almost 90%, of the new
jobs to be created during 1975-90 would be in industry and services. This
requirement implies a substantial reduction in the share of agricultural
employment. It also implies a net shift out of agriculture of more than a
million jobs from the number that would be employed if present employment
patterns were to persist.
6.         If the targets of the New Economic Policy are to be reached, the
economy must maintain a long-term GNP growth rate of at least 8% a year.
The growth of the manufacturing sector will have to be even more rapid.
Without the expansion, employment growth of more than 3% a year will not
materialize if rural incomes are to be significantly increased. A more
moderate growth rate would substantially reduce the creation of new
employment in the modern sector and make it more difficult to achieve the
targets for restructuring employment and reducing poverty.
/1 Bumiputra literally means "son of the soil." The word is used to refer
to Malays and other indigenous groups.



- 3 -
7.        Malaysia's strong natural resource base together with a favorable
outlook for the prices of her major commodity exports should provide the
economy with sufficient financial resources to achieve rapid growth. Aside
from short term fluctuations, the balance of payments current account should
continue in surplus for the foreseeable future enabling an adequate level of
reserves to be maintained together with a moderate level of debt service.
The elasticity of tax revenues should also enable the Government to finance an
expanded development program. Thus the availability of resources, which
has not been a serious problem in'the past,, is expected to be even less of a
constraint in the future. Compared with most other developing countries,
Malaysia is fortunate in this respect.
8.        Although Malaysia appears to have the financial capacity to achieve
rapid growth, the economy will no longer be able to rely so heavily on rapid
growth of primary production. Although Malaysia still is rich in natural
resources, which will provide a reliable base for the expansion of the
economy, the growth rates of the production of such commodities as rubber,
palm oil, petroleum and forest products are all likely to be lower than in
the past. With growth decelerating in the resource sectors, rapid
industrial growth will increasingly become essential to successful economic
performance. This imperative arises not only from the viewpoint of
production and the creation of real incomes but also from the viewpoint of
employment and its racial restructuring.
9.        In addition to rapid industrial growth, successful achievement of
the targets of the New Economic Policy will require a concerted effort to
accelerate the pace of rural development. Most of the poor live in rural
areas. Although rapid growth of industrial employment can ease the problem
of rural poverty by absorbing migrants from rural areas, poverty will
continue to be a largely rural phenomenon. Thus, even if there is rapid
sustained growth of employment in industry and services, the projections of
the Third Malaysia Plan indicate that more than three-quarters of Malaysia's
poor will be in rural areas in 1990. An expansion of income and employment
opportunities for rural tIalaysians is of high priority. Furthermore, the
expected decline in growth rates of the production of rubber and palm oil
make an expansion of government programs even more necessary, for example,
accelerating land development programs, increasing settler participation in
those programs, expanding programs of replanting for rubber smallholders,
expanding extension and credit for rice farmers, intensifying efforts to
promote intercropping by coconut smallholders and improving the access of
poor families to such basic services as education, housing, electricity and
water supply - all of which deserve priority because of the substantial
impact they can have in reducing poverty.  The greater availability of
public resources will enable the Government to undertake that expansion.
But the main constraint on mounting a more effective attack on rural poverty
appears to be the capacity of the public sector to identify and prepare
projects that can affect large numbers of rural poor.



- 4 -
10.       The Government does not have the direct control over private
investment that it has over public investment, but it can play a strong role
in providing a policy framework conducive to vigorous growth in the private
sector. Because the more obvious areas of import substitution have been
exhausted, sustained rapid growth in manufacturing will have to rely
increasingly on export expansion. Policies will therefore have to ensure a
favorable export environment. With regard to institutional factors, the
Government has already acted to alleviate fears in the private community
about the Industrial Coordination Act and the Petroleum Development Act.
The Government has also stressed that it will implement the Industrial
Coordination Act in a flexible and pragmatic manner so as to encourage
investment and growth. Because much of the concern in the private sector
has been over how that Act will be implemented, flexible implementation by
the Government should help to ease the concern in the business community.
11.       In summary, the prospects appear to be good for achieving rapid
growth and for ameliorating the twin problems of poverty and racial im-
balances. Certainly there should be no serious constraints imposed by the
availability of resources. To achieve the targets of the New Economic
Policy will nevertheless require vigorous action by the Covernment along a
number of fronts. The policy framework will have to be readjusted to ensure
sustained growth of the industrial sector. A pragmatic attitude will be
needed in interpreting and implementing the quantitative restructuring
targets to ensure that sight is not lost of the overall goal of improving
the racial balance. Growth in the supply of technically trained manpower
will require close scrutiny to ensure that it does not constrain the
restructuring potential made possible by rapid economic growth. Finally,
larger and more effective programs to reduce poverty by direct action will
require a concerted effort to expand the capacity of the public sector to
prepare and implement such programs.
12.       Assuming a continuing 7-8% rate of economic growth during the
1980s, Malaysia's balance of payments is projected to remain in modest
surplus. The cumulative current account surplus is projected to average
about 0.5% of GDP during the 1980s. Net capital inflows equivalent to
about 1.5% of GDP would be required to maintain a reasonable level of
reserves and to finance any short term balance of payments deficits. At
present about 15% of public debt outstanding and disbursed is from the World
Bank; this percentage may increase somewhat during the early 1980s. Debt
service is expected to be maintained at a level equivalent to about 5% of
exports, somewhat lower than the 1978 level of 8.8% which was abnormally
inflated due to prepayments of existing loans. The Bank's share of debt
service is currently about 11% and may increase to about 16% by the end of
the decade.
13.       In general, over the next few years, it is likely that the
Government will need less external capital than previously forecast, largely
because of strong commodity prices and oil earnings. At the same time,
Malaysia has a serious income distribution and poverty problem. The
country needs technical assistance and expertise to help develop poverty



- 5 -
alleviation programs and to assist in designing and packaging projects that
reach out directly to low-income families. The Malaysians believe strongly
that project borrowing, particularly from development institutions such as
the World Bank, is necessary to assist them to mount an effective attack on
poverty. Bank lending is therefore focused on strengthening government
efforts to reduce poverty directly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
14.       The Bank has made 46 loans to Malaysia, totaling US$1,082.6 million
for projects in agriculture, forestry, education, population, industrial
finance, power, water supply, sewerage, telecommunications, ports, railways,
roads, and urban transport. The proposed project is the second step in the
development of the Perak River, following the Temengor Project (348 MW)
which has recently been completed. The Bank has made eight loans for
Malaysia's power sector amounting to US$236.2 million (net of cancellations),
which are helping to finance the increase of approximately 1,610 MW in NEB's
generating capacity and associated transmission lines. The first six
projects have been completed and are operating well. Implementation of the
seventh and eighth power projects is on schedule. The power systems in
Sabah and Sarawak are being assisted by ADB loans.
15.       Although in a number of cases disbursements have been slower than
expected, the execution of Bank projects in Malaysia has generally been satis-
factory. As of December 31, 1979, the effective loans to Malaysia held by
the Bank amounted to US$914.9 million. Nineteen loans have been fully
disbursed. Annex II contains a summary of Bank Loans and IFC investments,
as well as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       While Malaysia currently is a resource surplus country, the openness
of the economy (exports amounting to about 45% of the GDP) and the volatility
of the prices of Malaysia's main exports (rubber, palm oil, and tin) make the
continuance of large surpluses uncertain. To cushion against fluctuation in
exports, large reserves are needed and continued resource transfer is
justified. However, the primary consideration of Bank lending will not be
resource transfer; rather, it is institution-building and helping Mlalaysia
to expand its capacity to implement programs to combat the deep-rooted
problems of poverty and unemployment, particularly in the rural areas.
17.       Malaysia's commitment to assist Lts low-income groups has strength-
ened significantly in the past few years. The Bank can take some measure of
credit for its efforts to help Mfalaysia identify and prepare projects geared
toward the rural poor. The number of rural development projects recently
financed and in the current pipeline is impressive. Six rural development
projects were financed in the past three years including national extension,
coconut smallholders development, national small-scale irrigation and three



- 6 -
integrated agricultural development projects. At least 16 additional rural
development projects have been identified for possible Bank financing in the
coming four years.  However, the Government's capability to develop projects
remains weak, largely because of a shortage of trained manpower. Witlh the
help of UNDP-financed and Bank-executed State and Rural Development Project,
which provides technical assistance to selected federal and state agencies,
the Bank is helping the Government to develop further its programs and
projects for reducing poverty.
18.       The country needs assistance in developing future povertv programs
and projects that will reach larger numbers of low-income famiLies.  While
providing support to existing smallholders, the Bank is assisting landless
laborers in developing larger areas of new land for agriculture. The Bank's
lending program will focus on the improvement of agricultural support
services, extension of credit for small-scale industries and other assis-
tance directly related to poverty redressal. In this regard, the Bank plans
to mount a concentrated effort to help such institutions as the Agricultural
Credit Bank (BPM), the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation
Authority (FELCRA), and the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development
Authority (RISDA). The Bank also plans to help expand social services, such
as adult education and skill training.
19.       Assistance to infrastructure development will be selective, concen-
trating on rural and coastal transportation and rural electrification. In
that regard, our future lending in the power sector will concentrate on
electrification of remote rural villages and extension of associated trans-
mission/distribution facilities rather than the conventional financing of
large power stations. At the Bank's urging, the National Electricity Board
(NEB) has recently undertaken a rural electrification study, which has its
best chances for a systematic implementation through our continuing presence
in the power sector. By maintaining our association with NEB, we intend to
help accelerate rural electrification and planning for overall energy sector
development.
20.       IFC has made six investments in Malaysia totalling US$8.69 million.
The total investments held by IFC as of December 31, 1979 amounted to
US$1.14 million (Annex II).
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
21.       The principal sources of energy in Malaysia are natural gas,
petroleum, and hydroelectric potential. No significant deposits of coal or
uranium have yet been found. The commercially exploitable proven energy
reserves are estimated to be 32 x 1015 Btu, of which about 78% is natural
gas, 19% petroleum and 3% hydropower. Malaysia has been a net exporter of
petroleum products since 1973.  It is expected that by 1980 petroleum



-7-
production would average 116 million barrels a year (about 317,000 barrels a
day). The country is also endowed with a sizable amount of natural gas.
The export of liquefied natural gas is expected to be about 6.4 million tons
a year (22.7 million cu m a day) after 1983. The hydropotential in
Peninsular Malaysia is estimated at about 1,900 MW in capacity and 7,670 GWh
in energy, equivalent to 13 million barrels of oil a year.
Role of the Sector in the Economy
22.        Electricity revenue accounts for only 1.8% of GDP.  However,
electricity provides motive power to the manufacturing and mining industries
which account for 20% and 5% of GDP and 21% and 13% of merchandise
exports, respectively. The growth of the power sector has kept pace with
Malaysia's economic development. Between 1970 and 1978, when GNP grew at
an average rate of about 7.5% in real terms, total electricity consumption
grew at an average rate of about 13.4%.
History of Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
23.        Of the eight power projects financed by the Bank, six have been
completed and are operating satisfactorily. The first unit (120 MW) of the
seventh project was commissioned in September 1979 and project construction
is on schedule.  Works financed under the eighth project are in the early
stages of construction but no difficulties are expected. The project
performance audit report for the fifth loan (700-MA) indicated that the
project was completed with a cost overrun of about 15% and about three
months behind schedule.

24.        Power in Malaysia is supplied principally by autonomous Government-
owned entities. The largest of these is the National Electricity Board
(NEB) serving Peninsular Malaysia with the exception of part of the State of
Perak which is supplied by the Perak River Hydroelectric Power Company
(PRHE). The Government has acquired all of the ordinary shares of PRHE and
is now its sole owner.  The final integration of PRHE with NEB is scheduled
to take place in 1980.  Sabah and Sarawak (the two states on the island of
Borneo) are supplied by Government-owned statutory authorities -
the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) and the Sarawak Electricity Supply
Corporation (SESCO).
25.        The generating capacity installed by the above-mentioned
entities was 1,802.8 1fW as of end-1978. Of this, 21% is hydro, 58% steam,
1% gas turbine and 20% diesel. In addition, there are a total of 19.5 MW
diesel units and 2 MW of hydro owned by 65 small electric companies. NEB
accounts for about 80% (1,440 MW) of the total installed capacity for
Malaysia. Quality of service has been good except for some rural stations
which provide only 12 hours supply. Because of the shortage of reserve
capacity, limited load curtailment has been necessary for the past few years



-8-
during dry seasons or emergency shut-downs of large thermal units. However,
this situation has improved after the full commissioning of the Temengor
Hydroelectric Power Plant (1979).
Supply and Demand for Electric Power
26.       For Peninsular Malaysia, total energy generated in FY78 was 7,432
GWh. Per capita consumption in that year was 570 kWh. Access to electric-
ity is estimated to be about 52% in Peninsular Malaysia. From FY70 to FY78
demand for electric power has grown by about 13.4% per annum. Industry and
mining have been the largest users of power, followed by commercial and
residential consumers. Energy sales up to FY85 are expected to increase at
an average rate of 10% per annum.
National Electricity Board (NEB)
27.       The National Electricity Board, established under the Electricity
Act of 1949, is a financially sound, well-organized, and well-operated
utility. It regulates the production and use of electric energy in
Peninsular Malaysia and grants licenses for the installation and operation
of independent electricity works. NEB's Board of Directors is appointed by
the Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts, subject to the terms and
conditions he may determine. The Board is headed by a Chairman and a Deputy
Chairman, who is also General Manager.
28.       The present organization of NEB has proved to be efficient, but
improvements are required to cope with a future increase in work load and
consequent expansion of the corporation. In accordance with the Bank's
recommendation, the system planning and construction activities have been
separated. A Corporate Planning Department under the charge of a Deputy
General Manager has been set up since January 1980. However, the Internal
Auditing Unit, which now reports to the Chief Accountant, lacks the necessary
independence and wider functions which it would acquire if it were to
report to the General Manager. Thus, NEB has agreed to make its Internal
Auditing Unit directly responsible to the General Manager by December 31,
1981.
29.       In recent years, NEB has lost some of its middle management staff
to the private sector.  NEB is now trying to fill the vacancies through
recruitments from outside and a vigorous internal training program. A
training institute was newly established and put into full operation in 1979.
Assurances were obtained that NEB will recruit sufficient qualified and
experienced staff to meet its immediate manpower requirements and continue
its vigorous training program for long-term manpower needs.
30.       In the past, NEB's internal cash generation has financed over 60%
of the expansion program, but this situation has been changing due to
accelerated load growth, the expanded construction program and inflation.
Consequently, greater reliance will have to be placed on borrowing and



- 9 -
additional equity injections. To maintain a sound financial policy, a
covenant has been incorporated in the draft Loan Agreement (Section 5.05)
requiring NEB to produce funds from internal sources of not less than 15%
for FY80, 25% for FYs81-84 and 30% for FY85 and thereafter.
31.       Under the Electricity Act, NEB has power to fix tariffs without
reference to any other authority. In practice, however, the Government
deliberates on tariff questions because of their political impact. As basic
tariffs have not been revised since 1958, they are not well related to NEB's
current costs of system operation. Increases in average revenue per
kilowatt-hour sold resulted almost entirely from the application of fuel cost
variation charges which were introduced in 1975. NEB revised its tariff
structure in November 1979 by consolidating the number of categories of
consumers from 23 to 7. NEB has agreed to exchange views with the Bank on
any proposed changes in its tariff structure (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 5.04(a)).
32.       NEB's rate of return on revalued assets in the past decade has
varied between 4% (FY75) and 10.0% (FY73). The existing debt service
covenant provides that the Bank's concurrence would be required when NEB's
borrowings result in a debt/equity ratio higher than 60/40. This require-
ment would be continued under the proposed project (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 5.06). The existing covenant also provides that NEB should limit
its short-term debt (maturing within one year) to 5% of its total debt. In
order to improve monitoring of NEB's current position, this covenant has
been amended under the proposed loan by requiring that from FY80 onwards
NEB's current liabilities will not exceed 33% of its cash operating expenses
for the preceding fiscal year (draft Loan Agreement, Secton 5.07).
33.       NEB is promoting the development of local manufacturing capability
in electric meters, cables, transformers and switchgear for which NEB would
be the main customer in the early years. A company has already been
established to manufacture cables in which NEB has a 60% share. A trans-
former factory is expected to be put into operation in 1980. Another
company is being organized for the manufacture of meters. The Loan Agreement
for the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1443-MA) contains a covenant that limits
NEB's investment in industries (other than for the generation, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity) to a maximum of 1% of its gross fixed
assets revalued each year. This covenant would be kept for the proposed
project (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.08).
Rural Electrification
34.       Rural electrification as a social objective began in 1957 and by
the end of FY78, 4,600 villages covering 370,000 consumers had been
electrified. These rural consumers represent about 40% of NEB's domestic
consumers. The number of villages newly electrified was 205 in FY75, 310 in
FY76, 400 in FY77 and 1,150 in FY78. While it is the Government's intention



- 10 -
to electrify rural Malaysia to the greatest extent possible, the current
program is not systematically organized. A rural electrification study was
included in the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1178-MA) in order to formulate a
comprehensive rural electrification plan and to review its technical,
economic and financial implications. The study was completed in August 1978
and is being used by the Government in formulating the rural electrification
program for the Fourth Malaysia Plan (FY81-85).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
35.        The feasibility report on the Upper Perak Hydroelectric Development
was first prepared by the Shawinigan Engineering Company (SECO) of Canada in
1966 and later updated in 1976 in a report entitled "Preinvestment Study -
Bersia and Kenering Hydroelectric Developments." The proposed expansion
plan for transmission lines and substations is based on the report prepared
in October 1976 by Preece Cardew and Rider (PCR) and entitled "Transmission
System Studies, 1976-85" and the more recent report, "Extension of Supply to
the East and Northeast of Peninsular Malaysia, 1978-85." The Bank's
preappraisal mission visited Malaysia in October 1977, and the appraisal
mission in January 1978. The proposed loan was negotiated in January 1980;
the Malaysian delegation was led by Mr. Khalil bin Hassan, Deputy Under
Secretary, Treasury. A Staff Appraisal Report (No. 2036a-MA; dated February
15, 1980 is being distributed separately. Supplementary project data are
provided in Annex III.
Objectives
36.        The primary objectives of the proposed project are to assist NEB's
continued system expansion program to meet the growing energy requirements
and to establish a backbone transmission system to the east coast of
Peninsular Malaysia for regional development and rural electrification. The
project also provides continued support to NEB's institutional development
and will assist NEB in obtaining funds from other sources, including
commercial banks, through co-financing arrangements. In addition, the
project provides assistance for an overall energy resources study, which
would help the Government to optimize the development and use of indigenous
energy resources.
Project Description
37.        The project includes the construction of two dams and hydroelectric
power stations in the upper reaches of the Perak River, Bersia (72 MW) and
Kenering (120 MW), about 20 km and 70 km respectively downstream of the
Temengor Project, and the 136 km of 275 kV and 38 km of 132 kV transmission
lines and associated substations to link the western network from Temengor
to Tanah Merah and Kota Bahru on the east coast. It is an important step



- 11 -
towards a full interconnection of Peninsular Malaysia's western network to
the eastern system, which would provide the basis for future implementation
of the rural electrification program. The project also includes consult-
ancy services for the energy resources study.
38.       Geological investigations have indicated that the bedrock at both
dam sites will provide adequate foundations with no significant structural
weakness. No unusual difficulties in construction are foreseen as the
physical site conditions have been well investigated, and the design and the
scope of construction are straightforward. NEB has agreed to maintain its
panel of experts to review the project designs and problems which might
arise during construction. NEB is required to implement, throughout the
operational period of the project, a program of inspection and maintenance
of the dam and associated works which would be satisfactory to the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Sections 3.03, 4.04).
Implementation
39.       Tenders for main civil works were opened in October 1979 and those
for turbines and generators in April 1979. Contracts are expected to be
awarded in early 1980. Construction of civil works will start in mid-1980
and reservoirs will be expected to be ready for impounding by March 1983 for
Bersia and January 1984 for Kenering. The project is expected to be
completed by August 1984.
40.       NEB has engaged the Shawinigan Engineering Company (SECO) of Canada
for the engineering study, detailed design, preparation of tender documents
and evaluation of bids for the main civil works and mechanical and electrical
equipment, and for the construction supervision of the project. As SECO
performed well at Temengor and is familiar with the local conditions, this
arrangement is considered acceptable.
Project Costs and Financing
41.       The estimated cost of the project is US$232.9 million, of which
US$140.6 million, or 60%, is in foreign exchange. Breakdown of the project
costs are given in the Loan and Project Summary at the beginning of this
report. Base costs are at end-1979 price levels, based on bid prices
already available for civil works and major equipment. Physical contin-
gencies are estimated at 10% for civil works and 3.5% for mechanical and
electrical works and associated transmission and substation facilities.
These are considered reasonable given the known geological condition of the
site and the fact that the project design has already evolved to an advanced
stage. The price contingencies for items already tendered are based on the
terms and conditions specified in the respective bids. For items yet to be
tendered, the following annual rates of inflation are used both for foreign
and local costs: 10.5% for 1980, 9% for 1981, 8% for 1982 and 7% for 1983
and thereafter.



- 12 -
42.       The proposed financing arrangements are given in the Loan and
Project Summary. The Bank loan of US$50.0 million would finance 35% of the
foreign exchange costs and 21% of the total project cost. The Bank loan
would finance the foreign exchange costs of ancillary electrical and
mechanical equipment, associated transmission and substation facilities and
consultancy services. The civil works and turbines are expected to be
financed by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, using
Yen credits. The generators costing about US$11.2 million would be financed
by other bilateral or suppliers' credits. The Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA) would finance the major portion of the foreign
cost of the engineering services. The loan of US$13.0 million equivalent
from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) will be used for any
contracts or any parts thereof not financed by the above parties.  A
commercial bank loan of about US$7.5 million will be obtained to fill the
remaining financing gap of the foreign exchange costs. Based on the
experience with the previous loan, NEB would have no difficulty in obtaining
commercial bank loans on favorable terms. NEB would finance all local costs
through self-generating funds and local borrowing. Although it is very
unlikely, should the co-financing arrangements fail to materialize, or for
any other reason, funds available to NEB be inadequate to meet the expendi-
tures to carry out the project, the Government would make such funds
available to NEB to the extent required (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section
2.02(a)).
Financial Position
43.       NEB's debt/equity ratio of 47/53 at the end of FY78 is adequate.
For the project period (FY80-84), NEB's debt service ratio is expected to be
above 1.3 and its current position is expected to improve. To help strengthen
NEB's future financial position, the Government approved in September 1979
a set of measures that include: implementation of a more rational tariff
structure; exemption of NEB from corporate and development taxes, import
duties and other taxes; government subsidy for losses incurred in the
operation of rural and diesel stations; financing by the Government of rural
electrification programs; and government equity injections for NEB's system
development. In addition, the Government authorized NEB a tariff increase
of Mi2.6 per kWh to reflect the higher fuel cost incurred by NEB in FY79.
The application of this fuel cost variation charge had been withheld by the
Government since June 1979.
44.       Under the Eighth Power Project (Loan 1443-MIA), NEB was required to
earn an 8% (after tax) rate of return on revalued assets (equivalent to a
before tax rate of about 10%). NEB's rate of return in FY78 was 7.3%.
However, the Government requested the Bank to adopt a self-financing ratio
as a measure of financial control for the proposed project in lieu of a rate
of return. The Government maintains that for a dynamic organization like
NEB where the asset base is constantly expanding, the concept of self-
financing is a better indicator of financial performance than the rate of
return measure. A recent loan approved by the Asian Development Bank



- 13 -
for a hydropower project in Malaysia also contains a self-financing covenant.
Since the Bank's objective is to ensure the financial strength of NEB and
its ability to finance a reasonable proportion of its expansion program, the
self-financing ratio is an acceptable substitute for a rate of return
measure as it directly reflects the level of cash generation. Besides,
NEB's investment program is not expected to have wide variations from one
year to another, thus eliminating the "lumpiness" problem associated with
the self-financing ratio. It was therefore agreed that NEB shall take all
necessary measures to produce, during each of its fiscal years, funds from
internal sources adequate to meet at least the following self-financing
ratios on the basis of a three-year sliding investment average: 15% in FY80,
25% in FYs 81-84 and 30% in FY85 and thereafater (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 5.05). These percentages are satisfactory in comparison with other
power utilities with large expansion programs.
45.       The financing plan assumes that the Government would make an
equity contribution of US$229 million towards NEB's requirements during the
period of FY80-85. The Government agreed to provide adequate funds to help
finance NEB's development program as approved by the Government, including an
equity contribution of US$68 million in FY80 (draft Guarantee Agreement,
Section 2.02(b)). In the future, the Government and NEB would review, at
least three months before the end of each fiscal year, the necessary
measures to produce the required contribution to investment (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 5.04(b)).
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       All equipment and materials financed under the proposed loan would
be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. All equipment would be procured on
a supply-and-erect basis.
47.       Disbursements on equipment and materials would be made against
100% of foreign exchange costs of directly imported items, 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory) for items manufactured locally and 70% of total
expenditures for imported items procured locally. Disbursements for
consultants would be made against 100% of foreign expenditures. Disburse-
ments are expected to be completed by August 31, 1985.
Consultancy Services
48.       The Government asked the Bank to finance under the project a study
for optimizing development and use of local energy resources. The study will
require about 90 man-months of services and have an estimated total cost of
US$1.5 million. The average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees,
travel and subsistence, is expected to be about US$9,000. In addition to
these personnel costs, the contract cost will include the cost of vehicles,
equipment, field survey and investigation. It was agreed that the
Government will furnish to the Bank for review and comments not later than



- 14 -
July 31, 1982, a report prepared by consultants whose terms of reference and
qualifications should be satisfactory to the Bank (draft Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.01).
Benefits and Justification
49.       Investigations for hydro projects other than the Bersia and
Kenering schemes have not yet advanced to a stage where such projects could
be completed by FY83/84 when additional capacity and energy are required.
After completion of the Temengor Project, the next logical step is to
develop the downstream potentials of the Perak River to utilize fully the
regulated flow from Temengor. The only realistic alternative would be
thermal development consisting of an oil-fired unit of 120 MW and a gas
turbine of 70 MW, the characteristics of which are comparable with those of
the Bersia and Kenering developments. Analysis was made on a constant price
basis by comparing the total present worth of investment, operation,
maintenance and fuel costs for each alternative. The generation scheduling
computer system (COSTOL) of the Central Electricity Generating Board of
England was adopted to calculate the fuel costs by merit-order operation on
a system basis. The Bersia and Kenering developments were found to be the
least-cost solution. The internal economic rate of return of the proposed
project is 13.8%.
50.       Another important feature of this project is that it includes, as
one of its main components, the transmission lines and associated sub-
stations to link the western network to the east coast of Peninsular
Malaysia. This is an essential investment for future electrification of the
area with high priority for the Government's rural development programs. In
addition, it is expected that the Bank's involvement will help NEB in
obtaining additional financing from various other sources, including
commercial banks, on more favorable terms than NEB could obtain on its own.
Finally, although NEB has developed an efficient organization, Bank support
is still needed for the institution building required to handle its rapid
growth.
Environmental Effects
51.       The experience of Temengor provides very useful information on the
probable impact of the Bersia and Kenering impoundments. Bersia and
Kenering are low-head developments with a relatively small reservoir
capacity. The surface area of the reservoir is only 570 ha for Bersia and
2,430 ha for Kenering, compared to 15,500 ha for Temengor. Neither the
Bersia nor the Kenering impoundment is of sufficient volume to have a
significant impact on the hydrologic regime. Forestry reports indicate a
low incidence of marketable timber in the valley bottoms and no minerals
suitable for exploitation have been identified within the areas to be flooded.
52.       The consultants (SECO) have recommended that: (a) a topographic
survey be undertaken to determine the effect of the full reservoir level



- 15 -
on the sanitary condition of villages situated in the lower reache';
(b) measures should be taken to reduce the sediment from the tin nine 50 km
upstream of the Kenering reservoir; (c) waste and fertilizer control, and
good agricultural practice should be implemented to minimize the aqtuatic
growth; and (d) an archaeological reconnaissance of the limestone cliffs in
the Kenering reservoir should be carried out during the early stages of the
project. Government assurances were obtained that the project wouild be
carried out with due regard to ecological and environmental factors and, in
particular, that the recommendations of SECO mentioned above will be carried
out (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.08).
53.        In the Bersia reservoir area, virtually no land is presently used.
There are only a few settlers at present in the proposed Kenering reservoir
area.  No more than 400 ha of agricultural land would be flooded, with 80 ha
being cultivated as rubber plantations. A comprehensive resettlement
program has been carried out for the 124 families in the Temengor reservoir
area, and they are now resettled in the Air Ganda area along the Perak River
about 13.5 km south of Grik. Each family is provided with a houise, 4 ha of
rubber, and 1.6 ha of land for fruit trees and grazing. Common facilities
such as roads, water supply and electricity services, school, clinic,
community hall and mosque have also been provided. Resettlers are being
paid M$100 per family per month as living subsistence tntil the planted
rubber becomes productive. The same program is plannied for the Bersia and
Kenering developments using the Air Ganda area for resettlement.
Risks
54.       The project does not present any special technical risk.  The
experience gained in the construction of the Temengor project wouLd be
valuable in the Bersia and Kenering projects. Some terrorist activities
took place during the early stages of construction of the Temengor project,
but no further disturbances have been experienced since December 1974.
Because the Bersia and Kenering sites are furtlier downstream fromn Temengor,
closer to the main road, and because NEB has gathered the support of local
residents by developing a mutually satisfactory resettlement program, it is
believed that no difficulties would arise during project execution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORI'Y
55.       The draft Loan Agreement between NEB and the Bank, the draft
Gnarantee Agreement between Mialaysia and the Bank, and the ReporL of t}e

STATUS OF PROJECTS UNDER EXECUTION
GENERAL AGRICULTURE
Loan No. 885 Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0 Ilillion
Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective Date: June 22, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1981
The project consists of the third and last stage of the Jengka
Triangle program (under which overall 62,000 acres of palm oil and 35,000
acres of rubber will be established and 10,000 families will be settled).
Under the project, about 22,000 acres of oil palm and 16,400 acres
of rubber have been planted. Planting and maintenance standards are satisfac-
tory. A severe drought in 1976 and 1977 caused heavy losses in rubber planted
in schemes 21 and 22. A major program to supply replacements was completed in
April 1979. Oil palm on schemes 15, 17, 18, 19 and 23 has been brought into
production. Good progress has been made in village development in 1978 but
settler intake is generally 2-2.5 years behind appraisal estimates becauise of
earlier delays in construction of access roads. So far, about 2,200 houses
have been completed and about 2,100 settlers mo:ed into schemes 15-20.
Settler intake in schemes 21-23 is expected to be completed in 1980. [Jater
supplies are now satisfactory on all schemes but delays are still being
experienced in school and clinic construction. Oil palm mill construction in
scheme 18 has been completed and the plant is operative.
Loan No. 967  Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million Loan of
February 27, 1974: Effective Date: Nay 16, 1974; Closing
Date: June 30, 1982
The Project consists of clearing of 81,000 acres of land and
planting about 65,000 acres of oil palms, construction of 5 palm oil m-ills,
8 villages, roads and provision for power and water and settlement of
6,500 families.
Clearing of 80,900 acres has been completed and final planting is
being carried out. Planting and maintenance standards are satisfactory. Oil
palm production has started in 5 schemes and production has recovered 'rof-
initially disappointing le-vels.  A major resupplying programn to replane losos
to game is under way and boundary trenches haie been completed.  Due tvI de!a s
in infrastructure development, village development is one to tGree .'eIr1
behind schedule.  Rising timber prices and labor shortages are also    It;ry
difficulties for contractors.  Regular coordination committee meeting,s haee
improved interagency relationships, but shortfalls in constructioll -f .At C
supply and access roads will cause some further slippage.  The thl.r,[   i tin
fourth oil mills were completed in June 1979.  About 2,400 settler homr a I-ve
been constructed and about 2,100 settler families have been housed.

Loan No. 1044  Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million Loan of
October 3, 1974; Effective Date:  January 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project consists of clearing about 63,000 acres of land and
planting and maintenance of about 55,000 acres of oil palms; construction
of three palm oil mills and establishment of two urban settlements for about
5,500 families.
Clearing and planting operations on schemes 8 and 9 are nearing
completion having been delayed one year by late logging. On four schemes, 25%
of palms were damaged by game. Perimeter trenches are being dug and seedlings
resupplied. So far, 1,250 houses have been completed and 1,100 settlers moved
in in schemes 1, 2 and 4. Settler intake during 1979 was less than half of
the scheduled number. The Bahau Keratong highway has been opened for all
traffic and the project area is no longer isolated.
Loan No. 1115 Agricultural Research and Extension Project; US$28.5 Million
Loan of May 30, 1975; Effective Date: October 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project is designed to expand and strengthen research programs
and establish an Extension Liaison Unit in the Department of Agriculture.
The project was restructured in July/August 1979 and the loan agree-
ment was substantially amended to cover all agricultural research programs of
the institute, substantially reduce the manyears of consultants, reduce the
loan from $28.5 million to $20.5 million, and extend the closing date to June
1984.
Loan No. 1493  National Extension Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of January 10,
1978; Effective Date: September 8, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
This project is designed to strengthen agriculture extension and
related services on a national basis in Malaysia. An uncertain federal/state
relationship continues to constrain implementation. Specifically, the main
constraints are (a) the federal supernumerary status of project posts, and
(b) the inability of the Public Works Department to prepare timely civil works
designs. However, the interest and enthusiasm in the T&V extension methodol-
ogy has spread among the staff and the farmers, and pilot programs have been
implemented in all Peninsular States. Sabah and Sarawak have not yet accepted
federal control of staff; physical implementation is proceeding satisfactorily
in Sarawak.
Loan No. 1590 FELDA VI Land Settlement Project; US$28.0 Million Loan of
August 11, 1978; Effective Date: March 9, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1985
The project consists of land clearing, planting and maintenance
of 62,000 acres of rubber and up to 10,000 acres of cocoa and 500 acres of

experimental plantings in Pahang and Negri Sembilan, recruitment and
settlement of 6,200 rubber smallholders and 1,500 hired labor and construc-
tion of necessary housing and infrastructure facilities.
Clearing is delayed by late logging and subsequently late forest
clearances. Rubber planting operations are satisfactory in Kelau Krau and
Lepar Hilir and disappointing in Serting due to very poor soils, drought, and
inexperienced contractors. FELDA is reviewing its cocoa development program
in view of the very marginal soil suitability for cocoa cultivation. The crop
diversification program is also under review; special attention will be given
to the economics of the crops for the settler, transport arrangements and
costs, and marketing possibilities.
Loan No. 1618 Coconut Smallholders Development Project; US$19.5 Million
Loan of October 24, 1978; Effective Date: February 23, 1979;
Closing Date: March 31, 1984
The project consists of rehabilitation of about 44,200 acres of
traditional MT Coconuts and intercropping with cocoa, coffee, fruits, etc;
replanting of about 17,000 acres with hybrid coconuts and associated cash
crop gardens in the initial years; the provision for the importation of about
6,400 crossbred dairy animals for the development of about 3,340 integrated
dairy and beef operations; and the strengthening of support services for crop
and dairy production.
Physical implementation has exceeded the appraisal targets for
year 1 of the project. About 2,000 farm families have received assistance
to rehabilitate 3,600 acres of coconut and 1,500 acres were scheduled for
replanting in 1979. Contracts have already been let for purchase of 6,600
cross-bred heifers and delivery will commence in the last quarter of 1980.
The only problem encountered has been general concern about supernumerary
posts; however, prospects for continued satisfactory achievements under the
project are very good.
IRRIGATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT
Loan No. 973 Western Johore Agricultural Development Project; US$45.0 Million
Loan of April 5, 1974; Effective Date: August 14, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project includes main and feeder drains, farm roads, coastal
embankments and tidal gates to improve drainage and access in an area of about
135,000 ha in southwest Peninsular Malaysia, as well as an integrated agri-
cultural development program to introduce intercropping and other changes in
cropping patterns, construction of farmers development centers, and improve-
ments in research, extension, and crop processing. Civil works got off to a
slow start and are about 3-1/2 years behind schedule, but progress is now
accelerating. Staffing and land acquisition problems have been largely
overcome. Work is progressing on drainage and farm road contracts, and

contract award for secondary roads are expected in early 1980. Construction
of the Macap Dam began in October 1979. Progress on the agricultural side is
generally satisfactory, particularly in developing an integrated agricultural
service system to coordinate the efforts of the crop-based development
agencies with the extension activities in the project area. Work is also
proceeding on the preparation of a second phase project.
Loan No. 1294  North Kelantan Rural Development Project; US$21.0 Hillion
Loan of July 21, 1976; Effective Date:  October 28, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project will provide drainage and flood protection for 30,000 ha
and intensive irrigation for 12,000 ha of padi land; construction of 190 km of
rural roads; 15 small irrigation schemes s-crving 1,300 ha; 25 farmers develop-
ment centers; and an integrated agricultural service system. Implementation
of civil works has fallen about 2-1/2 years behind schedule, due mainly to
staffing shortages, particularly in DID headquarters for design and tendering.
Providing adequate flood protection is the most difficult engineering problem.
Progress in finding a technical and economic solution acceptable to government
bodies and local people has been slow. Total project cost is likely to exceed
the appraisal estimate by about 60%, due mainly to the higher costs of
irrigation works and rural roads, and exchange rate adjustments since 1976.
Progress on extension in the first two districts is good, although intro-
duction of the program to the next two districts is behind schedule due to
staff shortages. A good start lhas been made in the pilot credit program.
Loan No. 1444 National Small-Scale Irrigation Project; US$39.0 Million
Loan of August 3, 1977; Effective Date: October 25, 1977
Closing Date:  March 31, 1983
This project includes construction of small irrigation systems with
a total irrigable area of 54,000 ha distributed throughout Malaysia, technical
assistance and training for DID, procurement of equipment and a feasibility
study for the Rompin/Endau irrigation project. Construction is proceeding
satisfactorily and most schemes should be completed on schedule by the end ot
1982, although sonie work may extend into mid-1983. Of the 195 proposed
schemes to be implemented under the project, 53 schemes have been rejected/
deleted by the PreparatLion and Evaluation Team and 18 new schemes have been
added; the revised number of schemes proposed under the project i-s now 1)0.
Of these, 96 have been approved by the Bank for inclusion in the project
following appraisal by the Preparation and Evaluation Team.  Construction of
nine schemes has been completed and 67 schemes are uwiJer construction as of
December 31, 1979. The Final draft of the feasibility report for the
Rompin-Endau Project was sitbrittted by the consultants to the Government in
December 1979.

US$26.0 Million Loan of March 8, 1978; Effective Date:
June 21, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
The project includes intensification of irrigation networks for
20,000 ha of padi, drainage works for 77,000 ha of tree crops, and facilities,
equipment, and training to support an intensified program of agricultural
services for smallholders. The project started about one year behind schedule
due primarily to staff shortages, but significant progress has been made on
staffing, design and tendering of structural tertiaries, and planning, survey
and design of drainage areas. Progress on the agricultural component is
satisfactory. A draft agricultural services operation manual has been
prepared. Total project cost is estimated at about US$104 million, or about
70% above appraisal estimate, mainly due to cost increases in irrigation and
drainage works.
Loan No. 1632 Krian-Sungei Manik Integrated Agricultural Development Project
US$26.5 Million Loan of December 13, 1978; Effective Date:
March 6. 1979; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The project will provide improved drainage and irrigation facili-
ties, access roads, training and intensified agricultural supporting services
in two separate areas, covering a total of about 30,000 ha of padi land in
the state of Perak. The ongoing civil works contracts are progressing
satisfactorily although overall progress is behind schedule due to initial
staffing and land acquisition problems. Progress in implementing the T&V
system has been hampered by changes in senior staff and the lack of
experience of extension personnel. However, the two pilot extension areas
have made a good start and improvements in yields indicates that the
extension service is beginning to have an impact.
Loan No. 1717 Muda II Irrigation Project; US$31.0 Million Loan of
July 30, 1979: Effective Date: September 4, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The project is the first phase of tertiary irrigation and drainage
development in the Muda irrigation area, whose storage facilities and main
canal system were constructed under a previous Bank-financed project
(Loan 434-MA) during the period 1965-70. The project will provide tertiary
irrigation canals, drainage channels, and farm roads to serve nearly 25,000 ha
of padi land, representing about 25% of the total command area. It also
includes establishment of a highly organized extension system, improvement of
operation and maintenance facilities, drainage and coastal protection works
serving the entire 98,000 ha area, and two studies, one dealing with the
development of groundwater resources and the other to prepare a phased
integrated rural development project. Despite staff shortages, mostly at the
technician level, and the recent cost increases and difficulties in the
delivery of construction and materials, progress in civil works is
satisfactory. Good progress is being achieved on most aspects of the
agricultural development program.

Loan No. 810   Second Education Project; US$15.5 Million Loan of April 5,
1972; Effective Date: July 7, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project provides US$15.5 million to finance: (a) educational
television in Peninsular Malaysia, (b) a national curriculum development
center, (c) a science university and (d) technical and vocational secondary
schools. Over 95% of the construction and equipment procurement has been
completed. Project implementation is about 2-1/2 years behind schedule
because of earlier delays in appointing consultant-architects, completion of
design, delays in obtaining approvals of designs and making contract awards,
slow performance by contractors and understaffing of the implementation unit.
The implementation staff has been strengthened and disbursements are
accelerating.  A final extension of the closing date to December 31, 1980 has
recently made.

1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The Project includes eight general secondary schools, four teacher
training colleges and one polytechnic institute in Peninsular Malaysia and
education mass media in Sabah/Sarawak. Project implementation is delayed
by 2-3 years because of site selection problems, slow design and tendering,
poor perfonmance by contractors and shortages of building materials and labor.
The implementation staff has been expanded and strengthened, and construction
has started at all project locations. Disbursements are expected to remain
slow for the next year because of earlier implementation delays. An extension
of the closing date is anticipated.

Unit No. 4 was commissioned in September 1979. Commissioning of Units No. 5
and No. 6 is now targeted for the end of February and August 1980,
respectively, as originally scheduled. Progress on the Pasir Gudang Thermal
Power Station under the Eighth Power Project was about 30% complete at the
last review, about 5 months behind schedule due tn delays in the delivery of
structural steel columns and boiler parts.

WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE
Loan No. 908 Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date:  August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project consists of the expansion of water supply facilities to
meet increasing demand in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley area. The first
part of the project, comprising ordinary water works, was completed in 1976,
practically on schedule and within the cost estimates and is operational.
The construction of the Langat Dam, the last and major work of the project,
after delays due to land acquisition, is now substantially completed and
impoundment of the reservoir has started. Overall project completion will be
two years behind the appraisal schedule. Cost of the dam is likely to be
about 25% more than originally estimated, resulting in an increase in total
project cost of about 15%. Staffing problems persist within the Selangor
State Water Department, which is responsible for the project. There are
deficiencies in the accounting, billing and collection, and reporting system.
Loan 1213-MA Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project; US$21.5 Million Loan of
March 11, 1976; Effective Date: August 25, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is the first stage (1976-81) of a 30-year master plan
for sewerage development in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area. It includes
the extension of sewage collection (about 70 miles of trunk and lateral
sewers) and treatment facilities to serve an additional population of 200,000
in the Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory; the institution of a separate Sewerage
Department within the Kuala Lumpur City Hall with its own accounting system
and finances; engineering and management consultant services; staff training;
and the preparation of sewerage and pollution control system in the Kuala
Lumpur metropolitan area. The engineering of the project has been satisfac-
torily completed. Construction of two out of the three major contracts
(sewers) is progressing. The bids for the last major contract have been
received. Land acquisition and resettlement of present occupants have created
serious problems but these are now being solved. A separate accounting system
for the Sewerage Department has been set up. Sewerage surcharges on water
bills were instituted after delays.
TRANSPORTATION
Loan No. 931: Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of August 22,
1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973; Closing Date:
March 31, 1980
The project includes: (a) construction and improvement of two
sections of Federal Route I totalling about 90 miles in length; and (b)
consultant services for (i) feasibility studies and detailed engineering of
about 22 miles of Route I and connecting roads in the vicinity of Kuala
Lumpur, (ii) detailed engineering of about 200 miles of roads in West and East
Malaysia, (iii) town development studies for Kuantan and for the region of

North-East Negri Sembilan and an urban road improvement study for Kuala
Lumpur, and (iv) supervision of (a) above.
The project, several months after its scheduled completion date, is
about 92% complete. The new Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Expressway was open to
traffic for about 80% of its length by the end of 1977, and except for a
one-mile section at the northern end, the balance of the Expressway and its
access ramps were opened to traffic by the beginning of June 1979. The
northern extremity, while completed, will be open to traffic only after the
completion of the interchange and access ramps which form part of the Kuala
Lumpur Traffic Dispersal Scheme (Loan No. 1214). The Expressway is operating
fairly well under traffic. However, traffic hazards are being created by
unauthorized use of road and shoulders for roadside stands, cattle driving and
general lack of driver discipline by road users. A serious situation will
result if not corrected. Government is slowly taking action. The improvement
work for the previously existing Kuala Lumpur-Seremban Road has been completed
and the entire length of the road is open to traffic. There have been,
however, long delays in the completion of the widening and improvement works
for the Kuala Lumpur-Batang Kali Road, construction of which began in November
1976; it is now 64% completed. Construction costs have escalated sharply due
to the delays in project execution combined with rapid inflation and the total
project cost is now estimated to be approximately US$53 million compared to an
appraisal estimate of US$37 million, an increase of 43%.
Initial delays in construction were largely due to the Government's
inability to acquire necessary right-of-way on a timely basis and to the
difficulty in relocating squatters. Further delays have been due to the
contractors' very slow progress. Due to the delays and the time still
required to complete the project, it will be necessary to further extend the
closing date of the loan (presently Iarch 31, 1980) to June 30, 1981 to allow
time for final disbursements.
Loan No. 1376: Third Highway Project; US$35.0 Mfillion Loan of April 4,
1977; Effective Date: May 4, 1977; Closing Date: June 30,
1982
The project consists of: (a) reconstruction and improvement of trunk
roads in Sabah; (b) four-year maintenance program for Sabah, including procu-
rement of equipment, upgrading 290 miles of 13 road sections and consultants
services for supervision of construction and technical assistance to Sabah's
PWD; (c) development of pilot road maintenance and pavement strengthening
programs for the states of Johore, Perak and Kelantan in Peninsular Malaysia,
including pavement strengthening of about 120 mi in Johore; and (d) a
transport/railway study for Peninsular Malaysia and an urban study of Kota
Kinabalu.

ANNEX II
Page 12 of 14 pages
The project overall is about 60% completed. Construction work on
the east and west coast roads in Sabah started in September 1977, about five
months behind schedule. Progress is slow at present on all three contracts,
but the situation on one of them is particularly serious. The Government is
now considering terminating his contract and appointing other contractor(s) or
rebidding the contract to complete the work. The Highway Maintenance and Road
Upgrading Program in Sabah is now proceeding satisfactorily with the help of
consultants but the program is more than a year behind schedule. While
satisfactory progress is now being made on the Pavement Strengthening Program
in the three pilot states in Peninsular Malaysia, the reorganization and
upgrading of the State Maintenance Sections and of the Maintenance Unit within
the Federal Public Works Department is far behind schedule, primarily due to
staff shortages. The Project also included an urban study of Kota Kinabalu in
Sabah and a transport/railway study in Peninsular Malaysia. Both of these
studies have been completed. Procurement of the first tranche of maintenance
equipment for the Sabah Highway Maintenance Program has been completed.
Procurement of the second tranche, which represents the balance of the
equipment to be acquired under the project, is underway.
Loan No. 1580: Second Sabah Ports Project; US$13.0 Million Loan of
September 20, 1978; Effective Date: November 10, 1978;
Closing Date: September 30, 1982
The project aims at:  (a) providing Tawau Port with the capacity to
meet forecasted traffic; (b) providing the ports of Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan
and Tawau with cargo handling equipment to meet future traffic growth and to
replace worn-out items; and (c) improving the performance of the Sabah Ports
Authority by providing technical assistance and staff training. Tenders for
the civil works have been evaluated and an award made to the lowest evaluated
tender. Traffic and financial results for 1978 were generally better than
forecast. Management consultants commenced work in August 1979.

The objective of the project is to: (a) strengthen administration
of the family planning program; (b) extend family planning services to rural
areas; (c) expedite in-service training of medical and paramedical personnel
in family planning; (d) introduce population education in schools; (e)
improve family planning, nutrition and lhealth education programs for the rural

The National Family Planning Board (NFPB), by activating the
national and state level committees and subcommittees, has recently gained
greater managerial control over the project implementation. Wdith the creation
of the Project Construction Coordination Unit (PCCU), the Government has
succeeded in halting the slow progress in the civil works. To date, 406
buildings out of a total of 571 have been completed and a further 129 are
under construction. According to the revised schedule, construction of some
facilities will be completed only by mid-1981. Due to this delay, the closing
date has been extended to December 31, 1981. Annual contraceptive acceptors
rose from about 75,000 in 1976 to ojer 85,000 in 1978; more than 35,000 of
these acceptors were reported to have been recruited through the integrated
rural health facilities supported through the project. The percentage of
women in childbearing age using contraception increased from 16% in 1970 to
over 39% in 1978.
Loan No. 1608  Second Population and Family Health Project; US$17.0 Million
Loan of July 17. 1978; Effective Date: December 15, 1978;
Closing Date; December 31, 1983
The project is designed to strengthen further the national family
planning program in order to achieve the demographic goal of reducing the
birth rate from 30.3 per 1,000 in 1975 to 26 in 1985, with a corresponding
reduction in the population growth rate from 2.4% to 2% in Peninsular
Mlalaysia, and to extend family planning services to Sabah and Sarawak for the
improvement of maternal and child health.
In less than a year's time since the project effectiveness, project
management capacity has been considerably strengthened by providing required
administrative support to each of the participating agencies. National pro-
gram performance, in terms of the number of new acceptors, reached an all
time high of over 50,000 during the first six months of 1979 compared to about
42,000 over the same period in 1978. Project components related to health in
Sarawak and those under the Ministry of Agriculture in the whole of
Malaysia are progressing well. Of the 202 buildings under the project, sites
for 128 have been acquired, of which 15 are either under construction or have
been tendered. The Government has taken action to locate and acquire sites
for the remaining 74 buildings.  NFPB will review NFSC building plans in terms
of its special functional requirements and seek Bank's comments prior to its
finalization. Considerable progress has been made in establishing specialized
services, training and research under the National Family Planning Center.
During July through September 1979, 529 clients attended this center for
various specialized services.

URBAN
Loan No. 1214  Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project; US$26.0 Million
Loan of March 11, 1976; Effective Date: November 11, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The main objective of the project is to increase the efficiency of
the transport system in Kuala Lumpur.  Public transport services will be
improved while the use of private cars will be restrained. Although primarily
concerned with urban transport, the project also introduces new approaches to
residential development for low-income families. The main components are:
(a) road and intersection improvements, traffic engineering and control
schemes and construction of new radial roads; (b) transport policy measures
including introduction of minibus services, traffic priorities for high-
occupancy vehicles and area road pricing; (c) provision of new serviced plots
for households and businesses, and improvement of infrastructure services for
existing households; and (d) technical assistance to support traffic manage-
ment and transport planning, to prepare an urban development project for
Kuantan, and to review national housing policies and programs. Overall
progress of the physical components on the transport side has been quite
satisfactory. Initial delays, however, will not be overcome and the estimated
project completion date has been moved back 25 months. Execution of the
residential components has been less satisfactory due to administrative and
policy problems which are in the process of being resolved. There is also
concern about delays in implementing the various policy measures included in
the project. Discussions with the Government are currently in progress to
ensure their implementation.
