SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 1397-PAN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.        This Is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Second Livestock
Development Project (Loan 1397-PAN). The total loan amount was US$8.0 mil-
lion. as approved by the Board on April 5, 1977. The Loan and Guarantee
Agreements are dated April 28, 1977. Total loan disbursement was US$7.5 mil-
lion; US$0.5 million was cancelled.  The final disbursement of the loan took
place on March 12, 1986.
2.        The PCR was prepared by Agriculture Division A of the Latín America
and the Caribbean Regional Office. An FAO consultant, who visited Panama in
October 1986, completed the project economic analysis and financial analyses
of the three farm models under the project. The PCR i8 based on the Staff
Appraísal Report (No. 1378a-PAN) dated March 14, 1977, the President's Report
(No. P-1984-PAN) of March 16, 1977, the Loan Agreement and supervision
reports. The minutes of the Board presentation, correspondence with the
borrower and internal Bank memoranda on project implementation were also
reviewed. The Borrower, with the help of consultants, prepared a draft
completion report, which provided statistical and financial data on invest-
mento and the impact of the project. In particular, the draft completion
report provided financial, technical and production data based on a sample
survey of subloan beneficiaríes; these drta were used to construct three farm
models, which were the basis for the financial and economic analyses.
3.        A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on July 23,
1987 for comments. The Government acknowledged receipt of the report and had
no comments.
4.        This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.        The Second Livestock Development Project was designed to continue
providing credit for livestock (beef and mdlk) production begun under
Loan 901-PAN. The emphasia of the second project was on m.lk rather than
beef production in an effort to reduce milk importa. The project was to
provide credit for: (a) dual-purpose (beef/dairy) farms (220 individual
farms and 20 farmer groups); (b) 135 dairy farms; aztd (C) a government-owned
breeding station, PRODEIRHA, that was to serve as a training center for
farmera. The PRODEIRHA component was replaced during implementation by a
dairy program involving support for fíve state-owned dairy farmas, an
artificial insemination centre and technical assistance. To complement the
provislon of credit and technical assistance, the project sought changes in
legialation governing milk juality and pricing in order to offer an incentive
for increased production of consumer quality mílk. Prior to the project,
only 'Grade A' milk could be sold to the public; all other ilk was graded
'industrial', for which producera received a much lower price. However, the
better quality 'industrial' ml1k was suitable for public consumptíon and was,
in fact, beíng sold to consumers in an ill g-l Grade A/'lindustrial' milk
blend. The project therefore sought to establish a third grade of milk
('Grade B), which could legally be sold to consumers and would have a higher
producer price than 'industrial' mílk. The project vas also to provide
technical assistance, equipment and vehicles to atrengthen the technical unit
of the Banco Nacional de Panama (BNP), which was to implement the eredit
component. The Ministry of Agriculture (MIDA) was to implement the dairy
progra..
2.        The project cost was estimated at US$20 million, of ihich the Bank
vas to finance the foreígn exchange component of US$8 million (40% of the
total project cost). The balance was to be provided by BNP (US$8 million),
the Government (US$1 million) and subberrowers (US$3 million). The actual
amount disbursed was US$7.5 million. I. was disbursed over eight years
compared to the five estimated at appraisal, because of continued availabil-
lty of credit funds under Loan 901-PAN until the end of 1979, and a slowdown
in on-farm investment following droughts in 1983 and 1984.
3.        The credit component of the project as implemented varies in three
main ways from the SAR proposal. Fírat, some credit (30% of funda) was used
for breeding/fattening farms, which were not included in the project descrip-
tion. The Bank allowed such lending because delays in implementing the
Crade B milk scheme resulted in leas demand for credit for dairy farms,
while--due to improved meat market prospecte--demand for beef credit was
high. Nonetheless, 70% of credit did support dairying on dual-purpose farme
(62% of credit) and dairy farms (8%) (para. 4.14). Second, the bulk of
credit went to larger farme (about 80% to farma of more than 100 ha), instead
of the anticipated average farm size of 50 ha. This is partly explained by
the fact that breeding/fattening farms were, on average, 3-5 times larger
than the other farma receiving credit under the project (para. 4.17).
Finally, improved etrains of daíry cattle were not imported as envisaged
under the SAR, mainly because farmers found sufficient cattle of satisfactory
qualíty available from local breeding farms.
4.        Despite the above deviations from the SAR proposal, the project
(excluding the dairy program on state-owned farms) achieved an 11% economic
rate of return, which i8 lower than the 20% estímated in the SAR but still

satisfactory.  Although .1lk productioa was lower thaz auticipated, ltcreme.-
tal meat productlou was double the SAR essimate due to the inclusion of
letditg to breed1ig/fatteuing faras.  Increseutal  ilk productton was leas
than one-fifth the SAR estimate, aally because delays tu aiplezeuting
Grade B 1l1k legislation constralued demaud for m.Lk productíon credlt.
Hovever, implementation of changes ií milk gradíug sad priz-cig legislatto.,
whtch atarted íi 1984, iB aow well underway aud provides the basts for
increased productlon of Grade B .1lk ia the future. On-fara investmeuate
improved incomes it  the three types of farma recetvirg credit, but by lover
rates than auticípated. Fínaucial rates of returu for the three models
rauged from 6% for breedtng/fatteuíng farma to 10% for dual-purpose aud 11%
for dairy faras (para. 5.07).
5.        The daíry program for atate-owned farms aud the Govermeint's
artifícial tusemíuatiou ceater was slow to be ímplemeuted aud suffered from
weak mauagemeut of MIDA's implemeuCttg uuit aud of the five atate farmas that
were to be aasslted.  MlIk production fell short of productiou tergeta, the
quality of milk produced declined, aud the farmas fatled to develop es a
source of improved straíns of breeding aLmalas.  Iusufficient data t ere
available to complete ecouomic analyses of these farms.  The farms slso
fatled to fulfill theír role as demonstration model,, because their equip-
ient, methods sud stock were inappropriate for demonstration to the dual-
purpose farmerz  uearby (para. 5.06).  The proposed artificial insemiiattou
center mas uot established because of techuical aud admiusttrative
difftculties (para. 4.20).
6.        The implemeLting uult of BNP continued to improve ita performauce
under this second project, partly as a result of trzalung sud expert services
províded. The unit has also established a mouitoriug and evaluatdo. unit aud
has computerized the credit data collected during implementation sud froa the
survey of fazms (para. 6.01).
7.        The following lessons can be learut froa the project and should be
reflected tu the preparation aud implementatiou of future projecta:
(a)  The project illustrates the need for a flexible approach duríng
implemetatdioa. Because of difficulties Iu revising milk legisla-
tiou, credit demand from dairy farms was low.  At the same time,
demaud for beef production credit was hígh. Faced with this
reality, the Bank alloved BNP to provide credit for breeding/fat-
tening farms to ensure that lending coutcnued. Although the
project as implemeuted varied somewhat froa ita desigu, the returu
on the tuvestameut was satisfactory, as evídeAced by the ecoomie
rate of retura of 11% (para. 8.01).
(b)  The overall succes8 of investmeuts on prívate farms uuder the
credit component and the failure of tha goverzment dairy program
suggest that future lending of this type ehould cacentrate on
private farms (para. 8.02).
(c) The emaller than auticipated improvementa in techuical coeffí-
cíeuta suggest that the appraisal team was over-optimlstie about
the viability of upgrading the local herd.  This iudicetes the meed
to seses more realistically what techiícal improvemeate are destr-
able snd achievable through such a credit project (para. 8.03).

PANAMA
SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 1397-PAN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
l. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Agriculture í8 lesa important in the economy of Panama than in most
other Latín American countries. In 1975, it accounted for only 16% of real
GDP and had been growing more slowly (just over 4% p.a.) than GDP (almost 7%
p.a.) since the early 1950s. The agricultural sector was, however, able to
supply most food products to feed the country's population. Importa of
agricultural products in 1975 totalled US$73 million (just over 8% of total
imports). The sector was also the source of the bulk of merchandise exporta:
about US$104 million, or almost 77% tn 1973, but decliníng to around 50% in
1974/75. Includlng agricultural inputa would eliminate the apparent surplus
on the agricultural trade balance.
1.02      Within agriculture, the crop subsector was predominant, accounting
for 81% of production value tn 1975, while lívestock accounted for 16%, and
forestry and fisberies for 3%. In the same year, three export cropa
--bananas, sugar and coffee-accounted for 82% of agricultural trade,
fisheries products for 16%, and livestock products for only 2%.
1.03      Within the livestock subsector, cattle (milk and beef) accounted
for about 46% of total production ín 1975, with poultry and pig8 accounting
for the balance. In the 19609, the number of cattle had been expanding at
over 5% p.a., but growth dropped to leas than 2% tn 1973/174. This trend
resulted tn falling production of beef and milk and inereasing importa (ti
1974, ímports of milk and milk products were valued at US$10.6 million).
Although the country had the capacity to produce milk competitively, the
cattle industry was overwhelmtngly oriented towards beef production: the
bulk of cattle farms (over 851) were for beef cattle, 15% were dual-purpose
(beef/diiry) farms, and less than 1% were dairy farms.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01      By April 1977, when the Second Livestock Project was presented to
the Board, tha Bank had made and dlsbursed two agricultural loans totalling
US$1 million for farm machinery and grain silos (both projects approved in
1953). In addítion, credit projects for livestock (US$4.7 million) aud
fisheries (US$3.4 míllion) approved ín 1973 were ongoing.
2.02      The Government requested the Bank to help finance the continuation
of ita lívestock development program, whích had been supported through the
first Livestock Development Project (Loan 901-PAN). Thie second project was
to help the Government meet its objectives of diversifyíng production and
exports and generating foreign exchange through import substitution, by
increasing milk productíon. It would be implemented by the Technical Unit
(TU) of the Banco Naclonal de ranama (BNP) established under Loan 901-PAN. A
second fisheries credít project was presented to the Board with the livestock
credit project.



III. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. ,reparatíon and Appralsal
3.01      The proposal for a follow-on project to Loan 901-PAN was made by
BNP tu August 1975 when it appeared that funds from that loan would be
exhausted within a Y-ir.  The feasibility study vas prepared by BNP and the
Government wíth 3ank asaistance. Two íssues highlighted during preparation
and appraisal--interest rates and milk priícng policy--are discussed below.
B. Negotiatione and Board Presentation
3.02      Negotiationa took place in Wachington in February 1977, and the
project was presented to the Board on Aliril 5, 1977. The only question
raised hy tihe Board concerned use of "international competitive shopping" for
breedíng cattle to be purchased under the project. Staff clarifíed tha, this
procedure, whereby several bids would be sought in suítable exporting
countries, was appropriate because of the limited market for cattle meeting
Panama's health requirements and wlth tolerance of its troplcal environment.
C. Objectives and Description
3.03      The primary objective of the project was to increase the domestic
supply of milk aud reduce the country's depecdence on impotted milk.  The
project was also to support the Government'e rural development program, by
benefitting government-sponsored settlements and a government-owned experi-
mental breeding farm, PRODEIRHA (Integrated Development Program of Rio Hato),
which would also be used as a trainíng center for farmers.
3.04      The project sought to achieve its objectives through improvement of
grassland production, better husbandry, and the upgrading or replacement of
poor quality cattle. It was to consist of:
(a) long-term financing of on-farm investment by about 355 small and
medium-sized producers and about 20 farmer groups 1/ dedicated
prímarily to milk pr3duction;
(b) long-term financing of on-farm investments in the livestock
operation of PRODEIRHA; and
(c) provision of: (í) consulting services and other support for BNP's
Technical Unit (TU); and (íí) consultant services to assist in the
expansion and diversification of tlie meat processing industry.
The provision of credit and technical aseistance for milk production was to
be complemented by changes in legislation on milk quality and pricing (see
paras. 4.03-05).
Do  Poect Cost and Financing
3.05      The total project cost was estimated at US$20 million, including
contíngencies of US$3.4 million.  The Bank loan of US$8 million (40% of the
1/   Asentamientos or cooperatives established under the agrarian reform
program or other organized farmers groups.

total cost) was to finance the foreígn exchange component (Annex 1). The
local cost component was to be financed as follows: BNP - US$8 milllon (or
40% of the total) for on-farm investments and for strengthening íts TU; the
Government - US$1 million (5%), In the form of an equity contribution to
PRODEIREA; and subborrowers - US$3e0 million (15%), tn the form of cash,
contract labor or materiala, as their contríbution to on-farm investmentae
IV. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Key Evento
4.01      Loan signing took place on April 28, 1977e  The only
project-specific condition of effectiveness was the satisfactory revision and
enactment of the laws and regulations relatíng to milk quality, on-farm
buítldng standards and mílk pricing policies. Failure t., meet this condition
caused three extensions of the date of effectiveness (originally expected by
July 29, 1977' and a delay of about six months. The loan was declared
effective on February 1, 1978. During implementation, the Loan Agreement was
amended twice, as discussed below.
4.02      The appraisal report anticipated a five-year disbursement period,
with the Closing Date set for August 31, 1982. Because of the slow start to
the project--due to delays in effectiveness and the availability of funda
under the previous loan (funds under Loan 901-PAN were not fully committed
until the end of December 1979)--dlsbursements were slower than anticipated.
The Closing Date was extended twice: to August 31, 1984, then to August 30,
1985, the actual Closing Date. The date of the final disbursement was
March 12, 1986. On March 26, 1986, about US$0.5 million of the loan (6% of
the total loan amount) was cancelled.
B. Iasues Durkng implementation
Milk Standards and Pricíng Policy
4.03      At the time of appraisal, Panama's legislation established that
only Grade A milk could be sold to the public; all other milk was graded as
"industrial". It also established minimum requiremento for production
facíiíties for Grade A milk. These requirements were so high that the
investment and operating costo were a disincentive to expansion of milk
production, and at the time of appraisal, only 10% of dairies were qualified
as producers of Grade A mílk. Much of the industrial grade milk was of a
high enough quality that it could have been sold to consumers as Grade B
milk; in fact, the processing plants sold consumers an illegal 50/50 blend of
Grade A and industrial milk at the Grade A milk price, giving them high
profíts at the producers' expense. Although producer prices for milk had
been raised several times, producers' real incomes had fallen and were
insufficíent to cover increased costs.
4.04      In order to achieve the project's objective of increased milk
production, a qualíty payment scheme was needed to complement the provision
of funding and technical assistance. A study completed in 1976 by USAID
provided the basis for a multiple mílk grading system, to add at least a
second quality (Grade B) that could be sold to the publíc. The Bank
therefore made enactment of revised legislation relating to milk quality,
buílding standarda and pricing polictes a condition of effectiveness.



4.05      Legislation on milk quality and pricing (Law 60) was passed in 1978
and included a clause that regulations implementing the Law were to be íasued
withín 10 months. On this basis the loan was declared effective. However,
the Government was extremely elow in implementing the provisions of the
legislation, due to uncertainties about their economic impact (consultants
were hired to study this in mid-1981) and to the time and budget required to
complete the necessary survey of dairy farms. Implementation of Law 60 was
finally achieved in December 1983, when it was made a condition of
negotiations for the Third Livestock Project. Although implementation of the
milk grading program began slowly, 144 farma had been classified as producera
of Grade B milk and 303 were preclassified by early 1986; the target of 400
Grade B farms seems likely to be reached ín 1987.
Interest Rate
4.06      The interest rate to subborrowers was set at 11% p.a. (compared
with 10% under Loan 901-PAN), which it was believed would be positive
(ínflation in Panama was about 12% in 1975 but was falling). In addition, a
small fee would be charged for technical services.  Although private
commercial banks were not excluded from the project, it was acknowledged that
they were unlikely to participate, given their preference for short-term
lending to larger farmers, the unattractive spread (with subsidiary loans at
9% and a lending rate to subborrowers of 11%), and the difficulty of
providing technical staff for subloan analysis and supervision.
4.07      The interest rate became an issue in 1981 when the National Banking
Commission passed a resolution that interest on agricultural credit be no
higher than 9%. 2¡ This resolution Was to apply to all outstanding balances
of subloans signeid after October 1980. The banks affected would receive an
amount equívalent to 3% of such balances to cover their administrative and
overhead costs. Although application of the resolution would technically put
BNP ín violation of the Loan Agreement, the Bank decided against taking any
action as long as the interest rate remained positive (inflation was then
5-6%) and BNP was able to recover its operating costs. The interest rate
under the Third Livestock Project (Loan 2356-PAN) is 9%.
Changes in Project Descríption
4.08      PRODEIRHA Component.  Despite some progress in establishing the
legal entity to implement this component, little headway was made ín drawing
up PRODEIRRA statutes and procedures. In January 1979, the Bank was informed
that the land previously made avaílable to PRODEIRHA was now to be used for
military purposes. The following year, the Bank agreed that the PRODEIRHA
funds could be used to develop five state dairy farms and an artificial
insemination centre on substantially the same terms as those originally
established for PRODEIRHA. This component would be executed by the Minístry
of Agriculture (MIDA). Related technical assistance comprised training of
staff assigned to the program in dairy technology and consultant services on
administration of dairy enterpríses.
2/   Agricultural interest rates had previously been subsidized, at 8%, under
legislation passed in November 1974 but repealed by September 1976.



4.09      Meat Processing Consultant.  The consultant was to be recruited by
February 28, 1978, but after many delays, it was apparent that the Government
attached low priority to this activity.  In August 1981, the Government
requested that the funds be used instead for a study of the impact of milk
pricing policy (para. 4.05).  Since the meat processing consultant was to
identify areas for possible future Bank support and would not affect the
outcome of this project, the Bank agreed to the change.
Activities Eligible for Credit
4.10      A question arose during implementation concerning the exclusion of
lending for beef cattle operations from the project. This type of activity
had been supported under Loan 901-PAN, both to meet growíng internal demand
for beef and to earn additional foreign exchange through exporte. During
implementation, however, as a result of increasingly favorable milklbeef
prices, subloans under Loan 901-PAN tended to swing away from beef to
dairying. The Second Livestock Project focused on milk production, with
support for beef production through dual-purpose operatlons. In May 1979,
however, because of pressure from producers who were responding to meat
shortages and an increase in meat export quotas to the US, the Covernment
requested that beef producers be eligible for credit under the project.
4.11      The Bank informed the Governnent that the category "dal purpose'
allowed sufficient flexibility for inclusion of faras giving emphasis to beef
breeding/fattening, and that it was unwilling to amend the Loan Agreement
without an analysis of meat market prospects and projections on milk supply
and imports. By keeping the project's emphasis on milk, the Bank believed it
would retain leverage to expedite implementation of Law 60.
4.12      During supervision, the Bank was aware that breeding/fattening
farme were receiving project funde. It was felt, however, that some latitude
was called for because this activity would contribute to improvemente in the
quality and size of the national herd, and demand for such credit was high.
In addition, staff believed that implementation of Law 60 would, by itself,
effect a shift to lending for dual-purpose and dairy farma.
C. Project Componente
Credit
4.13      The project provided a total of 438 subloans to individual farmere,
23% more than the 355 individual subloans anticipated at appraisal. However,
the project did not provide any subloans to asentamientos (the SAR estimate
was for 20 subloana to asentamientos). The main reason for the shortfall was
the availability of funds to farmer groupe on better terma from the Banco de
Desarrollo Agropecuario (BDA) using IDB and USAID lines of credit (interest
of 9% versus 11% from BiNP). Another reason was the Government's decision
after 1980 to limit borrowing by farmer groups because many had proven to be
ineffícient.
4.14      Lending for dual-purpose farms accounted for the bulk (62%) of
credit funde and was one third more than the SAR estímate. Support for dairy
farme, on the other hand, accounted for only 8% of total credit, or 17% of
the estimated amount. Subloans for breeding/fattening farme, which were not
included in the SAR, accounted for 30% of credit fundo.

la  Other credit to project farms during the implementation period totalled
US$7.3 million.
4.15      The small number of subloans for dairy farms and the higher than
estimated subloan size are probably attributable to the protracted delay in
enacting Law 60. The SAR had anticipated that the costa of investmento in
dairy farms would go down as críteria for milk grading were switched froz the
standard of facílities to milk quality, and that demand for credit would go
up as producer prices were inereased. However, it was not until late 1983,
tovards the end of th¢ project, that Law 60 was implemented (para. 4.05).
The pattern of lending does, nonetheless, show a significant emphasís on
dairying--with 70% of credit lent to dairy farma and dual-purpose farms
(para. 4.14)-especlally in view of the actual distribution of dífferent
types of farms in Panama (para. 1.03).
4.16      Project lending did not support saall- aud mediuiasized producers
(average farm size of 50 ha) to the extent anticipated (Annex 2).  Farms of
up to 50 ha received about 10% of all subloans (only 5% of total credit),
while more than half of all credit went to farme of over 200 ha. Similarly,
the value of subloane índicates that 277 subloane of under US$30,000 (about
the overall subloan average) accounted for only 34% of credit funds, while
68 subloane of US$50,000 or more accounted for over 40%.
4.17      The Bank did make efforts duríng supervision and by letter to urge
BNP to approve subloans more in line with the Bank'o objectlve of supporting
8mall and medium-sized farmere who would otherwise not have acceso to credit
or technical assistance. At the same time, the Bank continued to approve
large subloans of over US$100,000 based on thelr technical and financial
viability, and their contribution to inereasing milk production. The pattern
of lending by farm size ¡s partly attributable to the unanticipated lending
to breeding/fattening faras, which tend to be larger than both dual-purpose
farms (about 44% of which are under 50 ha) and dalry farmes (which average
50-100 ha). Breedinglfatteníng faras under the project were, on average, at
least thres times larger than the dual-purpose farma snd almost five times
larger than the dalry farmas (Annex 2).



- 7 -
4.13      On-farm investments were reasonably close to the appraisal esti-
mates, except for the high levels of investment ln pasture and fencing.
Additional expenditure on these items was justified by the limited availabll-
ity aud poor quality of pasture, especially during the dry season, and the
existence of wooded areas that could easily be converted to pasture. The
investment In livestock was about half of the total subloan amount, i.e.
below the 55% maximum of subloan funda to be used for this purpose. These
fundo allowed the purchase of over 14,230 head of cattle, about 13% more than
the 12,590 estimated at apprals.1 (Annex 2).
Daíry Program 31
4.19      Financing vas provided for five state-owned dairy farms to inerease
the numbera of purebred and crossbred aníials with good dairy characteri-
tice, which would both lmprove the qualíty of the national dairy herd and
lead to inereased production of milk and beef. Investments were slow after
this component became operational ln August 1980, but finally reached over
90% of planned levele as a result of high investments in buildings and,
particularly, machinery and equipment (Annex 3). Expenditures for cattle
purchases, on the other hand, were only 30% of planaed investment.
4.20      The artificial Insemination centre, to be located at one of the
dairy farms (Divisa), was to collect semen with excellent genetic character-
¡stice and provide services (such as ínsemination and gynecological exams)
for private farmers. The center was not established because of technical and
administrative difficulties. Insemination services were aleo to be provided
through small poste to be located ln 9 farme. Services have been provided by
8 technicians to 45 faras; this compares with the programed 14 technicians
who were to provide services to 120 farms in the first year.
4.21      Training for staff of the five farme involved courses and seminara
in farm management, insemination and milk production. There was some tech-
nology transfer to ovar 40 technicianas in other parts of the country through
training (mainly ín insemination techniques) given at Divisa. Some of the
farms also organized field days to demonstrate practices in, for example,
pasture management, and animal health and hygiene.
Technical Aseístance and Related Inputs for BNP
4.22      A total of 72 man-months of consultant services were provided under
the project (Annex 4), 69 man-months by expatriates and 3 man-months by local
consultanta. This iS 20% higher than the 60 man-months estimated at
appraisal. Consultants were hired towards the end of the project after local
staff had completed trainiag abroad, thus failíng to comply with the hirlng
date of February 28, 1978. In line with the Loan Agreement, consultanta were
hired in animal fertility, soil conservation and use of tropical pasture.
The reconmendatione on fertility management are beíng implemented and should
improve reproduction ratea over the long term. The soil conservation

consultant helped carry out a study to identify soil management problems and
recommend solutions, some of whích (e.g. that on reforestation) have been
Included in the follow-on project. The study to be completed by the consul-
tant on use of tropical pasture in milk production was not completed due to
technical problema in establishing the species (Leucaena Leucoce9hala);
further research may be carried out by the Institute for Agricultural
Research or the University of Panama. Other consultants facilitated imple-
mentation of Law 60, helped implement atudies of dual purpose farms, and
assisted BNP in establishing a computer program for monitoríng and
evaluation.
4.23      Staff of BNP's TU completed a total of almost 23 man-months of
training abroad (Annex 4). In addition to formal technical training, staff
received on-the-job training working with the consultants and the agricul-
tural economist attended a Bank-sponsored course in project monitoríng and
evaluationo BNP's staffing differed sllghtly from the Loan Agreement
requirements in that technicians increased to 19 (rather than 20) and,
because of the small part played by credít to daíry farms, the dairy
specíalíst position was not retained. The other main items provided were
vehicles (a total of 20).
D. Changes in Project Cost and Financing
4.24      Actual financing was close to the planned amounts for both the Bank
and BNP. The Government contributed US$1.9 million, including MIDA's budget
contrib'ition for administration expenditures (Annex 3), which was not in the
project at appraisal. The subborrowers' contributions to on-farm investment
were estimated by BNP at US$3.3 million equivalent, provided in the form of
labor (80%), materials (10%) and ínputs (10%).
Bank    BNP    Govt./MIDA    Subborrowers   Total
Credit                  6.2     7.1        -             3.3          16.6

Total          7.5      8.9      1.9             3.3          21.6
a/   Several supervision missions noted the Government's intention of
cancelling US$0.5 million of its contribution to the dairy program when
the Bank loan was about to close. Rowever, data from BNP índícate full
disbursement of the Government's contribution by 1984.
E. Procurement
4.25      Small items of machinery and equipment, as well as materials (such
as seed and fertilizer), for on-farm investments were available locally.
Sufficient cattle meeting the required standarda of health, fertility and
adaptabililty to a tropical environment were available from local breeding
farmas. The above itema and cattle were procured using procedures acceptable
to the Bank.



- 9 -
F. Disbursemente
4.26      Disbursements took longer than expected (see Basic Data Sheet), due
malnly to the slow start to the credit component (para. 4.02); reduced
on-farm investment following droughts in 1983 and 1984 further extended the
disbursement period. Funde for the dairy program and the consultanto were
also disbursed much later than planned.
G. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.27      A inonitoring system, based on a sample of 14 subborrowers, was
established under Loan 901-PAN, meeting the Loan 1357-PAN covenant that such
a system be established by February 28, 1978. Under Loan 1397-PAN, the
number and range of farme covered was increased to 25% of subborrowers. The
data were analyzed periodically. However, it was not until the end of the
project that a computer program was developed and the data systematically
analyzed. The consultant who assisted in setting up the computer program was
financed partly from Loan 1397-PAN (25%) and partly fron Loan 2356-PAN (75%).
4.28      The evaluation of the project was based on both the physical and
financial data collected during implementation and a survey, carried out by
BNP ín 1985, of 100 faras (or 23% of farms aseisted under the project). A
draft completion report evaluating the ímpact of the project was prepared by
a consultant aud counterpart staff of BNP,
H. Non-compliance with Covenants
4.29      BNP eventually complied with most covenants.  It was slow to hire
consultants and audit reports were usually received late. There was slight
deviation from BNP staffing requirements specified in the Loan Agreement
(para. 4.23). The Government only implemented the revised legislation on
milk qualíty and prices towards the end of the project.
V. PROJECT IMPACT
A. Agricultural Impact
5.01      At the national level, the herd grew from 1.3 million head in 1975
to almost 1.5 million head in 1984, an increase of 15%. The dairy herd has
grown almost twice as fast, from 75,000 to 96,000 head, an increase of 28%
over the same period.  Domestic milk production remained at around 90 millíon
litres in 1978-82 but, after a decline in 1983, is now projected to reach
over 100 millíon litres in 1985 and 1986. Production of beef inereased from
about 38,000 tons in 1978-80 to over 50,000 tone in 1984/85.  Because of the
small size of the project, it has made only a modest contribution to this
growth.
5.02     The impact of on-farm investment (i.e. including credit from all
sources) has been asseseed at the farm level by using data from BNP's survey
of 100 farms to develop typical farm modele for comparison with SAR estimates
(para. 5.03), and to quantify incremental output and employment by aggrega-
ting the model data (para. 5.04). BNP was unable to get much data for an
aseessment of the impact of the dairy program (para. 5.05).



- 10 -
5.03     In almost al! ('ases, actual production parameters are well below
those envisaged at appraisal (Annex 5, Table 1). Most farms receiving credit
were larger than the 50 ha models in the SAR, and as a result, the average
number of cattle per farm was higher than the SAR estimates. However, a
comparison can be made of carrying capacities, which ímproved only slightly
and reached levels of le8s than half the SAR estimates. Improvements in
calving rates were much lower than anticipated as was milk production on
dual-purpose farms. Actual increases in income were lower than the SAR
estimates--at 130% for the dual purpose model (compared to the SAR estimate
of 650%), 210% for the breeding/fattening model, and 28% for the dairy model
(compared to the SAR estimate of 230%). These shortfalls were due to the
lower-than-expected production capacity (partly the result of the herd not
being upgraded as antíicpated in the SAR) and the sizable drop in real prices
of the main products, beef and milk.
5,04      The impact of on-farm investments differs substantially from
appraisal estimates, as shown below by aggregate figures on ineremental
production of beef and milk (tonlyr):
SAR Estimate          Actual           % Change
Reef (carcass)          900               1,830               103
Miik                 28,800               4,980               -83
Beef production ís higher than estimated because support for breeding/fat-
tening farms was not foreseen in the SAR.  On the other hand, the consider-
able shortfall in milk production vis-a-vis the SAR estimate 1s the result of
the lower than expected stocking and calving rates. Permanent employment
increased by a total of about 390 m-n-equivalent per year; in addition,
employment was generated on-farm during the investment phase, as well as ín
input supply, and output marketing, processing and distribution.
5.05      The data available on the dairy program indicate that the impact of
investments on milk production have been minimal in most cases and mixed.
Milk production fell short of the targets at most of the farms, and only two
achieved the daíly target of milk production per cow (Annex 3). Moreover,
milk quality has declined: before the project, all the farms except Toabre
were producing Grade A milk, but all now produce lower grade milk. The sale
of breeding animals fell far short of the target.
5.06      The farms also falled to fulfill their expected role as demonstra-
tion farms. This was due partly to weak management and continuing poor
productlon practices at the farms.  Moreover, the state-owned farma were
dairy farma and tended to have infrastructure too elaborate aud produce
cattle of too high a quality for their production practices to be relevant
for the dual-purpose producers located nearby. It is not known to what
extent the farms purchased cattle to establish or expand dual-purpose herds.
B. Financial and Economic Returns
5.07      Financial rates of return for the dual purpose, breeding/fattening
and dairy farm models have been estimated at 10.1%, 6.3%, and 11.3%, respect-
ively (Annex 5, Table 6). These ratea compare with SAR estimates of 14% and
18.5% for the dual purpose and dairy farm models, respectively. The economic
return for the project (excluding the dairy program component, for which data



- 11 -
on benefits and operatíng costa were not available) ls estimated at 11.1%,
compared to the 19.6% expected at appraisal; asaumptions for the analysií are
noted in Annex 5. The principal reasons for the lower FRRs and economie
return are the Inclusion of the less financíally attractive breeding/fat-
tening farms, the lower than expected increases ín on-farm productivity, and
the drop in real prices for beef and meat during ímplementation.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A. Implementing Agencies
6.01      BNP's TU has continued to improve íts performance under thís second
project.  This was partly the result of the technical assistance provided
under the project (paras. 4.22-23). Organizational improvements under the
project include the selectíon of two regional managers and the establishment
of a monitoring and evaiuation unit. The computerization of project data now
allows efficíent and timely monitoring of progress and identification of
problem areas, and the TU should also be able to complete project evaluation
in the future. The livestock portfolío has increased almost sevenfold
between 1979 and 1985, and the TU is able to cover its operating costs frou
its investment margin. Arrears on principal are only 3% of the total port-
folio. In implementing the project, the TU has demonstrated the capability
of managing all aspects of loar, administration.
6.02      The MIDA implementation unit for the dairy program, on the other
hand, was slow to be established and seems to have been fairly ineffective.
Both the implementation unit and the management of individual state farme
suffered from frequent staff changes. Moreover, the specialized milk produc-
tion at these farms meant that they were not well suited for their role as
demonstration farma, since the private farms they were to assist tend to be
dual purpose and leas capital intensive.
B. Consultants
6.03      The long-term impact of the consultant's work is difficult to
assess, mainly because they were hired towards the end of implementation.
Delays occurred because BNP believed that working with the foreign experts
would be more useful to its staff after they had completed specialized
training abroad. BNP technicians appear to be well qualified for the tasks
they carry out and effective in províding technical assistance to farmers.
C. Auditing and Reporting
6.04      Persistent efforts by Bank staff resulted in improvements in the
coverage of BNP audit reports. In particular, starting in 1981, sn analysis
of the subloan portfolio was included. Audit reports were usually submitted
late; however, this was due to delays in completíng the audit of accounts
submitted by BNP to the government auditor. Similarly, improvements were
made ín the usefulness of progrese reporte by including credit data es well
as physical data, aud adding commentary to analyze trends and note potential
problem areas.

VII* BANK PERFORMANCE
7.01      During implementation, the Bank's performance was satisfactory.
The Bank took a flexible approach to the types of subloana granted for on-
farm investment, which was to some extent necessary because it underestimated
the difficulties involved in revising the legislation relating to milk
quality and prícing. The delays in implementing Law 60 contributed to lower
than anticipated credit demand for dairying, while credit demand for invest-
ment in beef cattle was high.
7.02      The project was intended to lend predominantly for small and
medium-sized farmers, but the bulk of credit was lent to larger farmers.
Again, the Bank was flexible in responding to a situation where larger sub-
borrowers proposed technically and financially sound investments that would
contribute to achieving the project's primary objective of increased milk
production, and to increasing and improving the national herd.
VIII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNT
8.01      The project illustrates the need for a flexible approach during
implementation. Difficulties were encountered in revising milk legislation
to establish Grade B consumer quality milk, which was to have a higher produ-
cer price than industrial grade milk. As a result, credit demand from dairy
farms was low. At the same time, domestic meat shortages aud an increase in
the US export quota increased demand for beef production credit. Faced with
this realíty, the Bank allowed BNP to provide credit for breeding/fattening
farmas to ensure that lending continued. Although the project as implemented
varied somewhat from its design, the return on the investment was satisfac-
tory, as evidenced by the economic rate of :eturn of 11%.
8.02      The overall success of private on-farm investments under the credit
component and the faílure of the dairy program to assist state-owned farms
suggest that any future lending should concentrate on support to private
farmers. Even though the dairy program became operational well into the
project, the slow rate of investment, poor management and frequent staff
changes were the main factors in the failure of the program. The farms do
not appear to have been well chosen for the demonstration role they were
intended to play.
8.03      The appraisal team was over-optimistic about the viability of
upgradíng the local herd. It foresaw the purchase of improved milking strain
cattle; particularly for the dairy farma, cattle would nee1 to be imported.
In fact no cattle were imported. BNP believes this was mainly because
farmers were not convínced of the additional benefita that would accrue from
the extra expenditure involved in importing higher productivity cattle. The
achievement of milk production targets at the dairy farma in the survey using
local animals supports this view. Overall, the project achieved smaller than
anticipated improvements in the herd, evidenced by the lower coefficients
(carrying capacity, calving rates, etc. See Annex 5, Tabl' 1) for the model
farms.  This outcome índicates the need to asase  more realistically what
technical improvementa are desirable and achievable through such a credit
project.

SECOND LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (Loan 1397-PAN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Project Impact 1,
A. Agricultural Impact
1.        This annex ís based on data collelted by BNP fleld offices through
a survey carried out ín 1985 of 100 farms, 2/ or about 23% of the total 438
farms assisted by the project.  The survey collected data on land use, herd
composition, productíon parametera and operating costs for both the without
and with project situations. These data have been used to develop typical
farm models for the three types of farms asaisted under the project. Total
project output has been quantified by aggregatíng data from the models. 31
2.        On Farm Impact.  The main indicators of on-farm impact are
summarized in Table 1; detatils follow in Tables 2-6. Comparing the outcome
with appraísal estimates indicates that although the project's impact
generally follows appraisal expectations, there are sore devíatíona:
(a)  Parm modela.  The two typical farm modela selected tn the SAR--
dual purpose and dairy farms-- were both based on an average farm
size of 50 ha. During implementation, farmers with much larger
farm sizes have actually participated ín the project. Three
typical models were identified as follows:
Number    Size Before Devel.    Actual Size
Model 1 (Dual Purpose)              320             167 ha             192  ha
Model 2 (Breeding/Fattening)         104            341 ha             333  ha
Model 3 (Dairy)                       14            220 ha             240  ha
1/   Excludes the dairy program, for which insuffícient data were available.
2/   48 dual-purpose farma; 48 breeding/fattening farma and 4 dalry farms.
3/   The survey farms also made investments usíng credit from other sources.
Since it was not possible to identify technícal improvements achieved
through different sources of credit, the following data reflect all
investments in the survey farms at the time the project subloans were
drawn down.

(b)  Production Capacity.  Because of the above, the average number of
cattle per farm was not in line wíth SAR's estimates. However, a
comparison can be made between the SAR estimates and the model
farms for the carryíng capacity (in AU/ha), as follows:
SAR                   Actual
Before Dev, Full Dev. Before Dev. Full Dev.
Model 1 (Dual Purpose)             0.8          1.9        0.76          0.80
Model 2 (Breeding/Fatteníng)       n.a.         n.a.       0.49          0.58
Model 3 (Dalry)                    1.4          2.1        0.84          0.89
(c)  Income-Generating Capacity.  The SAR estimated that net farm income
would inerease by 650% anu 230% for the dual purpose and dairy farm
models, respectively.  Actual increases have been much lower than
estimated and range from 28% for the dairy model to 130% and 210%
for the dual purpose and breeding/fattening modelo, respectívely.
The main reason why increases fell short of the SAR estimates l8
the combined effect of the lower-than-expected production capacity
and the sizable drop in real príces of the main products--beef aud
milk-that occurred during the project.
(d) Productivity Coefficients. In almost all cases, actual production
parametera are well below those envisaged during appraisal-a
comparison of the main production features is given below:

3.        Agregate Impact of the Credit Componento  Aggregate production
increases for mílk and meat as a result of the project are substantially
different from appraisal estimates, as shown below (in tons/yr):
Appraisal Estimate          Actual          X Change
Beef (carcasa)                900                   1,830               103
Milk                       28,800                   4,980               -83
Beef production ia higher than estimated because support for breeding/fat-
tening farma was not considered at appraisal. On the other hand, the
considerable shortfall in milk productíon vis-a-vis the appraisal estímate i8
the result of two main factors--atocking and calving rates--falling short of
the values expected.
4.        Employment.  According to BNP's data, permanent employment
ínereased by about 1.0 man equivalent (ME) on dual-purpose farmas, 0.5 ME on
breedíng/fattening farms, and 1.5 ME on dairy farms-for a total of some 390
ME per year.  Furthermore, a total of some 9,500 man-days per year have been
generated under the project, 48% of which were on dual-purpose faras and 40%
and 12% on breeding/fattening and dairy farma, respectively. Additional
employment was generated on-farm during the lnvestment phase, as well as
later on for ínput supply and output marketíng, processing and distribution.
However, quantífying these employment effects as impossible within the scope
of this report.
B. Financial and Economic Returns
5.        Financial Returns.  The fínancial rateo of return have been calcu-
lated for the dual-purpose, breeding/fattening and dairy farmas, based on the
farm models in Tables 1-6, and are, respectively, 10.1%, 6.3%, and 11.3%.
These compare wíth appraisal estimates of 14% and 18.5% for the dual-purpose
and dairy farm modelo, respectively.  The breeding/fattening farm model was
not envisaged at appralsal. The analysis is based on 1985 constant prices,
wíth past expenditures restated in 1985 price terma by using the wholesale
price lndex (Table 9).
6.        The principal factors that have contributed to achievement of lower
FRRs than given in the SAR are the poorer-than-expected productivity perfor-
mance (Table 6) and the drop in real prices for beef and meat (Tables 11 and
12).
7.        Economic Return.  An economlc re-evaluation has been undertaken of
the project, excluding the dalry program for which data on benefita and
operating costs were not avallable. The analysls has been carried out in
1985 price terms by using the wholesaie price index (Table 9). Phased
iuvestment costa in current terma, as well as in economic termo for the
purpose of the analysis, are shown in Table 10. In the analysis, the follow-
ing major asaumptlons were made:

(a)  Since Panama is a net exporter of beef and a net importer of dairy
products, f.o.b. prices for beef and c.i.f. prices for dairy
producto were utilized to derive economic prices for output. At
the farm level, the price thus calculated for 1985 is based on
export price of boneless beef and a boning yield of 35.8% (see
Table 11). The 1985 economic farm-gate príce has then been
projected for the period 1986-95 follow-ing the trend indicated in
the Bank's cobmodity price forecasts. Similarly, the on-farm
economic price of milk is derived from the weighted average of
reconstituted milk from different sources (powdered whole milk,
non-fat dried milk and butter oil), using appropriate conversion
factora (Table 12).
(b) Unskilled labor was valued at 80% of the financial costa.
(c)  Running costo of BNP's TU, estimated at some US$213,000 per year,
have been included in the analysis from year eight onwards.
(d)  Since taxes, tariffs and social benefits payments to labor are
transfer payments within the economy, benefits and costa were
adjusted to compensate for them. The purchase of land has not been
included as a cost in the ecornomic analysis.
(e)  A project life of 20 years was utilized in the analysis.  Incremen-
tal herd values were credited to the benefit stream at the end of
the project's life.
8.         Based on the above assumptions, the economic rate of return is
estimated at 11.1% (Table 14). Thi8 is lower than the 19.6% expected at
appraisal, due to the poorer than expected increases in on-farm productivity,
and the drop in real prices of beef and milk during implementation, and
possibly, the inclusion of the less financially attractive breeding/fattening
farma.
