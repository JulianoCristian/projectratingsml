The emphasis of the second\n            project was on milk rather than beef production in an effort\n            to reduce milk imports. The project was to provide credit\n            for: (a) dual-purpose (beef/dairy) farms (220 individual\n            farms and 20 farmer groups); (b) 135 dairy farms; and (c) a\n            government-owned breeding station that was to serve as a\n            training center for farmers. Lessons learned include: 1) the\n            project illustrates the need for a flexible approach during\n            implementation. Because of difficulties in revising milk\n            legislation, credit demand from dairy farms was low. At the\n            same time, demand for beef production credit was high. Faced\n            with this reality, the Bank allowed Banco Nacional de Panama\n            (BNP) to provide credit for breeding/fattening farms to\n            ensure that lending continued. Although the project as\n            implemented varied somewhat from its design, the return on\n            the investment was satisfactory, as evidenced by the\n            economic rate of return of 11 percent; 2) the overall\n            success of investments on private farms under the credit\n            component and the failure of the government dairy program\n            suggest that future lending of this type should concentrate\n            on private farms; and 3) the smaller than anticipated\n            improvements in technical coefficients suggest that the\n            appraisal team was over-optimistic about the viability of\n            upgrading the local herd. This indicates the need to assess\n            more realistically what technical improvements are desirable\n            and achievable through such a credit project."}, "docdt": "1987-10-21T00:00:00Z"}
