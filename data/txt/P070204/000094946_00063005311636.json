Benin, will assist in the start up, and pilot testing of a\n            new government program that aims at: increasing the\n            availability, quality, and cost effectiveness of labor force\n            training; and, at strengthening the public sector capacity\n            to monitor, and evaluate labor force training needs, and, at\n            improving the private sector training capacity. The\n            components will: 1) provide training grants to workers in\n            the informal, and modern sectors, and to selected, new labor\n            force participants. Priority training programs will be\n            identified, and subsequently, contract the provision of\n            training with qualified providers. Training proposals will\n            be evaluated on the basis of economic interest, social\n            equity, technical feasibility, cost estimates, and financial\n            planning; 2) develop a strong monitoring, and evaluation\n            system, to generate timely information on the implementation\n            of the training program, on the market for training, i.e.,\n            beneficiary groups' knowledge, and appreciation of the\n            Fund's program, and, on the impact of training.\n            Longitudinal studies will measure the economic impact, to\n            allow progressive policy adjustments, and rationalized\n            financial allocations; and, 3) will strengthen the\n            institutional development of the Fonds de Developpement de\n            la Formation Professionnelle Continue et de\n            l'Apprentissage, and finance overseas study, training,\n            and technical assistance."}, "docdt": "2000-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
