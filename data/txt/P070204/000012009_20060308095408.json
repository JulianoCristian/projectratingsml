Project results largely\n            confirm that the establishment of a flexible mechanism for\n            financing demand-driven training activities to strengthen\n            labor force qualification, is a viable and interesting\n            response to the skills development needs of various economic\n            actors, especially in the informal sector. However, project\n            implementation underscored that success and sustainability\n            hinge on some key elements. Lessons are highlighted as\n            follows. The effectiveness and sustainability of mechanisms\n            depend heavily on the autonomy granted to the fund, and on\n            the extent of private sector \"ownership.\" And, the\n            credibility of the mechanism calls for the establishment of\n            an adequate-and predictable-system of funding. The\n            demand-driven approach, and the organization of fair\n            competition among training providers underline the need to\n            be able to manage activities smoothly within a predictable\n            short- and medium-term framework to sustain training demand,\n            and to expedite timely responses to the needs identified.\n            Ensuring availability of other inputs such as micro-finance\n            and market accessibility is essential to improve the impact\n            of training on beneficiaries, especially in the informal\n            sector. But, financing a demand-driven training program,\n            together with the required beneficiary contribution should\n            be accompanied by adequate evaluation work, and suitable\n            communication strategies to ensure equitable distribution of grants."}, "docdt": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z"}
