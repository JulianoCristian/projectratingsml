raising enrollments and\n            quality/learning outcomes of primary education through\n            increased parental participation and financing, school-based\n            planning and management of resources, school-based quality\n            enhancement initiatives, and improved support for schools at\n            the district level, through a Community Education Fund\n            Pilot; 2) expanding educational opportunities and improving\n            quality at the secondary level, particularly for poorer\n            girls, through a Girl's Secondary Education Support\n            Pilot; 3) building capacity through these programs at the\n            district and community levels and through selective training\n            and project implementation at the central level; and 4)\n            improving policy development, planning, and research through\n            improved testing and statistics systems, operations\n            research, policy studies, and strategic
