         sustainability likely, and institutional development impacts\n            are substantial. Lessons reinforce the notions that adapting\n            flexibility in the process of project implementation is\n            usually necessary; that continuous community sensitization,\n            training and support during the project implementation are\n            needed to enhance active participation of different\n            stakeholders for improved school management; and, that\n            Project design should always pay attention to monitoring and\n            evaluation aspects, while regarding capacity building,\n            Project design should consider using local systems as much\n            as possible. However, it is suggested funds allocated for\n            quality improvement were small. The reason was that schools\n            were free to choose the items to include in their plans, so\n            interventions varied greatly. The lessons learned showed\n            that earmarking specific financial allocations for quality\n            improvements, such as teaching and learning materials is\n            important. It is highlighted that girls' selection, a\n            process that relies on head teachers and the village council\n            in a transparent setting, while far from perfect, is likely\n            to be better than having the selection made by an external\n            agency with no personal knowledge of the people being\n            considered. A combination of selection methods for\n            scholarships that would include the village level processes\n            with oversight by a committee of peers would be appropriate."}, "docdt": "2006-06-27T00:00:00Z"}
