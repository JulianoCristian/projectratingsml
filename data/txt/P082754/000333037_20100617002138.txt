2.      The implementation of the project is progressing well and the proposed changes,
namely a reallocation of the Loan Proceeds would allow finalizing all activities under the
project and consequently increase the chances of meeting the development objectives.


There are no pending audits and all audits were acceptable to the Bank. The next audit
report is expected to be submitted in June 2010.

The works under the project component 1 (Rehabilitation and upgrading of rural roads)
incurred cost overruns due to unanticipated increases in the costs of key inputs (oil,
bitumen, construction materials, consumables, labor, etc.). The proposed reallocation is
necessary to ensure the rehabilitation of the 625 km of rural roads that constitute the
project component 1 (as stated in the original project description). The remaining length
of roads is financed from the Government budget as part of the overall national program
of rural roads.

This reallocation does not affect the objectives of the project, as they will be fully
achieved. The reduction of the loan proceeds allocated to consultants' services
( 900,000) is due to the Borrower's decision to: (i) use their own budget to fund selected
activities, particularly those related to the formulation of specific proposals that would
help prepare for an eventual take over by provinces and communes of the management of
the local rural roads; and (ii) use European Investment Bank's grant (EIB) to strengthen
the capabilities of the Directorate of Roads (DR) for social and environmental
assessments. The reallocation of the loan proceeds initially allocated for "Goods"
( 40,000 Euros) results from the Borrower's decision not to finance the purchase of any
additional office equipment or cars for the implementing agency. Finally, the extension of
the closing date will allow the timely completion of the project activities.

Component 2 (Institutional support component - total cost estimate equivalent to US$
1.36 million) consists of consultant services, to: (a) develop a system to monitor and
evaluate the achievement of accessibility targets and execution of the Government
Second National Program of Rural Roads (NPRR-2) at the provincial and national levels,
and disseminate periodic reports on the NPRR-2 progress and achievement of targets; (b)
formulate specific proposals that would help prepare for an eventual takeover of the
management of the local rural roads by the provinces and communes; and (c) strengthen
the capabilities of the DR for social and environmental assessments. All these three sub-
components are under implementation and there will be no changes to the project outputs,
components or development objectives:

       a. sub-component 2(a), related to the project monitoring and evaluation, is
          ongoing and financed by the Bank loan proceeds;
       b. sub-component 2(b), related to the management of local rural roads, is
          ongoing and financed by the Borrower's own budget; and


                                            6
       c. sub-component 2(c) to strengthen the DR's capacity in social and
          environmental assessments, is ongoing and financed by a parallel EIB grant
          supporting the NPRR2.

The amount of 940,000 reallocated to Works from Goods ( 40,000) and Consultant
Services ( 900,000) represents only 3.03% of the Loan Amount. This is in addition to the
use of the unallocated amount ( 2,505,000) to cover price contingencies.

                                    Restructuring Paper

1.     The closing date for Morocco, Loan No 4747-MOR, P082754 will be extended
       from June 30, 2010 until June 30, 2011.

2.      The implementation of the project is progressing well and the proposed change,
namely an extension of the closing date would allow finalizing all activities under the
project and consequently increase the chances of meeting the development objectives.
The Bank and the Borrower have agreed in writing to a specific action plan and a
schedule to complete the project within the extension. In this regard, the implementation
schedule has been revised to reflect the completion of all contracts of the project hence
the disbursement of the Loan proceeds for the remaining period up to the new closing
date of June 30, 2011.

The proposed extension is necessary to allow: (a) the completion of the ongoing works
that were delayed by exceptional weather conditions in 2007, 2008, and 2009; (b) the
commencement and completion of works; and (c) the continuation of the contract
concluded with the Centre National d'Etudes et de Recherches Routières (CNER) for the
monitoring and evaluation of the Second National Program of Rural Roads.

The extension of the closing date from June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2011 will allow the
completion of all project activities and ensure the full disbursement of the Loan by the
new Closing date.

This will be the first extension of the project.
