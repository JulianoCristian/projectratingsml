1.  Country and Sector Background 
 
Rural poverty and government strategy
.
About 19 percent of Morocco’s population, equivalent 
to 5.3 million people are estimated to be below the poverty line. Overall, 66 percent of the poor 
live in rural areas. The rural poor live disproportionally in isolated areas. One of the Moroccan 
government priorities is to improve conditions of the rural population by increasing their access 
to basic infrastructure and to social services. 
Rural road accessibility.
 
The government strategy specifically includes improving the rural 
population’s access to all-weather roads. This access today is low, since only about 44 percent of 
the country’s rural population live near a road passable year round.  There are also large 
differentials among provinces in the population’s rural road accessibility, ranging from about 75
 
percent for the better served provinces to about 20 percent for the more isolated provinces.   
Highways and Transport Service
.
The density of the country’s Morocco’s  road network is  low, 
whether referred to area or to population. Further, close to half of the roads are unpaved, and 
many roads are cut 30-60 days per year due to severe weather. In the rural areas where road 
condition is generally poor, transport services are often limited to a basic, once or twice daily bus 
service, or to jeeps (all-wheel drive vehicles) on the poorer roads  Where the roads are better, 
individual operators provide higher quality and more frequent service with smaller vehicles, 
often share-ride taxis. 
Sector issues
,
in addition to the problems of low rural road accessibility and the quality of the 
road network are: (a
)
lack of global view of rural roads at provincial level
,
since a diversity of 
sponsors and agencies are involved in the financing and execution of rural roads projects, and it 
is difficult to obtain a global view of all such projects; (b
)
large size of road network under the 
responsibility of the central government
,
since not only national, but also regional and provincial 
roads are managed by the national road agency.  Ideally, part of the provincial and regional roads 
should be transferred to the respective local governments; (c) 
centralized highway management
,
Page  2
since while national highway agency has transferred many responsibilities to its regional and 
provincial offices,  headquarters still retain many functions that could be deconcentrated; (d) 
minimum financing of road maintenance
,
since allocation of resources in the last decade were 
barely sufficient, although efficient use of the funds resulted is some slight increase in the overall 
quality of the road system; and (e) 
poor road safety
,
reflected in a growing number of accidents 
and fatalities, where little improvement has been made as the proposal to create an 
interministerial commission for road safety, located a high level in the government, has not 
materialized. 
2. Objectives 
The project’s development objective
 is to increase the level of road access by the rural 
population, especially in the more disadvantaged provinces, by supporting a national program of 
road improvements and through strengthening institutional capacity.  
3.  Rationale for Bank Involvement 
Accelerating the pace of rural road improvement to achieve the desired rural accessibility targets 
requires significant additional financing over what has been possible in the past. The proposed 
project, which would support Morocco’s second National Program of Rural Roads (NPRR-2), to 
be launched in 2005, should serve a catalytic role in helping to attract the required financing.  
The project would provide a framework for the development of rural roads, with a global view of 
rural accessibility, financial requirements, maintenance strategies, community participation and 
sector integration.  As such, the project would give key stakeholders (central and sector 
government agencies, as well as potential co-financiers) an overall view of the rural road access 
programs.  The accessibility focus and the global analysis would likely be attractive for external 
financiers. 
4. Description 
The key components of this project are: 
Rehabilitation and/or upgrading of about 625 kilometers of rural roads, and  
Institutional development to: 
(a) develop 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
 of accessibility targets and execution of the 
Second National Program of Rural Roads (and roads improved outside this program) at 
the provincial and communal level, and 
disseminate
 the M&E information to facilitate 
sectoral integration of rural development programs and 
strengthen local participation
;
(b) formulate recommendations for improving 
management of local rural roads 
to help the 
communes
 and provinces prepare to take over their maintenance, and 
(c) strengthen the capabilities of the Directorate of Roads for 
social and environmental 
assessments.
 
This component will also include identification by the Provincial Directorates of Public 
Works (DPEs) together with specialized agencies, of local development opportunities 
stemming from improved accessibility, and assistance to the local communities for their 
materialization.

6. Implementation 
 
The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Morocco.  The Directorate of Roads (DRCR) of the 
Ministry of Public Works and Transport, with its regional and provincial directorates (DREs and 
DPEs), will be the implementing agency for the project.  DRCR is experienced with Bank-
financed projects, as the last project closed in 2001.   
Given the emphasis on institutional strengthening and recognizing the longer time for effective 
local participatory planning, the project is expected to be implemented in five years (January 1, 
2005 to December 31, 2009).  A mid-term review in March 2007 will evaluate progress on the 
basis of performance indicators  A Project Implementation Plan (PIP), providing details of 
project implementation was  prepared by DRCR before project negotiations. 
The DRCR to ensure full compliance with social and environmental requirements will strengthen 
its environment and social team capacity to prepare adequate environment and social action 
plans, carry out social surveys and address resettlement issues, including for the non classified 
roads for which the 
communes
 are responsible for land acquisition. 
DPEs will implement the rural roads component with support of the DREs as needed.  DPEs will 
coordinate their activities with all stakeholders involved in the project and implement the 
dissemination program at the provincial level.  Selection of road works and technical standards 
will be led by DRCR through the participative process described in B4 above. Annual lists of 
subprojects, selected from the NPRR-2, to be financed under the project, would be submitted to 
Bank prior approval with indication of their economic rate of return (ERR) or cost-effectiveness 
(CE)  indicator.  The subprojects must be included in the provincial programs of priority rural 
roads (PPRR) approved by the province.  This arrangement is appropriate and will help the 
MPWT to further strengthen the de-concentrated road management functions and participation of 
local authorities.  This is also a  step toward the empowerment of the 
communes for
 managing 
their local roads networks. 
7. Sustainability 
 
The technical, economic, environmental and social analysis carried out for all subprojects of the 
NPRR-2  should ensure that these investments are sustainable.  The institutional component that 
will help monitor and disseminate progress and results, and the identification of local economic  
opportunities, should help ensure that the benefits stemming from the projects are sustained. 
There is a risk, however, that budgetary allocations for road maintenance may be insufficient,  
affecting the sustainability of the overall road network.  A gradual increase in the maintenance 
budget will be necessary from 2005, leading to a total increase of about 10 percent by 2011, to 
cover the incremental maintenance requirements stemming from the rehabilitation and upgrading 
of the roads listed in the NPRR-2. A monitoring indicator will track the allocation of funding and 
will flag the need for corrective action in case of underfunding. In addition, another indicator 
under the project will monitor the condition of the road network.  
For local roads, a similar risk exists.  Agreements to be signed by the provincial and the local 
authorities will commit the 
communes
 to make  arrangements to ensure adequate maintenance of 
the roads.  
8.  Lessons Learned from Past Operations in the Country/Sector 
Page  5
Two lessons noted in the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) of the last highway project  
have been taken into account in the formulation of the project.   
First, there is the need for rural roads projects to define objectives based on accessibility.   The 
last project provided  some crude indicators on accessibility, but still retained the physical 
outputs (length of roads) as key indicators. The proposed project has accessibility as its main 
focus. 
Second, carrying out monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is difficult.  This project therefore pays 
special attention to this function.  A monitoring and evaluation system will be developed and put 
in place from the launching of the NPRR-2. The M&E will track progress of the provincial 
programs of priority rural roads (PPRR) and the NPRR-2 as a whole, and of their impact in 
improving the level of road accessibility for the rural population.  Information on NPRR-2 
progress and evaluation of impacts will be disseminated broadly.  In particular, information will 
be conveyed to the provincial and central authorities responsible for the relevant sectors, 
especially health and education and other infrastructure (water, rural electrification).  This 
dissemination will contribute to a better integration of the sectors involved in rural development, 
including their investments and services.
