While it is\n            not expected that major displacements will occur due to\n            project implementation, minor land acquisition and\n            expropriations are foreseen, namely, expropriations on the\n            right of way, and of small land plots, required for roads\n            realignments. Another instrument addressing expropriations,\n            often practiced in Morocco, is through voluntary donation of\n            land. This resettlement policy identifies project affected\n            people (PAP), and determines, based on the country's\n            legislation, and the Bank's operational directive on\n            involuntary resettlement, the due compensation for land, and\n            asset losses (both for PAP holding property rights, or\n            squatters) following public consultations. Expropriations\n            will be compensated at market values as of the date of\n            consignment with the authorities. Grievance mechanisms will\n            be in place should conflict occur, and regular monitoring\n            shall ensure compliance with his policy."}, "docdt": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z"}
