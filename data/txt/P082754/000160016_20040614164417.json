The two\n            components of this project are: (1) rehabilitation and/or\n            upgrading of about 625 kilometers of rural roads, and (2)\n            institutional development to: (a) develop monitoring and\n            evaluation (M&E) of accessibility targets and execution\n            of the Second National Program of Rural Roads (and roads\n            improved outside this program) at the provincial and\n            communal level, and disseminate the M&E information to\n            further sectoral integration of rural development programs\n            and strengthen local participation; (b) formulate\n            recommendations for improving management of local rural\n            roads to help the communes and provinces prepare to take\n            over their maintenance; and (c) strengthen the capabilities\n            of the Directorate of Roads for social and environmental\n            assessments.
