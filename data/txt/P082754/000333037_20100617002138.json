The implementation\n            of the project is progressing well and the change, namely an\n            extension of the closing date will allow finalizing all\n            activities under the project and consequently increase the\n            chances of meeting the development objectives. The Bank and\n            the Borrower have agreed in writing to a specific action\n            plan and a schedule to complete the project within the\n            extension. In this regard, the implementation schedule has\n            been revised to reflect the completion of all contracts of\n            the project hence the disbursement of the loan proceeds for\n            the remaining period up to the new closing date of June 30,\n            2011. The extension is necessary to allow: (a) the\n            completion of the ongoing works that were delayed by\n            exceptional weather conditions in 2007, 2008, and 2009; (b)\n            the commencement and completion of works; and (c) the\n            continuation of the contract concluded with the Centre\n            National d'Etudes et de Recherches Routieres (CNER) for\n            the monitoring and evaluation of the second national program\n            of rural roads."}, "docdt": "2010-06-09T00:00:00Z"}
