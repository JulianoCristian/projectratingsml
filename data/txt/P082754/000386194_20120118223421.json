"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Rural Roads Project for\n            Morocco were as follows: outcomes were satisfactory; risk to\n            development outcome was low or negligible; Bank performance\n            was satisfactory; borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned includes: in a country\n            like Morocco, providing access to an all-weather road to the\n            rural population requires first programs to be implemented\n            by the Directorate of roads and its provincial directorates\n            with a priority given to rural roads connecting to the\n            network of classified roads and for the establishment of a\n            platform for planning, designing and implementing rural\n            roads along with an effective monitoring and evaluation\n            system including impact evaluation. Implementing a national\n            investment program requires the establishment of a dedicated\n            and well staff unit at the onset of its launch. An adequate\n            monitoring and evaluation system including well-defined and\n            measurable indicators plays is key role for a successful\n            program. Well stated technical standards are essential to\n            the quality and sustainability of infrastructure\n            investments. The preparation and dissemination a manual for\n            design and appraisal of rural roads projects played a\n            critical role and helped ensure quality and conformity for\n            the detailed designs prepared by different and numerous consultants."}, "docdt": "2011-12-08T00:00:00Z"}
