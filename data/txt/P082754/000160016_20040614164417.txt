A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.      Country andsector issues
Ruralpoverty and government strutegv. About 19 percent o f Morocco's population, equivalent
to 5.3 millionpeople, are estimated to be below the poverty line, and 44 percent, equivalent to 12
million, are considered economically vulnerable (at or below 50 percent over the poverty line).
Poverty is mainly rural, since almost one Moroccanout o f four i s poor inrural areas compared to
one out o f ten inurbanareas. Overall, 66 percent ofthe poor live inrural areas. The rural-urban
gap is especially big for the extreme andvery poor: 3.0 million rural people fall inthis category,
compared to 0.7 million for the urbanpopulation. The rural poor live inlarge households, have
few working members and anilliteracy rate of67 percent, comparedto 34 percent inurbanareas,
and live disproportionallyinisolated areas.

One o f the Government's priorities noted in its 2020 Rural Development Strategy i s to improve
conditions o f the rural population by increasing their access to basic infrastructure and social
services. This policy includes reducing the imbalance between the provinces better off interms
o f accessibility, and those worse-off.      In the mid-l990s, the Government launched rural
infrastructure programs targeted at the rural population in power, water and roads, and such
programs are currently ongoing.

Rural road accessibility. The Government's strategy specifically includes improving the rural
population's access to all-weather roads. Access today is low, since only about 44 percent o f the
country's rural population live near an all-weather road.        Large differentials exist among
provinces in the population's rural road accessibility, ranging from about 75 percent for the
better served provinces to about 20 percent for the more isolated provinces. Population counted
as having rural access are those who live in villages (douars) o f at least 50 households, and are
located not more than one kilometer away from an all-weather road. This definition takes into
account that providing rural access to highly dispersed populations i s not presently affordable; it
also takes into account that a large proportion o f the inaccessible rural population lives in
mountainous areas, some living at high elevations, which makes walking and access to basic
services andeconomic opportunities difficult.

Morocco's highway system comprises about 57,226 kilometers o f classified roads (national,
regional and provincial), a large percentage o f which, 44 percent, i s unpaved. There are also
about 9,000 km o f non classified roads, mostly unpaved. The density o f the road network is
low, with less than 100 kilometers o f roads per 1,000 square kilometer and 2.0 kilometers per
 1,000 inhabitants. The quality o f the road system i s further hindered by inadequate reliability,
since manyof the roads are often cut 30 to 60 days per year due to severe weather conditions. A
first National Program o f RuralRoads (NPRR-1) launched in 1995, and to be completed in2005,
aims at improvingthis situation. By completing this Program, accessibility will increase to about
50 percent, which is still substantially short o fgovernment objectives.

Transport services in rural areas are provided by private operators. In the areas with thin
demands for passenger services, due to low population densities, and where road conditions are
generally poor, transport services are often limitedto a basic, once or twice daily bus service or
jeeps (all-wheel drive vehicles) on the poorer roads. Where the roads are better, individual
operators provide higher quality and more frequent service with smaller vehicles, often share-
ride taxis. Regarding road freight, this industry was, until recently, highly regulated, which
hampered competitionand led to highfreight tariffs and inadequate services. A law that became
effective in March 2003 liberalized the sector.        This law should significantly improve the
provision o f road transport services for villages and rural areas because small trucks, that are

                                                                                              1

appropriate for the rural economy due to the small size o f shipments and poor road condition,
will no longer be constrained to own-account transport. Where roads are improved, better truck
service with lower prices will be offered.

Sector issues include the following: (a) inadequate quality and density o f the road network; (b)
low rural road accessibility; (c) lack o f global view o f rural roads at provincial levels; (d) large
size of road network under the responsibility o f the central government; (e) centralized highway
management and lack o f capacity at the local level; (0 minimumfinancing o f roadmaintenance;
and (g) poor road safety.
   (a) Quality of the road network. Only about 56 percent o f Morocco's classified road
         network i s paved (totaling 32,000 kilometers), including about 500 kilometers o f
         motorways and some 18,000 kilometers o f two-lane roads that meet international
         standards. Theseroads carry the heaviest inter-city traffic. Close to halfo fthe classified
         paved network consists o f narrow roads, less than 4.5 meters wide andbarelywider than
         a conventional single lane. Traffic has grown at a sustained pace o f about four percent
        per year, and use of larger trucks for long-distance hauling is also growing. As a result,
         the road network i s becoming increasingly inadequate, causing high costs o f land
         transport and increasing traffic accidents and fatalities.
   (b) Rural roads accessibility. Most of the classified roads serving rural populations are
         unpaved, and the large majority are just tracks with minimal or no engineering. About
         seven percent o f the unpaved roads are national roads, 6.5 percent are regional roads,
         and 86.5 percent are provincial roads. Ownership and management o f more than 9,000
         kmofnon-classified roads remains undefined. The very low standardso fall theseroads
         cause frequent road closures due to weather conditions, or impassability by most
         motorized vehicles due to weather or traffic-induced deterioration. The result i s that
         only about 50 percent o f the rural population have access to roads that can be used
         reliably at all times.
   (c) Provincial view of rural roads. Inthe provinces, a diversity o f sponsors and agencies
         are involved inthe financing and execution o frural roadprojects. This makes it difficult
         to obtain a global view o f all projects, which is essential to facilitate integration o f rural
         road programs with other sectors and activities plannedat the local level. Despite the
         diversityo f sponsors andtypes o fruralroads, the Directorate o fRoads andRoad Traffic
         (DRCR), with the help o f its Provincial Directorates (DPE) carried out an inventory of
         all rural roads inall provinces, with a view to facilitate the preparation o ftheir programs
         o fpriority rural roads. There is a need to generate information on all rural road projects
         and their implementation status, and to disseminate such information to government
         officials and service providers so as to facilitate the planning o f infrastructure, services
         andinvestments. The DPEsarewell placed to collect anddisseminate this information.
   (d) Size of the road network under the central government. Morocco's classified road
         network under the Ministry o fPublic Works and Transport (MPWT) is large relative to
         the other government levels. The DRCR manages national, regional and provincial
         roads. Ideally, part o f the provincial and regional roads should be transferred to the
         respective local governments (regions, provinces andcommunes). However, attempts in
         the early 1990's to make such transfers failed because: (i)f the weak financial and
                                                                          o
         technical resources o f local governments and slow progress with the Government's
         decentralization process that could have improved the resource situation; and (ii)
         important investments needed to rehabilitate the roads largely exceeded the resources
         available locally.



                                                                                                    2

    (e) Centralized road management. The DRCR, together with its 48 DPEs and 16 Regional
         Directorates (DRE), manage the classified road network. The number o f DREs has
         gradually increased from four pilot offices in the mid-1990s to 16 offices today. The
         DRCR has already delegated several technical review functions to the regional and the
         provincial offices. In practice, however, the deconcentration is still limited, and the
         central office still retains manyhctions that could be passedon to the DREs andDPEs,
         such as programming the maintenance o f provincial roads, since resident engineers are
         moreknowledgeable o froadcondition andneeds.
    (0 Funding of road maintenance. A recurrent issue with Morocco's road system is the
         allocation o f fimding for road maintenance. In the last decade, funding improved with
         the creation o f a Road Fund(Fonds Special Routier, FSR) inthe early 1990's, a special
         Treasury account, which was established to finance maintenance o f the classified road
         network and improvement o f rural roads.         Even then, at times the funding for
         maintenance was barely sufficient. However, efficient use o f resources by the DRCR
         permitteda slight improvement inthe overall rating condition o f the road system. The
         resourceso f the RoadFundshould be augmented to ensure that any increases infunding
         requirement that may result from the rural roadsprograms will be adequately funded.
    (g) Road safety. With the increase in traffic and the low standards o f the road network,
         traffic accidents and fatalities have grown at an alarming pace. Some improvements
         have been made in recent years, and especially dangerous road sections (black spots)
         have been eliminated. The creation o f an inter-ministerial commission for road safety,
         reporting directly to the Prime Minister, regarded as essential to make substantive
         progress on road safety, has been considered and a draft law prepared. However the law
         has not yet been submittedto the Parliament.

The project addresses the following sectoral issues: (i)improving rural roads accessibility in all
provinces, (ii) establishing a global approach to accessibility at the provincial level, based on
bottom-up, participative planningprecededby a rigorous road inventory andpre-identification o f
provincial rural roads programs, and (iii)      preparing appropriate models for an effective
managemento f localruralroads.

2.      Rationale for Bank involvement
The Government's rural development strategy is to continue improving the rural population's
access to infrastructure.      When the first National Program o f Rural Roads (NPRR-1) is
completed in2005, it will have raised rural accessibility to all-weather roads to about 50 percent.
The Government is seeking to substantially increase this level over the next ten years, and has
decided to accelerate the pace or rural roadimprovements. A secondNational Program o fRural
Roads (NPRR-2), to be launchedin2005, assumes such faster pace.

The Bank i s well placed to support this program, for two reasons: (a) it supports the
Government's rural development strategy, including the improvement in accessibility to
infrastructure; and (b) the Bank has been active and has a good knowledge o f Morocco's road
sector, where its operations have been successful (Section B4).

The project, as designed, takes abroadview o fMorocco's needs for rural roads andaccessibility.
It provides a fi-amework for the development o f rural roads, with a global view o f rural
accessibility focusing on the beneficiary population, an assessment o f the NPRR-2 financial
requirements, road design and maintenance strategies, and participation o f communities and
local governments in the selection o f priority roads. The project would also help facilitate the
integration of rural development activities. Duringproject preparation, an economic evaluation

                                                                                              3

of the NPRR-2 was conducted and confirmed that the program was economically justified and
would generate ample social benefits.

The program approach taken by the project i s likely to help attract the funding required to
complete the program's financing, andmake it possible for the government to reach accessibility
targets. The FrenchDevelopment Agency (AFD) and the European InvestmentBank (EIB), are
currently financing rural roads projects in the Northern provinces inthe context o f the NPRR-1.
The importance givento the accessibility objective and the global evaluation o f the NPRR-2 also
are likely to be well received bythe donor community.

The proposed project's focus on improving accessibility o f the rural population, matches the
Bank's interest inpromoting a change inthe focus and objectives o f rural road programs, from
that o f traditional physical outputs (such as the length o f roads improved) to the beneficiaries.
The Bank has encouraged the MPWT and the DRCR to support the rural road program with
institutional activities aimed at improving the planningprocess and enhancing the impact o frural
roads to be improvedunder the NPRR-2.

3.      Higher level objectives to which the project contributes
The secondNational Program o fRural Roads, that the project supports, will: (a) be instrumental
in helping the rural population improve their access to services, markets and income
opportunities; and (b) contribute to reducing the accessibility differential between the more and
less accessible provinces. The government views both goals as essential elements o f its strategy
to reduce rural poverty and improve equity. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supports
these goals and explicitly identifies development o f rural infrastructure as one o f the key
priorities to be supported byBank operations to assist inalleviatingpoverty.

The project also contributes to the Millennium Development Goals because o f strong inter-
sectoral synergies o f rural roads, with all-weather roads being especially important to achieving
targets on maternal mortality andprimary school enrollment, particularly for girls.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.      Lending instrument
The Government andthe Bankhave agreedto process the project as a Specific Investment Loan.

2.      Project development objective and key indicators
Theproject's development objective i s to increase rural populations' access to roads, especially
in the more disadvantaged provinces, by supporting a national program of road improvements
and through strengtheninginstitutionalcapacity.

The main indicators' are:
    (a) A National Rural Road Accessibility Index (NRRAI), that i s the percentage o f rural
          population that can access an all-weather road.             The target for this indicator is to
          improve from 45 percent in2002 (most recent roadinventory) to 67 percent in2010, (80
          percent in 2015 when the NPRR-2 i s completed and 60 percent by the Mid-Term
          Review).



    The baseline values of the indicators at the start o f the NPRR-2 and of the project (January 2005) will be
    determined by the CNER, as part of its responsibilities for designing and implementing the monitoring and
    evaluation system for the NPRR-2.
                                                                                                        4

         An Accessibility Differential Indicator (ADI), a measure devised for this project that
         quantifies the accessibility gap between the ten provinces (representing about 20 percent
         o f Morocco's 48 provinces) with the lowest accessibility, and the ten provinces with the
         highest accessibility. The target for this indicator i s to improve from 0.38 in 2002 to
         0.60 in2010 (0.65 in2015 and 0.50 at Mid-Term).
         A Transport Service Improvement Indicator (TSII), a measureto assessthe impact ofthe
         improved roads on the quality o f inter-city transport services for passengers. Inorder to
         monitor this indicator, a sample o f roads will be selected every year. By the end o f the
         project, at least 80 percent o f all sample roads that will have been open to traffic for two
         or more years should show an improvement inthe quality o f service, reflected inhigher
         service frequency, more comfortable vehicles, or lower rates.

Indicators relating to the project's institutional development objectives aimed at enhancing the
impact o f improved accessibility and strengthening capacity for social and environmental
analysis would include:
    (a) An accessibility monitoring system in place, that will generate annual, provincial-level
         reports coveringprogress inimplementingall rural roadworks, including the number o f
         people that have gained road access, kilometers completed and open to traffic, design
         standards, exact location, and other related information, as well as the impact on
         improved delivery, use o f social services, and access to markets.
    (b) A disseminationand outreach program, that will cover a number of sub-activities aimed
         at making available public information on ruralroads projects to concerned stakeholders,
         andidentifyinglocal economic opportunities madepossible byimprovedroads.
    (c) A study completed to improve management capacity of local rural roads in provinces
         andcommunes.
    (d) Training carried out and its effectiveness in strengthening capacity of the road agency
         for social and environmental assessments.

Inorder to ensurethat the maintenance ofthe overallroadnetwork isbeing done correctly there
would also be:
    (a) An indicator2 measuring the level o f funding provided for road maintenance, set at a
         minimum, annually, per kilometer of classified road, equal to the value determinedfrom
         the 2004 maintenance budget. .
    (b) An indicator on overall road network condition, specifying the percentage of roads in
         bad condition. The target would be 30 percent in 2010, from 35 percent measured in
         2003.

3.      Projectcomponents
The NPRR-2Program
The second National Program for Rural Roads (PNRR-2), which the proposed project will
support, is expectedto improve about 15,000 kilometers o froads, about 59 percent o fwhich will
be provincial roads, 34 percent local rural roads, and seven percent national andregional roads.
Itwould provideimprovedroadaccessibility for about 2.9 millionpeople livinginrural areas

The PNRR-2's main features are: (a) a focus on accessibility; (b) strong participatoryplanning at
the provincial level; (c) sound technical, economic, social and environmental standards; (d)
diversified financing, including borrowing and contribution by provinces, communes and local

*   This indicator will be calculated following the same criteria to assess maintenance expenditures used during
    supervision o fthe SixthHighway project fianced by the Bank.

                                                                                                          5

communities; (e) attention to the preservation o f rural road assets, especially o f the local rural
roads by the communes and provinces; (f) promotion o f local economic development
opportunities to enhance the roads' benefits; and (g) appropriate monitoring and evaluation
arrangements including a broad dissemination o f the program's implementation and results.
These features are described inAnnex 16.

The Program's cost i s estimated at about US$1,065 million (see Annex 4). The program will be
partially financed by the Road Fund. In 2004, a law (No. 57-03) created a public entity, the
Caisse pour le Financement Routier (CFR).           The CFR through borrowing will mobilize
resources additional to those of the FSR. This should allow to significantly increase the
resources available to finance rural roads programs and ensure that road accessibility targets are
met. The CFR's borrowing levels would be determinedby the net resources available from the
FSR, after provision o f adequate hnding for road maintenance. The CFR, which structure and
administrative organization will be inplace duringthe second half o f 2004, i s expected to be a
lean agency with the minimumnecessarystaffing to carry out its financial mandate. Itwould not
have any technical functions, which would continue to bethe responsibility o fthe DRCR.
The Proposed Project
The scope o f the proposed project consists o f (i)rehabilitation and upgrading rural roads (about
625 km); and (ii) institutional support.
   Rural roads component (total cost includingstudies andsupervision, as well as physical and
   price contingencies is MAD 388.7 million, equivalent to US$41.98 million). Rehabilitation
   and/or upgrading o f 625 km o f rural roads included in the NPRR-2 (and including small,
   complementary, road-related infrastructure).       The roads under the NPRR-2 will: (a)
   contribute to improving rural access in a cost-effective manner, or having satisfactory
   economic returns inthe case o fhighertraffic roads, (b) have beenselected following a strong
   participatory process involving the provinces and the rural municipalities (communes), (c)
   have acceptable design standards including for road safety, for crossing villages, and (d)
   include environmental, resettlement and social safeguards.
   Any rural roadmeetingthe above criteria would be eligible for Bank financing. Priority will
   be given, however, to subprojects ready for implementation especially inpoor areas or where
   they can support activities under a parallel rural water project being processed as a CAS
   priority. It i s expected that the majority o f the roads selected under the NPRR-2 program
   will contribute strongly to improving accessibility. Connectivity needs o f the roadnetworks
   will require that some o fthe roads may be selectedmainly for this purpose.
   Institutional support component (total cost including physical and price contingencies:
   MAD 12.6 million, equivalent to US$ 1.36 million) consisting of consultant services, to: (a)
   develop a system to monitor and evaluate the achievement o f accessibility targets and
   execution o f the NPRR-2 (as well as other road improvements outside this program), at the
   provincial and communal level, and disseminate periodic reports on the NPRR-2 progress
   and achievement of targets, in order to facilitate sectoral integration and strengthen
   participation o f local governments and communities; (b) formulate specific proposals that
   would help preparefor an eventual take over byprovinces and communes o fthe management
   of the local rural roads; and (c) strengthen the capabilities o f the DRCR for social and
   environmental assessments.
   This component also includes identification by the DPEs with assistance from specialized
   agencies o f local economic opportunities stemming from the improvements in accessibility.
   The DPEs working with agencies such as Morocco's Social Development Agency (ADS)
   will helpthe localcommunities materialize such opportunities.

5.      Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
Two alternative approachesfor the design o fthe project were considered and rejected:
    - The first approachwas Community Driven Development (CDD) project, under which
        individual roads would have been selected and implemented by communes. The CDD
        was not suitable to support a national program involving the central, as well as local,
        levels. Inaddition, technical capacities are not available to the local level for designing,
        executing and maintaining proposed road improvements. A CDD approach would have
        had to focus mostly on very short local links, that often connect to classified roads
        (provincial, regional, national), which are often not accessible year round. Ensuring
        accessibility o f classified roads i s vital for any program aimed at improving rural road
        accessibility.

                                                                                                  7

    - Thesecond, aspatiallyfocused approach,withplanningandimplementationcamedout
        by the provinces, was not considered feasible because the provinces have limited
        autonomy, scarce resources, and are not equipped for planning o f networked
        infrastructure such as a roads; decentralization-focused operations would be better suited
        for this purpose. Pilots could have been triedinthe more advanced provinces, butwould
        have been riskybecausethey would require complex implementation arrangements.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1.      Institutionaland implementationarrangements
The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Morocco. The DRCR, with its regional and provincial
directorates, will be the implementingagency for the project. DRCR i s experienced with Bank-
financed projects, as the last project closed in2001.

Given the emphasis on institutional strengtheningand recognizing the longer time for effective
local participatory planning, the project i s expected to be implemented over a five-year period
(January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009). A mid-term review in March 2007 will evaluate
progress on the basis o f performance indicators. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was
prepared by DRCRbefore project negotiations.

To ensure full compliance with social and environmental requirements, the DRCR will
strengthen its environment and social team capacity to prepare adequate environment and social
action plans, carry out social surveys, and address resettlement issues, including for non-
classified roads, for which the communes are responsible for landacquisition (Annex 10.B).

DPEs will implement the rural roads component with support o f the DREs, as needed. DPEs
will coordinate their activities with all stakeholders involved in the project, and implement the
dissemination program at the provincial level. Selection o f road works and technical standards
will be led by DRCR through the participative process described in B4 above. Annual lists o f
subprojects, selectedfrom the NPRR-2, andto be financed under the project, would be submitted
to the Bank for its prior approval, and include indications o ftheir economic rates o freturn(ERR)
or cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios. The subprojects must be included in the provincial programs
o f priority rural roads (PPRR) approved by the province. This arrangement i s appropriate and
will help the MPWT to mher strengthen the de-concentrated road management functions and
participation o f local authorities. This i s also a step toward empowering communes to manage
their localroadsnetworks.

Specific Agreements will be signed between the DPE and the provinces and/or communes that
have local rural roads included inthe NF'RR-2, with a view to makingcertain that they provide
necessary rights-of-way, contribute to the road's financing, and guarantee their future
maintenance. Works on localrural roadprojects includedinthe NPRR-2 will not be starteduntil
the respective Agreements become effective.

2.      Monitoring and evaluation of results
The DRCR will assume the main responsibility for collecting data on accessibility results and
monitor progress with implementation of the road works.           This will cover the project, the
NPRR2, and any other programs of rural roads financed and/or executed by other entities. The
National Center for Road Study and Research (CNER), an autonomous service under the DRCR,
will be entrustedwith designing and implementating a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system
to be installed inevery province, establishing 2005 baseline values, assisting with the preparation
of the PPRR, reporting on the its implementation, and evaluating the roads' impacts, particularly

                                                                                              8

on improving accessibility. The CNER has expertise in this area, as it i s responsible for
collecting road data, and has a well developed database o f Morocco's road network, including
physical, as well as socioeconomic data. CNER will disseminate M&E information to major
stakeholders on an annual basis. The CNER will work in close collaboration with the DPEs to
set up the monitoring system andto trainthe DPEs inits operations.

3.      Sustainability
The technical, economic, environmental and social analysis carried out for all subprojects o f the
NPRR-2 should ensure that these investmentsare sustainable, The institutional component that
will help monitor and disseminate progress and results, and the identification o f local economic
opportunities, should help ensurethat the benefits stemming from the projects are sustained.

There i s a risk, however, that budgetary allocations for road maintenance may be insufficient,
which would affect the sustainability o fthe overall roadnetwork. A detailed analysis carried out
as part o f project preparation provided a clear picture of the fimding needed under different
maintenance strategies. Overall, the fimding required i s about what the DRCR has received in
recent years. A gradual increase inthe maintenancebudget will be necessary from 2005, leading
to a total increase o f about ten percent by 2011, to cover the incremental maintenance
requirements stemmingfrom the rehabilitation andupgrading o fthe roads listed inthe NPRR-2.

A monitoring indicator will track the allocation o f funding and will flag the need for corrective
action incase o f underfunding. A performance indicator will monitor the condition o f the road
network. For local roads, a similar risk exists. The Specific Agreements that will be signed by
the DPEs and the local authorities will commit the communes to make arrangements to ensure
that the roads are properlymaintained.

4.      Critical risks and possible controversial aspects
Program and projectfinance. The NPRR-2, which the project finances inpart, i s a government
priority, as was its predecessor NPRR-1that will be completed in 2005. The financing plan i s
not yet complete. Detailed analyses carried out during project preparation: (a) validated the
priority assigned to the "-2,            and its social and economic benefits, (b) confirmed the
relevance o f its strategic directions, including the financing planand the vital role that the CFR
will have to mobilize additional resources, and (c) found the technical, environmental and social
procedures adopted for the NPRR-2 to be sound. The positive conclusions of these analyses
should provide comfort to potential cofinanciers and ensure that the program funding's gap will
be satisfactorily resolved.

Ownership by the provinces and communes of the proposed local roads. The potential for
disagreement about road priorities, which may cause failure by some stakeholders to support the
proposed road investments, is always present. However, this risk i s mitigated by the strong
participatory process. The inventory, together with the pre-identified program, and the selection
criteria that were used, will be presented in each province to the local authorities (elected
representatives and officials o fthe provinces and communes) andto the local communities. This
will allow them to effectively participate in the planning process, confirm or change initial
priorities, and make a final selection o f the roads to be included in the provincial programs o f
priority rural roads (PPRR).        In addition, the Specific Agreements will commit the local
governments to provide the right-of-way whenever necessary, contribute to the road's financing,
andguaranteetheir future maintenance.

Execution of project-financed road works. Since most road subprojects will be identified during
implementation, there i s a risk that not enough subprojects are ready for implementation insome

                                                                                                9

years. To mitigate this risk, with financing from a Japan PHRD Grant, some 400 kilometers o f
roads, equivalent to about 2 years o f implementation, will have completed designs as well as
environmental and social assessments, before the Bank loan becomes effective. Supervision
missions will make sure that road subprojects are ready for timely implementation.

Implementation of institutional components.        The magnitude o f the road works under the
Program will demand special attention by the DRCR, andmay eventually delay other parts o f the
project.   To avoid this, the institutional components will be launched at the outset of
implementation.

Benefits from monitoring of improved accessibility. A key benefit o f the monitoring and
dissemination actitivy is the opportunity for other sectors to plan their investments and programs
takinginto account the rural roads programs plans and execution progress. Some o fthe weaker,
less pro-active local authorities and sectoral agencies may be slow in reacting. To mitigate this
risk, the project includes a series o f workshops in all provinces that will sensitize local
authorities to the benefits of building into their operations information on the rural roads
programs.

The above risks, their evaluation and mitigationmeasures are summarized inthe table below.

D.APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1.      Economic analysis
The NPRR-2 program i s a major undertaking requiringsignificant investments. Inview o f this,
a prior analysis was done to assess whether the program o f investments inthe transport sector,
including the investments to be carried out under the NPRR-2, are within acceptable limits. A
review o f overall transport investments, including roads, rail, ports and airports shows annual
investments in the recent past and projected for the next few years to be in the order o f $700
million per year. This represents less than 2.5 percent o f the GDP, which is acceptable. The
NPRR-2 program, at about $80 million per year, would account for slightly over 10 percent o f
the overall transport investment program.

The roadsunder NPRR-2, andthose project-financed, are expected to broadly fall into one o fthe
two following categories: (i) volume roads that will produce benefits not only in alleviating
                                low
isolation, but also in reducing transport costs to the longer-distance traffic they would normally
carry, or (ii) very low traffic roads whose mainbenefits will be their contribution to reducing the
level o f isolation o f rural communities, and connecting them to social sector infrastructure, such
as schools and health centers, and to markets. Correspondingly, to define the proper level o f
investments o f each project road ensuring economic efficiency, two alternative approaches will
beused:
    (a) A cost benefits analysis (CBA) will be done for all roads that already have an established
         traffic, generally over 30 vehicles per day. The investments' economic rate o f return
         (ERR) and net present value will be determined. Roads subject to CBA will need to
         show an ERR o f at least 12 percent. A CBA analysis conducted for the preliminary
         NPRR-2 comprising some 15,000 kilometers o f road works showed that 10,300
         kilometers with a base cost o f $684 million, representing 63 percent o f total program
         cost, had an ERRexceeding 12percent.
    (b) A cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be done for all roads selected on the basis of
         their contribution to accessibility, generally with a daily traffic less than 30 vehicle per
         day. The NPRR-2 program is expected to benefit about 2.9 million people, with an
         average cost o f $365 per person. Normally, the roads with very low traffic serve the
         more isolated populations, and therefore have less density o f population served per
         kilometer o f road. Therefore, reaching those populations, even with the lowest road

                                                                                               11

         design standards that provide all-weather accessibility will require a higher cost per
         person. On this basis, a threshold o f $490 per inhabitant has been agreed with the
         DRCR. An analysis o f the roads not meetingERR criteria showed that 2,040 kilometers
         of roads with a base cost o f $110 million, representing 10 percent o f the program cost
         would be selectedbasedon cost-effectiveness grounds.

According to the preliminary NPRR-2 program, roads invery difficult mountainous topography
or in clay soils, where past experience has shown that earth or gravel roads deteriorate rapidly
and become impassable, which would negate the populations they serve from having a
reasonable level o f accessibility, have been tentatively designed with a thin pavement structure.
These roads have a total lengtho f 2,605 kilometers, and a base cost o f $156 million. The final
design o f these roads will be subject to a rigorous technical and economic analysis to ensure that
the design results in a cost as low as possible. Prior to establishing the final design, the DRCR
will carry out pilot tests, in selected unpaved roads, consisting o f multi-yearcontracts covering
the initial investment inroadrehabilitation and 3-5 years o f routine maintenance. Recent pilots
conducted by the DRCR o f multi-year, comprehensive maintenance contracts have been
successful and suggest that a similar approach could be followed inthe case o f very low volume
roads located indifficult topography or soils.

The overall economic rate o f return for the whole NPRR-2 program i s estimated at 20 percent.
For the ERR to fall to 12 percent, costs would need to be 1.50 times higher, or benefits be 33
percent lower than estimated. The overall Net Present Value (relative to base costs) is US$330
million .

The subprojects identz$ed for the first year to be financed under the Bank loan comprise 12
roads, with a total length o f 185 kilometers anda cost o f $14 million. The overall ERR for these
roads i s 30 percent, and all the roads have an ERR higher than 12 percent. Sensitivity analysis
showed that even with a combined effect o f a 20 percent increase in costs and a 20 percent
decrease in benefits, the economic return would fall to 20 percent, still satisfactory.        The
combined Net Present Value o f the first year program i s $12.3 million. Overall, the first year
investments will provide some 85,000 rural inhabitants with access to all-weather roads.

2.      Technical
DRCR and its regional and provincial directorates have the capacity and experience for
implementing the program as they have already implemented Bank financed projects.
Experience and lessonslearned from the implementation o f the previous highway project and the
NPRR-1will be usedto improve the design o fNPRR-2, especially for usinglocal materials and
labor intensive methods o f works and techniques when appropriate. DRCR has all the needed
guidelines for design, implementation and supervision o f subprojects, with intemational
standards. Appropriate design standards will be used with two objectives: (i)         to meet the
economic thresholds (economic retumor cost-effectiveness), and (ii) reach the highest number
                                                                        to
of population.    Based on the preliminary program, 4,144 km o f roads are expected to be
improved as unpaved roads and 10,884 km mostly with a narrow, 4-meter pavement (including
some 2,000 kilometers whose final surface needs to be defined). Under a grant from the Japan
PHRD Fund, technical and biddingdocuments for 400 kmof the project roads will be prepared,
as well as design guidelines to be applied for the studies o fthe whole program.

DRCRwill monitor all activities executedby the DPEs inadditionto the monitoring done bythe
DRE. Local contractors have the capacity for carrying out the subprojects.               Studies o f
subprojects will include all the environment and mitigation activities and social aspects. Design
of roads will include additional roads connected facilities to improve the living conditions inthe

                                                                                              12

concerned villages (improvement o f marketplaces, construction o f bus stops, etc). The project
has also been designed to helpDRCRbecome more efficient through upgrading its roaddatabase
for monitoring program outputs and outcomes, dissemination o f information on rural roads, and
organization o ftheir maintenance.

3.      Fiduciary
Procurement
An assessment o f the capacity of the DRCR and its provincial and regional directorates (DPE
andDRE)to carry out procurement activities was doneduringproject preparationandwas found
to be satisfactory. The procurement planfor the first two years o f the programwas finalized and
incorporated into the project implementation plan (PIP). The overall procurement risk has been
judged to be low. The national legislation on procurement, with some exceptions, i s generally in
line with the Bank`s Guidelines (Annex 8). Inparticular the following procedures, not provided
inthe national legislation, mustbeapplied underBankfinancing: (a) thetwo-envelope procedure
should not be used for bids for works and goods; (b) quantifiable bid evaluation criteria should
be included inbiddingdocuments and, inthe case o f goods, a points system should not be used;
and (c) open competitive bidding for consultants should not be applied (see CPAR, February
2000). DRCR will be responsible for the consulting services o f the institutional component arid
for monitoring the works' procurement process carried out by the DPEs. Inaccordance with the
Government's deconcentration policy, procurement activities for works will be undertaken by the
DPEs and will follow national competitive (NCB) procedures. Bidding Documents from the
closed Loan 3901 will be adopted, with appropriate modifications to ensure consistency with the
Bank's standarddocumentation. Furthermore, all procurement activities carried out bythe DPEs
willbemonitoredandsuperviseddirectlybyDRCR.

Financial Management
The financial management system for this project was assessed during project preparation, as
requiredby OPBP 10.02. The assessmentwas based on information provided by the MPWT,
the Ministry o f Finance, and the DRCR, and focused on two aspects o f DRCR's financial
management: (a) financial systems, including accounting, intemal and external controls,
planning, budgeting and financial reporting, and (b)financial monitoring, including the format
andcontent ofthe Financial Monitoring Reports (FMR), to be submitted to the Bank, andproject
audit arrangements The financial management arrangements, including financial monitoring,
meet the Bank's minimumfinancial management requirements.

The financial management risks, assessed as "medium low", originate mainly inthe delegation
o f project implementation to the DREs andDPEs. While this approach has merit and will speed
up implementation, it could result in: (a) delays in the submission o f financial management
reports, and (b) a slow-down in loan disbursements, due to additional processing time to
reimbursethe project expenditures pre-financed by the budgetor bythe RoadFund. These risks
will be mitigated by: (a) training o f staff, (b) detailed description in the PIP o f rules and
procedures; and(c) close supervision bythe Bank, especially duringthe first year.

4.      Social
Poverty in Morocco: Nearly, two thirds o f Morocco's poor live in rural areas. Without road
access, the poor are trapped in their geographic enclaves, unable to access social and
administrative services (schools, health centers, communes' offices) or to realize their economic
potential (no means o f marketingtheir goods or no choices in the goods they could buy). The
isolationo fthe rural poor i s accentuatedbythe topography o fthe country where highmountains,
deep rocky gorges and desert dunes serve as insurmountable physical barriers. The Rural Roads

                                                                                            13

project i s designed to link poor and isolated inhabitants o f these rural areas to social and
administrative services and markets in order to alleviate poverty. (See Annex 15). Reducing
isolation o fthe poor population may also have an effect inslowing down the strong trend inrural
to urbanmigration fueled bythe increase and deepening o fpoverty inrural areas.

A beneficiary survey conducted as part of the preparation o f the ICR for the preceding road
project, confirmed results o f earlier surveys and studies in Morocco, and showed that the
construction o f rural roads had severalpositive social impacts, including: (a) improved access to
schools and health centers, due to reduced time required to reach them and to new facilities
constructed along the roads; (b) improved quality and choice o f transport services; (c) improved
access to and choice ofbasic goods and foodstuffs, often accompanied with a drop inprices; and
(d) decreased operating costs o f vehicles resultingin lower transport costs for passengers and
freight.

Participation and the Rural Roads Project: The provincial and local authorities will review the
draft provincial priority programs o f rural roads (PPRR) prepared by the DRCR and then
collectively approve them and propose any amendments they deem necessary. Building on
political and social organization in Morocco, participation will be at two levels: (i)     level o f
elected representatives for the rural roads planningprocess and (ii)      community level for local
initiatives. Annex 15 describes the political and administrative organization o f Morocco and the
participatory mechanisms.

Institutional Arrangementsfor integrating Social Development in the DRCR 's work: Roadshave
a socioeconomic dimension that needs to be explicitly taken into consideration to make the
infrastructure works effective in bringing about sustainable development. Inrecent years, the
DRCR has been moving in this direction, launching a sample analysis o f the impact o f its road
projects. The DRCR i s interested in strengtheningthis activity in order to better assess impact
on the local population, evaluate the effectiveness o f its interventions and contribute to their
integration with other sectors working on rural development. The DRCR, thus, would bring
added value to the communities it serves for a concerted effort to reduce poverty. The project
will help the DRCR improve capacity for addressing social issues by strengthening its
Environment and Social Development unit. The project will focus on the following social
development activities: (i)  better integrate communities in the planning and implementation o f
infrastructure works designed to enhance the quality o f life o f rural residents (ii)
                                                                                    better measure,
monitor and document socioeconomic impacts o f roads, and (iii)         promote activities for local
economic development. The DRCR will assign a qualified member o f its staff, one who has had
extensive field experience, especially working directly with communities to oversee the above
activities. Furthermore, local offices o f the DREiDPE will also designate staff who will be
responsible for integrating social development inroadworks.

The project will not entail resettlement of population: The roads to be executed under the
proposed project are on existing right o f ways and there will not be significant changes inroad
characteristics such as width or alignment. Therefore, the project will not entail resettlement o f
population. Minor land expropriation would be required and excavation works will be limited.
Becauseproject-financed roadworks may involve landacquisition, OP 4.12 is triggered. To this
end, the DRCR has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework, since the exact locations o f the
landacquisition will only be determined as the rural road subprojects are identified.

5.       Environment
Environmental considerations will be an integral part of the design, implementation and
operation and maintenance o f rural roads. An operational manual on environmental procedures,

                                                                                              14

including a framework environmental management plan, has been prepared.                                             The manual
establishes the process and institutional requirements for environmental management during the
various project stages.            It ensures that roads are subjected to an adequate environmental
assessment, that they do not create any serious impacts on the local environment, and that
appropriate mitigationmeasuresare integrated into designs.

Although environmental risks are relatively minor for rural roads financed under the project,
environmental monitoring will be part o f the construction supervision activities to ensure the
application o f required mitigation measures.                      Monitoring of environmental impacts during
operation will be undertaken by the DPE/DREs and the communes under DRCR's supervision.
The environmental specialist at DRCR's safeguardunit will ensure that monitoring activities are
being properly implemented. The Bank will receive regular reports from DRCR on the progress
o f the project, including progress achieved regarding the development o f environmental
managementplan for ruralroads and status o fimplementation.

Duringproject preparation, environmental and social screening was conducted as perthe Bank's

environment and, "Category S2" regarding the social aspects .The screening indicated that there
Operational Policy 4.01, Annex C, and the project has been classified as "Category B" regarding

are reversible environmental issues that can be mitigated. The safeguard policies on
environmental Assessment and Involuntary resettlement would apply to the first component,
road rehabilitation and/or upgrading. Since the individual rural roads will be identified only
duringproject implementation, a framework approach was adopted for managing environmental
and social impacts.

7.      PolicyExceptions andReadiness

No policy exemptions are required. The project meets Regional criteria for project readiness.
The selected sub-projects to be implemented during the project's first-year comply with
necessary requirements (technical, economic, environmental and social), and are ready for
implementation.

Economy and Poverty

1.      Morocco's populationi s about 30 million, o fwhich close to 50 percent live inrural areas.
Per capita income, about US$1,200, grew at a modest 1.3 ercent per year during 1992-02,
although growth inthe last two years was substantially higher. P

2.       According to the most recent counts (1998/1999), about 19 percent, equivalent to 5.3
million people, o f Morocco's population are estimated to be below the poverty line, and 44
percent, equivalent to 12 million, are considered "economically vulnerable" (at or below 50
percent o fthe poverty line).

3.      Poverty is mainly rural: almost one Moroccan out o f four i s poor inrural areas compared
to one out o f ten in urban areas. Overall, 66 percent o f the poor live in rural areas. The rural-
urban gap is especially big for the extreme and very poor: 3.0 million rural people fall inthis
category, compared to 0.7 million for the urbanpopulation.

4.       The rural poor:
         - livemostlyinCenterandNorthwestregions;
         - liveinlargehouseholds,withfewworkingmembers;
         - haveanilliteracyrateof67percent,comparedto34percentinurbanareas;and
         - livedisproportionally inisolatedareas,andmorethanhalfthevillagesdonothave
            access to all weather roads.

5.       There are enormous differences among provinces inthe level o f per capita income. The
government aims at helpingthe poorest regions by improving rural populations' access to basic
infrastructure and social services.

Decentralization and the Role of Local Governments4

6.       For administrative purposes, Morocco i s divided into three sub-national territorial levels:
Regions (16), Provinces and Prefectures (45 and 26, respectively), and Communes (249 urban
and 1,298 rural). The Regions, Provinces andPrefectures are under the authority of a Governor,
while the Communes are under a CommunePresident.

7.       While delegation o f responsibilities to local governments through decentralization i s a
government objective, the transfer processhas been hamperedby the scarcity o f local resources.
Locally generated revenues are few, and government transfers to local governments have been
limited. As shown below, expensesbythe localgovernments account for less than 15percent of
central government expenditures.

8.     The rural communes, that would have a direct interest and responsibility in the
management o f their local rural roads, with a few exceptions, have limited budgets. A study
under the project will look into possible financing options, as well as management models that
couldbe applied to the localruralroads.

Transport Sector
9.     Morocco's transport system comprises 57,226 kilometers o f classified roads, a railway
network o f about 1,900 kilometers, 11 commercial ports and 20 airports handling scheduled
commercial services.

10.    Road transport is the dominant mode and accounts for at least 90 percent o f inter-city
passenger traffic and more than three quarters o f freight traffic (excluding the transport o f
phosphates, carried by rail). While operated by private companies, road transport untilrecently
was strongly regulated, and many constraints to competition existed. A transport law that
became effective inMarch 2003 (the law was approved inMarch 2000 but included a three-year
period until effective), liberalized the transport market. The law granted an extra three years
beyond effectiveness to current operators to meet professional qualification standards. One
consequence o f the law i s that small trucks that were traditionally limited to own-account
transport can now provide for-hire services without restrictions. This change should bring about
important improvement in the provision o f road transport services for villages and rural areas,
where the size o f shipment and road condition favor the use of small trucks.           Another
consequencei s that large trucking companies are now allowed to do transport without requiring
prior approval by the government's National Transport Office (NTO); only post-notification i s
now required.

Highways
Organization
11.    The Directorate o f Roads and RoadTraffic (DRCR) o f the Ministry o fPublic Works and
Transport (MPWT) i s responsible for the management o f Morocco's road system, comprising
national, regional and provincial roads. The DRCR i s a well established agency, endowed with
capable personnel, and well experienced in Bank-financed projects. It is organized into the
following divisions: Planning, Studies and New Construction, Bridges, Maintenance and Road
Safety, Programming and Finance, Human Resources, and the National Center for Road Study
and Research(CNER)'.

12.    DRCR operations are partially deconcentrated through the 16 regional and 29 provincial
offices o f the MPWT. The number o f regional offices has gradually increased over the last
decade, from four pilot offices inthe mid-1990s to 16 offices today. The DRCR has delegated
several technical review hnctions to the regional offices, including maintenance programming,
reviewo fstudies, and technical support for works supervision. The ninemost important regional
directorates are equipped with a Regional Center o f Technical Studies (CERET) and a Planning
andEconomic Studies Service (SPEE), inadditionto administrative support. These two services

are key parts o f the delegation process. The process o f delegation i s ongoing and the DRCR
expects to continue transferringtechnical and economic functions to the regionaloffices.

TheRoad Network
14.    Morocco's classified roadnetwork comprises 57,226 kilometers, o f which 44 percent are
paved and 56 are unpaved. The density o f the road network is low, less than 100 kilometers o f
roads for 1,000 square kilometers, and only 2.3 kilometers for 1,000 kilometers. In addition,
many o fthe roads are oftencut 30 or 60 daysper year dueto severeweather conditions.
                    Table 1.3 Morocco's Classified Road Network, December 2003




15.    The high percentage o f unpaved roads (56 percent) is an indicator o f the relative low
quality o f the classified roadnetwork. At the same time, paved roads are generally quite narrow,
with 45 percent of the classifiedpavednetwork being less than4.5 meters wide, which is barely
morethan the equivalent o f a standard lane width (3.5 meters).

1      Road System Ownership.           The classified road network i s owned by the central
government. Inthe past, there were attempts to transfer a substantial part o fthe provincial roads
to the communes. However, the attempts were not successful because: (a) the roads to be
transferred were in poor condition, and communes would have needed to rehabilitate many o f
them, for which they had no resources, and (b) the general weak condition o f the provincial and
communal finances. Upgradingo f the rural roads under the First (underway) and the Second (to
be financed by the project) National Programs of Rural Roads should facilitate transfer to local
governments bythe time the project i s completed around 2010.

17.    Road Condition. The condition o f the road network has gradually improved over the last
years.  The proportion o f roads in bad condition decreased, while the proportion in good
conditionrose. As indicated inthe Table 1.5 below.

Utilizationof the RoadSystem

18.     Utilization o f the classified road system almost doubled during the 10-year period since
1991, growing fi-om 27.7 million vehicle-kilometer per day to a corresponding 46.1 million.
About two thirds o f this traffic uses the national roads and the motonvays, while the remaining
thirduses the regional andthe provincialhighways..

RoadMaintenance:Managementand Funding
Management
19.     At present, 100 percent of road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance is carried out by
contractors, as is about 50 percent o f routine maintenance. Some routine maintenance activities,
especially in remote areas, are difficult to outsource since the small size o f the routine
maintenance works and the highcost o f access makes them little attractive for contractors. At
the same time, recurrent floods and other emergencies require quick road repairs for which,
especially inthe case o f unpaved roads, i s difficult to find contractors that are interested or can
respondrapidly.

20.     Over the last 3-4 years, the DRCR launched three pilots to test multiyear contracts for
routine road maintenance. These contracts are more attractive for private enterprises, while at
the same time should lead to better quality and lower cost o f maintenance operations. The first
pilot was a two-year contract covering two provinces (Meknes and Tetouan). The contract was
input-based (quantity o f work done). This pilot was considered unsatisfactory becauseo f lack o f
performance targets and because unit prices were substantially higher than by force account.
The second pilot was a three-year contract covering a national road. Contract penalties were
based on several performance parameters. Prices were slightly higher than force account. This
pilot was considered a qualified success. The thirdpilot, also a three-year contract, also focused
on a national road. This contract, also performance-based,used several indicators integrated into
one single indicator of performance, on which penalties were based. This pilot was considered
successful: the quality o f work was good, and unit prices were comparable to those by force
account.

21.     The successfblthirdpilot shouldprovide a goodbasis for anextension o fthis approachto
a larger number of roads. The performance-based multiyear contracts may be a way to W h e r
expand outsourcing o f routine maintenance in the future, since it i s likely that more highway
maintenance enterpriseswould be interested inbiddingfor these biggercontracts.

Funding
22.     Road maintenance funding is received from two sources: (i)Road Fund (the "Fonds
                                                                          a
Special Routier", FSR) and (ii)     the national budget. The FSR was established in 1989, and i s
fed by a number of road user charges, notable: taxes on gasoline, vehicle registration fee and
axle-load tax for freight vehicles. Since its creation, the FSR has been revised several times,
mainly to expand its resources. In 2004, a new law created a financially-autonomous entity
called Caissepour le Financement Routier (CFR). The Caisse is allowed to borrow for rural
roads and service the loans with resources from the FSR.             This change would allow to
significantly increasethe resources available for financing ruralroadprograms.

23.     When originally set up, the FSR was intendedonly to finance maintenance o f the whole
classified roadnetwork. However, inorder to securethe necessary financing for the execution o f
the national rural roads programs launched in 1995 the government at that time expanded the
FSRresources. The expansion was achievedby increasing the surcharge on gasoline and diesel,
                                                                                               19

from MAD 18 and MAD 10 per liter, to MAD 41 and MAD 23.5 respectively.6 While in 1994
FSR revenues were inthe order of MAD 600 million, with the new resources the FSR collects
about MAD 1,200 million annually. The FSR funds are usedmainly to finance maintenance and
construction o f rural roads. The revenues o f the FSR are mainly from the taxes on gasoline
(MAD 840 million inthe fiscal year 1999/2000), on vehicle registration (MAD 108million the
same year) and on taxes by axle charge (MAD 192millionthe same year).

25.      Besides the budget and the Road Fund, funding for roads i s also provided by tolls
collection on expressways of the Socikte` des Autoroutes du Maroc and by local communities
through partnerships with the DRCR inthe construction or improvement o frural roads. In2002,
toll revenuesamounted to some MAD550 million.

26.      Roadmaintenance expenditures since 1995 are shown in Table 1.8. The overall level o f
fundingfor roadmaintenance is considered adequate. A large proportion of the funding went to
road rehabilitation because important roads in poor condition needed to be put in working
conditions. Inthe future, the needs for rehabilitation should decrease, with a higher proportion
going to finance periodic maintenance, that is, resurfacing o fpaved roads.

 RuralRoads

 27.     Morocco's rural roads perform two key roles: (a) to be an integral part o f the national
 road system, ensuring connectivity o f the network; and (b) to provide the rural population
 accessibility to local andregional markets and services.
 Rural Road Accessibility
 28.     Accessibility to rural roads in Morocco i s low, since only 44 percent of the country's
 rural population have access to an all weather rural road. Population counted as having rural
 access are those who live invillages (douars) o f at least 50 households, and are locatednot more
 than 1 kilometer away from an all weather road. This definition was arrived at following
 sensitivity analysis, which showed that providing rural access to highly dispersed populations
 was unaffordable.

 29.     Similarly as with per capita income, there are also large differentials among provinces in
 the population's rural road accessibility, ranging from about 75 percent for the better-served
 provinces to about 20 percent for the more isolated provinces. More details are in table 1.9
 below.




                                                                                                     21

30.     Rural road accessibility inMorocco i s made especially difficult by two factors: frequent
floods, which cut roads to traffic for hours or days at a time, and severe mountainous
topography.

31.     The road accessibility problem can take different forms.            Isolated rural households
normally do not have a decent road connection to even the closest village, impedingtheir access
to markets, jobs and services. Conversely, a rural household may be well linked to the closest
village, but the village may itself be isolated andpoorly linked to main roads connecting to cities
or other urban centers. A rural road may be passable some days, but not others, dependingon
weather conditions, type o froad surface, and quality o fmaintenance. Distance from a household
to the closest road may be difficult to interpret, since topography, water crossings, climate and
other factors may significantly distort the meaning o f such distance. Or, a road may be passable
by one type of vehicle, for example, a four-wheel drive and a motorcycle, but not by a car or a
truck.

Rural Roads Programs

TheFirst National Programfor Rural Roads (NPRR-I)
32.     In 1995, the DRCR launched a priority ten-year program for the development of the
Morocco's rural roads. The program covered some 11,000 kilometers, o f which about 5,000 to
be surfaced with bitumen, and 6,000 kilometers to be left with improved gravel surface. The
criteria for defining priorities included economic efficiency (return on the investments), degree
o f accessibility o f the areas servedby the road, the importance o f the road in serving social and
administrative centers, andthe agricultural potentialo fthe road's area o f influence.

33.     Through the first trimester o f 2004, about 72 percent o f the program had been completed
andopento traffic. DetailsareinTable 1.10 below.

Impact of the rural roads.

35.     Several studies and surveys have analyzed the socioeconomic impact o f rural roads in
Morocco, and have shown significant benefits.
        - AstudybytheWorldBank's OperationsEvaluationDepartmentin19968foundthat
            the improved roads generated substantial positive impacts on: transport (such as
            reduced transportation costs and lower and better access to markets and services),
            agriculture (increased yields, production shift to higher value commodities); health
            (increased visits to clinics, better quality o f services); education (increased
            enrollment, easier recruitment andretentiono f teachers); and, gender (girls increasing
            school enrollment more than boys, women benefiting from economic transformation

                              Annex 4: Detailed Project Description
                             MOROCCO: RURALROADSPROJECT

1.       The project comprises road investment, consisting o f a slice o f the Second National
Program of Rural Roads ("RR-2),         and institutional support, aimed to enhance the benefits and
impact o fthe physical investments.

The NPRR-2 Program

2.       This program, which the project supports, follows the NPRR-1, launched in 1995 with a
target o f some 11,000 km o froads to be rehabilitated or upgraded. The NPRR-2' main aim i s to
increase the level o f accessibility o f the rural population to all-weather roads to 80 percent by
2015. This program, that covers 15,000 kilometers, to be launched in2005, will differ inthree
major ways from Phase I.It will: (a) focus on outcome, that is, the population that will be
providedwith rural access, rather thanonkilometers, (b) proceed at a faster pace; and(c) include
a stronger participatory process. This program will also improve the integration o f rural roads
with other rural infrastructure projects. The outcome approach, which matches the Bank's
interest inresults, is possible thanks to field and methodological work carried out by Morocco's
Directorate o f Roads (DRCR). The approach also benefits from efforts to measure accessibility
usingindicators developed under Loan3901.

3.       To prepare the program, the DRCR carried out, in 2002, an inventory o f rural roads
throughout the country. The inventory was aimed at assessing the level o f accessibility o f the
ruralpopulationand covered 48,200 kmo froads andtracks, o fwhich 24,685 kminthe classified
road network (national, regional and provincial roads).          In total 39,650 km of roads were
inspected and entered in a database, which includes technical as well as socioeconomic data for
each road, while 8,559 km o f roads were not accessible during the inventory. The vehicle
passability of the roads inspected was as follows: 19% impassable by any kind o f vehicle
because o f their poor condition; 28% passable by four-wheel drive cars or trucks; 53% can be
used by any type o f vehicle. Some 19 percent of these are closed at least for 30 days a year
duringthe rainy season.

4.       The rural road inventory was the basis for the preparation o f draft Program o f Priority
Rural Roads (PPRR) in each province. The roads in this program were selected on the basis of
two analyses: (a) the first, at the national and provincial level, was the contribution to improving
accessibility, with priority given to the roads serving the most people and to those that reduced
the difference in accessibility between the most and the least accessible provinces, and (b) the
second considered the connectivity o f the classified road network. The preliminary programs o f

(elected and officials o f the provinces and communes) and to the representatives of the local
communities to involve them inthe planningprocess, confirm the initial priorities, and make the
final selection of the roads to be included in the provincial PPRR. The consolidation o f the
PPRRs at the national level will constitute the NPRR-2. The regional and provincial directorates
o f the MPWT are very active in this participatory planning process, and assist the rural
communes on technical aspects. At the time o f project appraisal, the draft PPRR were being
reviewed by the respective provincial authorities.

5.       The directorates o f the MPWT are responsible for the implementation o f the PPRR,
budgeting, maintenance, and institutional aspects for local roads classification.                 The
responsibilities o f the provinces in the context o f the PPRR, the allocation o f funding and
assuring the financing o f the maintenance o f the rural roads to remain under provincial

government or communes' responsibility are formalized through Specific ProvincialAgreements
signed between the MPWT and the provincial government and its communes. The PPRR will
play a key role in integration with other sectors and activities inthe same province. The PPRR
will serve as a basis for consultation with provincial and local authorities, and other sectors
planninginfrastructure investments inthe same area. Also, the status o f implementation o f the
PPRRs will be updated periodically, and information made available to other sectors such as
ruralwater supply, facilitatingtheir own decisions on investments andservices.

6.      A preliminary program of NPRR-2 preparedby the DRCR, presently is being reviewed
by the Provinces. It consists o f about 15,000 kilometers: 515 km of national roads, 606 km o f
regional roads, 8,842 km o f provincial roads and 5,065 km o f non-classified roads. This
preliminary program comprises: (a) about 1,800 km of roads extending the classified roads
rehabilitated under the NPRR-1, completing and improving the classified road network; (b)
2,240 kmo f tracks classified as national or regionalroads structuring the main roadnetwork and
unlocking large areas; (c) 5,160 km o f classified roads to unlock rural population and connect
non-classified roads and tracks; (d) 1,077 km o f roads for the less accessible provinces
(Chefchaouen, Tetouan, El-Hoceima); and (e) 4,723 km o f roads with high impact on
accessibility.

7.      Overall, the lengthof the road network under the DRCR i s not expected to vary once the
NPRR-1 and NPRR-2 are completed, although some sections may be transferred to local
governments while others may be incorporated under the DRCR classified network (national,
regional andprovincialroads)."

8.      Apreliminary program by province and tentative list o fpriorities was discussedby Bank
missions andthe DRCRmanagement. However, since the preliminary program i s still subject to
final discussions with the provincialandlocal authorities, itwas agreednot to includedetails o f
the program byprovince or region inthe PAD.

9.      Program Cost. The cost of this preliminaryprogram o fthe NPRR-2 i s estimated at about
MAD9,865 billion(US$1,065 million), as shownintheAnnex 4.A.

10.     Economic tests. The selection o f roads to be part o f the program and the project andthe
definition o f priorities will be done considering : (i)    the economic rate o f return (ERR) for roads
with a traffic generally higher than 30 vehicles per day; and (ii) cost effectiveness indicator
                                                                             a
(CEI) for roads with traffic generally lower than 30 vehicles per day. The objective o f the CEI
indicator being to select roads with high population served per investment. It i s expected that
some 2.9 millionpeople will enjoy improved accessibility at completion o fthe NPRR-2.

11.     Design standards. The roads to be improved will have standards allowing all-weather
operation, with: (a) for local roads, a six-meter platform, and a four-meter width for the traffic
surface (graveling with asphalt or selected material without bituminous product, depending on
the local conditions of traffic, soil, topography, material available for construction, cost, IRR,
etc) ;and a reference traffic speed of 40 kmper hour; and (b) for national, regional or provincial
roads, 6 m o f pavement and two shoulders o f 1 m each. Appropriate local materials and labor
intensive methods of works will be used when appropriate. Environmentalmitigation activities
will be implemented as recommended by the environmental impact study.                        Works will be


lo  In 2002, the classified road network (national, regional and provincial roads) comprises 57,500 kilometers
    (32,000 paved and 25,500 unpaved), o f which about 65 percent are all-weather roads. By 2015 (when the
    NPRR-2 will be completed)(when the percentage of all weather roads will have increased to provide an overall
    ruralroad accessibility of 80 percent t

executed by contractors under the supervision o f consulting firms and o f the provincial
directorates andpublic works laboratories.

The Project

12.      To support the NPRR-2program, the proposed Project consists o ftwo components:

            Road rehabilitation and upgrading:about 625 kmof rural roads, selectedamong the
            priority roads o f the WRR-2 (US$ 41.98 million o f which US$35.53 million
            financed by the Bank), including design and supervision services (US$1.02 million,
            o fwhich US$0.72 millionfinanced by the Bank).

            Institutional support: consulting services (US$1.36 million, o f which US$0.96
            million Bank-financed) to carry out the following:
            - develop monitoring and evaluation of the achievement of targets (impact on
                accessibility) and o f NPRR-2 implementation (including other roads improved
                outside this program) at the provincial and communal level; disseminate regular
                progress reports describing implementation progress and impact on improving
                accessibility. This activity should facilitate sectoral integration and strengthen
                participation by the local governments and communities;
            - identifylocal economic opportunities stemming fromthe enhancedaccessibility
                (to be carried out by the DPEs, with assistance o f specialized agencies such as
                the Social Development Agency (SDA), and help the local communities
                materialize the opportunities;
            - develop specific recommendations tohelptheprovinces andcommunesprepare
                to eventually take over responsibilityfor the management o fthe localrural roads;
                 and
            - strengthentheDRCRcapabilitiesforsocialandenvironmental assessments.

Road rehabilitation and upgrading
13.      The project would ensure that all roads to be improved under the NPRR-2 program,
whether Bank-financed or not, would contribute to improving accessinan economically efficient
manner (see Annex 9), have acceptable design standards, and meet environmental, resettlement
andsocial assessment, fiduciary andprocurement requirements.

14.      The project would also finance, as part o f the selected eligible rural road projects, small
complementary infrastructure invillages that would be identifiedthrough aparticipatory process.
Complementary infrastructure can be built with limited additional cost during road construction
that will add value to the road investments. Many o f the areas where the roads are built lack
proper market facilities, accessibility features for disabled persons and the old, recreational
facilities for youth (e.g. football fields), sidewalks, poorly designed public areas such as water
fountains (adding a stand for placingbuckets, stone benches and shade for those waiting). These
are investments that can be done in partnership with local communities both in terms o f
identifyingpriorities and infinancing.

15.      Among those subprojects selected under the NPRR-2 and meeting economic criteria,
additional eligibility criteria for project financing will be roads inpoor areas, and, ifpossible, in
areas where they can support other social or economic activities, like the parallel rural water
project beingprocessed as a CAS priority (nine o f the provinces are in the Atlantic regions : El

Institutional support
Monitoring and evaluation of rural roadsprograms, and dissemination and outreach
16.     The Monitoring and Evaluation activity will be broad-based and will cover the universe
o f rural roads works being carried out in a province. This will include the NPRR-2 as well as
any other rural roadsprojects financed andlor executedfrom other sources such as the communes
themselves, NGOs, or other financiers.

17.     The main output o f this subcomponent will be the preparation o f annual reports, by
province (for all 45 provinces), detailing the progress with the implementation o f road works
from all sources, including kilometers completed and open to traffic, design standards, exact
location, number o f people that have gained road access, a qualitative assessment o f the impact
o fimprovedaccessibility, and an analysis o f social impacts. (see below). To the extent possible,
these reports should include an analysis o f the impact on poverty and links with poverty maps
expected to be available by end 2004. These annual reports will be essential inputs for the
DRCR annual report on rural roads programs and progress in improving rural population's
accessibility to all weather roads.

18.     The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) function will be carried out by CNER, which is
well qualified for this task. CNER hastaken a leading role inthe roadsurveys andthe analysis of
data necessary for the assessment o frural roadaccessibility. The initial task will be to update (to
2004/05) and validate the existing CNER country-wide roads inventory and database, including
NPRR-1 and works on other roads included in the inventory. This would include all major
physical, traffic, accessibility and socioeconomic data, as well as preparation o f provincial maps
reflectingthe inventory.

19.     The implementation of this subcomponent will require the CNER to allocate staff or
recruit consultants (over the five-year duration o f the project), to visit all provinces at least once
a year as well as appoint a project manager located at headquarters to process information and
prepare the annual provincial reports.

20.     Dissemination and Outreach. The purpose o f dissemination and outreach will be to
ensure that beneficiaries o f these programs are well informed on the progress o f planned rural
roads works. O f particular importance will be to help other sectors benefiting from improved
access, such as health and education, to adjust their plans and services delivery to the higher
accessibility level. Since the monitoring and evaluation and the dissemination activities are
closely related, both activities will be carried out by the CNER, who will work closely with the
DPEs andDREs.

21.     This activity will consist o f disseminating informationcontained inannual reports on the
progress with NPRR-2 and other programs. Dissemination would be done through seminars,
workshops, and other means. Some dissemination methods could be tested through pilots, for
example, use o fportals. Dissemination activities would bereported annually.

Identification of local economic opportunities.
22.     This activity will identify local economic opportunities that result from the improved
roads and all-weather accessibility.       New rural business would be geared to individual
entrepreneurs or micro-enterprises. The activity would provide training, quality enhancement
and marketingof local products, promote `rustic' or eco-tourism, etc. Specific efforts will be
                                                                                                 31

made to ensure that women are among the beneficiaries. (A similar experience in the Second
RuralRoadsproject inPeruhasbeenhighly successful).

Study on the Management of Local Rural Roads
23.     The purpose o f the study would be to review the current management o f local rural
roads, develop possible financial and maintenance management models, make recommendations
regarding application o f the models, and identify and prepare more detailed information as well
as tools for pilot communes that would be candidates for taking ownership o f their local rural
roads. The study will cover engineering aspects (such as inventory o f road assets, establishment
o f a GIS system, road condition assessment), financial aspects (sources o f funds, level o f funding
required and available for proper roadmaintenance), andmaintenance managementmodels. The
management models would include, among others: commune's agreement with DPE; multiyear
contracts with private companies for comprehensive maintenance o f a package o f roads;
multiyear comprehensive maintenance, including rehabilitation, under single contract; options
above for individual communes or several communes together; force account inisolated areas or
emergency situations. The assessment o fthe level o f fimdingrequired for proper maintenance o f
the municipal road network will be a useful input for the central and regional authorities to
determine allocation o fresourcesto the communes.

24.     The study would cover all the communes inthree or four sample provinces. Provinces to
be selected are expected to represent a variety of conditions such as rich and poor, flat and
mountainous terrain, large and small municipal roadnetworks, agricultural and desertic All local
rural roads in each province would be considered, although special attention would be given to
roads improved under "-1,         special programs such as the drought programs or carried out
under the Municipal Fund (Fonds d'Equipement des Communes FEC), and roads selected for
inclusionunder the NPRR-2.

25.     In view of the government interest in testing through pilots the classification of rural
Toads by the communes that are better positioned to take over maintenance o f the local rural
roads, the study would find practical ways o f doing this. To this end, for communes expressing
interest in being selected as pilots, the study would carry out more detailed analysis o f
maintenance costs o f the communes' local rural roads, and would prepare the necessary
documentation that would be used if the management and financial models selected were put in
practice.

Strengthening capacitiesfor social and environmental assessmentand impact studies
26.     Trainingfor Social and Environmental Assessment: A training program will be prepared
and implemented to strengthen DRCR's capacity (including headquarters staff as well as
regional and provincial staff) to carry out social and environmental assessment o f road
investments.

27.     Socioeconomic impacts of rural roads.        This will include, for a sample o f roads
completed in the first two years, surveys and data collection to assess impact, such as on
improved use and delivery of social services. The monitoring o f impact will be limitedto these
roads because o f the time lag from completion of the works until changes in behavior, and
therefore impact, takes place. Developing socioeconomic indicators, data collection, beneficiary
assessments, specialized studies (gender and roads, disability issues and traffic accidents etc.)
will allow DRCR to better coordinate its efforts with other sectors (education, health, donors
etc). This activity will ensure that baseline socioeconomic data are collected prior to start o f the
road improvement works. As impact o fthe improvedroads on the quality o ftransport services is
one o f the project's performance indicators, this component will include finalizing the design o f

                                                                                                32

indicator (establish levels for each o f the three quality components: frequency of service, type of
vehiclehervice, passenger rates), identifying sample roads and taking baseline measures where
indicator will be measured, and taking measures one and two years after the sample roads are
open to services. All activities related to socioeconomic impacts of rural roads will be integrated
into CNER's work.

                       Annex 4.B: ProjectDescription -Technical Aspects


1.      Visit of several roads improvedunder the NPRR-1, carried out duringpreparation of the
project, showed that the design and implementation o f works were generally satisfactory.
However, use o f more appropriate standards would reduce the cost of road pavement structure
ando f roadwidth. Equally, drainage andsafety couldbe improved.

2.      Traffic on the improved roads i s very low (less than 50 cars a day and most o f the roads
program have less than 10 cars a day, with only few trucks, generally not heavy). Recent studies
carried out by the CNER show that the traffic class T4 (less than250 vehicles per day) comprises
94 percent o f light vehicles, four percent o f small trucks (less than 3.5 tons) and two percent o f
buses. Design o f the pavement structure was based on DRCR guidelines and standards on the
basis of T4 with 22,000 passages o f 13-ton equivalent axle, during the life o f the pavement.
Materials are mostly crushed stones as base layer, bituminous graveling andmechanizedmeano f
work execution. The cost o f the pavement structure i s highandrepresents an important part (50
to 80 percent) o fthe subproject cost. However, drainage, which is important for all-weather use
o froad and for protecting the road from erosion was sometimes not sufficient.

3.      DRCR technical standards were designed for national, regional or provincial roads with a
reference truck o f more than 8 tons and an axle charge o f 13 tons. Since actual traffic on the
roads improved is very low and only small trucks use the rural roads, it i s important that inthe
design of new subprojects, especially for the NPRR-2, traffic studies should be carried out
carefully. These studies should provide the basis for road standards and design, with new
reference trucks andaxles, allowing a phasedimprovement o f the road as traffic increases, and
yielding savings in construction costs. Highway design engineers should be aware that the
road's objective i s all-weather accessibility, not comfort.

4.      The use o f localnatural materials and appropriate structures would be less expensive than
the use o f crushed stones. This would also generate more employment. Bituminous graveling
should be limitedto roads with hightraffic. Since the cost o f the pavement structure represents a
large part o f the road cost (an average o f about 65% o f the total cost), its design, choice o f
materials (and source location) and techniques o f execution should be reviewed carefully. The
most cost-effective structure should be selected.

5.      Drainage, especially in mountainous areas where erosion i s dangerous for road
accessibility and durability, should be given especial attention in project design and
implementation. Adequate drainage i s essential for ensuring all-weather accessibility o f aroad.

6.      Traffic signs and road safety equipment should be part o f the project design and
implementedwith special attention to localpractices. Training onroad safety andinformationof
the users should be carried out by the DPEandcommunes on completiono fthe roadworks.

7.      As subprojects should meet ERR or CEA benchmarks, and since the expected traffic
levels are low and the population is frequently dispersed, selecting the appropriate technical
solution for road improvement i s crucial. The solution should be based on the current situation
o f the road, traffic (level as well as composition), population, geography, weather, soil,
availability o fmaterials.




                                                                                              36

8.      Different solutions, ordered fiom lowest to highest standards, are shown below as
examples, the first three solutions beingthe minimumwhich couldbe implemented:
        (a) improving the existing platform with appropriate drainage to make it all weather
            accessible;
        (b) solution (a) ifnecessary, plusimprovingsafety;
        (c) solution (a) if necessary, plus improving the most difficult parts of the existing road
            by better drainage, appropriate longitudinal profile, and choice of good digging
            materials for surface;
        (d) surface graveling with appropriate naturalmaterial (10 cm for example);
        (e) platformimprovement and surface graveling;
        (f) addition to the platform o f 15 to 20 cm o fnatural material as base and surface;
        (g) addition to the platform of sub-base (with natural materials) and basehrface (with
            natural materials if possible, or if not on crushed stones) with the minimumallowed
            by aprogressive improvement;
        (h) solution (g) using stone crushed and addition of surface treatment with bituminous
            graveling (pavement).

9.      Onthe basis o fproposals made by the DPEs, two types o f solutions are considered:
        (a) First type: rehabilitation o f eartwgravel roadsto make them all-weather, with addition
            sometimes o f a thin layer in special situations (clay soils). Average cost 330,0000
            M A D h (cost varying between 250,000 and 500,000 M A D h , depending on the
            topography, geology, rainfall, traffic, etc)
        (b) Second type: paved roads, with a pavement of bituminous graveling (mainly to
            protect against erosion), utilizing different, optimal pavement structures, with layers
            o fnatural materials, or exceptionally crushed stones. Average cost 667,000 M A D h
            (cost varying between 320,000 and 1,200,000 M A D h , depending on topography,
            geology, rainfall, traffic, etc).

10.     Other solutions could be used and it i s important that geo-technical studies and design
and execution o f pavement be carried out carehlly to find the most appropriate solutions
technically andeconomically, under limitedbudgets.

11.     Close cooperation with consulting firms, laboratories and contractors should be
established for the use o f local natural materials and labor intensive techniques when appropriate.
The experimentation on labor-intensive techniques carried out under the NPRR-1 was
insufficient.

12.     The local communities would be made aware of road maintenance needs, technical and
financial, o f their rural roads improved under NPRR-2. Some elementary maintenance tasks
couldbe implemented by the communes themselves, with monitoring andtechnical assistanceby
the DPEs. Annual road maintenance budgets, preparedwith DPE support, should be part o f the
commune ' budgets, starting the first year after subproject completion.

The table below shows the subprojects submitted for the first year o f the project. The selection
o f these subprojects is yet to be confirmed in accordance with the participatory planningprocess
describe above. Practically all the roads inthe list are located inmountainous areas, and follow
the existing alignment o f the tracks that will be improved and paved.                Complementary
environmental studies will be carried out for the two subprojects inAzilal and inTiznit. While
all the subprojects have satisfactory economic return (over 12percent) as designed, the pavement
structure would needto be reviewedinthe light o f recommendations given inAnnex 4.B.

                              MOROCCO: RURALROADPROJECT

1.      The Borrower will be the Kingdom o f Morocco. The DRCR with its provincial and
regional directorates (DPEDRE). will be the implementing agency for the project. DRCR i s
experienced with Bank-financed projects, as the last road project (Loan 3901) closed in June
2002. Selection o f road works and technical standards will be led by DRCR through the
participatory process described in Annex 4B. The roads, both classified and non-classified,
eligible under the project in eachprovince are those included inthe PPRR and approved by the
provinces and communes. The Specific Agreements (SPA) signed by the provincial authorities
andthe representativesof all the province's communes commit the local authorities to contribute
to the NPRR-2 subprojects, to comply with safeguards and to maintain the improved roads. All
subprojects to be financed by the Bankwill be subject to Bankprior review and need to meet the
economic, environmental, and social requirements. Subprojects should be submitted at least one
year aheado ftheir inclusioninthe program.

2.      The project will be implemented over five years. The subprojects to be implemented the
first year were reviewed during the appraisal mission, and agreed with the DRCR, subject to the
complementary studiesmentioned inAnnex 4C, andto approval bythe respectiveprovinces.

3.      DRCR will strengthen its environment and social unit and hire specialists to monitor the
design and implementation o f environment and social action plans, social surveys, and
resettlement issues (Annex 10).

4.      The biddingprocess, contract award, design and construction supervision o fthe physical
component will be carried out by the DPEs, with assistance from the Regional Directorates as
needed and monitoring from DRCR. This arrangement i s appropriate and will help the MPWT
to hrther strengthen the deconcentrated road management functions.                Due to (i)the
geographically dispersed works inrural areas and local availability o f qualified contractors; (ii)
the small value o f contracts; and (iii) nature o f labor intensive works, it is expected that the
                                       the
contracts will not attract foreign competition andwill be processedunderNCB procedures.

5.      For non classified roads, the SPA indicates the share o f the subprojects to be financed by
the province and/or commune, their commitment to provide the land for road improvement or
upgrading and to carry out road maintenance. However, compensation or resettlement o f the
affected persons by landacquisition will be monitored by DRCR and implemented following the
resettlement framework (Annex 10).          Any financial participation o f local communities
(communes and village associations) in subproject cost would be likely up fkont and
implementation arrangements would be reviewed case by case, but DPE will be responsible for
subproject implementation, including for the share financed bythe community

6.      The DRCR will assume the main responsibility for collecting data on outcomes and
progress with implementation o f the road works. This will cover the project, the NPRR-2
program and any other programs o f rural roads financed and/or executed by other entities. To
carry out this work, DRCR will rely on an agency reporting to it, the National Center for Road
Study and Research (CNER).         The CNER has expertise in this area, as it is responsible for
collecting road data, and has a well developed database o f Morocco's road network, including
physical as well as socioeconomic data. CNER's tasks are described inAnnex 4.

7.      The DRCR will allocate a community development specialist to work in its
environmental and social unit, who will be responsible for coordinating and supervising the
above activities.   In selected pilot provinces, community development specialists will be

                                                                                              40

recruited to work with the DRE. Consultants will be recruited for measuring and monitoring
socioeconomic impacts o f roads. The terms o f reference for the community development
specialists and the firms will be part o f the PIP. A mid-term and final evaluation o f the unit's
activities will be conducted to assess progress and impacts.

8.      Financial management o f the project will be the responsibility o f the Programming and
Financing Division (PFD) o f DRCR, which handled the financial management o f Loan 3901.
Details are inAnnex 7.

9.      DRCR will submit to the Bank a quarterly report indicating the status o f project
implementation, outputs, outcomes, financial statements (including commitments and payments
and disbursements), updated procurement plan, environmental and social issues, and actions
taken to ensure satisfactory project implementation.

                  Annex7: FinancialManagementandDisbursementArrangements
                             MOROCCO: RURALROADPROJECT

Summary
1.      The financial management system for this project was assessed during project
preparation, as requiredby OPBP 10.02. The assessment, was based on information provided
by the MPWT, the Ministryof Finance, and the DRCR, and focused on two aspects of DRCR's
financial management: (a)Jinancial systems, including accounting, internaland external controls,
planning, budgeting and financial reporting and (b) financial monitoring, including the format
and content o fthe Financial MonitoringReports (FMR), to be submittedto the Bank, andproject
audit arrangements.

2.      The project's fmancial managementwillbe done bythe DRCR at the central level andby
its provincial and regional directorates (DRE/DPE), within the public expenditure system. This
system, that follows the public accounting rules, and operates inthe context o f a structured and
reliable controls, has a low fiduciary risk. Payments will be made by the Kingdom's Treasury
drawing on the national budget.Reimbursements will bemade from a special account or directly
fiom   the budget for the part financed by the Bank. The DRCR, which has experience in the
financial management o f projects, will be responsible for consolidating the accounting and
reporting. Disbursements o f the loan and the special account will need to be monitored closely.
This will be done by the DRCR in coordination with the Ministry o f Finance's Budget
Directorate.   In view of this, the project's financial management meet the minimum Bank
requirements, with the adoption o f arrangements that will allow to secure adequate project
accounting andreporting.

3.      The financial management risks, assessed as "medium low".                 These risks originate
mainly in the delegation o f project implementation to the DREs and DPEs, which the project
endorses. However, this delegation could result in: (a) delays in the submission o f financial
management reports, and (b) a slow-down in loan disbursements (from the s-pec'lal account or
from the loan), due to additional processing time to reimburse the project expenditures pre-
financed by the budget or by the Road Fund. These risks will be mitigated by: (a) training o f
staff, which should be adequateinnumbers and qualifications; (b) detailed description inthe PIP
o f rules and procedures; and (c) close supervision by the Bank, especially during the project's
first-year.

Generalframework
4.       Project h d s (Bank and counterpart funds) which are allocated through the general
budget and the Special Road Fund (Treasury special Account), follow the Moroccan public
expenditure procedures.         The procedures o f budget authorization, funding, expenditure
commitment, liquidation and payment are long". They are, however, considered as robust and
reliable12. Expenditures eligible under the Loan are pre-financed by the general budget or the
Road Fund, and then reimbursed by the Bank. This may generate delays between payment and
Loan disbursements. Delays may have a negative effect on project implementation and specially
on the level o f disbursements.

5.      The implementation agency's (DRCR) financial management system was reviewed
duringproject preparation to assess compliance with Bankrequirements detailed inOPD3PlO.02.
The main characteristics ofthe financial management system are described below.

Accounting system
6.      The accounting system i s based on the rules o f public accounting that apply to state
financial and accounting operations. They are defined by Royal Decree 330-66 o f April 21,
1967.    The budget unit ("ordonnateur") and public accountants keep separate accounts,
respectively referred to as administrative accounting and Treasury accounting. Administrative
accounting, as maintained by the "ordonnateur" and y'sous-ordonnateur", is based on
commitments. It records the execution o f budget authorizations listed in the government's
general budget and in each o f the categories o f special accounts, including the road fund.
Execution o f budget authorizations covers commitment, liquidation (certification o f services
rendered) and expenditure scheduling (issuance o f orders to pay to the public accountant).
Treasury accounting, i s the accounting o f orders to pay received from the "ordonnateur" and o f
payments made. This accounting is maintained by the General Treasurer o f the Kingdom, who
centralizes the operations performed by other public accountants.          This accounting system
records, by chapter and if appropriate by article and by paragraph, appropriations and the
payment o f expenditures from the general budget and the special accounts. The accounting
systems are reconciled on a monthly and annual basis in order to compare payment orders
handledbythe accountant.

Internal and external oversight
7.      Intemal oversight o f public expenditure guarantees the separation o f functions by
incorporating a number o f levels o f a priori oversight, involving three independent actors. They
are: (a) the "sous-ordonnateur" for the administrative phases o f commitment, liquidation and
expenditure scheduling; (b) the Budget Execution Controller for ex-ante oversight o f
expenditures at the commitment stage; and (c) the public accountant for ex-ante oversight of
expenditures at the payment stage. Depending on whether the expenditure i s executed at the
central level (DRCR) or the decentralized level (DREDPE), the following are involved: (a)
"sous-ordonnateur central" or "sous-ordonnateur territorial" for delegated budget allocations;
fb) the Budget Execution Controller at the central level or the provinciallregional controller at
the local level;13 and (c) the maintreasury inRabat or the provincial treasurers. The second level
of oversight i s the a posteriori internal oversight which may be performed by the central audit
unit of MPWT and by the Inspectorate General of Finance (IGF), at their request. Inaddition,
extemal oversight o fpublic expenditure may beperformed periodically by the Court o f Account
(Cow des Comptes), which is the highest oversight level. The audit reports o f the 6thhighway
project (Loan 3901) were regularly submitted to the Bank and did not contain substantive
comments on accounting or internalcontrols.

Information system andfinancial reporting
8.      The current information system, which is based on the public accounting system, focuses
onbudgetexecution. It does not allow for easy identificationo f operations specific to the project.
Therefore, it does not meet requirements for project financial reporting as requiredbythe Bank's
newerguidelines on financialmonitoring.

9.      The DRCR developed a separateinformationto monitor implementationo fits action plan
over the period 2002-2007 at the central and decentralized levels. Software was developed in-
house with the assistance o f a consultant and has been installed at DRCR and at some
DREDPEs. This makes it possible to monitor financial implementation (commitments and
payments) o f the action planby unit (central, provincial and regional directorates), as well as by




                                                                                             43

program and by contract. It is not envisaged under the project to adapt the software to the
information needs o f the project.

 11.     The project financial management will follow public accounting rules.                   They have
structured and reliable controls with a low fiduciary risk. Inaddition, the DRCR i s experienced
in financial   management of Bank-financed projects.             Furthermore, the audit reports of the
previous project did not raise significant comments. However, the information system does not
allow the DRCR to produce monitoring reports complyingwith Bank requirements andformats
to ensure an optimal monitoring of project disbursements. This situation i s further complicated
by the delegation of implementation.             Therefore, the financial management system meet
minimumBank required provided arrangements are made to ensure adequate project accounting
andreporting. The risks will be mitigatedbythe following measures: (a) trainingo f staff, which
should be adequate in numbers and qualifications at the central and deconcentrated levels, (b)
establishment of procedures between the DREDPE, the DRCR and the MOF to be integrated in
the PIP, and (c) a close Bank supervision duringthe first year of the project.

Arrangements for financialmanagementof the project
Breakdown of responsibilities
12.     The system that will be used for project implementation i s already partially inplace and
was usedfor the last road project (Loan 3901).

13.    At the central level, a team responsible for the project will be designated by the
programming and finance division o f DRCR and will include a person responsible for financial
management o f the project. This person should have an appropriate profile especially regarding
knowledge o f accounting, project management and information technology (Excel as a
minimum). The team will be responsible for coordination, budgeting, procurement and
implementation. The team will rely on existing structures at DRCR and in the DREDPEs,
particularly the contracts office for procurement and the accounting office for payments and
accounting. The team will also be responsible for: (a) monitoring financial implementation o f
the project and preparing quarterly interim financial reports; (b) producing the project financial
monitoring reports every semester and the annual project financial statements and submitting
them to the Bank and the auditors; (c) monitoring disbursements with the MOF's Budget
Directorate and with the General Treasury and preparing and/or centralizing the statements o f
expenditure received from DRE/DPE to be sent to the BudgetDirectorate ;and(d) submittingall
documents to the Bank and the auditors on a timelybasis. The management o f disbursements i s
centralized at the MOF's Budget Directorate, which transmits to the Bank the applications for
funds withdrawal.

14.    At the regional and provincial levels, the DREDPEs are responsible for implementing
the project activities for which appropriations are delegated to them. The directors o f the
DREDPEs will assign a person, having a profile similar to the person in DRCR, from the
managementand programs office to beresponsible for the project's financial, administrative and
accounting management. The DREDPES will also be responsible for monitoring and updating
gmmitments and payments, and periodically submitting the data to the central project team.
The DREDPE will transmit regularly their statement o f expendituresto DRCR, for its onward
transmission to MOF's BudgetDirectorate.

Projectfinancial managementprocedures
15.     Project financial management procedures have been establishedby the project team at the
central level, and are included in the PIP.       Procedures will be reviewed as needed. The
procedures will facilitate the performance o f project financial management tasks and will, at the
central andregionallprovincial levels, describe:
        (a) Tasks o f members o f the project's teams, particularly regarding coordination and
            financial reporting, and the procedures for preparingthe project financial monitoring
            andaudit reports.
        (b) Financial information flow chart (and schedules) between the different internal
            entities involved in the project (DRCR and DPEDRE) and between the DRCR and
            the Budget Directorate, the General Treasury and the Budget Execution Controller.
           They also describe relations with the offices involved in project implementation,
            specifically the procurement office, the accounting office andtechnical services, and
            the procedure for filingjustifications o f expenditures. A procedure to safeguard this
            documentation will be put inplace.
        (c) Financial flows o f the project, includingthe special account operating methods.
        (d) Basis of project reference documentation (Bank documentation and national
           regulations).

                                                                                            45

Project accounting and monitoring
16.    The general principles are as follows :
           The project accounting system will cover all sources o f project hnds andthe use of
           these funds, while distinguishingbetween the part financed by the World Bank and
           the rest. The source o f funds financed by the Bank will cover: disbursements made
           on the basis o f applications for special account replenishment and recovery;
           applications for repayment to the general budget and the Special Road Fund (FSR);
           and, direct payments.       The use o f funds will cover payments, with budget
           commitments reported for information.
           A distinctionwill bemade betweenactivities specific to the project and other DRCR
           activities.
           The DREDPEs will periodically provide the DRCR with progress reports on
           financial  implementation o f the project, showing for each contract: amount
           committed, payments made and physical progress ("tableau intermkdiaire de suivi
           Jinancier etphysique des DRE/DPE").
       - Theproject' chartofaccountsmustconformtotheclassificationofexpendituresand
           sources o f funds shown in project documents (implementation plan, appraisal
           document).    This classification should facilitate, through manual data entry, the
           production o f financial monitoring reports and, in particular, the use o f funds by
           project component andbydisbursement category.
       - The monitoring system will permit the preparation of annual project financial
           statements (PFS) to be submitted to the auditor. At a minimum, the PFS should
           contain: (a) a statement o fresources and expenditures covering all resourcesand cash
           payments, as well as the entity's available funds; (b) the accounting principles and
           appendednotes; and (c) a certificationby the implementingagency stating that Bank
           funds havebeenusedfor the purposesintended andinaccordancewiththe provisions
           o fthe legal agreement with theworld Bank.                                ~

           withdrawal applications sent to the Bank as well as copies o f the monthly special
           account statement received from General Treasury.

Project information system
17.    The project financial informationwill be managed manually (usingExcel spreadsheet) at
the central level, usingconsolidated data from the regionaVprovincia1teams, and incoordination
with the Budget Directorate andGeneral Treasury o fthe Kingdom.

Financial monitoring reports
18.    Bank guidelines on financial monitoringreports have been givento DRCR. The FMRs
include, inaddition to a summary o fproject progress, the following main tables :
       - summaryofsourcesanduseoffunds, showing, forthepartfinancedbytheLoan, any
           discrepanciesbetween disbursements from loan funds (source o f funds) andpayments
           made (use o f funds);
       - summaryofthe useoffundsshowing commitments (for information) andpayments
           by component andby expenditure category;

         - summaryofprocurementprocessesandproceduresfor activities thatarenotsubject
             to prior Bankreview; and
         - summaryofthephysicalprogressbyprojectcomponent.

19.      The format and content of the reports were agreed during project preparation and
included in the Project Implementation Plan. These tables will be produced manually by the
DRCR's central managementunit, which will consolidate the dataprovided by the decentralized
units. The financial monitoring reports will be prepared every semester and sent to the Bank
within 45 days o f the close o f each reporting period. In order to facilitate and speed up
disbursements o f project funds, the DRCR will produce quarterly financial reports on project
implementation.

Auditing

20.      The implementing agency will retain an auditor acceptable to the Bank to perform an
annual audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA), as issued by the
International Federation o f Accountants, and with terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank.
The auditor will provide a professional opinion on the project financial statements and will
submit an annual audit report to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The
audit will be detailed and will cover all aspects o f the project, including all sources and uses of
funds.

Flow of funds
21.      Project funds (World Bank funds and government counterpart funds) are allocated
through the budget o f the Ministry o f Public Works and Transport and the Special Road Fund
(FSR) in line with the various annual appropriation laws covering the project period. Budget
allocations to the project are made available to "sous-OYdonnateuYS" through delegation at the
central (DRCR) andthe decentralized (DREDPE)levels. Paymentsto suppliers are made by the
main treasury in Rabat at the central level and by the appropriate provincial treasury at the
decentralized level. Such payments are made globally with no distinctionbetween the financed
part and the non-financed part. The part eligible for Bank financing will be repaid into special
account funds, the management o f which is centralized at the General Treasury o f the Kingdom
(TGR), or directly to the govemment budget, based respectively on applications for
replenishment or applications for repayment sent by the Budget Directorate to the Bank.
Contribution by beneficiaries (partnership agreements) will be placed under a separate fund
opened for the MPWT at the TGR.

Disbursements
22.      Methods of disbursements. Withdrawals o f loan hnds are based on the Bank's standard
disbursement methods: direct payments, applications for special commitments or applications for
repayment, accompanied by all justifications or using statements o f expenditure in accordance
with the procedures stipulated and described in the project disbursement letter and the Bank
disbursement manual.        The multilateral financial division ("Division du financement
multilateral") within the Budget Directorate will be responsible for submitting all withdrawal
applications o f funds to the Bank. Applications will be supported by the corresponding
justifications received from General Treasury or statements o f expenditure received from DRCR
as sole justification depending o f the method used (applications for repayment accompanied by
all justifications or using statements o f expenditure). The corresponding justifications will be
heldby the multilateral financial division except for the documentation supporting expenditures
claimed against SOEs, which will be retained by the executing agency. In any case, this

                                                                                              47

documentation will be made available for review by Bank supervision missions and project
auditors.    According to Bank standard disbursement procedures, disbursements will be
completed four months after project closing.

23.      Special account. To facilitate disbursement o f eligible expenditures, the Government
will open a special account inMADat The General Treasury. This account will bemanagedby
the multilateral financial division (MFD). The special account will have a ceiling o f MAD
35,000,000, which would cover an estimated 4 months o f eligible expenditures financed by the
loan. Initially, allocation will be limited to MAD 15,000,000 until cumulative disbursement
reach a level equivalent to EUR 7 millions. The MFD will be responsible for submitting
monthly replenishment applications with appropriate supporting documentation for expenditures
received from General treasury or DRCR depending on the method used. The corresponding
justifications will be retained and made available for review by Bank supervision missions and
auditors. To the extent possible, all o f loan's share o f expenditures should be paid through the
special account. The supporting documentation will include reconciled bank statementsand other
documents as may berequired.

24.      Use of Statement of Expenditure (SOEs): All applications to withdraw proceeds from the
loan will be fully documented, except for expenditures with a contract value less than or equal
to: (a) US$2,500,000 for civil works contracts; (b) US$lOO,OOO for goods and equipment
contracts; (c) US$200,000 for consultant contracts, and (d) US$50,000 for individual
consultants, which may be claimed on the basis o f certified Statements o f Expenditures (SOEs).
Documentation supporting expenditures will be retained by the executing agency in accordance
with the filing procedures described inthe PIP and will be made available for review by Bank
supervision missions and auditors. All disbursements will be subject to the conditions o f the
loanAgreement andthe procedures defined inthe DisbursementLetter.

Retroactive Financing.
25.       To facilitate project start-up, retroactive financing for eligible expenditures within the
 limit ofEUR3,000,000 would beprovidedto helpcover project expenditures for civil works and
consultant contracts between July 1, 2004 and the date o f the loan signature.                Bidding
procedures, use o f consultants, review o f documentation should be accord with Bank guidelines.
Documentation requiredto support retroactive financing i s the same required for disbursements
 after signature o fthe loan.

Planning of supervision
26.       The proposed frequency o f supervision missions is every six months with a close
 supervision duringthe first year.

                                                                                                48

                          Annex 7.A. Caissede Financement Routier

InstitutionalSet-up
1.     A Caisse de Financement Routier (CFR) has been created with the purpose o f
accelerating the pace o frural roadprograms to improve accessibility. The CFR will finance road
construction or maintenance works through concessionaryborrowing.

2.     The CFR is a public entity, provided with administrative and financial autonomy. The
CFR was created by law 57-03 and became effective through decree 2-03-702. It reports to the
Ministry o f Public Works and Transport and is subject to financial control of the Ministry of
Finance (MoF). The CFR's financial and accounting rules have been submitted to the MoF for
approval.

3.     The CFR's financial management, as described below, is based on a review o f
documentation not yet effective.     The description i s not intended to be an evaluation o f
operational capacity o fthe CFR, which i s not yet operational.

Financialand accountingorganization
4.     Administration and management. A Board chaired by the Prime Minister or a person
appointed by him directs and supervises the CFR. The CFR i s managedby a director appointed
byexecutive decree.

5.     Management information system and           procedures. CFR's information system and
management o f accounting are: (a) based on rules o f accounting records that are reliable and
comprehensive, and (b) include a manual o f accounting procedures covering the organization o f
accounting, and rules for evaluation and accounting that integrate inventory procedures and
archives.

6 Budgetsystem.AccordingtothefmancialandaccountingorganizationoftkeCFR,its
      ~


budget will be submittedto the Boardbefore November 15 for the following year. The budget,
including an investment and an operating budget, and a financial management framework, i s
approved by the Board and becomes effective after approval by the Ministry o f Finance. If
budget approval i s delayed, the budget can proceed on the basis o f up to one half o f the budget
amount effectively obtained the previous year.         Regarding the investment budget, only
consolidated amountsbasedon those o fprevious fiscal years are authorized.

7.     Accounting. CFR accounting i s basedon rules applicable to public entities (decree 2-89-
61 of November 10, 1989). These rules are described inthe administrative decree establishing
the financial and accounting organization o f the CFR. It covers budget, general and analytical
accounting.

8.     Internal controls. The system o f intemal controls is intended to ensure a separation
similar to that applicable to public expenditures. This includes three levels o f controls by
independent actors: (a) the director of the CFR, as the responsible (ordonnateur) for
commitments, payments and scheduling o f expenditures, (b) the state Comptroller, for the a
priori control o f expenses at the commitment stage, for expenses exceeding a ceiling to be
determined by the Minister o f Finance, and (c) the Finance Officer (trksorier) for the a priori
control o f expenses at the payment stage. Payment orders are signed jointly by the director o f
the CFR and by Finance Officer (trksorier payeur) or a delegate approved by the MOF. The
statecomptroller andthe trksorierpayeur are appointedbythe Minister o fFinance.


                                                                                            49

9.     Internal audits. No reference i s made to internal audits. Arrangements are yet to be
determined.

10.    External audit. The CFR will no be subject to a compulsory external audit. The CFR's
financial and accounting organization states that "in case o f accounting and financial audit", (a)
the external auditor must provide an opinion about the annual summary financial statements and
about the quality o f internal controls, and (b) the director o f the CFR must submit to the Board
before June 30, every year, the synthesis financial statements audited by external auditors.

                                      Annex 8: Procurement
                            MOROCCO: RURAL ROADPROJECT

Summary of ProcurementAssessmentCapacity
1.      An "Assessment of Agency Capacity to ImplementProcurement" was carried out during
appraisal and was found to be satisfactory. The procurement plan for the first year o f the
program will be finalized during appraisal. The overall procurement risk has beenjudged to be
low. The national legislationon procurement, with some exceptions, i s generally inline with the
Bank's Guidelines.      In particular the following procedures, not provided in the national
legislation, mustbe applied underBank financing:
        (a) the two-envelope procedure could be usedfor bids for works and goods providedthat
            the two envelops are openedsimultaneously;
        (b) quantifiable bidevaluation criteria are includedinbiddingdocuments and, inthe case
            o f goods, apoints system should not beused;
        (c) open competitive biddingfor consultants should not be applied (see CPAR, February
            2000);
        (d) each NCB procurement shall be advertised in the borrower's national press and
            posted on the Borrower's procurement website, and bidders will be givenno less than
            30 days to preparetheir bids;
        (e) the contract would be awarded to the bidder having submitted the lowest evaluated
            responsive bid; and.
        (f) bidswouldbeopenedpublicly, andthe bidevaluation andaward would bepublished
            including the procedures for claim. NCB procedure is openedto contractors from all
            eligible countries.

2.      DRCR will be responsible for procurement o f consulting services o f the Institutional
Component and for monitoring the procurement process carried out by the provincial
Directorates DPEs. The central and de-concentrated directorates have benefited from direct
technical assistance by experienced consultants from past projects financed by the Bank. Their
capacity is good andthey represent a low risk. Their performance is expected to remain good. In
accordancewith the Government's de-concentration policy, procurement activities for works will
be undertaken, under NCB procedures, by the DPEs. The DPEs have handledNCB for works
for years and they have experience with the Bank'sprocurement procedures. However, the risk
associatedwith DPE's project procedures i s considered low, based on the experience gained by
the Government and the Bank inthe implementation o fNCB procurement under Loan 3901. In
addition, to mitigate the risk, all procurement activities carried out by the DPEs will be
monitored and supervised directly by DRCR.

Use of BankGuidelines and StandardDocuments
3.       All goods, works and services (other than consultants' services) would be procured in
accordance with the provisions of Section Io f the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 (the Procurement Guidelines), and with the provisions
o fthis Schedule.

4.       All consultants' services shall be procuredinaccordancewith Section I, paragraphs 3.15
through 3.20, and Section I V of, andAppendix 2 to, the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 (the Consultant Guidelines), and
with the provisions ofthis Schedule. The standardrequest for proposals (RFP) andthe Standard
Form o f Contracts will be used for contracts above US$200,000 equivalent. For the Selection

                                                                                          51

Process o f firms, the Sample Form o f Evaluation Report for the Selection o f Consultants
(October 1999) will beused.

Advertisingand ProcurementPlan
5.      A general Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published online in the United Nations
Development Business (UNDB) and DG Market, and in at least three newspapers o f national
circulation. The GPN will provide a description o f the project and will list all contracts for
works and for consultancy services estimated at more thanUS$200,000 equivalent.

6.      A procurement plan was finalized during appraisal to determine the most appropriate
packaging for some o f the subcomponents under the project. The procurement plan i s included
in the Project implementation Plan, and will be updated quarterly.             It includes details for
activities prior to loan effectiveness as well as for the first year ofthe project. Procurement o f all
works and services will be undertaken in accordance with this plan as approved by the Bank.
This planwill be updated quarterly.

Procurement Arrangements
7.      Procurement of Civil Works: estimated at US$40.957 million (Euros 34.45 millions),
including contingencies:
        o International Competitive Bidding (ICB):           Due to (i)the geographically dispersed
            works inrural areas and local availability o f qualified contractors; (ii) the small value
            o f contracts; and (iii) the nature o f labor intensive works; it i s expected that the
            contracts will not attract foreign competition.
        o National Competitive Bidding (NCB): Procurement activities for rural roads with an
            estimated cost not exceeding US$2.5 million equivalent per contract, will be
            performed by the DPEs through NCB procedures, at the provincial level, with DRCR
            monitoring. About thirty (30) contracts, valued at between US$200,000 to US$2.5
    -       million, will be awarded among the provincial directorates.             The procurement
            documentation for NCB will be prepared and submitted to the Bank clearance before
            Loan effectiveness.

8.      Procurement of Goods: Goods to be procured under the project are limited in quantity
and are mainly specialized equipment related to the road data system o f the institutional
component. Goods with a contract value less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent will be procured
under nationalhtemational shopping procedures.              The aggregate amount will not exceed
US$lOO,OOO equivalent.

9.      Domestic Preference- The provisions o f paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 o f the Procurement
Guidelines and Appendix 2 thereto, providing for domestic preference inthe evaluation o f bids,
shall apply to goods manufactured inthe territory o fthe Borrower.

10.     Consulting services: estimatedat US$2.33 million(Euros 1.960).
            Quality and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS): The consultants' assignments for
            consulting firms for the following will be procured through the Bank's QCBS
            procedures: (a) design and supervision o f rural roads construction or improvement
            (included incomponent No.1); and (b) institutional studies.
            Selection Based on Consultants' Qualzjkations (SBCQ): SBCQ procedures will be
            usedto select the consultants for social andenvironmental studies.


                                                                                                 52

             Selection based on the least cost (SBLC): Services for assignmentsto be performed
             by road laboratories for rural roads studies and works supervision, which the Bank
             agrees meet the requirementso f paragraph 3.6 o f the Consultant Guidelines, may be
             procured under contracts awarded on the basis o f Least-cost Selection in accordance
             with the provisions ofparagraphs 3.1 and 3.6 o fthe Consultant Guidelines.

11.     Single Source Selection: This method will be used for the procurement o f services
related to the monitoring and evaluation component, with the CNER, in accordance with the

                                      Annex 9: Economic Analysis
                             MOROCCO: RURALROADS PROJECT

A. Relevanceof Objectives

1.      The relevance o f the project objectives and the rural roads program it supports i s high.
The government has assigned a high priority to alleviating poverty and to reducing the
differences inliving standards across the country. To this end, the government has increased its
attention to rural development, because poverty in Morocco is mainly a rural issue. While
Morocco's population is about equally divided between rural and urban, two thirds o f the poor
live inrural areas, and poverty is deeper inthe rural population- almost one out o f four i s poor
inthe rural areas, comparedwith one out ten inurban areas. The rural-urban gap is especially
big for the extreme and the very poor, since 3.0 million rural people fall in this category,
compared to 0.7 million for the urbanpopulation. Women are especially affected in the rural
areas, since 9 out 10 women are illiterate and close to 60 percent o f the children not attending
schools are girls.

2.      A key issue affecting the life o f the rural population is their low accessibility to
infrastructure and social services. Only about 30- 40 percent o f the rural inhabitants have access
to clean water, power and all-weather roads. In the case o f roads, close to 60 percent o f the
villages are inaccessible by motor vehicles at all times, or have difficult access (seasonal
isolation).

3.      In addition to constraining access to infrastructure and services, the low accessibility
results in an excessively high cost o f foodstuffs and agricultural inputs, in turn hinderingthe
potential for development o fthe agricultural economy.

4.      Program andproject objectives include, inaddition to increasing the overall level o frural
road accessibility, reducing the accessibility gap between the more accessible and the less
accessibleprovinces. This objective supports the broader government objective to reduce living
standarddifferentials occurring among differentpartso fthe country.

B.The SecondNationalProgram(NPRR-2) ofRuralRoads andthe Project

5.       The ongoing first National Program of Rural Roads (NPRR-l), when completed in2005,
will have increased rural road accessibility to 54 percent. While this represents a major leap
compared with the start o f this program, it is still substantially short o f government goal to
provide the vast majority o fthe rural populationwith reliable road access.

6.       The secondNational Program of Rural Roads, that the project will support, will scale up
in three major ways the efforts under the NPRR-1, involving the objectives, the participatory
process, andthe output:

         (a) Theprogram objectives will be defined in terms of thepopulation served, rather than
             the kilometers of roads built. The program will aim to increase the percentage o f
            rural population given access to an all-weather road from 54 percent at the start o fthe
            program, to 80 percent when the program i s completed in2015.14



l4  Rural population counted as inaccessible are those living in douars of 50 or more households, living at a
    distance over one kilometer from an all weather road. This excludes the very dispersed population for whom
    providing all weather, motorized access is unaffordable.
                                                                                                         55

        (b) Thelevel of participation by the local government will be substantially increased and
           formalized.    The global NPRR-2 will result from the consolidation o f provincial
            programs o f priority rural roads (PPRR).       The PPRRs will be decided by the
            provinces and communes upon their review o f a list o f pre-identified project roads
            prepared by the Directorate o f Roads on the basis of a detailed road inventory.
            Further, specific Agreements will be signed between the DPE and the provinces
            and/or communes that have local rural roads included inthe NPRR-2, with a view to
            making certain that they provide the right-of-way whenever necessary, contribute to
            the road's financing, and guarantee their hture maintenance. Works on local rural
            roads projects included in the NPRR-2 will not be started until the respective
            Agreements become effective.

        (c) Thepace of construction and improvement will be accelerated. The second Program
            i s expectedto be executed over a ten-year period, the same as the NPRR-1. However,
            duringthis period the secondProgram will improve some 15,000 kilometers ofroads,
            compared to 11,000 kilometers that will be completed underthe first Program.

7.      Road investmentsto be financed under the project and more broadly under the Second
National Program o f Rural Roads (NPRR-2) will be selected through a multi-stage process,
including a strong participatory process, as described in Annex 4.           The selection process
recognizes the complexity o f variables involved, including decisions on criteria for considering
highly dispersedpopulations requiringa very highcost per unit population served and relative
priorities between roads whose main function i s strengthening the connectivity o f the road
system and those mainly providing local accessibility. The selection process also takes into
account the benefits o f completing road section gaps left upon closure o f the first National
Program o fRuralRoads (NPPR-1).

C.Beneficiaries

8. ThemainbeneficiariesoftheNPRR-2andthe projectwillbethepopulationlivinginthe
vicinity o f the roads to be improved. These populations, currently isolated, will gain reliable
access through improvedroads to social services and markets. They will also benefit from new
services likely to spring up near the improved roads which will result in lower costs o f
foodstuffs and other necessities, as well as new services such as public telephones being made
available. An important proportion o f the beneficiaries will be people with income below the
poverty line. Some o f the improved roads may become a convenient shortcut for transit traffic
on longer distance travel, and those road users will also be beneficiaries, substantially reducing
their cost and time oftravel. Suppliers of serviceswill also benefit, since improvedroads will
makeit easier to recruit personnel such as teachersandmedicalstaff, andto get necessaryinputs.

D. ConsiderationofAlternatives

9.      Altematives were considered at three levels:
            At the project design level, two altemative approaches were considered and
            discarded:
            (a) the first was Community Driven Development (CDD). A CDD would have had
                 to focus mostly on the very short local links, that often connect to classified roads
                 (provincial, regional, national) themselves not accessible year round. Ensuring
                 accessibility o f the classified roads is a higher priority both to increase rural
                 accessibility andto improve network connectivity.


                                                                                                56

           (b) the second approach would have been spatially focused at the provincial level,
                with planning and implementation carried out by the provincial governments.
                 This approach was not considered feasible because the local agencies have
                 limited autonomy, scarce resources, and are not equipped for planning of
                networked utilities such as roads (decentralization-focused operations are better
                 suitedfor this purpose).
           These two approaches are described inmore detail in Section B6 o f the PAD'Smain
           text.

           At theprogram investment level, the conventional alternative o f seeking optimization
           o f the economic return on investments was discarded in favor o f a mix o f road
           investments some selected on efficiency grounds and others on equity, that is,
           improving accessibility o fthe more isolated rural populations. Optimizationo freturn
           was discarded, as it would have tilted the program towards high traffic roads and
           would have negated the views o f stakeholders expressed through a participatory
           process,

           For engineering design of the subprojects, a range o f design standards will be
           considered and subject to economic analysis in the detailed studies as follows: (a)
           improve the road to earth road, considering various design standards; (b) pave the
           road with a four-meter width surface treatment, considering different pavement
           standards; and(c) pave the roadwith a six-meter widthsurface treatment, considering
           differentpavement standards.

E.EconomicAnalysis Methodology

10.    The roads to be included inthe "-2           will consist o f two categories from the point o f
view of economic analysis: (i)    low-volume roads, at least in relative terms, that will produce
benefits not only in alleviating isolation but also in reducing transport costs to the longer-
distance traffic they would normally carry, and (ii)  very low-volume roads, whose main benefits
will be their contribution to reducing the level o f isolation o f rural communities and connecting
themto social and economic infrastmcture (schools, healthcenters, village markets, etc.).

11.    Correspondingly, to define the proper level o f investments o f each project road ensuring
economic efficiency, two alternative approacheswill be used: (i)      a Cost Benefits Analysis (CBA)
will be done for all roads that already have an established traffic, generally with daily traffic
higher than 30 vehicles per day, and investments' economic rate ofreturn and net present value
will be determined and, (ii)Cost Eficiency Analysis (CEA) will be done for roads selected on
                              a
the basis o f their contribution to accessibility, generally with a daily traffic less than 30 vehicle
perday.

12.    Low-volume roads: for these roads, the cost-benefit analysis will be done using the Road
Economic DecisionModel (RED) developed by the World Bank for the economic evaluation o f
investments and maintenance alternatives for low-volume roads. The RED model adopts the
consumer surplus approach to estimate project benefits that are comprised o f road user costs
(vehicle operating costs, passenger time costs, and accident cost) savings, which are estimated
using road user costs relationships fkom the Highway Development and Management Model
(HDM-4). The RED Model i s customized to the characteristics and needs o f low-volume roads,
such as the highuncertainty o f the assessmento f the model inputs, the importance o f speeds for
model validation, and the need for a comprehensive analysis o f generated and induced traffic.
The DRCR i s equipped with the RED model and its staff was trained duringproject preparation


                                                                                                57

inits use. The investment on eachproject roadshould yield anEconomic Rate ofRetum(ERR)
higherthan 12percent to be considered acceptable. For these roads, the beneficiary population
will also be computed inorder to be able to determine the overall impact o f the project and the
NPRR-2 on improving accessibility.

13.      Very-low volume roads:for these roads, the CEA will be done computing the investment
cost per beneficiary person. A global analysis o f the preliminary NPRR-2 program reviewed at
appraisal showed that it would benefit 2.9 million people, with an average cost o f $365 per
person. Most o f the population that live in the vicinity o f the very low volume roads live in
smaller villages and more dispersed than those around the roads with higher traffic volumes.
Therefore, providing road access to such isolated populations will cost more than the average.
On this basis, it was agreed with the DRCR to adopt a threshold o f $490 per inhabitant for the
roads to be selectedonthe basis o ftheir-cost effectiveness.

14.     For the CEA ratio calculation, both the direct beneficiaries, that is, the population living
along the project road (in douars with at least 50 households and within one kilometer at each
side o f the road) as well as the indirect beneficiaries, that i s persons living within one and two
kilometers from the road, will also be counted in this analysis. However, only the direct
beneficiaries will be counted for the purpose o f measuring the accessibility (to rural roads)
contributed by the road. Conversely, while many o f the roads are also likely to serve dispersed
populations living indouars o f less than 50 households, such populations will not be counted for
the purpose o f the CEA indicator.

15.     While the investment will be the minimum investment needed to provide all weather
access, experience indicates that unpavedroads inmountainous terrain or insoil clays deteriorate
rapidly, and become impassable for long periods. Since this would implythat road accessibility
for the populations served by those roads would be rapidly lost, such roads would receive a light
surfacetreatment. The DRCRwill carry out rigorous reviews o fthe engineering analysis o f such
roads to ensure that the minimumstandards and investment costs are usedthat guaranteereliable
accessibility.  Prior to establishing the final design, the DRCR will c@           out pilot tests, in
selectedunpaved roads, consisting o f multi-year contracts covering the initial investment inroad
rehabilitation and three to five years of routine maintenance. Recent pilots conducted by the
DRCR o f multi-year, comprehensive maintenance contracts have been successful and suggest
that a similar approach could be followed in the case o f very low volume roads located in
difficult topography or soils.

16.     On the basis o f the NPRR-2 program (see Annex 4), a global economic evaluation was
done using the RED model. The analysis considered a matrix o f representative road classes by
traffic range, annual maintenance cost, and road user costs. The evaluation was done with for
analysis period o f 15 years and adopting a discount rate o f 12 percent. The table below presents
the roadclassesevaluatedwith the REDmodel (Table 9.1).

  Results-GlobalNPRR-2Program
-21.  -    The evaluation showed that the preliminaryNPRR-2 program would have an economic
  rate o fretumo f 20 percent with a global Net PresentValue o f US$330 million. The ERRwould
  fall to 16 percent with a 20 percent increase in investment costs, and to 15 percent if benefits
  were 20 lower than estimated. The switching value analysis shows that for the ERR to fall to 12
  percent, costs would need to be 1.5 times higher, or benefits 33 percent lower than estimated
  (Tables 9.6 and9.7).

  22.      The above results indicate a satisfactory economic justification for the roads meeting
  ERRcriteriaas well as for the overallNPRR-2 program.

traffic levels (over 50 vehicles per day), or where the condition o f the existing roads was very
poor (IRI=20) andthere was much gain inrehabilitating or pavingthe road (Table 9.8).

G.Cost-EffectivenessEvaluation

25.     An analysis of the roads not meeting ERR benchmark showed that 2,040 kilometers of
roads with a cost o f $110 million, representing 12 percent o ftotal costs, would be selectedon the
basis o f cost-effectiveness criteria (under $490/person). The population served by these roads
amounts to 550,000. As noted above, this count underestimates the amount of beneficiary
population since it excludes dispersed population served by these roads but that live invillages
cdouartr) o f 50 households or less.

26.     According to information in the preliminary NPRR-2 program and the above analysis,
there would be 2,605 kilometers o f roads, with a total cost o f US$156 million, located inhighly
mountainous topography or in clay soils. These roads, already under difficult construction
conditions that yield high unit costs, would require a light surface treatment. As a result, such
roads would not pass either ERR or CEA benchmarks. However, the large majority o f these
roads are located in the most inaccessible provinces, such as Azilal, Chefchaouen, Tetouan,
Tiznit, and therefore are important because they increase overall accessibility and reduce
accessibility differentials among provinces. The DRCR will carefully review the final technical
standards o f such roads to ensure that the minimumnecessary investments are done. The final
design o fthese roads will be subject to a rigorous technical and economic analysis to ensure that
the design results in a cost as low as possible. Prior to establishing the final design, the DRCR
will carry out pilot tests, in selected unpaved roads, consisting o f multi-year contracts covering
the initial investment in road rehabilitation and three to five years o f routine maintenance.
Recent pilots conducted by the DRCR o f multi-year, comprehensive maintenance contracts have
been successfil and suggest that a similar approach could be followed in the case o f very low
volume roads locatedindifficult topography or soils.

H.BeneficiaryPopulation.

27.     As noted above, the beneficiarypopulation, that is, the rural population that will bemade
accessible by an all-weather road as a result o f the NPRR-2 program over its ten-year
implementation period, amounts to 2.9 million people, not counting the very dispersed rural

                                                                                             61

population that live in villages (douars) o f 50 households or less. Benefits will also accrue to
providers o ftransport services that will operate on better and safer roads, and to the shippers and
consumers beyond the direct area o f the improved roads, that will benefit from a reduction in
transport rates on the routes with competitive transport services.

28.    Beneficiary population living in the areas of the roads by category of roads i s shown in
Table 9.9. Beneficiary populationwould consist of direct beneficiary (within 1kilometer o f the
improved road, and counted for the purpose o f accessibility measure), and indirect beneficiary
(within1and2 kilometers ofthe improved road).

I.EconomicEvaluationofFirstYearProgram

29.     At appraisal, the DRCR submitted a list of 12 roads to be carried out during the First
Year o f the project. These roads have completed technical and economic studies.               Their
combined length i s 184.5 kilometers and their total cost is $14 million. The overall ERR for
these roads i s 30 percent, and all the roads have an ERR higher than 12 percent. The combined
Net Present Value of the first year program i s $13.9 million. Results shown in Table 9.10
indicate that the First-Year program has a solid economic return. Sensitivity analysis showed
that evenwith costs 20 percent higher andbenefits 20 lower than estimated the overall economic
return would remain high, at 20 percent, and switching values also confirm this result (Table
9.11). Overall, the first year investments will provide some 85,000 rural inhabitants with access

30.     A tentative assessment ofthe increaseinmaintenance requirements bythe completion o f
the NPRR-2 program, requiringan increase inbudgetary allocation or provision from the Road
Fundwouldbe as follows.

31.     By 2015, some 10,880 kilometers would bepaved underthe NPRR-2 program. Ofthese,
7,500 km would be classified roads under the MPWT, and the remainder will be local rural
_roads. Currently, the DRCR spends about $2,OOO/km o fpavedroad (including any maintenance
on the unpaved roads) inannualized maintenance. By2015, the DRCRrequirements for funding
maintenance will increaseby about US$15 million. The resourceso fthe RoadFund, which fund
maintenance, have been growing and are expected to continue to increaseto meet the increasing
maintenance requirements resulting fi-om the NPRR-2 works. The local rural roads on average
have lower standards and will require some US$l,OOO/km annually for maintenance. The
incremental maintenance costs by the some 3,400 kmof paved localrural roads would amount to
$3.4 million. The local authorities should endeavor to secure fi-om the appropriate government
level the required funding. The study under the project o f local rural roads should help prepare
the decisions neededto secure this fimding.

32.     The economic analysis o f investments should also take into account the capacity for
executing the investments. The DRCR will be responsible for carrying out the NPRR-2 Program

                                 Annex 10: SafeguardPolicyIssues
                           MOROCCO: RURALROADSPROJECT

 A.       OVERVIEW

 1.      Project Description: The proposed Morocco Rural Access Project aims at providing
 better access to social, community andadministrative services inorder to improve rural life. The
 project will consist o ftwo maincomponents: (i)    rehabilitation or construction o fruralroads, and,
 (ii)technical assistanceand training.

 2.       The implementation o f the Project falls under the responsibility o f the Directorate of
 Roads and Road Traffic (DRCR) o f the Ministry o f Public Works and Transport (MPWT) who
 would be in charge o f managing, monitoring and coordinating the various project activities.
 DRCR will strengthen its environment unit to become a safeguard unit comprising an
 environmental expert, a social expert and a technician with relevant experience inimplementing
 similar projects, and with proven capacity to handle all required functions. The unit capacity
 would be reinforced by adding an environmental engineer, a social scientist and a technician
 with relevant experience inimplementingsimilar projects, andwith proven capacity to handleall
 requiredhctions Among its mandates, the safeguardunit will ensure that any sponsoredroad
 i s environmentally and socially sound.

 3.       Regional and provincial Directorates o f the MPWT (Direction Regionale de
 I'Equipement -DE, and Direction Provinciale de I'Equipement             - DPE ) will undertake the
 execution o f the rural roads including their operation and maintenance. DRE and DPE will
 ensure that environmental procedures are followed and used throughout the project cycle.

 4.       Project Environmental Category: The proposed project would support environmental
Anprwements through construction and improvements of rural roads insmall poor communities
 and villages. Potential adverse environmental impacts during both construction and operation
 are restricted in magnitude and severity. Roads to be funded by the project do not have major
 irreversible environmental impacts; on the contrary, all roads would contribute to positive
 environmental and social impacts especially by providing access to agricultural areas, and to
 social infrastructures and services. The roads to be executed under the proposed project are on
 existing right-of-ways and there will be no significant changes in road characteristics such as
 width or alignment. Therefore, the project will not entail resettlement ofpopulation, minor land
 expropriation would be requiredand excavation works will be limited. Furthermore, the project
 will not fund any road that would require resettlement, deforestation, or would adversely affect
 natural habitats, biodiversity, and cultural heritage sites. Negative impacts are mainly related to
 construction activities and are limitedto the civil works sites. Accordingly, the proposed project
 has beenplaced in "Category B" in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.01)
 on Environmental Assessment (January 1999).

 5.       Environmental and Social Safeguards Review Process: Evaluation o f issues concerning
 environment, social, involuntary resettlement and land acquisition has been an integral part o f
 project preparation. As all roads to be funded bythe project were not identifiedprior to appraisal,
 a fkamework approach was adopted for managing environmental and social impacts.                  The
 Directory of Roads (DRCR) with the assistanceo f consultants has undertaken the preparation o f
 an operational manual on environmental procedures and an environmental management plan
 (EMP). A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared by the DRCR's service des
 affaires domaniales.

                                                                                                64

6.      During project preparation, the Bank team has held meetings with the Directory of
Roads, Regional and Provincial Directories, Department of Environment and Local communities
to discuss the environmental and social assessment process and requirements. An evaluation o f
environmental regulations and procedures in Morocco and their conformity with World Bank
requirements was also undertaken. Inaddition, capacities of the various institutions to undertake
environmental assessmentand monitoringwere evaluated.

7.      Moreover, and as part of the preparation process, field visits were undertaken to several
roads that were identified by the Government within the second National Program o f Rural
Roads (NPRR-2) inthe various provinces.

8.      Preparation o f the environmental screening and scoping as well as the EMP of eachrural
road will include public consultation. Provisions to ensure public consultation at each selected
road site have beenintegrated inthe environmental procedures.




                                                                                           65

                   Annex 10.A: SafeguardPolicy Issues EnvironmentalAspects
                                                           -
   1.     Legal and Regulatory Framework The Department o f Environment (DOE) i s the
   government institution responsible for the development o f a national policy for environmental
   management. DOE i s undergoing several review procedures to up-date the country's
   environmental policies and regulations including the preparation o f a law for the protection o f
   environment, as well as norms and standards for environmental protection. The Environmental
   Assessment law No. 12-03 was recently promulgated and publishedinthe official Bulletin(June
   2003). EnvironmentalAssessment (EA) studies are beingundertaken and a national committee
   grouping representatives o f several ministries has been formed for evaluating EA studies.
   According to the law and its Annex, highways and national roads would require a hll
   environmental assessment study similar to World Bank Category A project. However, there i s
   no provision inthe law for the preparation o f an environmental evaluation for other roadprojects
   that might generatepotential negative impacts.

   2.     In addition to the environmental laws that have been prepared by the department of
   environment, several regulations exist inMorocco regarding environmental protection and there
   are several protected areas and national parks. The Government has also ratified a number o f
   international conventions for Environmental Protection including Convention on Biological
   Diversity, Desertification Convention, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,
   Convention on Intemational Trades in Endangered Species o f Wild Fauna and Flora, Vienna
   Convention for the Protection o f the Ozone Layer, Montreal Protocol for the Protection o f the
   Ozone Layer.

   EnvironmentalAssessment

   3.     Environmental Review of Rural Roads to be Funded by the Project: Twelve rural roads
   in eight provinces have been identified as potential projects for first-year funding. A rapid
   environmental review including field visits was conducted to assess impacts that might arise
- .from proposed projects. The identified roads have a total length o f around 185 km, they are
   located inmountainous areas and vary inlengthbetween 7 km and 28 km. None o f these roads
   would have major irreversible environmental impacts; on the contrary, all roads would have a
   positive contribution to the overall environment inthe rural areas by improving safety conditions
   as well as enhancing accessibility to rural infrastructure and services. Adverse impacts could
   occur if the roads are not properly designed, implemented and maintained. Fieldvisits to rural
   roads constructed under NPRR-1were also undertaken to better assess potential adverse impacts
   that might arise from the proposedproject.

   4.     Environmental issuesthat needto be properly addressedduringthe implementation o fthe
   proposed project are mainly construction-related and are limitedto the roads sites; these include
   borrow area operation and redevelopment, environmental degradation due to the opening o f
   quarries, controlling erosion and slope stabilization, as well as disposal o f wastes and other
   construction material. Some hture roads could be located near forests or other ecologically
   sensitive areas. Inhilly terrain o f some provinces, road works may accentuate erosion and affect
   drainage. Moreover, during operation, adequate road maintenance should be implemented to
   avoid the generation o f negative impacts, mainly with respect to clogging o f drainage and
   erosion.

   5.     As the roads to be funded by the proposed project were not all identified prior to
   appraisal, the following eligibility criteria and environmental requirements will be observed
   duringthe implementation o fthe project:

                                                                                              66

       (a) Roads that can have considerable irreversible negative impacts, such as those
           requiring deforestation as well as roads adversely affecting natural habitats,
           biodiversity and cultural heritage sites, will not be approved for hding.
        (b) Roads identified as having only minimal or short term impacts on the environment,
           with no significant adverse impact on communities or important resources would be
            addressed through the implementation o f a limited environmental assessment
            including the preparation o f a site specific environmental management plan (EMP)
            and the incorporation of mitigationmeasures inthe contract documents according to
            the typical examplesprovidedinthe environmental procedures.
        (c) Roads with moderate environmental impacts limited to the sites and with no
            significant adverse impact on communities or important resourceswill be subject to a
            limitedenvironmental assessment includingthe preparation ofa site specific EMP.
        (d) Roadsrequiringthe preparationofEMPswill bereviewedandapprovedbyDRCRas
           part o f its prerogatives. The first three roads will be reviewed by the Bank after
            which only roads costing above US$1.5 million will require prior approval of the
            Bank.
        (e) Although none were found during project preparation and site visits, roads with
           potentially significant adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, or diverse or
           that could affect an area beyond the road site will be subject to a full environmental
            assessment including the development o f an EMP to be implemented andmonitored
            according to the terms ofreference providedinthe environmental procedures manual.
            Theseroads will be subject to review andapproval bythe World Bank.

6.      Site visits revealed that no designated culturalproperty will be impacted by the proposed
project. Inthe unlikelyevent of any such impacts occurring, they will be examined as part o fthe
limitedor full environmental assessment, as applicable, and a detailed conservation plan for the
cultural property will be prepared. Inaddition, procedures forconservation and protection o fthe
                                                                                       ~~


"archeological chance finds" will be included inthe contract documents.

7.      The environmental procedures will specify the environmental screening process and
documentation, scoping, environmental management and mitigation measures to be included in
the biddingand contract documents as well as monitoring procedures duringimplementation.

8.     Assessment of Environmental Capacities: There i s good environmental awareness among
the staff of DRCR, however the capacity o f the DRCR safeguard unit should be strengthened
with respect to environmental requirements such as environmental assessment, mitigation
measures and monitoring. Until the promulgation o f the EA law, DRCR experience has been
limited to EA of road projects that are hnded by international funding agencies. Although,
DRCR will have a full time environmental engineer within its core team, it will be necessaryto
provide the DRCR with technical assistance for environment including training workshops and
provision o f short-term environmental specialist to assist in (i)integrating environmental
procedures as part o f the project cycle and (ii)     reviewing projects that would require the
preparation o f limited or full environmental assessment.        Environmental awareness i s also
present among most provincial and regional directorates that will be executing rural roads.
However, none o f these directorates have environmental specialists among their staff members
and it would be necessary to provide them with technical assistance with respect to
environmental matters.

9.      The Department o f Environment (DOE) has a special division for environmental
assessment studies. Under the Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program
                                                                                            67

(METAP), the World Bank provided several capacity building activities including training
workshops for the division o f environmental impact and other line ministries. At present the
division o f environmental assessment has six staff members for preparing terms o f reference,
reviewing environmental assessment studies and assisting at the meetings of the National
committee. Consequently, the DOE will not be able to provide major technical assistance to
DRCR.

  10.    The private sector including consultancy firms and individual consultants have modest
capacities to carry out full EA studies. Until the promulgation o f the EA law inJune 2003, EA
 studies were limited to projects that are funded by international donors. Most EA studies were
undertaken by consultancy firms with the assistanceo f international consultants or by individual
 consultants basedinuniversities or other institutions. Academic bodies are beginningto develop
their expertise to support thorough EA studies. The promulgation of the EA law is expected to
 create a wider understandingo f the basic principles o f EA. Strengthening o f the national EA
 capacities will also be achieved through the implementation o f the proposed project and other
World Bank projects that are underimplementation and/or preparation.

  11.    The environmental procedures will cover institutional arrangementsrequiredto evaluate
 and monitor the environmental impacts during design, implementation as well as operation and
 maintenance. Public consultations to be undertaken for each rural road and disclosure of the
 EMPfor eachroadwill alsobeaddressedinthe environmentalprocedures.

 EnvironmentalManagementPlan(EMP)

  12.    The objectives o f the EMP are to mitigate adverse environmental impacts identified in
  each road project. The implementation o f the EMP will improve the quality o f projects and will
  ensure the participation of concerned stakeholders. For each road to be financed, the EMP will
  describe mitigation measures that have been designed to mitigate its potential negative effects
  andenhanceitspositiveimpacts, bothduringconstruction andoperation.
~~                                                                          ~




Mitigation Measures
  13.    Mitigation measures identified for each road project shall be properly implemented.
  Typical environmental impacts and possible mitigation measures are given in Table 1 for
  guidance andwill include, butnot be limitedto the following:
         - Designphase: environmentally-sound technical designs will be specified for each
             road to be financed, according to its particular conditions. Issues to be addressed
             include: encroachment on private properties, erosion and slope stabilization,
             provision o f adequate drainage facilities, proper disposal o f waste material, and road
             safety.
         - Constructionphase: constructionmitigationmeasureswillberequiredto minimize
             inconveniences to the public.     Adverse construction activities will be mitigated
             through the adoption o f Good Practice Environmental Procedures, which will be
             developed in the environmental manual and adopted and applied to all projects.
             Contract documents will incorporate all requirements to minimize disturbance from
             construction activities, including proper management o f construction waste; control
             measures for waste fuel, oil and lubricants; provisions for protection o f vegetation,
             actions to reduce noise and dust levels; control o f soil erosion andprotectiono f water
             quality; as well as reinstatement o f areas used for construction camp and for
             temporarily storage o f construction materials. Mitigation measureswill be monitored
             by the DPE Supervision Engineer to ensure compliance with the contract.

                                                                                               68

        -   Operational phase: operational impacts will be addressedas part o fthe operation and
            maintenance o f each road in order to avoid deterioration o f the road and associated
            safety problems. Among the major issues to be addressed during operation are:
            proper hctioningo fdrainage facilities, and erosion control.

Environmental Monitoring
14.     Environmental Monitoring will be the responsibility o f the regional and provincial
directorates o f the MPWT (DREs and DPEs) in close coordination with the relevant authorities
andlocalcommunities andwill include:
        - Compliancemonitoringduringconstruction.
        - Monitoringofsignificantimpactsduringtheoperationofeachroad.

15.     Monitoring indicators shall be developed for both the construction and operation phases
of each road project. Monitoring o f construction activities will have to ensure that mitigation
measures o f construction impacts are being implemented properly, while the monitoring o f
operation i s to ensurethat no unforeseennegative impacts are arising.

16.     Periodic monitoring o f roads will be conducted by DRCR safeguard unit to ensure
compliance with submitted monitoring plan. The functions o f the unit will be to: (i) and
                                                                                       review
approve environmental management plans (EMP) o f roads to be funded under the program; (ii)
monitor compliance with EMP by the various actors involved in the implementation o f the
project; and (iii)collect data to document that the environmental and social procedures are being
met. Moreover, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects will be conducted by a local or
international consultant duringthe midtermreview andat the end o fthe project.

Institutional Strengthening
17.     Environmental expertise within the implementing and executing bodies will be
strengthened. Training programs will be designed and implemented with the assistanceo f local
or international experts andwill target two levels:
        (a) DRCR, DPE and DRE stafl Training workshop will be provided to the staff o f
            DRCR, DPE and DRE to raise environmental awareness and to clarify the specific
            environmental requirements related to design and implementation o f the proposed
            project. The training workshop will include case studies andwill cover the following
            topics:
            --   EAtechniques
                 Screening projects for environmental review
            -
            -    Use o fpractical checklists
                 Best environmental practices indesign and implementation o fprojects
            -    Effective implementation o fmitigation measures
            --   Project supervision
                 Monitoring and evaluation

        (b) Communities, and Contractors: Workshops for local communities and contractors,
            focusing on public awareness, case studies o f environmental issues experienced in
            similar rural road projects, use o f environmental procedures and implementation o f
            mitigation measures.

18.     Cost Estimates: The cost o f implementingthe environmental management plan includes
the cost of: (a) environmental mitigation measures (included as part o fthe cost o f each road); (b)
monitoring of construction and operation activities (included in the cost o f construction
                                                                                             69

supervision and the cost o f operation and maintenance); and (c) institutional strengthening o f the
implementing and executing agencies as well as concerned stakeholders. An estimated amount
of US$lOO,OOO        will be allocated for institutional strengthening and for meeting the
environmental requirements o f the proposed project as detailed in Table 2 and in accordance
with the schedule given inTable 3.

19.    Additional Actions to be Undertaken: To ensure the environmental and social
sustainability o f the project, the following environmental requirements will be observed:
       - Appointqualifiedpersonneltothesafeguardunit.

       - Prepareregularreportsonthe ontheprogressoftheproject includingthe status of
           EMPpreparation andDevelopment.

  Annex 10.B: Safeguard Policy Issues Social Aspects -Resettlement Policy Framework
                                             -
A.      INTRODUCTIONAND PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1.      The Rural Roads Project i s intendedto provide better access to social and administrative
services to improve the quality o f life o f rural populations. The project has two components: (a)
construction and improvement o f about 625 kilometers o f roads which are part o f the first phase
o f the Second Program for National Rural Roads (PNRR-2), and (b) technical assistance and
training to strengthen the planning and management capacity for rural roads within the
Directorate o fRoads (DRCR).

2.      The project will be implemented by the DRCR which is responsible for managing,
monitoring, evaluating and coordinating the activities. The DRCR has an environment and
social unit as well as a department responsible for handlingland issues. This unit i s responsible
for managing environmental affairs and land expropriation issues necessary to construct roads to
be financed by the project. These two sections will ensure that eachroad respondsto the social
and environment criteria. The unit is composed of an environment specialist, and an engineer
responsible for social issues.

3.      This Policy Framework defines the land acquisition and compensation requiredfor Rural
Roads projects throughout the Project areas.          The principles described in this policy are
consistent with Moroccan law and Bank policy which includes expropriation o f land whether or
not there i s physical movement o f people. Since the roads share common characteristics, this
policy framework will apply to all roadsbuiltunder the Project.

B.      PRINCIPLESAND OBJECTIVESGOVERNINGRESETTLEMENTAND LAND
        ACQUISITION

R a l e for expropriation of land
4.      The requirements for land to be acquired are determined by the engineering designs in
eachparticular case, andresult fiom a) the type o f traffic the road will accommodate; andb) the
topography o fthe land, where varyingwidths and/or alignments o froadmay berequired.

5.      Inanyroaddesignundertheprojecttherearethreescenarios:
        - Roadconstructedwithinexistingrights of way,withnoexpropriation required This
            i s the case for the vast majority o froads under the project since the works are mainly
            to improvethe conditions of existingroads inthe officially classifiedroadnetwork.
        - Expropriation of small tracts of landfor expansion or realignment: Some roads
            within the classified network may require expansion or realignment and thus
            necessitate land acquisition. The required land must be acquired by the DRCR. This
            acquisition could be done through expropriation, amicable arrangement or land
            donation. Amicable arrangement or land donation are governed by the Dahir which
            covers the code o f obligations and contracts.
        - Communitydonation of landfor rural roads thatarenotpart of theDRCRnetwork
            under state control: Inpartnershipwith local authorities, through the DREDPE, the
            DRCR i s also constructing rural roads that are not managed by the state but which
            will improve rural population's road access. Because these roads will be managedby
            the communal authorities they are responsible for acquiring land needed for their


                                                                                                 73

            construction or rehabilitation. Local communities or other property holders, are eager
            to donate small tracts o f land for roads because o f the dramatic opportunities roads
            bring. Many o f these roads already exist and therefore, works mostly involve quality
            improvement. However, others might involve new construction. Land acquired for
            suchwork will be done through voluntary community donation.

Minimization of expropriationof land
6.      Typically, land requirements for roads improvements are moderate, not more than 5
meters wide. The expropriation o f private land i s minimized inaccordance with Moroccan law,
which requires public infrastructure projects o f any nature to make maximum use o fpublic land,
andonly to resort to expropriation when there isno alternative. Minimal expropriation o fprivate
land also serves the interest o f the provincial offices o f the DRCR and the communes which are
obliged to pay compensation awarded by independent assessment as explained below. The
DRCRtakes great care to avoid disturbingexisting structures, especially residences, farms, areas
o fcultural, religious or cultural heritage or other areas o fpublic value.

Legalprocess is obligatory
7.      All expropriations mustbecarried out according to the provisions ofMoroccanlaw. The
law o f expropriation defines the procedures to be followed and protects the rights o f all parties
involved.     Wrongs committed during expropriation may be redressed by the courts with
provisionfor payment o f damages andpunishmento foffenders

Compensationand eligibilityprinciples
8.      Whenever expropriation o f private land i s unavoidable, Moroccan law clearly indicates
that land should be expropriated through full compensation at market value, independently
determined, with advancepublic notice, negotiation andright o f appeal. Rightsto compensation
extend to owners, tenants, workers, or any person who can demonstrate any interest lost as a
result o f expropriation as longas thepare acknowledgedbythe 1andh-dduringjhepenod o f
public inquiry.

Legaland InstitutionalFramework
9.      Moroccan law Number 7-81 permits the expropriation o f land for public use. The law
allows temporary occupation o f land in the event that no agreement with property owners has
been reached on the proposed compensation in order to permit the expropriating agency to
conduct preparatory works, remove materials or to set up the work site. The law protects those
who either do not have formal land title or do not have sufficient documentation to prove
ownership.

10.     Law number 12-90 on urbandevelopment (Zoi sur Z'urbanisme) also states that roadside
landowners (riverains) must contribute a portion o f their landequivalent to a rectangle about 10
meters wide and the lengtho fthe faqade o fthe parcel. This contribution, however, should not be
more than a quarter o fthe parcel.

B.      DESCRIPTIONOF PROCEDUREFORPREPARINGAND APPROVING LAND
        ACQUISITION PLANS(per MoroccanLaw and OP 4.12)

11.     The expropriating authority is the relevant DRE/DPE responsible for road construction.
The following steps apply in this project whereby the DRJYDPE prepares a Land Acquisition
Plan.


                                                                                                 74

             The DRCR through its provincial offices is responsible for establishing the public
             necessity o f constructing the roads and drawing up terms o f reference for the
             consultant engineers.
             Consulting engineers, under the oversight o f the DREDPE, do a land survey to
             determine and define the width and length o f each parcel along the road after its
             boundaries (emprise) have been determined by the feasibility study. They also
             provide a preliminary description o f the land use. One o f the criteria includes
             minimizing expropriation impacts on private land. At this stage, landexpropriation
             requirements are known inbroad outline.

             Once the dimensions o f the road are known, an investigation committee i s
             established composed o f the following: (i)representative o f the expropriating
             agency (DREDPE), (ii)       representative o f the local administration authority, (iii)
             property owners or users, and (iv) the surveyor responsible for establishing the plan
             The commission prepares minutesofmeetings for eachparcel which includes:
                (i)   The boundaries o f the parcel affected by the project, its surface area, legal
                      status, registratiodtitle status, communal land, state land privately owned,
                      etc.
                (ii)Namesoftheowners/usersofthelandandanyotherrelevantinformation
                      about them (first and last names, address, landowner, user, national ID card
                      numbersetc).
                (iii)Descriptionoflanduse(housing,business,stable,factory).
                (iv) List o fequipmentonthe land(well, irrigationsystem, electricityetc).
                (v) Describes the agricultural uses(type oftrees, numberetc).
                (vi) A qualitative andquantitative descriptiono fthe agricultural uses.
             This information i s documented and signed by the property owners/users and each
             member o fthe commission.
             Basedon this investigation, the surveyor preparesthe LandAcquisition Plan andthe
             inventory o f eacho fthe parcels.
             On review o f the evidence, and on finding the application justified, the DRCR gives
             permission to the DREDPEto beginthe processo f expropriation.

InformationandConsultationwith Project-AffectedPersons
12.     Moroccan expropriation procedures include publicly informing concerned parties. The
procedure requires the public announcement o f an intent to expropriate at least twice in a
national newspaper and in the Bulletin oficial. The draft "order o f cessation o f ownership''
(Z'ucte de cessibilitk, an administrative order which authorizes the agency to launch the
expropriation process o f specific property) i s submitted to the Conservation fonci2re which
registers the land identifiedfor expropriation inthe landtitle andrequisitions. Ifthe landi s not
registered, this informationi s recorded inapublic register dedicated to this purpose andplaced at
the relevant administrative tribunal.

13.     The expropriation proposals andplans are posted inthe offices o fthe relevant communes
(plans parcellaires). The publication o f the expropriation acts i s followed by an administrative
reviewwhich is completed within two months o fpublication inthe bulletinofficial inthe offices
o f the relevant communes. The public during this time may review the plans and provide


                                                                                                 75

       comments, questions/concems or objections which i s documented in an official register that i s
       reserved for this purpose.

        14.    Locally elected representativesare well informed o f the DREDPE's action plansintheir
       respective regions. Thus, they play an active role in informing their constituents o f the
       expropriation plans.

        15.    The findings are then submitted to the Secretary General of the Government which
       verifies the correct application of the procedure and publishes the "cessation of landtitle'' inthe
       Bulletin official.  The Prime Minister provides the clearance o f expropriation decrees before
       publication in the Bulletin oflcial. An announcement o f the decree i s thenpublishedin a local
       newspaper and the complete text o f the decree is posted in the offices o f the communes for
       public information andresponse.

       D.      ESTIMATEDPOPULATIONDISPLACEMENT

        16.    In the present project, no physical displacement of persons, residences, or economic
       enterprisesi s expected and any suchinstanceswill be fully detailed inthe LAP.

       E.      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FORDEFINING CATEGORIES OF DISPLACED
               PERSONS

        17.    Inlandwith defineduse, the law explicitly recognizes for the purposes of entitlement to
       compensation all holders o f any rights.     The following main categories o f right holders are
       entitledfor compensationwhere loss canbe established.
               (i) Owners
               (ii)Tenantsoroccupant
               (iii)Usufructiers
-          (iv)      Owners o ftrees or other permanent improvements or equipaent     - - -
     ~




               (v)   People who use the land for commercial purposes

        F.     METHODS OFEVALUATINGASSETS

        18.    Valuation Commission: The expropriation law specifies that valuation o f losses or
        damages is determined by a commission. The commission, headedby the representative o f the
        local administrative authority, consists o f the following permanent members: head o f the
        circonscription domaniale or a person designated by himher, the receveur de 1'enregistrement
        or person delegated by himher and representative o f the expropriating entity. Non permanent
       members o fthe commission are the following:
               - InRuralareas:therepresentativeoftheprovincialrepresentativeoftheMinistryof
                   Agriculture and the inspector o frural taxation.
               - Urbanareas:theinspectorofurbantaxationorhisherdesignateandtheinspectorof
                   urbanaffairs or hisher designate.

        19.     Methods of Compensation: Direct damages due to expropriation are compensated, but
       uncertain, indirect or speculative damages are not compensated. The valuationmethodtakes into
        account the value o f assets and land at market value rate at the time the expropriation decree is
        issued. Improvements made to the value o f the land after the decree cannot be compensated,
        unless prior agreement with the expropriating agency has been made. The compensation rates



                                                                                                        76

will not include any price changes that might have occurred by speculators as a result of the
expropriationdecree.

20.     Institutional responsibility for compensation: The DREDPE are responsible for
expropriation o f roads that are under the management o f the state. Affected individuals must
properly establish ownership rights.    If affected individuals do not have sufficient proof of
ownership, the compensation amount i s placed in the "caisse de depot et de gestion" until
sufficient documentation has been established. An official announcement i s made that the
compensation amount has been deposited and the expropriation decree i s posted inthe relevant
commune office.      After six months, if there are no objections, the claimant receives the
compensation along with the interest accumulated inthe caisse de depot.

21.     Grievance mechanisms: Landowners have legal recourse for contesting expropriation
decrees. However, ajudge may accord the expropriating agency rights to take the landwhile the
case is incourt as long as the compensation is paid to the landowner. The judge may propose a
new amount during the appeal. The additional amount will then be awarded to the property
owners (ifthey have land title) or placed in the Caisse de Depot et de Gestion (if the title i s
insufficient) following the procedures above.

22.     All other cases. Any affected personmay appealto the court for redress. The court has
the power to hear submissions, review the process, and make such provisions as it deems fit.
These includeordering compensation to bepaid or haltingworks.

23.     Land Donation: Rural communities are acutely aware of the costs of poor road access
and their isolation and are prepared to donate small tracts o f land that will bring with it
considerable economic, social and welfare benefits. According to ownership, land may be
provided for roads by the following: (a) communities (b) individual owners on behalf o f the
community or (c) the commune in case o f communal property. The Government o f Morocco's
and the Bank's interest is inensuring that these donations are made formally and ina genuinely
~-
voluntary manner, avoiding injustice and hardships for donors. As a result, the DRCX, through
the DPEDRE is responsible for ensuring that this process i s properly documented and
formalized. The DREDPE will have in its records documentation related to land donation,
includingcopies o f signed contracts.

G.      PROCEDURESFORINFORMING THE BANK

24.     The details o f planned expropriation, together with details o f any expropriations for the
project that have already been undertaken, are consolidated in a Land Acquisition Plan. This i s
the basis upon which compensations are determined and are therefore prepared with great care.
The procedures for the LAP are harmonized with Moroccan law and Bank policies. The DRCR
ensures that the LAP conforms to the requirements o f Bank policy and submits the LAP
monitoringplan (see attached form at the end o f this annex) as part o f the procurement package
to the Bank, which approvesthe plans that conform to Bank requirements for financing.

H.      MONITORING OFIMPLEMENTATION

25.     The DRCR i s responsible for monitoring the correct implementation o f the Resettlement
Policy Framework and the Land Acquisition Plan for all types o f land to ensure that project
affected people are protected in the terms outlined in this framework. In each case, when any
type o f land acquisition and compensation is involved the LAP monitoring plan is completed.
This table informs the Bank and also serves as a monitoringdevice showing all actions involved,

                                                                                                 77

  the responsible agency, expected completion date, the reason(s) for any delay and new expected
  completion date.

  InstitutionalCapacityBuilding
  26.     Although the DRCRhas a well qualified expropriations department, the project requires
  early planningwhich ensures that the parcels are acquired sufficiently early to avoid any delays.
  The project intends capacity building for the DRE and the DPE relating to planning for land
  acquisition inorder to avoid any delays inimplementing civil works. This capacity buildingwill
  be supported through technical assistance by a national consultant with supervision by the
  Service de Domaine Public.           As a result, the training will also include representatives o f
  communal andprovincial authorities.

  27.     Training will (i) the necessaryprocedures for landacquisition, as well as methods
                                clarify
  for planningland surveys related to implementing roadworks, (ii)       provide methods for effective
  public consultation for all forms o f land acquisition, and (iii)methods for supervision,
  monitoring andevaluation.

                             MOROCCO: RURALROADPROJECT

Social impact of roads

 1.      Poverty in Morocco: Morocco is a rapidly urbanizing country, although poverty remains
a largely rural phenomenon where nearlytwo thirds o f the poor live. The heavy trend inrural to
urbanmigrationis fueled bythe increaseanddeepeningo fpovertyinrural areas. Provinces with
the highest incidences o f poverty are Meknks Tafilalet (29%), Fes Boulmane, Taza-A1 and
Hoceima-Taounate, Doukala-Abda, Marrackech-Tensfit-Alouaz which account for nearly 40%
o f the total share o f the poor. Without road access, the poor are trapped in their geographic
enclaves, unable to access social services (schools, health centers), realize their economic
potential (unable to market their goods or choose what goods to buy) or realize their rights as
citizens (e.g. travel easily to obtain national identification cards). The isolation o f the rural poor
fiom the rest o f the nation is accentuated by the topography o f the country where high
mountains, deep rocky gorges and desert dunes serve as insurmountable physical barriers.

2.       Beneficiaries of the project: The Rural Roads project, that will support the second
National Program o f Rural Roads "-2)            i s designed to link poor and isolated inhabitants o f
the rural areas to social andadministrative services and markets. Criteria for the road selection o f
the program include population size (at least 50 households in a douar) and access (douars
located at least a kilometer away from an all weather road). Poorer and isolated areas will be
targeted for poverty alleviation. The program also uses other criteria such as economic potential
o f the area (agriculture and tourism), distance from SociaUadministrative services and
connectivity o fthe roadnetwork to establishpriority roads among a list o f eligible ones.

 3.      A beneficiary survey recently completed as part ofthe preparation ofthe Implementation

               Report (ICR) for the preceding road project demonstrated that the construction o f

                                                            ~                             ~

         - Improvementinqualityandchoiceoftransportservices.
         - Betteraccessto andchoiceofbasicgoodsandfoodstuffs, oftenaccompaniedwitha
             drop inprices.
         - Decrease inthe operating costs of vehicles resultingin lower transport costs for
             passengers and freight.

 4.      Poor access to social services: Poor road access not only severely constrains the ability
 of rural inhabitants to reach social services but also has a negative impact on the quality o f
 services delivered. For example, few teachers are willing to accept jobs where road access i s
 difficult, this is especially true o f women which in tum has a negative impact on girls' school
 enrolment rates. Once personnel are recruited, rural services often suffer ffom a high rate o f
 absenteeism.Teachers who go to their home towns on weekends or go to the market to buy their
 provisions have difficulty finding transportation to return to the village. In field visits to rural
 areas during preparation o f the project,     villagers mentioned the more regular presence o f
 teachers as one o f the primary benefits o f the roads. A 1998 study o f two rural roads in the
 province o f Tiznit showed that school enrolment increased dramatically, especially for girls
 (23%, compared to 12% for boys). Inthe village o f Tiffret N'ailHamza, located inthe heart of
 the Atlas mountains inthe province o f Azilal, residents described how prior to the road, women
 in labor were carried on the backs of villagers over several hours to reach the nearest health
                                                                                                     86

    center. Often, they died duringthejourney. Villagers citedthe reduction inmaternal mortality as
    one o f the most tangible benefits o f the road. With a good road network, it would be more cost
    effective to have few well equipped and staffed health centers where patients can be transported
    by ambulance rather than the current system of scattered and poorly functioning rural health
    units. The DRCR can be a catalyst for coordinating investments in infrastructure and social
    services so as to maximize their benefits.

     5.      Rural inhabitants are isolatedfrom markets and income generation opportunities: Lack
    o f roads and an inefficient transport system are a serious barrier to achieving rural development
    and significantly contribute to urban migration. Reliable and efficient transport affects the
    availability o f goods, prices on agricultural inputs and production. Poor households are forced to
    remain in subsistence agriculture, unable to bring their goods to markets. In one village in the
    Atlas mountains located 120kilometers from the nearest town, villagers explained that they used
    to walk for a fill day to bring their livestock to the nearest market. After the arduous journey,
    the livestock arrived in poor condition and could only command a low price.                With the
    construction o f the road, villagers now have access to animal feed which has raised productivity
    by about 20%, can transport the livestock on trucks and command a 50% higher price. Time
    savings, that can be used inother productive activities, are one o f the most important benefits o f
    the road. Increased contacts with urban areas and increased revenue has also meant that rural
    residents are able to invest in new communications technologies. Villagers described how with
     added income, they have been able to hire shepherds, equip them with cell phones, check on
    marketprices and send their livestock where they are likely to bringahigherprice. The impact
     o f roads i s also felt inthe dramatic drop o fprices o f basic supplies. Inthe commune o f "hilt in
     the province of Taroudant, located on the eastern mountainous region for instance, the price o f
    LPG dropped from MAD 100 to MAD 45, the cost o f public transportation from the village to
     the provincial capital declined from MAD 5OODto MAD 40, time savings went from two hours
    to 40 minutes.

-~h. Isolation,Urbanmjptionand-                                                         a    o     f deep
     isolation and real marginalization o f the rural poor. Not only are they unable to leave their
     localities, but outsiders cannot come. Inparticular, government officials, be it at a national or
     even provincial level, have limited knowledge o f the needs o f the isolated populations. As an
     elder inone village noted, "now that we have the road, we have more visits by people from the
     government because before, they never liked to come to our village because they would arrive
     covered in dust." With the trend in urban migration, the lack o f roads also contributes to the
     flagmentation of families and communities. Children sent to live with relatives innearby towns
     can only periodically return to visit their families. In many communities, people discussed the
     frequent return visits o f such children and even those who have immigrated outside the country
     thus maintaining ties with their families and communities. Inmanyprovinces, such as Taroudant,
     the expansion o f the rural road network has also been accompanied by investments in
     construction and other economic activities, revitalizing these rural areas. Information generates
     knowledge that people can adopt for learning new ways of doing things.

     7.      Gender and Roads: The gender gaps in health, education and employment are one o f
     Morocco's most significant developmental challenges. Improved road access provides girls
     better educational opportunities. Women, in rural areas in particular, suffer from deep isolation
     dueto severerestrictions on their mobility and limited economic opportunities. The presence o f
     a reliable road network makes travel safer, allowing women to enjoy social exchange (e.g.
    marriedwomen can easily visit their families andhomevillages).



                                                                                                       87

        Participation and the RuralRoads Project

         8.      The roads to be improved under the project are part o f the provincial priority programs
         o frural roads (PPRR), initially preparedby the DRCRon the basis o f a road inventory andthen
        presented to provincial and local authorities. The priority rural roads programs are approved by
         the Provincial Councils with the participation o f all the communes concerned. The communes
        confirm their commitment to the localrural roads to be improvedunderthe NPRR-2 by signing a
         specific provincial agreements(SPA), committing the commune to provide landfor right-of-way
         and to maintain the roads once improved. Provincial Council (Conseil Provincial) members are
         elected representatives where each commune either directly or indirectly is represented. In
         addition, there i s also a parallel administrative structure o f state appointed officials, based on
         territory and a system o f hierarchical jurisdictions from provincial /prefectoral level to
         administrative circles. Delivery o f public services is beginning to be decentralized the local
        population a stronger say for determining priorities for government expenditures. This provides
         an opportunity for greaterparticipation o f locally elected representativesto make decisions about
         the region's development.

         9.      The DRCR has made a concerted effort to ensure that the priority roads identified inthe
         annual program respond to local needs. In practice, this i s often done through regular and
         frequent interactions with govemors. However, local leaders (both elected andnon-elected), also
         frequently lobby the provincial directors so that roads o f their preference are given greater
         priority. Better organized communes (or communities) are often able to pushfor roads that most
        benefit them. Given that the degree o f sociaL'community organization is highly variable in
         Morocco, the level o f involvement o f elected leaders at the communal level is also variable.
         Regions such as Taroudant which have a high degree o f social capital (and social organization)
         and strong traditions o f kmigrC investment have successfully mobilized funds from their
         communities, donated land and established partnerships with the DRCR to co-finance roads.
         However, such community participationinthe co-financing o f roads has been limited. With the
--ion               of two p r x w i n c e s - - T a m u d ~ J b' m k~ h m o b i l i z e
                                                                                 '   u
         funds for roadworks. Mobilizationof funds from communities for roads is difficult becauseof
         the large amounts necessary and the poverty o f the community. There i s also a problem o f
         distribution o f costs and benefits, in that although the road will benefit the community, many
         more passersbywho are not from the community andwould therefore not pay for it, will equally
         benefit.

         10.     Provincial and local authorities, based on the draft provincial programs o f priority rural
         roads (PPRR) prepared by the DRCR, review priority rural roads proposed for inclusion in the
         NPRR-2, make recommendations and contribute towards final approval of the PPRR.

         Operationalizing Social Development inthe RuralRoads Project

         11.     The DRCR will bring added value to rural roads through the following social
         development interventions.
                 (a) Community participation in planning and implementing infrastructure works for
                     communities along ruralroads.
                 (b) Better measure, monitor and document socioeconomic impacts o f roads through
                     systematic data collection.
                 (c) Indepththematic studies on the sociological impacts o froads.
                 (d) Promote activities for local economic development linkedto roads.
                 (e) Land acquisition for roadrehabilitationor construction.


                                                                                                           88

     12.   The DRCR will appoint one o f its engineers who has had hands-on experience in the
     provincial offices to work in the "environment and social development unit" who will be in
     charge of coordinating and supervising these interventions. In addition, at the level o f the
     DPEDRE, a person responsible for social development will also be identified. Their
     responsibilities are included as part o fthe description o f eacho fthe activities below.
           (a) Community participation in planning and implementing infrastructure works for
                communities along rural roads: Small scale civil works will be carried out along
                roads in selected communes designed to enhance the quality o f rural life, requiring
                only limitedadditional funds due to economies o f scale. Many o f the areas where the
                roads will be constructed lack markets, pedestrian crossing points, speed bumps,
                access for the old or disabled, sidewalks, public transportation stops, parking etc.
                These works will be selected following a participatory process andwill be limitedto
                infrastructure related to roads. These types o f investments will be identified during
                the feasibility studiesby the consultants following a participatory process. The person
                responsible for social development at the DRCR will monitor the consultants and
                ensure that the identification o fthe civil works is done inaparticipatorymanner.
           (b) Better measure, monitor and document socioeconomic impacts of roads through
                systematic data collection: (a) Baseline data collection      - this activity calls for the
                systematic collection o f selected socioeconomic indicators as they relate to roads and
                are to be done during the feasibility studies, in conjunction with the environmental
                assessments. These data will be collected by the DPE and the DREs with the
                assistanceo f the CNER. The DPE and DREswill transmit these data to the CNER or
                the firm selected for monitoring and evaluation o f PNRR-2 so they would analyze
                andpresent these data. (b) Collecting monitoring and evaluation indicators: after the
                construction o f the road (one or two years later), data will be gathered periodically in
                a representative sample o f roads financed by the Bank in each o f the provinces. An
                illustrative list o f indicators to be monitored is included at the end o f the present
-__             annex-; These data will a l s 8 - + t h p = W i 1 1                                tmnsmit
                the information to the CNER or the firm responsible for monitoring and evaluation o f
                PNRR-2.
           (c) I n depth thematic studies on the sociological impacts of roads: Thematic sociological
                studies will enable the DRCR to better coordinate its programs with that o f other
                sectors (education, health etc) anddonors. Itwill also enable the government to assess
                the impact ofrural roads inimproving the lives of ruralpopulation. These studies will
                be conducted usingrigorous data collection and analysis methods inorder to establish
                causal relationships. Examples o f such studies are "rural roads and their impact on
                social services," "rural roads and community isolation," "road accidents and the
                disabled," "rural women and the road network," "the participatory process and its
                impact on the quality o fthe road network." Qualitative and quantitative methods will
                be used inthese studies. The studies will be conducted by sociologists (consultants)
                through the CNER and will be hired for specific studies through a competitive
                process.
           (d) Promote activitiesfor local economic development linked to roads: This activity will
                allow opportunities for local economic development inrural areas which make use o f
                rural roads through a collaboration with the Social Fund for Development (ADS).
                These activities could include the following activities: (a) creation o f agricultural
                cooperatives for local produce (b) rural tourism (c) car repair and maintenance (d)
                processing o f local produce (e) making and marketing o f local artisanal work (f)
                public (mass) transportation (g) private system for local school transportation. The

                                                                                                         89

            profitability o f these activities will be improved by training and advice on improving
            locally produced goods and their marketing and commercialization. Efforts will be
            made to ensure that women will particularly benefit from these activities. Those
            charged with social development at the DREDPE are responsible for assisting the
            communities in contacting and interacting with ADS. Those responsible for "social
            development" are also in charge o f periodic monitoring and documentation o f this
            experience. An agreement between ADS and the DRCR will be signed to formalize
            this activity.

CapacityBuildingfor integratingsocialdevelopment

13.     A training program will be prepared and implementedinorder to strengthen the capacity
of those who are in charge o f social development issues at the DRCR and the DREDPE level.
The training will include but not be limited to the following themes: (a) quantitative data
collection methods for completing the questionnaires (social development indicators) attached to
the end o f this annex) and simple reports (b) sociological analysis, including monitoring and
evaluation (c) economic activities linked to rural roads and (d) participatory approaches and
social mobilization. The training will be conducted by consultants recruited through CNER. It is
also possible to carry out study tours in countries where roads projects have integrated social
development concerns (e.g. Peru) for those charged with social development.

14.     Monitoring and evaluation of the social and environmental unit: The TORS for the
national and local level staff working on social development will be included in the project's
operations manual (PIP). Evaluations will be conducted at mid-tem and end o fthe project ofthe
unit's activities

          Annex 16: StrategicDirectionsofthe SecondNationalProgramofRuralRoads
                          MOROCCO: RURALROADSPROJECT


1.       Rural development i s one o f the key objectives o f the govemment. Programs aimed to
facilitate access to rural infiastructure and services help meet those objectives since the rural
populationhas suffered, for many years, from deficient infrastructure. Lack o f roads providing
all-weather accessibility remains a major national concern. The Ministry o f Public Works and
Transport (MPWT), considering the important results and socioeconomic impact o f the First
National Program o f Rural Roads that was launched in 1995 (currently being completed), has
prepared a follow-up program. This is the SecondNational Program o f Rural Roads (NPRR-2),
that aims to provide access to roads to most o fthe ruralpopulation by 2015.

2.       The NPRR-2, while continuing the development o f the rural network initiated under the
NPRR-1, will introduce a number o f improvements based on the lessons learned from the first
program. The main features o f the Second Program are: (a) a focus on accessibility; (b) strong
participatory planning at the provincial level; (c) sound technical, economic, social           and
environmental standards; (d) diversified financing, includingborrowingbythe newly established
Caisse de Financement Routier, CFR --whose purpose i s to mobilize resources to accelerate the
program-- and contributionbyprovinces, communes and local communities; (e) attention to the
preservation o f rural road assets, especially o f the local rural roads by the communes and
provinces; (0 promotion o f local economic development opportunities to enhance the roads'
benefits; and (g) appropriate monitoring and evaluation arrangements including a broad
dissemination o fthe program's implementation and results.

Accessibility as the ProgramObjective.

3.       Rural roads are essential to reduce the isolation o f the rural population. They provide
&+eonnectioiw to economic, social and &mkis&-ative centers and aewss to provincial,
regional and national roads. When the NPRR-1 i s completed in 2005, about 54 percent o f the
rural populationwill be made accessible to an all-weather road. The 15,000 kilometers o f roads
planned to be improved under the NPRR-2 are expected to bring the accessibility level to 80
percent by 2015. The NPRR-2, in addition to raising overall rural road accessibility, will also
reduce the differentials existing today between the more accessible provinces and the less
accessible ones.

ParticipatoryPlanning

4.       Road investments to be financed under the NPRR-2 will be selected through a bottom-
up, participatory planningprocess. This process will be underpinned by a rigorous inventory of
rural roads at the provincial level, and a pre-identification o f the roads to be included in
provincialprograms that have already been carried out.

5.       The inventory and pre-identificationofroads were prepared by the Directorate o f Roads
(DRCR) in close coordination with its decentralized offices. The roads pre-identified in the
provincial programs were selected based on two analyses: (a) the first, at the national and
provincial level, focused on the contribution to increasing accessibility, with priority given to the
roads serving the largest amount o fpeople and to those contributing to reduce the differential in
accessibility between the provinces less accessible and those most accessible, (b) the second,
took into account the contributionto connectivitywith the classified roadnetwork.


                                                                                                   93

6.      The inventory together with the pre-identified program, and the selection criteria that
were used, will be presentedineachprovince to the local authorities (elected representatives and
officials o f the provinces and communes) and to the local communities. This will allow them to
participate inthe planning process, confirm or change initial priorities, and makea final selection
o f the roads to be included in the provincial programs o f priority rural roads (PPRR). The
consolidation o f all the PPRP will constitute the Second National Program o f Rural Roads
(NPRR-2). The Directorate o f Roads (DRCR) and the provincial (DPE) and regional (DRE)
directorates o f the MPWT will assist in this participative planning process with a view to
ensuringconsistency.

SoundTechnical,Economic, Social and EnvironmentalStandards

7.       Based on the lessons o f the First Program, design criteria have been improved to better
take into account: (a) in the case o f paved roads, the level and composition o f the traffic to
ensure that optimal pavement structures are adopted, and (b) in the case o f unpaved roads, the
objective to allow their operation year round.

8.       The NPRR-2 roads should meet acceptable economic criteria, either a satisfactory
economic return, or acceptablecost-effectiveness for the roads with very low traffic.

9.      Social and environmental considerations will be integrated inthe design, implementation
andmaintenance o fthe roads. The DRCRhaspreparedan operational manualon environmental
and social procedures that will guidethe environmental and social management o f the program,
and that includes a framework for land acquisition and resettlement that may be necessary as a
result of the clearing o f right-of-ways. The DRCR will strengthen is capacity for social and
environmental work, through training at both the central and the provincialhegional levels. The
DRCRwill continue to carry out surveys and studies to assess the socioeconomic impacts o f the
ruralroads.

                                   ~                                      __
Financingof the Program

10.     The NPRR-2 will be financed in part through the resources o f the Road Fund (Fonds
Spkcial Routier- FSR).      A law passed in 2004 created a public entity, the Caisse pour le
Financement Routier (CFR).        The purpose o f the CFR is to mobilize, through borrowing,
additional resources to those o f the FSR and the national budget, in order to accelerate the
NPRR-2 program and to ensure that the program's accessibility objective will be achieved (by
20015).

11.     The NPRR-2 financing plan also includes contributions bythe provinces, communes and
local associations.     The financial contributions as well as commitments relative to the
maintenance o f the local rural roads to be improvedunder the NPRR-2 will be stated inspecific
agreementsbetween Regional and Provincial Directorates o f the MPWT and their local partners
involvedinthe NPRR-2.

PreservationofRoadAssets

12.     The effort over the next years required to implement the NPRR-2 will not lessen attention
to roadmaintenance andthe need to preserve the whole road network. The MPWT gives a high
priority to the maintenance o f the classified road network, whose condition should continue to
improve thanks to the resourcesallocated by the RoadFund(FSR) to road maintenance.



                                                                                                 94

     13.     The MPWT i s equally concerned with the sustainability o f the investments financed
     under the NPRR-2 program, and the socioeconomic benefits they generate. Inthis context, the
     MPWT will put special attention to ensure that the local rural roads (communal and non-
     classified) are properly managed andmaintained. Inthis context, the MPWT will:

             (a)  raise local governments' (communes and provinces) awareness so that they
                  undertake the necessary actions to contribute to the financing o f the local rural roads
                  o f the NPRR-2, and take responsibilityfor the maintenance o f these roads, and

             (b) ensure that Specific Agreements be signed between the DPE and the provinces
                   and/or communes that have local rural roads includedinthe NPRR-2, with a view to
                  makingcertain that they providethe right-of-way whenever necessary, contribute to
                  the road's financing, and guarantee their future maintenance. Works on local rural
                  roads projects included in the NPRR-2 will not be started until the respective
                   Agreements become effective.

     14.     The above actions will be complemented by others that may be needed to ensure an
     effective responsibility for the local rural roads, whose length will increase by over 5,000
     kilometers when the NPRR-2 is completed. Proposals the MPWT will prepare for this purpose
     willbe defined basedon a studythat will belaunched at the outset o fthe NPRR-2.

     Local Economic Opportunities

     15.     The improved rural road accessibility resulting from the roads to be improvedunder the
     NPRR-2 will generate many opportunities for economic development at the local level. It is
     intended to train the DPE staff inthe identification o f such opportunities so that they can, with
     assistance from specialized entities such as Ageme de Developpement Social (ADS), help the
     local communities materialize the opportunities.

~-   Monitoring andEvahation, and Dissemination

     16.     At the outset ofthe "-2,        a Monitoring and Evaluation(M&E) system will be put in
     place to ensure a rigorous and systematic monitoring of program implementationand o f impact
     on the level o f road accessibility by the rural population. To this end, contractual arrangements,
     based on well defined Terms o f Reference, will be preparedby the DRCR. Such arrangements
     will entrust the National Center o f Road Studies andResearch (CNER) with the design o f the
     M&E, assistance for the preparation o f the PPRR, monitoring implementation progress, and
     evaluating the roads' impacts especially as regards improving accessibility.

     17.     Information on the progress with implementation, and evaluation of PPRR impacts will
     be broadly disseminated. Inparticular, dissemination will be made for the provincial and central
     authorities o f different sectors, especially health and education as well as other infi-astructure
     (water, rural electricity). This dissemination will be expected to help facilitate the updating of
     programs dealing with rural infrastructure projects and social services taking into account the
     increased accessibility to roads. In tum, this should contribute to a better integration o f rural
     development programs.
