The project comprises: (a) construction\n            of 38 new wells; (b) repair of 102 existing wells; (c)\n            establishment of two units to maintain 821 wells in the main\n            livestock producing areas; and, (d) strengthening of the\n            Livestock Development Unit established by UNDP in 1969. The\n            project would play a very important part in the\n            Government's efforts to boost its livestock industry\n            and, thereby, increase its foreign exchange earnings. The\n            estimated foreign exchange cost of the project is about $2\n            million, of which the proposed total credit would finance\n            about $1.6 million and the UNDP about $0.4 million. The IDA\n            would in addition finance about $0.6 million of local costs."}, "docdt": "1972-01-24T00:00:00Z"}
