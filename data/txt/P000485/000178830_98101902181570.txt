LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOIOTENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A LIVESTOCK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad for the equivalent of US$2.2
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a livestock development project.
2.          The livestock project was originally appraised in the fall of
1968 and negotiation for IDA financing substantially concluded in July,
1969. As explained in paragraph 8 below, submission to the Executive Direc-
tors was deferred because security conditions in Chad at that time would
not have allowed the project to go forward, The proposed credit would be
the first Bank Group assistance to Chad for agriculture and the fourth IDA
operation in Chad. Present commitments, amounting to $8.1 million, cover
three projects - one for transport and two for education. In keeping with
the findings of the 1969 economic mission (updated in September 1970) and
subsequent discussions with the Government, Bank Group operations in Chad
over the coming few years are likely to be concentrated in agriculture and
transport. In agriculture, particularly good potential exists in livestock
and in the production of cotton - the country's two most important foreign
exchange earners. However, Chad is a land-locked country and improvement
in transport is essential if it is to realize its export and production
potential. The Bank Group is assisting the Government to prepare several
projects in agriculture and transportation.
3.          Annex I contains a summary statement of the existing IDA credits
to Chad as of December 31, 1971, showing thab a large part remains undis-
bursed, reflecting the considerable delays encountered in the implementation
of all three projects. These delays arise mainly from problems of internal
administration. A Highway Maintenance credit of US$4-l million, signed in
August 1968 and made effective in February 1969, is about eighteen months
behind schedule, mainly because of the delay in the procurement of mainte-
nance equipment and consideration will have to be given in due course to
postponing the closing date for the credit, presently December 31, 1973.
The two on-going education projects (US$1.8 million and $2.2 million) for
which the credits were signed in August 1968 and June 1971, respectively,
are also behind schedule. The main reasons are, again, administrative problems;
there is need for more flexible governmental procedures and closer coordi-
nation between government departments involved, as mentioned in Ny Report and
Recommendation on a Credit for an Education project dated April 6, 1971
(IDA/R71_16). The closing date for the first project, presently March 1,
1972, will have to be postponed for two years to M{arch 1974. I am intensify-
ing supervision of these projects. A supervision mission has just returned
from Chad and reports that implementation of the education projects is now
improving.



PART II - THE ECONONY
4.          The most recent economic report entitled "The Current Economic
Situation and Prospects of Chad" (No. AVI-24a))was distributed to the
Executive Directors on April 9, 1971, and was based on an economic mission
which visited the country in March/April, 1969, and on an updating mission
of September 1970. An economic mission will visit Chad in March 1972.
A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
5.          Chad is the largest land-locked country in Africa; its main
centers of activity are 1,000 - 1,500 km from the sea. Its population of
approximately 3.7 million comprises two main ethnic groups - the Arabic
speaking IMhslims, who are largely nomadic pastoralists north of the Chari
River, and the predominantly Christian negroids south of the river, who
engage in crop cultivation. About 90% of the population works in agricul-
ture wJhich generates over 80o of exports and contributes about 40% of
national income. Per capita GDP (including subsistence) was estimated at
$76 in 1970. Absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to assess
the growth of the economy. However, tentative estimates show that GDP
has grown in real terms at a rate of about 2 - 3% per year over the last
decade. The growth rate of sectors, other than subsistence and animal
husbandry is estimated to have been 2.5 - 4%.
6.          Compared with other African countries of its size, Chad has
severely limited development opportunities, Its predominantly agricultural
economy is almost entirely dependent on cotton exports by peasant farmers
in the South, and the raising of livestock, for both export and subsistence
consumption, in the central and northern parts of the country. In addition,
gum arabic is grown as a cash crop in the North; other crops, such as
groundnuts, wheat, maize, and rice are grown mainly for subsistence con-
sumption in other areas. Some fishing is carried out in the rivers and also
on Lake Chad. The extrerme North of the country is mainly desert and is of
little agricultural value.
7.          The existence of good transport routes to the sea is an
important factor in development, and, in particular, in the expansion of
cotton and livestock exports. At the moment, lack of adequate outlets -
to outside markets is a great handicap and slows down the country's de-
velopment *0< )o Another handicap is the inadequacy of trained manpower
necessary to plan and execute development projects. The Bank Group's
two on-going projects in this sector, which include the provision of teacher
training facilities and the training of agricultural technicians, are
designed to help solve this problem. The country relies heavily on
technical assistance provided by France.
8.          Chad has recently undergone a difficult period in its
development effort associated with internal unrest. An extremely tight
financial situation has severely curtailed the Government's ability to
generate public savings and improve the standard of living. The Government
received French assistance in 1969 to help re-establish order in the
troubled areas through military operations as well as administrative,
budgetary, and fiscal reforms. The miuest resulted from the northerners'
resentment of the predominant role of the generally more educated



- 3-
southerners in almost all spheres of economic and administrative activities.
Opposition to paying taxes on livestock - the main source of livelihood
in the North - was also a factor in the revolt. The country's deteriorating
security situation made it virtually impossible for the Government to pro-
ceed with its improvement efforts in the livestock industry. Following the
return of some regional administrative responsibilities to the northern
sultanates (such as taxation and judicial powers), the subsequent release
of political prisoners, and the-inclusion of more northerners in the Govern-
ment, calm has largely returned.
9.          The Governmentts financial position is tight - another immediate
obstacle to development - as a result of several factors. These include
heavy expenditure on security, Chad's withdrawal from the Central African
Customs and Economic Union (UDEAC), the decline in tax revenue from the
livestock sub-sector, and the slow growth of the tax base caused by the slow
expansion of the economny. Since 1966, the budget has been in deficit on -
current account.and commercial and debt service arrears have accumulated.
There are virtually no public funds for investment and the Government will
find it difficult to bear the additional current expenditure generated by
externally financed projects.
10.         Even with improved tax collection and more austere current
expenditure policies, the public sector is likely to be in deficit for-at
least the next two or three years, In 1970 a current deficit of CFAF 1.6
billion was recorded. The overall deficit was CFAF 2.3 billion, or some
18% of current revenues. The deficit was slightly higher in 1969 because of
higher investment outlays in that year. A continued large overall deficit
is forecast for 1971. External assistance therefore, may be needed to
finance current deficits, including the liquidation of arrears, as well as to
cover capital spending. It is difficult to estimate foreign assistance
requirements on the basis of present information. The Government has decided
to implement the program of fiscal reforms which had been recommended by
the Bank's 1969 economic mission. The forthcoming economic mission will
continue discussions on the overall financial situation.
11.         It is to be hoped that there will be sufficient improvement
in the security situation and in the implementation of administrative and
economic reforms to make possible a cut-back on military expen diture,-
thus permitting limited resources to be saved for development projects.
Military expen ditures account for about a third of the budget. Assuming
that local funds will eventually become available, the country's absorptive
capacity should be able to increase due to new investment possibilities,
notably in cotton and livestock. The 1970 economic mission considered it
most unlikely that total public investment over the five-year period 1971 -
1975,for wihich the Government is preparing a development plan, would exceed
CFAF 30 - 35 billion (US$118 - 137 million) compared to CFAF 20 billion
($80 million) in the previous five years. The plan has not yet been worked
out in detail, and does not yet constitute a basis for government action.
As evidence of its commitment to developmenti, however, the Government last
year was reportedly introducing a special levy of one twelfth of incomes to
finance development. The levy was expected to yield some CFAF 2 billion.



- 4 -
122         There was an increase in foreign assistance to Chad through
1969. FED assistance increased from CFA? 1.0 billion in 1966 to CFAF 2.0
billion in 1969. French assistance appears to have risen by CFAF 2.3 billion
over the same period, including provision for military expenditure. In 1969
about 38% of foreign assistance was directed to development projects, and
36% represented technical assistance personnel engaged on development pro-
jects. Budget subsidies and the provision of goods and services to meet
current expenditure amounted to 26% of total aid. French budgetary subsidies
in 1970 amounted to CFAF 2.3 billion which was close to the size of the
overall deficit. Data on more recent commitments are not available.
13.         Chad's balance of payments has always been in deficit on
trade and on nearly all services. This has been covered largely by foreign
assistance grants and private transfers, as well as, but to a lesser extent,
by capital inflow, In 1969 the current account deficit amounted to CFAF 8
billion, equivalent to 13% of GDP. Changes in foreign exchange reserves
reveal a persistent deficit in the overall position since 1965. The position
improved somewhat in 1969 as a result of an MCF drawing of $3.8 million.
It appears that the decline in reserves has resulted mainly from the trade
deficits. In 1970, despite a 30,4 rise in imports, a slight overall balance
of payments surplus was reported, mainly as a result of higher world market
prices for cotton and a rise in French Govermnent and Common Market trans-
fers, The balance of payments is highly vulnerable to changes in cotton
prices and the high elasticity of demand for imports.
14.         Chad's external indebtedness has been rising and amounted to
$67.5 million on Decenber 31, 1970. The debt service ratio in 2970 amounted
to 13% of export eaxnings. In view of the country's poverty and the virtual
absence of public or private savings, foreign aid should cover a large
proportion of projects costs (in many cases close to 100%) including a large
share of local costs. Further, the limited prospects for the.7balAnce of
paymnts and the tight budgetary situation make it desirable that aid to
Chad be on concessionary terms.
15.         As mentioned earlier, the basic priorities of Chad's economy
require concentration on the development of agriculture and transportation.
In agriculture the best opportunities lie in cotton and livestock,which
are the mainstays for the vast majority of the population. Investments in
transport and conunnication would be next in importance, in order to reduce
transport costs to ocean ports. It is important to improve the effectiveness
of local administration as well as to facilitate agricultural marketing,
particularly for livestock.
PAR' III - THE PROJECT
16.         Chad relies almost entirel-y on agriculture for exports, empioy-
ment and subsistence, In 1969, agricultural crops and livestock products
comprised nearly 80% of export earnings. The principal items were cotton,
live animals, meat and hides and skins, Agriculture, including subsistence
production, accounts for about 50% of the gross domestic product, about-
25% of which is from livestock, mainly cattle, meat and animal productsp
17.         In 1969, recorded exports of livestock and animal products
amounted to the equivalent of US$3.1 million (nearly 90% of which was cattle



and beef). These probably account for only 30% of the total earnings from
this sector, the other 70% being unrecorded exports of livestock on hoof.
The export of livestock and animal products may therefore have been as high
as US$10 million, or 28% of total export earnings, coming second only to
cotton exports (US$24 million).
18.         Cattle are traded commercially through well-organized tradi-
tional local markets which, however, lack modern facilities (auction floors,
weighing scales, etc). The main flow of cattle is towrards the west to Fort
Lamr for local consumption, processing or export on hoof to Nigeria. A
second.   route is from the northwest to the south for slaughter at Fort
Archambault, or for export to the Central African Republic (see map attached)
19.         Chad has an estimated cattle population of 4.5 million, of -
which about 70% is in the Sahelian belt. In addition, there are approxi-
mately 1.5 million sheep, 2.8 million goats, 400, 000 camels, 500,000 horses
and a few thousand pigs. Mainly as a result of the establishment of modern
abattoirs, the export of dressed meat has increased nearly threefold over
the past four years to reach 12,000 tons of which 11,000 tons is beef.
20.         Chad has great potential to expand production of its livestock
industry, but in the main cattle areas of Sahelian Chad, permanent water
is limited. The rains open up extensive grazing areas, but these can be used
only for a short period. The widely practiced traditional form of animal
husbandry is based on annual movement of herds in search of water and pas-
ture. Large areas of good pasture that could be opened up for stock grazing
lie idle because of lack of permanent water facilities. Substantial increases
are also possible in areas that already have permanent water if cattle owners
would use better methods of range and animal management. These include con-
trol of grass fires, treatment against parasites, sale of immature cattle
for fattening, etc. In addition, improved marketing facilities are also
necessary.
21.         The recently established (May 1971) Ministry of Livestock is
responsible for the administration and development of the livestock industryt
The Ministry's staff is occupied almost entirely with disease control and no
section deals specifically with animal husbandry, range management or mar-
keting. There is also no livestock extension service. The veterinary ser-
vices are well served by the Fareka Research Laboratory in Fort Lamy which
produces a wide range of vaccines. The laboratory forms part of the Institut
d'Elevage et de MWdecine Vet4rinaire de Pays Tropicaux in Paris, financed
by France and other participating countries.
22.         Several bilateral and multilateral aid agencies are financing-
extensive programs of technical assistance in Chad's livestock sub-sector.
The European Development Fund (FED) has financed the construction of 318
wells in the Chari Baguirmi, Batha and Ouaddai districts. Both the French
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), and FED have provided watering points
in Chad for the past 12 years which have resulted in the opening up of
additional grazing land. In addition, FAC provides technical assistance for
the livestock services, mainly for animal health.



23.         The proposed project would supplement the above-mentioned
programs and further stimulate the expansion of the livestock industry. It
was identified by the Government, with the assistance of the FAO/IBRD
Cooperative Program, in 1966/67 and appraised by an IDA mission in September/
October 1968. Negotiations were held with representatives of the Government
in July 1969. It was agreed, however, that, in view of security problems,
particularly in the project area, further action on the credit should be
postponed until the situation had improved. It was nevertheless considered
desirable that the consultants should continue work on detailed surveys
and well siting, as well as the preparation of tender documents for wvell
construction and repair work. Following their review by the Association,
tender documents were issued early in 1971 to ascertain contractor interest
and firm up cost estimatese These bids were received by July 1971, the lowest
from a locally based firm.
24.         In September 1971, a mission visited Chad to revise the cost
estimates in the light of the bids received and up-to-date information on
local costso During the visit, confirmation was obtained from the Government
on the main project components on which agreement had been reached during the
1969 negotiations, and on certain revisions in detail that are now considered
desirable.
25.         A report entitled "Chad - Appraisal of Livestock Development
Project"',dated January 24, 1972, is-being distributed separately. A Credit
and Project Summary is in Annex III. The project comprises:
(a) construction of 38 new wells;
(b) repair of 102 existing wells
(c) establishment of two units to maintain 821 wells in the
main livestock producing areas; and
(d) strengthening of the Livestock Development Unit established
by UNDP in 1969.
The total estimated cost of the project, taking into-account the 8.5% in-
crease in the US$ equivalent of the CFA Franc, is 4Q3.4 million equivalent
and would be financed by the proposed IDA credit, a grant from UNDP and a
Government contribution on the following basis:
(In thousands of US$)
IDA         UNDP        Government  Total
_ount   %   Amount  %   Amount  %    Amount

- 7 -
26.        The cost estimates for new well construction and repair include
turnovrer taxes payable by the contractor and import duties on equipment
and materials, totalling about $412,000. This amount is included both in
the total cost shown above and in the amount to be contributed by the'
Government, which will collect the taxes over the construction period. The
Governrnnt's net of tax contribution would-thus be $342,000 equivalent, that
is about 11% of project cost, net of taxes.
27.        In January 1972 the Governing Council of UNDP approved the
Country Program for Chad which includes assistance for the Livestock De-
velopment Unit. UNDP has indicated informally that this wlould include the
salaries and related costs of 4 experts.
28.         G4nie Rural, a department in the Ministry of Rural Development
responsible for ruiral water supplies, will also be responsible for the
supervision of new well construction, repair, renovation and maintenance.
For this purpose, the Government has requested technical assistance from
France. Should such assistance not be forthcoming, the Government has agreed
to engage a consultant and the cost of consultant servrices has been included
in the proposed credit.
29.        The design of the 38 new wzells to be constructed will be based
on experience gained under local conditions. *Iater would be drawn by
traditional methods aided by rollers and troughs. The drawing rate of this
method would be about one litre/sec per well wihich would be adequate to
provide water for l,500 cattle daily. Construction of the new wells is
expected to take two years, allowing for time lost during the rainy seasons
when no construction can be done. The well sites were determined by the
consultants, SAUTI, to minutes of longitude and latitude, and account
was taken of grazing conditions and expected depth and quality of the
water. The expected life of each well is 30 years.
30.        The 102 wells which would be repaired and renovated under the
project were built in 1955 in the southern part of Batha district. Defects
in these wells were detected as early as 1966. By 1969, 21 of them had
already been abandoned and the rest, although still in use, needed repair,
In 1969 a surveywiias carried out by SAUTI to determine the extent of the
required repairse The work would take 18 months to complete, including
stoppages during two rainy seasons,
31.        The two well maintenance units to be provided under the project
would be responsible for a total of 821 wells, including those to be con-
structed and repaired under this project. Because of lack of funds; the
Goverrment has not been able to carry out regular well maintenance. The
credit would finance the acquisition of maintenance equipment as wqell as
the maintenance units' operating costs. The IDA credit would cover the
total cost of maintenance in the first year, and half in the second year.
Thereafter, the Government would take over the cost of the units.
32.        The Livestock Development Unit would be responsible for drawing
up a comprehensive developnent plan, as well as for preparing subsequent
livestock projects. On the postponement of the project In 1969, the financing
of the LIDU was taken over by UNDP,-ihich set it up as a UNDP/FAO project
ard provided an expatriate officer. When the updating mission visited Chad



- 8 -
in 1971, it was found that the IZU had been functioning on somewhat
different lines from those originally envisaged by the Association. Agree-
anet has been reached with the Government on terms of reference. In addition
to the head of the unit (a livestock specialist), the LDU would be manned by
an animal production officer, a range ecologist and an agriculturaP economist
all of whom would, initially at least, be internationally recruited. A
Ghadian veterinarian would be attached to the unit to obtain experience in
planning and project preparation. The unit wxould be financed by UNDP for
a period of three years. The salaries of the livestock specialist, the
animal production officer, and the range ecologist would be funded for three
years, and that of the agricultural economist, for two years. In addition,
UlfDP would finance the cost of office accommcdation, the purchase and
operating costs of transport and fellowships for training. IDA would finance
the foreign exchange costs of special studies to be carried out for the
Unit by consultants on short-term contracts.
33.        The work of the Livestock Development Unit would be reviewed
every three months by an inter-ministerial cormittee comprising the Ministry
of Livestock, the NTinistry-of Finance, the High Commission for Planning and
the G4nie Rural department. They would ensure that the Unit operates in
accordance with the terms of reference agre6d with the Association. The
Government has also agreed that-the LDU would submit progress reports to
UiDP and MIA every three months.
34.         As mentioned in para 23 the contract for well construction
and repair was put to international tender and the local firm of Dijckmans,
which submitted the lowest bid, won the contract. Two thirds of the total
project-cost, excluding the LDU, was subject to international competitive
bidding. A few vehicles and a small amount of ancillary equipment, amounting
to about $371,000C, would be purchased through-regular government tender
procedures, which are considered satisfactory. A number of international
manufacturers of vehicles and equipment have local agents wiho would bid
for government purchases.
35.         The Government has expressed concern that if project construction
does not start in February, it iwill have to be postponed to November, 1972,
because of the rainy season. The present low bid for the well repair and
maintenance contract would no longer be valid and there is a danger that  -
new bids would be higher. The Association has accordingly approved the con-
tract and, if the credit is approved, the amount of retroactive financing
required would be about 4003,000.
36.         The estimated foreign exchange cost of the project (see Annex
III) is about $2 million, of which the proposed total credit would finance
about $1.6 million and the UNDP about $0.4 million. The IDA would in addition
finance about $0.6 million of local costs, The proposed credit would be
disbursed against 70% of the cost of well construction and repair and So%
of the cost of equipment and spare parts for the two maintenance units, this
percentage reflecting the net of tax costs; 100% of expatriate salaries
for the maintenance units; 100% of the remaining costs of the maintenance
units for the first year and 50% for the second year; 75% being the-estimjated
foreign exchange cost of consultants for special studies by the LDU.

37.         The project would play a very important part in the Governmentfs
efforts to boost its livestock industry and, thereby, increase its foreign
exchange earnings. It would increase the purchasing 7power of the stock
owners while, at the same time, increase government revenues through live-
stock taxes. It would increase foreign exchange earnings by about $1.3
million per year, increase employment opportunities, and add about $195,000
a year to government revenues from livestock taxes. It would bring into
productive use an additional 600,000 ha of grazing land with a carrying
capacity of 80,000 cattle and about 70,000 sheep and goats. It would also
prevent the continuing decline and possible collapse of 102 existing wells
which serve an area of over 2.0 million ha, supporting about 210,000 cattle
and 180,000 sheep and goats. In addition, 821 wells, including those to be
constructed and repaired under the project, would be assured of regular
repair and maintenance. Studies to be carried out by the LDU would lead to
the identification and preparation of further projects designed to bring
about a more systematic development of the country's livestock industry.
38.         It is estimated that, as a result of additional grazing land
which would be made available following the implementation of the project,
herd sizes would grow by 190,000 cattle and 160,000 sheep and goats to
reach totals of some 800,000 and 700,000 animals, respectively. The regular
repair and maintenance of the wells would prevent their deterioration
and a consequent reduction in their carrying capacity. Assuming an off-take
of 11.5 percent after full stocking, annual off-take in the Batha district
would be higher by 50,000 cattle and almost 100,000 sheep and goats under
the project than without it. At 1970 prices, this would represent an added
annual value of $2.3 million. The project's average rate of return to the
econony discounted over the estimated 30 year life of the wells, would be
about 11%.
39.         Apart from the quantifiable benefits, the project would provide
additional subsistence food for about 15,000 - 20,000 people, as well as
increased returns from a number of secondary products, such as skins, hides,
butter, and hair.
40.         No charges are levied at present for the use of government
stock wells and none are proposed for the wells to be constructed under the
present project.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.         The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Chad and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
42.         The draft Development Credit Agreement conforms to the normal
pattern in credits of this kind.
43.         I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
