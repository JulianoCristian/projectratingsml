macroeconomic goals at the\n            municipal level.  The project consists of two components:\n            (a) municipal institutional development; and (b) national\n            institutional development.  The Municipal institutional\n            development component consists of the following\n            subcomponents: (i) general municipal management improvement;\n            (ii) financial management strengthening; and (iii) municipal\n            management information systems.  The second component,\n            national institutional development consists of the following\n            subcomponents:  (i) national information system for\n            municipalities; (ii) analysis of policy alternatives for\n            improving national/subnational fiscal relations; (iii)\n            evaluation of the impact of regional and sector investments\n            on municipal finances; and (iv) project executing unit."}, "docdt": "1993-11-05T00:00:00Z"}
