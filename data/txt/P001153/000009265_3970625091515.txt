MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE
FOR A FIFTH RUBBER PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the Republic of Cote
d'Ivoire of USS 11.9 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would carry a standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20 years
including 5 years of grace and would help finance a fifth rubber project.
2.        Background.  Agriculture in CBte d'Ivoire accounts for about 35
percent of GDP and over 60 percent of all merchandise exports. It provides
employment to 77 percent of the cotal labor force and taxes on export crops
represented 30 percent of Government's annual revenues in 1985. The
agricultural sector will remain the predominant factor of Ivorian economic
growth over the next decade. Structurally, however, the circumstances for
its development have deteriorated: timber potential is declining; cocoa
production is projected to grow at about 6 percent per annum but such
expansion can not be sustained without adversely affecting export revenues
given Cote d'Ivoire's already dominant position in the world market; and
coffee production is on a downward trend because of the slowdown in new
plantings and the resulting aging of plantations. Against this background,
government development strategy aims at: (a) optimizing coffee and cocoa
contribution to the economy through a new program to improve cocoa quality,
rehabilitate existing coffee plantations and plant new coffee; (b)
promoting other export crops to ensure diversification and thus-greater
export earnings stability; and (c) encouraging food crop production. The
success of this strategy is critically dependent upon a shift in incentives
in favor of the agricultural sector, to motivate farmers and permit
investments in improved technologies. Such a shift is encouraged by
appropriate measures under the program supported by the Third Structural
Adjustment Loan (SAL III).
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project would support the
government policy of promoting diversification crops so as to reduce the
excessive dependence of the economy on cocoa and coffee. Rubber is a
product with favorable market prospects and a high comparative advantage.
Rubber development was initiated in 1955 and, by 1987, the total planted
area reached about 50,000 ha.  The proposed project would involve new
plantations over an area of 14,900 ha and would thus contribute
significantly to meeting the government target of 100,000 ha of new
plantings by the turn of the century.  Like previous rubber projects
financed by the Bank in CGte d'Ivoire, the proposed project would rely on
the concept of nucleus estates surrounded by smallholder plantations.
However, in this instance, a greater emphasis will be given to smallholder
development as a means of reducing investment costs. Furthermore, new
types of medium-sized estates will be developed in order to combine the
advantage of lower planting costs with economies of scale. Some of these
medium-sized plantations would be offered to urban savers as a means of
fostering private capital investment in rubber development.



-2-
Finally, the proposed project would aim at strengthening appliod and
adaptive research in :ubber growing and processing techniques.
4.        Project Description.  The project would be located in the humid
forest zone of southern Cote d'Ivoire. Project plantings would be located
in three main areas, the South-East and South-West where rubber has already
been successfully developed under previous Bank financed projects and the
Center-West where rubber development has so far been restricted to an
estate managed by a subsidiary of SAPH.  The project would be implemented
over a five-year period by three executing agencies: SAPH, a mixed
company, would manage the rubber development program; REVEGO would carry
out the research program; and BNDA would be the financial intermediary for
the credit component. Disbursements would be spread over six years. Under
the project, 14,900 ha of new plantacions would be established including
1,400 ha managed by HEVEGO and around 7,000 ha planted under previous Bank
financed projects would be brought to maturity. These investments would be
complemented by a research program, a staff training program, effluent
control measures and studies on future rubber development strategy. The
project would consist of three main components: the planting program,
research activities and support services in the form of studies and
institutional development.
5.        The 13,500 ha executed by SAPH would consist of (a) 9,700 ha of
smallholder plots involving about 3,400 participants over five different
sites; (b) 2,500 ha of medium-sized (25 to 50 ha) estates, of which a third
would be allocated to rural school graduates; (c) 700 ha managed as a
condominium type company whose shares would be offered for subscription to
private investors; and (d) 600 ha of industrial plantation to supplement a
nucleus estate established under the Third Rubber Project which would thus
be brought in.to full development. In addition, the project would cover the
maintenance of 6,700 ha planted under earlier projects. SAPH would also
manage a specific program of adaptive research under contract with IRCA,
the Ivorian rubber research institute. Applied research would be conducted
by HEVEGO on 1,000 ha of industrial plantations and 400 ha of experimental
fields. Finally, the project would provide resources for staff training
and institutional development of the implementing agencies and for surveys
to be carried out by a strengthened Rubber Sector Planning Unit in order to
update the Rubber Master Plan of the Government.
6.        Total project costs are estimated at US$ 58.9 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$ 23.5 million or about 39%. A breakdown
of costs is shown in Schedule A along with the financing plan. The project
would be cofinanced by the CDC, CCCE and the Bank in approximately equal
amounts for a total of US$35.2 million or 60% of project costs. Part of
the proceeds of the loan would be onlent to farmars/investors through the
BNDA. The Government would effectively assume the foreign exchange and
interest variability risks while allowing BNDA to maintain a minimum
interest spread of 3% taking into account the variable cost of externally
borrowed funds and the fixed lending rate charged to the final borrowers.



-3-
7.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project forms an integral
part of t"o Government's agricultural sector strategy of crop
diversification with emphasis on smallholder development. Returns per
man-day are high enough to ensure competitiveness with cocoa and coffee and
to contribute to increasing rural incomes. The project also represents a
first attempt at reducing direct government involvement in production by
encouraging private sector investment and maximizing the impact of low
investment cost approaches through smallholder development programs. The
Bank encourages the gradual disengagement of the Government in directly
productive activities in the agricultural sector and through the entire
economy.  The Bank's lending strategy is designed to support this objective
while strengthening government role in (a) the design of the policy and
incentive framework for agriculture through a proposed Agricultural Sector
Loan and (b) the provision of support services and infrastructure in rural
areas through operations such as the Agricultural Extension project which
was approved by the Board in November 1986, and a proposed Agricultural
Research project.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to the following
conditions of effectiveness: (1) execution of a subsidiary loan agreement
between the government and the credit agency BNDA with terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank; (2) amendment to the management contract between
the Government and SAPH to include the proposed project within the scope of
that agreement; (3) amendment to the existing agreement between SAPH and
the BNDA specifying the working arrangements for the management of the
smallholder credit; (4) introduction of a cost recovery scheme in the
system which governs the producer price of rubber. Other important actions
agreed to be taken during project implementation include (1) establishment
of a Committee to select applicants under the medium-sized plantation
component of the project; (2) establishment within a legal framework
acceptable to the Bank of a condominium type company to manage the 700 ha
development earmarked for subscription by urban investors; (3) execution of
a management contract between this corporation and the SAPH; (4)
recruitment of a qualified agro-economist to be attached to the Rubber
Planning and Monitoring Unit; and (5) execution of an agreement between
SAPH and the rubber research institute by June 30, 1988, outlining the
program of adaptive research.
9.        Justification.  The proposed project is expected to generate
sizeable foreign exchange earnings (about US$850 million during the
productive life of the trees) and to increase rural employment and incomes
(CFAF 6,900 per man-day) in the project zones. The medium-sized estate
program would also be instrumental in mobilizing private savings (about tJS$
1 million) for investment in the rubber sub-sector. The economic rate of
return for the project as a whole is estimated at 16% which is
significantly above the opportunity cost of capital. Financial rates of
return have been calculated for the various components of the project,
excluding institution building and research. For the industrial estates
the rates are 6% to 10% and for smaller sized developments, they reach 13%
to 15%. Returns for industrial estates are lower due to the inclusion of
high infrastructure costs incurred under earlier Bank-financed projects and
which also benefit smallholders. A major objective of the proposed project



-4-
1s to assist the country and specifically farmers in the forest zone in
diversifying risks linked to an excessive reliance on the main export crops
of cocoa and coffee,
10.       Risks.  The technical risks associated with the project would be
minimal considering the high technical standards of operation of SAPH. The
training and research components are designed to enable the project imple-
menting agencies to cope with the expanded development program and to
advance agronomic performance. The main risks are associated with the
possibility of a further decline in the CFA equivalent of world market
prices in comparison to project estimates which were based on Bank
projection of future rubber prices and exchange rates. Additional
sensitivity tests show that a 20% decline in project benefits would bring
down the economic rate of return to about 13% which is still satisfactory.
The project is not expected to have any adverse environmental effects.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
