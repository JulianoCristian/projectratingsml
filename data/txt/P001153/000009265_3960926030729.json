     Bank's fifth operation in the subsector.  It seeks to\n            (a) assist Cote d'Ivoire in increasing its export\n            earnings; (b) help in the diversification of Cote\n            d'Ivoire's agricultural sector through the\n            development of a perennial crop with good long term\n            prospects; and (c) provide support to the rural credit\n            system.  In that view, the project consists of the (i)\n            establishment of a total of 14,900 ha of new plantations;\n            (ii) the maintenance to maturity of an average of 6700 ha\n            planted during earlier projects; and (iii) the initiating of\n            an adaptive research program.  It also includes (iv) further\n            support to the applied research program started under the\n            Fourth Rubber Project; (v) studies on the long term\n            development strategy in Cote d'Ivoire and on land\n            availability; (vi) a training program for SAPH project\n            staff; and (vii) technical assistance in Ministry of\n            Agriculture and on nucleus estates."}, "docdt": "1987-06-03T00:00:00Z"}
