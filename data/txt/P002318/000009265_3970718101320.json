production of cotton, cereals, and livestock products. This\n            will be achieved through crop development activities, and by\n            strengthening and support of existing rural development\n            institutions, improvements in applied research, training of\n            extension workers, and rehabilitation of essential rural\n            infrastructure. The project's main quantifiable benefit\n            would derive from expected incremental production of cotton,\n            food crops and livestock products. Unquantifiable benefits\n            would include better financial management of SODEFITEX,\n            enhancement of its capability to plan and implement\n            development activities, and social benefits from the\n            research, maize-processing, village health and watersupply components."}, "docdt": "1983-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
