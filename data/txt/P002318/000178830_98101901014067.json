cotton, cereals, and livestock\n            products. This will be achieved through crop development\n            activities, and by strengthening and support of existing\n            rural development institutions, improvements in applied\n            research, training of extension workers, and rehabilitation\n            of essential rural infrastructure. The project's main\n            quantifiable benefit would derive from expected incremental\n            production of cotton, food crops and livestock products.\n            Unquantifiable benefits would include better financial\n            management of Cotton Development Agency (SODEFITEX),\n            enhancement of its capability to plan and implement\n            development activities, and social benefits from the\n            research, maize-processing, village health, and water supply components."}, "docdt": "1983-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
