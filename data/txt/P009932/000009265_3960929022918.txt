MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTI'VE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR A SECOND TAMIL NADU NUTRITION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed credit to
India is submitted for approval. The credit, for SDR 73.5 million (US$95.8
million equivalent) would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years' maturity and
would help finance a second nutrition project in the State of Tamil Nadu.
2.        Background.  Tamil Nadu's soc!al development indicators are in
general better than the national average. Despite a relatively low state per
capita income, in 1987 infant mortality rates were estimated at around 84 per
1,000 live births, 202 lower than for India as a whole, and the state's birth
rate was estimated at 23.6 per 1000 population against 32 for India as a
whole. However, Tamil Nadu's nutrition status is poor relative to its other
social development indicators. A 1986 survey of nutrition status in about half
the state classified children under four (the most vulnerable age group) as
follows: severely malnourished, about 112; moderstely malnourished, about
32Z, and normal and mildly malnourished, abouL 57Z. Conditions in the rest of
the state were probably worse than in the areas surveyed.
3.        Tamil Nadu's nutrition program efforts span a quarter century and
today, four major programs absorb almost all the state's nutrition spending:
the IDA-aided Tamil Nadu Integrated Nutrition Project (TINP); the Nutritious
Meals Program (NMP), exclusively funded by the state; and two programs funded
jointly by the Central and state governments, the Integrated Child Development
Services (ICDS) scheme and the Public Distribution System (PDS).
4.        ICDS is India's main child development program.  It provides
nutrition, health and pre-school education to children under six in the most
disadvantaged areas and now covers 401 of tht country. However, before ICDS
began its major national expansion, TINP had gotten under way in Tamil Nadu.
TIMP now covers 173 of Tamil Nadu's 385 rural blocks, .with a population of
around ten million. ICDS operates in 26 blocks. The NMP was introduced in
1982; it provides a daily noon meal to children from two to fourteen years of
age; it operates only in Tamil Nadu. NMP has social as well as nutritional
goals. Its coverage includes old-age pensioners and destitute widows, but not
the most nutritionally vulnerable group--very young children and pregnant
women. Nutrition education and coordination with health services is excluded
from NMP; its nutritional impact has never been carefully evaluated. The PDS
is a nation-wide program providing subsidized staple foods to poorer families
through a network of 'fair price shops'. General experience with the program
has been that, while increasing families' food security, it does not
significantly reduce malnutrition among very young children. It is therefore
not a substitute for programs like TINP and ICDS which target nutrition and
health interventions to the most vulnerable age groups.
5.        In 1986-87, Tamil Nadu spent about US$104 million on its nutrition
programs, 90 per cent of it on the NHP. Of the remaining expenditure, three



2-
quarters was on TINP and one quarter on ICDS. Nutrition program expenditure
accounted for 15.7Z of expenditure on social services and 5.22 of total state
government expenditure. Reflecting the state's considerable emphasis on
povertv alleviation, spending on social services grew at 7.62 per year during
the last decade, as against a growth rate of 2.31 per year for state
government spending as a whole.
6.        Experience in Previous and On-Going Projects.  The Bank has financed
six population/health projects in India, but only one credit for nutrition,
TINP (Cr. 1003-IN, for US$32 million). The project began in 1980, and is
being continued with state government funding, after the credit closed in
1989. TINP's main objective was to halve the prevalence of malnutrition in
children under four. Other objectives were to contribute to reductions in
infant mortality and micronutrient deficiencies among young children and
pregnant women. TINP provided linked nutrition and health services, including
intensive nutrition education for mothers and development of community
participation through women's groups. Its focal point was 9,000 Community
Nutrition Centers fCa"s) each serving an average populat'on of 1,500, and
staffed by a local female Community Nutrition Worker anc: a helper. The main
services provided were growth monitoring through monthly weighing of all
children aged 6-36 months; supplementary on-site feeding for all children with
severe malnutrition or faltering growth; nutrition education; oral rehydration
therapy for diarrhea wanagement; administration of vitamin A; periodic
deworming; and supplementary feeding of a limited number of pregnant and
nursing women.
7.        TINP's strengths and weaknesses were reviewed in a draft Project
Completion Report (March. 1990) which concluded that implementation experience
was good. Delays were not significant, and the project was both
institutionally and financially sustainable. With regard to impact, it was
estimated that the project contributed to a reduction of 33-50S in severe
malnutrition in the target population, surpassing most other nutrition
programs.
8.        Evaluators commended several features of TINP's software design for
nutrition services. These included carefully defined criteria for local staff
recruitment; limiting worker tasks to what was manageable and high priority;
specification of daily and monthly work routines; an innovative decentralized
training system; supervisory ratios which facilitated on the job training; the
effective use of women's groups to support project activities, and innovations
in the areas of community and management information. Several features of TINP
have already been adapted for Bank-assisted nutrition operations in other
countries.
9.        In addition to the need to increase impact on moderate malnutrition,
three main problems were identified in TINP's nutrition component: first,
about 30? of eligible children did not benefit from project services, largely
because they lived too far from CNCs. Second, just over 4? of children
remained severely malnourished despite project services. Third, over 40Z of
children who graduated from feeding required further supplementation within
six months because they could not maintain adequate weight gain. On the



- 3 -
health side, the main problems were institutionals weak cooperation between
the Departments of Health and Social Welfare contributed to inadequate
teamwork between health and nutrition field staff.
10.       Tamil Nadu's Strategy.  Tamil Nadu's nutrition strategy for the most
vulnerable age groups is to build on TINP's strong foundation, with special
attention to the design, execution and management of service delivery
activities for younger children and promotion of comaunity involvement. In
the light of lessons learned, the strategy concentrates on strengthening field
relationships between nutrition and health services. It also calls for
special measures to extend services to hard-to-reach areas and to provide
therapeutic supplementation to moderately malnourished children and to higher
proportions of pregnant women at risk of low-birth weight babies. In addition,
to promote cost-effectiveness, the state's strategy is to amalgamate NMF and
TINP centers in the villages so as to provide a full range of child
development services at a single location for the entire under-six group,
including pre-school education along ICDS lines.
11.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  There are four main reasons for the
Bank's involvement. First, the proposed project would help accelerate human
capital formation by raising the nutrition and health levels of disadvantaged
children. Second, the proposed project is part of increased Bank Group
assistance to address poverty alleviation; another nutrition project to
improve the quality and coverage of ICDS in the tribal areas of Orissa and
Andhra Pradesh states is shortly to be presented for Board consideration.
Third, promising strategies have been developed, with IDA assistance, for
resolving each of the problems identified by the evaluation of TINP I. The
Bank Group's Involvement in testing and implementing these strategies will
lead to further important lessons for replication in nutrition programs in
India and elsewhere. Finally, since Tamil Nadu's nutrition status is worse
than average, extending TINP services to the currently unserved half of the
state's under four population should have high priority. Without Bank Group
assistance, Tamil Nadu would not be able to move as rapidly to state-wide
coverage.
12.       Project Strategy and Objectives.  The project strategy would be to
support the proven concepts of TINP, improve on them and extend the modified
package to all of rural Tamil Nadu other than ICDS areas. In '2 of Tamil
Nadu's 385 rural blocks, existing TINP services would be strengthened and
enhanced; the new service package also would be extended to the remaining 194
blocks which currently have no effective nutrition coverage of under-three
children. The specific impact objectives of the project would be to:
(a) reduce severe malnutrition among children 6-36 months by 501 in new and
252 in existing TINP I areas, respectively; (b) increase the proportion of
children 6-36 months in normal or Grade I (i.e. mild malnutrition) nutrition
status by 50X and 352 in new and existing project areas respectively; and (c)
contribute to a reduction in the infant mortality rate to 55 per 1,000 births,
and to a 501 reduction in the incidence of low birth weight from present
levels.

13.       Project Description.  The project would have three componentst
service delivery, communications and comounity participation, and project
management. The service delivery component would finance construction,
furnishLag anu 6qulipping of village nutrition centers; increased training for
health and nutrition field workers and staff; supervisory vehicles;
incremental maternal and child health drugs and medications; therapeutic
nutrition supplements for malnourished younger children and at-risk pregnant
and nursing women and incremental salary and other operating costs. The
communications and commiunit participation component would finance production
and distribution of print and audio-visual materials for worker and community
use, including posters, flip charts, booklets, films and cassette recordings;
folk play production and performances &round nutritim and health themes;
audio-visual equipment and maintenance aud local consultancies for materials
production. It also would fund training for community support groups. The
project management and evaluation component would finance baseline nutrition
surveys of project areas, mid-term and final project impact and process
evaluations; vehicles, equipment, training and incremental operating costs of
the project monitoring and evaluation system; operations research beginning in
?adurai district and special studies, and a project management fund for
innovative activities. The project also would finance civil works to expand
the state's Communications and Training anter (CTC), and vehicles, furniture,
equipment and salaries and other operating costs of the CTC and the Project
Coordination Office.
14.       Total project costs are estimated at US$139.1 million.  The proposed
IDA credit of SDR 73.5 million (US$95.8 million equivalent) would finance
about 712 of project costs net of duties and taxes, including all foreign
exchange costs and 662 of local costs. Tamil Nadu would finance the remaining
US$43.3 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and the fin"ncing plan
appear in Schedule A. Retroactive financing of up to US$1.3 aillion would be
provided for eligible expenditures made after September 30   989.  Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursements and the disburses    schedule appear
in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and tL status of Bank
Group operations in India appear in Schedules C and D, resnectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8497-IN of May 10, 1990, is beiug distributed
separately.
15.       A8reed Actions.  During negotiations, Tamil Nadu agreed to:
(a) by January 1, 1991 adopt and apply beneficiary selection criteria and
methodology, mutually agreed to by Tamil Nadu and IDA, for provision of
therapeutic supplements to children under three years of age and pregnant and
lactating women in the project area; (b) thereafter maintain the provision in
the project area of therapeutic nutrition supplements whose composition is
satisfactory to IDA; (c) by January 1, 1991, introduce and thereafter maintain
arrangements agreed to by IDA and Tamil Nadu for coordination between health
and nutrition services in project areas; (d) by September 30, 1991, undertake
and complete operations research on the efficacy of different approaches to
strengthening obstetrical and child nutritional risk management at referral
facilities in the project area, this operations research to be conducted
according to terms of reference agreed to by IDA and Tamil Nadu; and



-5-
(e) to complete baseline surveys of each Health Unit District under terms of
reference satisfactory to IDA before the start of project implementation in
that district.
16.       Benefits.  The project would substantially accelerate the pace of
improvement in nutrition and health status of young children while
contributing to a faster reduction in infant and child mortality. These
changes would strengthen Tamil Nadu's base for human resource development by
enabling larger numbers of children to make better use of their genetic
potential for physical and mental growth. Over five million relatively
disadvantaged pre-school children and an estimated two million pregnant and
lactating women in project areas would benefit directly from the project's
nutrition, health and educational services. In the new project blocks, an
estimated 18,000 women would obtain training and employment as Community
Nutrition Workers and helpers, and 1,600 as supervisors. These workers would
form new Women's Working Groups in project villages with a total expected
membership of around 300,000, whose maternal competence would increase through
project-funded training in basic health and nutrition care and how 'o pass
these skills on to other women in the community. Additionally, over 20,000
traditional birth attendants would receive refresher training under the
project. The project also would have indirect benefits through testing new
technologies and managerial arrangements which may be suitable for adoption or
adaptation elsewhere in India. These include interventions to reduce low
birth weight and moderate pre-school malnutrition; coordinat,'ri arrangements
for nutrition and health services, and new approaches to dealing with
referrals of severely malnourished children and obstetrical risk cases.
17.       Risks.  The main risk is that organizational arrangements for
health-nutrition collaboration will fail to function as smoothly as necessary.
That risk is limited to the extent that major gains in nutritional status can
be expected from improvements to the nutrition service delivery strategy. A
wide range of measures to improve nutrition and health services collaboration
is proposed under the project, reinforced both by a specific action to be
agreed on and special attention to this consideration which is planned as part
of project supervision.
18.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
