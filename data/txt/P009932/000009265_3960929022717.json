Integrated Nutrition Project (TINP) I areas; (b) increase\n            the proportion of children 6-36 months in normal or mild\n            malnutrition status in project areas; and (c) contribute to\n            a reduction in the infant mortality rate to 55 per 1,000\n            births, and to a reduction in the incidence of low birth\n            weight from present levels. The project has three\n            components. The service delivery component will finance\n            construction, furnishing and equipping of village nutrition\n            centers; increased training for health and nutrition field\n            workers and staff; supervisory vehicles; incremental\n            maternal and child health drugs and medications; therapeutic\n            nutrition supplements for malnourished younger children and\n            at-risk pregnant and nursing women and incremental salary\n            and other operating costs. The communications and community\n            participation component will finance production and\n            distribution of print and audio-visual materials for worker\n            and community use. It would also fund training for community\n            support groups. The project management and evaluation\n            component will finance baseline nutrition surveys of project\n            areas, mid-term and final project impact and process\n            evaluations; vehicles, equipment, training and incremental\n            operating costs of the project monitoring and evaluation system."}, "docdt": "1990-05-10T00:00:00Z"}
