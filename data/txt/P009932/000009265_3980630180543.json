"abstracts": {"cdata!": "Ratings for the Second Tamil Nadu\n            Integrated Nutrition Project (TINP II) for India were as\n            follows: outcomes were marginally satisfactory, project\n            sustainability was likely, Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: TINP I had a\n            marked impact on the prevalence of severe malnutrition in\n            Tamil Nadu during the 1980s, as borne out by an impact\n            evaluation, and later corroborated by the National Family\n            Health Survey (NFHS). This success was founded on several\n            factors including selective feeding, favorable\n            worker-supervisor ratios, clear job descriptions and a\n            well-focused monitoring system, used to improve project\n            management and implementation. Community ownership should\n            remain a priority, requiring an involvement of more people\n            in more direct nutrition-improving action, in addition to\n            resource contributions by panchayats community\n            self-monitoring is just one example, where by a core set of\n            key indicators could be tracked by community organizations\n            to increase the visibility of progress. Particular attention\n            needs to be paid to reaching the youngest children who are\n            at greatest risk. With regard to area-targeting, many remote\n            hamlets, with high proportions of scheduled caste groups,\n            still need to be reached through the establishment of\n            mini-Community Nutrition Center (CNC). The phenomenon of\n            lagging districts, particularly in the north of the state,\n            has been known for sometime. The recommendation of\n            supervision missions of joint action-planning with district\n            staff and block-level problem mapping is still valid."}, "docdt": "1998-04-24T00:00:00Z"}
