the  Borrower  expects  to  meet  its  estimated  foreign exchange
requirements during 1989; and  (b)  that  the actions described in

4.   If, after the  exchange  of  views  described  in paragraph 3

progress achieved  and  actions  taken  are  not satisfactory and,
within 90 days  after  such  notice,  the  Borrower shall not have
achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank, then
the Bank may, by  notice  to  the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn
amount of the Loan or any part thereof.

Page  9
consistent with those  set  forth  in  Sections  I  and  II of the
"Guidelines for  Procurement  under  IBRD  Loans  and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines), subject to the
following modifications:
     (a)  Paragraph 2.8  of  the  Guidelines  is  deleted  and the
following is substituted therefor:
     "2.8 Notification and Advertising
          The international  community  should  be  notified  in a
     timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by
     advertising invitations to apply  for inclusion in a bidder's
     invitation list, to  apply  for  prequalification, or to bid;
     such  advertisements  should  be   placed  in  at  least  one
     newspaper of general  circulation  in  the Borrower's country
     and, in addition, in at least one of the following forms:
          (i)  a  notice  in   the   United  Nations  publication,
               Development Forum, Business Edition; or
         (ii)  an  advertisement  in  a  newspaper,  periodical or
               technical journal  of  wide  international circula-
               tion; or
        (iii)  a notice to local  representatives of countries and
               territories referred to in the Guidelines, that are
               potential suppliers of the goods required."
     (b)  The following is added at  the  end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:
          "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require
     the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely
     used in  international  trade  and  specified  in the bidding
     documents."
     (c)  Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56  of the Guidelines are deleted.
2.   Contracts for goods estimated to  cost the equivalent of less
than $5,000,000 each shall be  awarded  on the basis of the normal
procurement procedures of the purchaser of such goods.
3.   With respect to each contract  referred  to in paragraph 1 of
this Schedule, the Borrower  shall  furnish  to the Bank, prior to
the submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal
of funds from the Loan  Account  in  respect of such contract, two
conformed copies of such  contract,  together with the analysis of
the respective bids and  recommendations  for award, a description
of the  advertising  and  tendering  procedures  followed and such
other information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
4.   With respect to each contract  referred  to in paragraph 2 of
this Schedule, the Borrower  shall  furnish  to the Bank, prior to
the submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal
of  funds  from  the   Loan   Account  in  respect  thereof,  such
documentation and information as  the  Bank may reasonably request
to support withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.
5.   The provisions of the preceding  paragraphs  3, 4 and 5 shall
not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has authorized
withdrawals from the Loan  Account  on  the basis of statements of
expenditure.
                            SCHEDULE 4
              Actions Referred to in Paragraph 3 (b)
                  of Schedule 1 to this Agreement
1.   The value  of  the  aggregate  expenditures  for  1988 of the
Consolidated Public Sector has  been  reduced  by not less than 40
million Lempiras, such  reduction  to  be calculated in accordance
Page  10
with a methodology satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank.
2.   The deficit of the Consolidated Public Sector during the last
six months of 1988 has  been  reduced  by not less than 65 million
Lempiras, all to be  calculated  in  accordance with a methodology
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank.
3.   (a)  Enactment of a law by the Borrower's Legislative Branch,
          and promulgation  thereof  by  the  Borrower's Executive
          Branch, setting forth  the Borrower's Central Government
          budget for 1989; and
     (b)  approval by the Borrower's  Executive Branch of budgets,
          at levels satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank, for
          each of the Autonomous Institutions.
The measures  mentioned  above  will  be  taken  so  as to achieve
overall results, as follows:
          (i)  that the aggregate value  of the aforesaid budgets,
               when combined with  the  duly  approved budgets for
               1989 of all other entities and agencies referred to
               in Section 1.02  (c)  of  this Agreement, will show
               that the deficit of  the Consolidated Public Sector
               for 1989, when  compared  with  the deficit of said
               Sector for 1988, all  calculated in accordance with
               a methodology satisfactory to  the Borrower and the
               Bank, has been reduced by one and eight-tenths of a
               percentage  point  of   the  estimated  1989  gross
               domestic product  estimated  in  accordance  with a
               methodology satisfactory  to  the  Borrower and the
               Bank; and
         (ii)  that the level of  Net  Current Expenditures of the
               Borrower's Central  Government  for  1989  has been
               reduced to 17.6% of the 1989 gross domestic product
               estimated   in   accordance   with   a  methodology
               satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank.
4.   Preparation of  an  administrative  reform  program  aimed at
improving tax collection procedures during 1989.
5.   Preparation  of   a   program   of   reforms  for  Autonomous
Institutions to be initiated during 1989.
6.   Preparation of a month-by-month action  plan for 1989 for the
execution of CONADI's  privatization  program,  as  defined in the
Borrower's Decrees No.161/85 and 197/85.
7.   Preparation of a plan of action to be implemented during 1989
to rationalize ENEE's expenditures, investment and management, and
to restructure ENEE's debt.
8.   Agreement has been reached between  the Borrower and the Bank
on an  investment  program  for  1989  of  the Consolidated Public
Sector.
9.   A list of non-essential items has been set forth and all such
measures as shall  be  necessary  have  been  taken to ensure that
foreign exchange for the import of  any item included in such list
will not be available at any point in time at a rate that is lower
than  the  implied  rate  of  exchange  derived  from  the  price,
prevailing at the point in  time  in question, at which CETRAs are
being acquired in their  secondary market; provided, however, that
the aggregate value of  the  imports  during 1987 corresponding to
items included in the aforesaid list  is not lower than 40% of the
aggregate value of all imports into Honduras during such year.
10.  Enactment of a law  by  the Borrower's Legislative Branch and
promulgation thereof  by  the  Borrower's  Executive Branch, which
will eliminate  import  duty  exemptions,  and  certain surcharges
already agreed between the  Borrower  and the Bank, while allowing
Page  11
increases in yearly revenues, substantially  in the terms on which
the corresponding bill was  submitted  by said Executive Branch to
said Legislative Branch on June 22, 1988.
11.  Measures have been taken to  comply  with the targets for the
September  30,  1988  through  December  31,  1988  period  of the
Monetary Program.
12.  The program of  action  referred  to  in  Section 3.05 of the
draft Loan Agreement  between  the  Borrower  and the Bank (Fourth
Agricultural Credit  Project)  submitted  to  the  Bank's Board of
Directors for its  consideration  and  approval  in its meeting of
September 15, 1988 has begun to  be carried out and the Borrower's
Central Bank rediscount rate  has  been  raised,  as of January 1,
1989, to not less than  10%  per  annum, except for loans directly
related to the production of basic grains.
13.  Presentation to  the  Bank  of  a  plan  of  action  aimed at
strengthening the  ability  of  the  Borrower's Superintendency of
Banks to monitor  commercial  banks'  transactions and performance
taking into account the recommendations of the consultants already
selected for the related study to be carried out under Part B.3 of
the Project described in  the  Loan Agreement between the Borrower
and the Bank (Third  Industrial  Credit Project) for Loan 2703-HO,
dated July 7, 1986, as amended from time to time.
