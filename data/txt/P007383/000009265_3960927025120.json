The main goals of the plan are to: (a)\n            increase public sector savings; (b) reduce the overall\n            fiscal deficit in 1989; and (c) promote external balance and\n            increase transparency in the foreign exchange market by\n            permitting a greater proportion of transactions to take\n            place at market-determined rates. Also, the plan aims to\n            sterilize the excess money supply and avoid it's\n            inflationary impact, and begin the process of liberalization\n            of interest rate policies by the elimination of distortions\n            among discounted credit lines."}, "docdt": "1988-08-25T00:00:00Z"}
