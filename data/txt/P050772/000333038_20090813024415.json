First Land-Based Poverty\n            Alleviation Project for Brazil were as follows: outcomes\n            were moderately satisfactory, the risk to development\n            outcome was moderate, Bank performance was moderately\n            satisfactory, and Borrower performance was also moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: beneficiary\n            attrition from a settlement should be seen as a natural\n            occurrence and can have many underlying causes. Even so,\n            project evaluation shows that there has been a vigorous\n            process of substitution of new settlers on vacated lots -\n            virtually matching the rate of desistence - indicating that\n            the perceived value of the opportunity to settle, and under\n            the regime of a repayable loan, has not diminished. Further,\n            the settlements financed under the project are generally\n            sustainable, at the very least as legally secure residential\n            locations for poor rural people if not always as the primary\n            source of productive income. Differentiated, area-tailored\n            financing of a 'linked package' can provide\n            incentives and room to maneuver to associations/families to\n            negotiate with sellers for the lowest market price. The\n            lower the land price paid, the more resources which remained\n            for on-farm investments which were grant financed, i.e.,\n            non-repayable. Additional, targeted incentives added to the\n            Land Acquisition Subproject (SAT)/Community Investment\n            Subproject (SIC) package also proved an effective catalyst\n            to more conservative land management practices on-farm.\n            Monitoring arrangements and performance under a\n            Federally-financed project implemented at the state and\n            local levels require close supervision to ensure that key\n            data is collected, stored and transmitted regularly by\n            outliers to the center for aggregation. Linked management\n            information systems, i.e., state systems linked to a central\n            system, need regular technical assessment by Bank\n            specialists for performance and content quality, and data\n            collected should inter alia, cover the performance of all\n            project components and activities."}, "docdt": "2009-06-29T00:00:00Z"}
