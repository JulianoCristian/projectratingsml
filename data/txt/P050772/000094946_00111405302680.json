i.e., its inadequate access to\n            land by the rural poor, to further support the\n            government's program of community-based land reform.\n            The components will: 1) include land purchases by community\n            associations of poor farmers, funded by loans financed\n            through Federal Government budgetary sources, representing\n            the counterpart funding for the Bank financed project\n            components; 2) include subprojects to be made available to\n            participating communities, eligible for complementary\n            investment financing, and technical assistance (TA), to\n            establish the land settlement, and improve the productivity\n            of the acquired land. Matching grants will be provided to\n            rural community associations to finance small-scale\n            subprojects, identified as priority investments for\n            infrastructure, social, and productive aspects on a\n            demand-driven basis, in accordance to technical, economic,\n            environmental and sustainable standards; 3) finance TA,\n            seminars and training for community associations, to\n            strengthen the effectiveness, and quality of project\n            operations, through capacity building programs for community\n            mobilization, specialized skills, best practices, and public\n            awareness; 4) support project coordination, supervision, and\n            monitoring, and, provide the basis to judge ex-post project\n            impacts, and determine ex ante, possible program extensions."}, "docdt": "2000-11-06T00:00:00Z"}
