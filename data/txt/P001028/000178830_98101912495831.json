would be to increase the productivity of the\n            Guinean cattle herd and thereby augment national meat and\n            milk product, improve nutrition, and raise the standard of\n            living of cattle-herding families. It would be implemented\n            over four years and would include: (a) institutional\n            strengthening through: upgrading of the General Directorate\n            of Livestock (DGE) to provide a central capacity for the\n            day-to-day implementation of the project, and establishment\n            within the DGE of a Research and Planning Office (Bureau\n            d'Etudes, BDE). (b) Support for animal health and\n            husbandry services through: upgrading of regional livestock\n            services including reconstruction for refurbishing of\n            headquarter buildings and provision of basic equipment and\n            materials; sales to herdsmen of drugs, medicines and mineral\n            licks; a national vaccination campaign; reinforcement of the\n            central vaccine production and diagnostic laboratory; and a\n            pilot credit program to encourage cattle ownership and use\n            of draft animals. (c) Staff training through: establishment\n            of a 40-person capacity training center and provision of\n            fellowships for overseas training. (d) A total of 19\n            man-years of technical assistance, and 30 man-months of\n            short-term consultant services."}, "docdt": "1980-08-31T00:00:00Z"}
