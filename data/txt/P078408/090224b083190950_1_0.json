Lack of\n            effective financial management, audit and procurement\n            functions in the public sector continued to hamper the\n            government's ability to function effectively. The\n            Financial Management Transparency and Accountability Project\n            (FIMTAP) was designed to provide a toolkit of solutions to\n            poor fiscal discipline, transparency, accountability and\n            operational inefficiency in the public service. The project\n            introduced new payroll and human resource management and\n            debt management systems. An effective Integrated Financial\n            Management Information System was linked to the budget\n            development system, to streamline budget and cost estimates.\n            All government bank accounts was consolidated into a\n            Treasury Single Account, to better control public debt\n            management, and provide control over the public wage bill."}, "docdt": "2010-09-23T08:16:02Z"}
