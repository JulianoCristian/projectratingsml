Transparency,\n            and Accountability Project (FIMTAP) for Malawi aims to\n            improve an effective and accountable use of public\n            expenditures through capacity building and institutional\n            strengthening for budget implementation and oversight, and\n            increase transparency of government institutions, as well as\n            to improve human and institutional capacity for expenditure\n            accountability. The project seeks to strengthen expenditure,\n            improve financial management systems, and enhance human\n            capital development. There are four components to the\n            project: strengthening accountability institutions to reduce\n            corruption, and improve allocation and utilization of\n            resources; improve financial management that will\n            electronically link Government with an integrated financial\n            management system to provide data; and human development to\n            support the creation of critical skills needed in areas of\n            financial management, auditing, accounting, management, and\n            information technology; and FIMTAP Secretariat - the project\n            will be managed by the FIMTAP Secretariat."}, "docdt": "2003-02-04T00:00:00Z"}
