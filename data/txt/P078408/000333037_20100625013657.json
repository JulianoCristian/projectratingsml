outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was substantial, the Bank performance\n            was moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance\n            was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned\n            included: the project design should be simple and designed\n            for easy implementation and should take into account the\n            absorptive capacity of the country and the prevailing\n            political context. For efficient use of available resources\n            in a country, project design should take account of grant\n            financing from donors, which however, requires more flexible\n            design of capacity building activities. This will minimize\n            duplication of efforts, and encourage cost effectiveness.\n            Changes in political economy are not predictable, but could\n            be better adapted to if project design allowed greater\n            flexibility in implementation. It is pertinent therefore, to\n            constantly evaluate and adapt to change in circumstances to\n            better maneuver public management reform programs.\n            Candidness in project supervision reporting is essential, as\n            is early management attention to emerging problems. A\n            project should not proceed with Board presentation unless a\n            full technical appraisal and feasibility study of its\n            components have been conducted. Inter-ministerial and donor\n            coordination is crucial to the success of project implementation."}, "docdt": "2010-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
