        Project builds on the previous operation, and further\n            develops the program, by supporting reform policies,\n            particularly regarding the use of public funds for public\n            service delivery, specifically, to the poor, through\n            increased access to, and expansion of quality education,\n            and, through modernized agricultural development practices.\n            This environmental assessment stipulates the need for\n            preparing a three-year capacity building plan regarding\n            environmental protection, establishing units at line\n            ministries, to help screen sectoral investments for the\n            integration of environmental, and social safeguards,\n            supported by technical advise from specialized institutions.\n            Sectoral mitigation measures, thus address: 1) agricultural\n            and livestock issues will follow environmental guidelines as\n            set within the Decentralized Rural Development APL operation\n            recently launched, which contains an environmental\n            management plan covering agricultural safeguards; 2) the\n            HIV/AIDS Response operation also contains a medical wastes\n            management plan, that constitutes a guide for relevant\n            investments, and practices in the health sector; and, 3)\n            included in the Basic Education Project, is an environmental\n            analysis, that provides the framework for mitigating adverse\n            environmental aspects, which could guide the investment\n            management plan. Careful attention will be given to\n            monitoring environmental and social impacts."}, "docdt": "2002-05-31T16:45:05Z"}
