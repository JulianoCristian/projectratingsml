About this Report
       The IndependentEvaluationGroupassessesthe programsand activitiesof the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrityof the Bank'sself-evaluationprocess and to verify that the Banks work is producingthe
expectedresults, and second,to helpdevelopimproveddirections,policies,and proceduresthroughthe
disseminationof lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As partof this work, IEGWBannually assesses about 25 percentof
the Bank's lending operationsthroughfield work. Inselectingoperationsfor assessment,preferenceis givento those
that are innovative,large,or complex; thosethat are relevantto upcoming studiesor country evaluations;those for
which ExecutiveDirectorsor Bank managementhaverequestedassessments; and those that are likelyto generate
importantlessons.
       To preparea Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR),IEGWBstaff examine project files and other
documents, interviewoperationalstaff, visit the borrowingcountry to discussthe operationwith the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff bothat headquartersand
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internalIEGWBpeer review, Panel review, and managementapproval.Once cleared
internally,the PPAR is commentedon by the responsibleBank department. IEGWBincorporatesthe comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrowerfor review;the borrowers'comments are attachedto
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of ExecutiveDirectors.After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosedto the public.


About the IEGWB RatingSystem
       IEGWB's use of multipleevaluationmethodsoffers both rigor and a necessary levelof flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWBevaluators all apply the same basic methodto
arrive at their project ratings. Followingis the definitionand rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additionalinformationis available on the IEGWBwebsite: http:/lworldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevantobjectiveswere achieved, or are expectedto
be achieved, efficiently.The rating has three dimensions:relevance,efficacy, and efficiency.Relevance includes
relevance of objectivesand relevanceof design. Relevanceof objectivesis the extent to which the project's
objectivesare consistentwith the country'scurrent developmentprioritiesand with current Bank country and
sectoral assistancestrategiesand corporate goals (expressedin Poverty ReductionStrategy Papers,Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, OperationalPolicies). Relevanceof design is the extent to which
the project'sdesign is consistentwith the stated Objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expectedto be achieved,taking into accounttheir relativeimportance.Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expectedto achieve, a return higherthan the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost comparedto alternatives.The efficiency dimension generally is not appliedto adjustment
operations.Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to DevelopmentOutcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes)will not be maintained(or realized).Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome:High
Significant,Moderate, Negligibleto Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which servicesprovided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementationthrough appropriatesupervision(includingensuring adequate
transition arrangementsfor regular operation of supportedactivities after loanlcredit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions:quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possibleratingsfor Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory,Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly Unsatisfactory.
      BorrowerPerformance: The extent to which the borrower (includingthe government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensuredquality of preparationand implementation,and compliedwith covenantsand
agreements,toward the achievementof developmentoutcomes.The rating has two dimensions: government
performanceand implementingagency(ies)performance.Possible ratings for BorrowerPerformance:Highly
Satisfactory,Satisfactory, ModeratelySatisfactory,ModeratelyUnsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory,Highly
unsatisfactory.

Preface

        This is the Project PerformanceAssessment Report (PPAR) on six lending
operations to the Republic of BurkinaFaso from 2001 to 2006, to assist the country in
implementing its poverty reduction strategy. The lending instrumentadvocatedby the
Bankto assistBurkinaFasoachievethis objective was budget-support inthe form of
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC). Two programmatic series of three PRSCs
eachare reviewed here. The purpose ofthis report is to assess whether these six
operations have achievedtheir objective.

        The first programmatic series (2001-2003) consistedof: (i) FirstPRSC (Credit
                                                                    the
3565-BUR), inthe amount of SDR 36 million, approvedon August 23,2001. The Credit
becameeffective and was fully disbursedon October 4,2001. Itwas closed on June 30,
2002, the originaldate; (ii)the SecondPRSC (Credit 3691-BUR), inthe amount of SDR
28.1 million, approvedon July 11,2002. The Credit became effective and was fully
disbursedon October 31,2002. Itwas closedon June 30, 2003, the original date. There
was parallel cofinancing bythe Belgian Cooperation for US$5 million; and (iii)  the Third
PRSC (Grant H058-BUR), inthe amount of SDR 35.4 million, approved on July 15,
2003. The Grantbecame effective and was fully disbursedon September29,2003. It
was closed on June 30,2004, the original date.

        The secondprogrammatic series (2004-2006) consistedof: (i)     the Fourth PRSC
(Credit 3900-BUR), inthe amount of SDR 40.9 million, approved on May 11,2004. The
Credit became effective andwas fully disbursedon July 21,2004. Itwas closed on June
30,2005, the original date; (ii)the FifthPRSC (Credit 4053-BUR and Grant H158-BUR),
inthetotalamountof SDR39.9 million (a Credit of SDR 30.6 millionandaGrantof
SDR 9.3 million), approvedon May 3,2005. The Credit andthe Grant becameeffective
and were fully disbursedonAugust 25,2005. They were closed on June 30,2006, the
original date; and (iii) Sixth PRSC (Credit 4194-BUR), inthe amount of SDR 41.8
                       the
million, approvedon June 20,2006. The Credit became effective andwas fully
disbursedon August 31,2006. Itwas closed on June 30,2007, the original date.

        The PPAR is basedon all relevant Bank and Funddocuments and on interviews
withBankand Fundstaff. A mission, consisting ofMonikaHuppi, Lead Economist, and
Ilka Funke, Consultant, visited BurkinaFasoinMay 2007 to discuss performance with
officials who implementedthe projects, representatives o f civil society, membersofthe
Bankresident mission, andlocalrepresentativesofdonors. Basic data sheets are in
Annex A. The draft PPAR was sent to the Government for comments. No comments
were received.

        This report was preparedby Pierre de Raet (Consultant) with Claude Leroy-
Themeze as Task Manager. Cecilia Tanprovided administrative support.

Summary

1.       The purposeofthis PPAR is to assess the extent to whichtwo programmatic
series ofthree PRSCs each (PRSCs I- I11and PRSCs IV-VI), financed by the Bank from
2001 to 2006, helpedBurkinaFaso achieve its objective of reducing poverty inthe
country.

2.       The Governrrient's programs supported by the PRSCs mustbe seen against the
background of developments inthe secondhalf of the 1990s. In 1991,after decades o f
economic mismanagement, the Government (GOB) undertook a wide range of economic
reforms under stabilization and structural adjustment programs supported by the Bank,
the IMF, and the donor community. After declining over the first halfo f the decade,
growth pickedup following the January 1994CFA franc devaluation, reversing past
trends. Real GDP growth reachedan average of 7.5 percentp.a. between1995 and 1999.
Inflationwas contained andthe fiscal and current account deficits were broadly
maintained withinthe IMF's programs limits. The programs ofthe 2000s and the PRSCs
builtuponthe positive achievementsofthe 1990s.

3.       Inspite ofthe goodperformance ofthe late 1990s, social andhumandevelopment
laggedbehindwith poverty (definedas the population below the national poverty line)
increasing from 44.5 percent in 1994to 54.6 percent ofthe population in 1998.' The
Government recognized that the country would not be able to reduce poverty and meet
the 2015 MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs), unless the pace of reforms was
acceleratedto liberalize andopenupthe economy further. To address this situation, it
preparedand issued inmid-2000 a Poverty Reduction StrategyPaper (PRSP-I) built on
four pillars: (i)   acceleratingbroad-based growth; (ii)               ensuring access to basic social
servicesby the poor; (iii)        expanding opportunities for employment andincome-
generatingactivities for the poor; and (iv) promotinggood governance. PRSP-Icovered
a medium-termprogram over 2001-2003, supportedby a first series of three PRSCs. In
November 2004, the PRSP was revised, proposing a medium-termprogram covering
2004-2006 (PRSP-11). Although built uponthe same pillars and objectives of the 2000
strategy, PRSP-I1placed greater emphasis on achieving ahigher level o f growth and
employment. The 2004-2006 program was supportedby a secondseries o f PRSCs. The
donor community also provided budget support to assist inimplementing the strategy.

4.       The six PRSCshadthe same overall objective, Le., helping implementthe PRSP.
They also hadthe same three specific objectives consistentwith the strategic pillarso fthe
PRSP: (i)    accelerating broad-based growth and employment (reforms inthe cotton
sector, agricultural diversification, telecom, energy, labor market, and business climate);
(ii)improving access to basic services (reforms ineducation, health, andwater
infrastructure); and (iii)      promoting good governance (reforms inbudget management,
fiduciary framework, civil service, deconcentration and decentralization, and



 The poverty incidence of 45.3 percent, recordedby the 1998 survey, was readjustedto 54.6 percentby the poverty
assessment conductedjointly by GOB andthe Bankin2003. The ratio was revisedby applyingthe same methodology to the
1998 andthe 2003 data.

while the Government's policies on deconcentration and decentralization had not been
formulated.

5.       Since PRSCs are meant to provide more flexibility andpredictability in
implementing reforms over the medium-to long-term, performance must be assessed
using the same time horizon as that o fthe reform programs themselves. Accordingly, the
PPAR assesses achievements under each o f the three objectives at the end o f the second
programmatic series, Le., inmid-2007. This provides a better picture o f performance
after a period long enoughto make ajudgment, which i s not the case ifassessment is
made year by year.

6.      Macro-economic stability was maintained and performance was consistently
satisfactory under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) programs
throughout the period despite adverse exogenous factors, notably the increase inoil
prices, the appreciation o fthe US dollar, andthe serious deterioration o f the political
situation inCBte d'Ivoire. The Government i s to be commended for its ownership o fthe
reform program, particularly for its determination to adhere to sound fiscal policies, a
considerable challenge inthe circumstances.

7.      Accelerating broad-based growth and employment. Overall, results were mixed.
The growth objective was achieved, butthere is no evidence that it was broad-based or
that it had any impact on employment. Growthreflectedthe good performance o fthe
cotton sector, which was due as muchto the relatively good rainfalls over the six-year
period as to the sector reforms. The large increase inproductionreflects increases in
cultivated areas and not higher yields, which, accordingto the last Implementation
Completion Report (ICR), have declined by over 10percent inrecent years. As the ICR
notes, the good performance o fthe sector should not eclipse the fact that the industry
continues to face manychallenges interms o f efficiency and competitiveness. Incontrast
to cotton, progress was modest inagricultural diversification, a key condition for
broadening the productive basis o fthe country. Although cereal production is estimated
to have increased by between 30 and 60 percent over 2004-2006, productivity remains
low as production is characterized by low mechanization andvulnerability to rainfall
variation.

8.      Inthe other reformareas expectedto generate growth andemployment, results
were modest. The telecom company was privatized, but after long delays, while, inthe
energy sector, the process is not expected to be completed before 2008/09, with a much
delayed impact on lowering power costs, one o fthe key factors to raise competitiveness.
Progress inprivatization provedto be much dependent on reaching a political consensus,
while reforms inthe labor market were also slow, reflecting pressures from labor unions.
Progress was made inremoving bureaucratic obstacles to the registration o f businesses,
insecuring titles, inreformingthe urbancode, etc., butthere islittle evidence that these
had any impact on growth and/or employment.

9.      Improving access to basic services. Inbotheducation and health, access was
improved thanks to regular increases inbudget allocations and expenditures and better
sector budget management. More clarity insector finances was achieved by bringing
more consistency betweenthe different budget documents (Medium-Term Expenditure

9.      Improving access to basic services. Inboth education andhealth, access was
improvedthanks to regular increases inbudget allocations andexpenditures and better
sector budget management. More clarity insector finances was achievedby bringing
more consistency betweenthe different budget documents (Medium-Term Expenditure
Frameworks, Program Budgets, andthe budget) and with GOB'Sten-year plansandthe
PRSP priorities. However, more rapidprogress was hampered by institutional
weaknesses and capacity constraints inline ministries and by the absence of a clear
framework indeconcentration and decentralization

10.     Ineducation, gross enrollment increased from 41.7 percent in 1999-2000 to 66.5
percent in2006 (for girls, from 36.2 to 61.2 percent), a significant increase. However,
quality lags behind, as illustratedbythe following findings: (i) primary completion
                                                                   the
rate stood at 36.4 percent in2006, increasingby 5 percentage points inthree years,
makingit highlyunlikely to reachthe MDGgoal ofuniversalprimaryeducationby 2015;
(ii) literacyrateincreasedfrom18.4percentin1999/00to31percentin2003,but
    the
declined to 30.5 percent in2005; and (iii) ratios pertaining to books/pupil and
                                            the
pupils/teacher have remained stagnant duringthe period under review. The key obstacle
to improvingquality remains the lack o fprogress inraising the number o fteaching hours.

11.     Inhealth, accesswas improvedas evidencedby significant improvementin
vaccination coverage, and it is likely that the MDGgoal will be reached inthat respect.
However, the MDGs with respect to mortality reduction are unlikely to be achieved.
According to the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), under-fivemortality
fluctuated over the past decade, moving from 187per 1,000 live births in 1993, to 219 in
1998, and to 184 in2003. It i s unlikely that the goal o f reducing under-five mortality by
two thirds from the 1990 level (Le., to a rate o f about 60 by 2015) will be reached.
Similarly,the objective o freducingthe maternal mortality rate by three quarters from
1990 to 2015 is unlikely to be reached. The main obstacle to improving services i s the
resistance o fhealthpersonnel to move to rural areas. Inwater and sanitation, the main
reforms consisted o f focusing efforts towards achieving the MDGs, includingimproving
sector management ina comprehensive and coherent manner. But insufficient funding
andweak absorptioncapacity may prove a serious obstacle to completingall the
necessary investments before 2015.

12.     Promoting good governance. Progress was uneven among the different reform
areas. It was significant inbudgetmanagement. Improvementwas steady and
consistently made inbudget formulation with GOB now conducting key activities on a
routine basis; it was less so inbudget execution because o ftechnical issues related to
software incompatibility, which caused at times unexpected delays. This, however, does
not dilutethe progress made instrengtheningand expandingthe IntegratedFinancial
Management System. Progress was also significant inprocurement and inbudget
reporting and control. By the end o fthe first series, the legal and institutional framework
ofpublic procurement had been completely revamped, budgetexecution reports were
regularly submittedto the oversight authority, and the "lois de rdglement" regularly
adopted by Parliament. These were significant achievements on the part of the
authorities.

                                                          xviii


13.       Incivilservice reform, progresswas negligiblebecause ofbureaucratic
complexity and resistance from personnel. Indeconcentration and decentralization,
delays were to be expected as it takes time to arrive at the necessary political consensus
on newpolitical and administrative structures for the State. As noted above, the political,
legal, andadministrative complexity o f formulating and implementingdecentralization
was underestimated. However, by the end o fthe second series, there was inplace a
coherent framework that should greatly facilitate the delivery o f services inthe future. It
is likely that, inthe absence o fthe support provided by the PRSCs, less progress would
have been achieved. Finally, inenvironment, the first steps were taken to strengthen
capacity to prepare Environmental Assessments (EA) and comply with guidelines.

14.       Outcome. Although the poverty incidence increased from 44.5 percent o fthe
population in 1994 to 54.6 percent in 1998, in2003, it stood at 46.4 percent, a decline o f
8.2 percentage points, and, in2006, at an estimated 40.8 percent2. This represents an
average reduction o f about 1.7 points over eight years (1998-2006). However, over the
second series, the average yearly reduction was 1.9 points, just below the target o f 2.0
points p.a. under the medium-term program. These results are below but consistent with
the per capita growth o f about 3 percent over 2001-2006. Assuming a continued decline
o f 1.9 percent per year until2015, poverty incidence would reach about 30 percent by
2015, a major achievement althoughthe target set underthe MDGswill not be achieved.

15.       The extent to whichthe decline inpoverty over the period reviewed here canbe
attributed to the PRSCsi s difficult to assess for two reasons: (i) addition to the Bank,
                                                                                        in
there was substantial budget support from the donor community insupport o fthe same
programs and same objectives; insuch a case, the impact o f-and thejudgment on - the
PRSCscannot be dissociated from that of other interventions; and (ii) significant           the
growth performance o f 6.1 percent p.a. over 2001-2006 was largelydue to the good
performance o fthe cotton sector, which cannot be assumed to continue at the same pace
over many years.

16.       Onthe basis of "modest" ratings for the "growth and employment" and "service
delivery" objectives and o f "substantial" for the "good governance" objective, andtaking
into account the relevance o f objectives and design, the overall outcome is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

17.       Risk to development outcome. Burkina Faso will continue to face serious risks,
not least the possibility o f political instability and external shocks. However, the
country' strong ownership o fthe program and commitment to reforms considerably
reduce the risks o f reversal or change indirection. Inaddition, there are key mitigating
factors at play: the increased responsibility assumed by Burkina's leaders inmanaging
the economy andthe institutional developments that accompanied some reforms, such as
inthe cottonsector, budgetmanagement, fiduciary framework, anddecentralization.
Reforms inthese areas would be difficult to reverse. Inthat respect, the predictability o f
budget support is a strong encouragement to deepen andbroadenthe reform agenda.
Thus, the benefits interms o freductioninpoverty and institutional development are



 Subject to the final results of the 2008 Demographic andHealth Survey to be issued in2009.

                                             xix


18.     However, there is no room for complacency. Burkina Faso faces two major
challenges to reduce poverty further: one is to raise the revenue/GDP ratio, which
stagnates at 10-12 percent, including by developing new sources o f growth and raising
productivity, to be able to finance the poverty reduction programs and reduce dependence
on foreign assistance; andthe other is to overcome the institutional weaknesses and
capacity constraints that retardand limit the benefits derivingfrom the reforms. On
balance, the risk to development outcome is rated Moderate.

19.     Bunkperformance. The medium-term programs and individual operations were
closely aligned with the PRSP andthe Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. On all key
dimensions, issues were well identified and reforms well defined. The programs
incorporated the lessons learned from the 1990 adjustment operations, built on a
substantial body o f analytical work, andmade the necessary corrections and adjustments
as progress was beingmade along the six operations. This is best illustratedby a broader
agenda, stronger coordination among donors, and a muchimproved Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) systeminthe second series. However, as noted above, the design
suffered fiom some shortcomings. A Technical Assistance (TA) operation prior to or in
parallel with the series would have considerably reduced the negative impact o f these
shortcomings. Duringexecution, the Bank showed diligence andflexibility inits
dialogue with the authorities and donors. Realism was injected inadjusting the triggers
andthe measuresmonitored by benchmarks. There was close coordination withthe IMF
and, duringthe second series, the Bankwas constructive inharmonizingits positions
with that o fdonors regardingthe M&Esystem anddisbursement. Bankperformance is
rated Moderately Satisfactory.

20.     Borrower performance. The Government's ownership o f the programs and
commitment to reforms are commendable. Inparticular, it showed determination in
maintainingmacro-economic stability and sound fiscal policies inthe face o f adverse
exogenous sectors. This was a significant achievement inthe circumstances. Also
noteworthy was the cooperationwith the Bank and donors inrevising the PRSP and in
harmonizingthe reform programs, the conditions for disbursement, andthe results
framework, with significant added value as a result. Inthat connection, the learning
process associated with the first series had a beneficial impact on the second. Finally, the
Government demonstrated a willingness and ability to master the discipline o f meeting
legal requirements on a regular basis, an important objective o f the PRSC instrument.
Borrower performance i s rated Satisfactory.

21. The main lessons o f general applicability are the following:

      o PRSCs are usefulinstruments to helpthe borrower assumeincreased
         responsibilityinmanaging its public resources inan efficient manner,
         notably byprovidingmore flexibility and predictability; however, there i s a
         risk o f complacency and o fdependence on continued foreign budget
         support;

       o issueso fattributionare inevitable when the reform programs are supported
         by several donors;

       o since outcomes areto be assessedafter several years, the quality o fthe
         relevant statistical data i s critical; ifinsufficient, preparation should include
         remedial actions, includingthe selection and definition o fbaseline data;

       o since reforms are o fmedium-to long-term nature, early identificationo f
         institutionalweaknessesand capacity constraints i s o fparamount
         importance. Readiness o fimplementationand appropriateness o f a capacity
         buildingoperationprior to or inparallel witha PRSC series should be
         carefully considered;

       o since PRSCs usually targetthe social sectors, implementationrequirements
         expected from line ministries concerned should be carefully identified,
         defined, andplanned, giventhe fact that these ministries usuallyhave weaker
         structures than central ministries;

       o decentralization anddeconcentration are oftenused indiscriminately inBank
         documents, while their meaning is very different. This gives rise to
         confusion. Measures consisting of delegating more authority at
         deconcentrated levels are sometimes presented as progress in
         decentralization, while infact it does not lead to more empowerment at the
         local level. Deconcentrationanddecentralization are complex matters raising
         manypolitical, legal, andinstitutionalissues. Countrylawyers(or
         specialized lawyers) should be active members o fthe team from the start o f
         preparation. Improved service delivery at the local level is dependent on
         establishing first workable structures;

      o coordinationbetween Poverty ReductionandEconomic Management
         (PREM) and sector staffmust be strengthened from the start o fpreparation;
         and

      o to assessoutcome o famedium-termprogram, it is essentialthat the different
         documents o fa PRSC seriesbe consistent incontent andformat, including
         statistical series andother data.

1. Introduction

1.1     The purpose o fthe PPAR i s to assess the extent to which two programmatic series
o f PRSCs (PRSCs 1-111and PRSCs IV-VI), financed by the Bank from 2001 to 2006,
assisted Burkina Faso inachieving its objective o f reducing poverty. PRSCs 1-111were in
support o fthe 2000 PRSP (PRSP-I) and PRSCs IV-VIwere in support o f the revised
PRSP (PRSP-11) issued in2004.

1.2     The first series (2001-2003) built on the pillars o f PRSP-I by pursuingfour
objectives: (i)strengthening program budgets linking allocations to specific sector
objectives, strategies, and action plans; (ii)
                                            improving service delivery inselected line
ministries; (iii)
                strengthening the fiduciary framework to promote accountability and
transparency inthe use o f public funds, includingexternal assistance; and (iv)
strengthening the capacity to track and manage public expenditure efficiently. Objectives
($ (iii), (iv) fell underthe broader objective o f"promoting good governance" inthat
         and
they aimed at achieving better outcomes inthe management ofpublic resources. In
addition to aiming at improving the delivery of social services, mainly inrural areas,
objective (ii)covered reforms inthe rural development sector because they were seen as
stimulating rural growth and employment.

1.3     The second series (2004-2006) built on PRSP-11, the pillars o fwhich were
essentially the same as those underlining PRSP-I. Reforms under PRSCs IV-VI
addressed four objectives consistent with the four pillars o f PRSP-11: (i)
                                                                          accelerating
broad-based growth; (ii)  ensuring access to basic social services by the poor; (iii)
expandingopportunities for employment andincome-generatingactivities for the poor;
and (iv) promoting good governance. Inthe second series, reforms inrural development
were explicitly part o fthe growth and employment agenda, which was broadened to
include reforms insome public enterprises, the labor market andprivate sector
development. However, the rural sector remained the main area or reform giventhe
importance o fthe sector inthe economy.

1.4     Given the commonality o f objectives and reform areas betweenthe two series (see
Table l), for the purpose o f consistency and clarity, this PPAR discusses reforms and
          and
outcomes organized inthree broad areas: (i)   accelerating broad-based growth and
employment; (ii)  improving service delivery; and (iii)  promoting good governance.

1.5     Chapter 2 provides background information onthe economic and social situation
ofthe country inthe early 2000s, prior to PRSP-I issued inmid-2000.

1.6     Chapter 3 describes the objectives o fthe first (2000) and the second (2004)
PRSPs, as well as the objectives and content o fthe six PRSCs insupport o f the PRSPs.
The chapter also discusses the relevance o f objectives and design o fthe six operations.

1.7     Chapter 4 presents achievements under the three broad objectives listed above and
provides for each an assessment ofperformance. Since PRSCs are meant to provide
budgetsupport to enable the borrower to implementdifficult or complex reforms over the
medium-to long-term, performance i s assessedbased onthe same time horizon as that o f

                                             2


the program itself. Giventhe commonality o f objectives and components betweenthe
two series, as indicated above, achievements are assessedat the endo fthe second, Le., in
mid-2007, thus providinga better basis to make ajudgment. However, to providethe
reader with the detailed information o f what was and was not achieved under each
operation, Appendix A and Appendix Bpresent achievements under each objective for
each operation. Appendix A covers the first series, and Appendix B covers the second.

1.8    Chapter 5 provides the overall assessment andthe different ratings.

1.9    Chapter 6 discusses some main findings.

1.10   Chapter 7 offers lessons.

2.       Background

2.1      BurkinaFaso i s apoor landlocked country with limitedresources, highly
vulnerable to external shocks, andwith acute social needs. Its population i s about 13.4
million growing at 3.1 percent per annum, and its GNP per capita was US$430 in2005.
Cotton i s the mainagricultural product andthe main export.

2.2      In1991, after decadesofeconomic mismanagement, the Government (GOB)
undertook a wide range o f economic reforms under stabilization and structural
adjustment programs supportedby the Bank,the IMF, and other donors. During the
1990s, the Bank approved four adjustment operations targeted at macro policies and
public sector management*(there were also sectoral adjustment operations). Growth
recordover the 1990swas uneven. After declining over the first half, growth pickedup
following the January 1994 CFA franc devaluation. The latter, high investment, sound
macro policies, and structural reforms combined to revive economic activity duringthe
second half ofthe decade, reversing the trendo fthe 1980sand early 1990s. Real GDP
growth reachedanaverageo f 7.5 percentper annumbetween 1995 and 1999, and
inflationwas successfully contained, reaching -1.1 percent in 1999. The fiscal and
current account deficits were broadly maintained withinthe IMF's programs limits.
Satisfactory implementation of the FundandBank programs helpedmaintain macro
stability inthe 1990s. Key economic indicators for 1995-2007 are inAnnex B.

2.3      Duringthe 1990decade, BurkinaFaso also made progress inits transition to a
market-oriented economy, notably intrade, fiscal, andpublic enterprises reforms, as well
as insocial policy and institutional development. As a member o fthe West African
Economic and Monetary Union(WAEMU), the country introduced the common external
tariff(CET) ofthe Unionover 1998-2000,whichloweredthe ratesandsimplifiedtheir
structure. In 1998, a law on Government Reformwas enacted aimed at modernizing the
State andreforming the Civil Service. InSeptember 1997, Burkina Fasoreachedthe
decision point under the Original HIPC Initiative and, inJune 2000, its completion point
as well as the decision point underthe EnhancedInitiative. The completion point under
the latter was reached inApril 2002.

2.4      In1995, GOBhadissuedaLetter ofIntentfor SustainableHumanDevelopment
Policy, which laid down its vision ofthe country for 1995-2005. This vision consisted of
transforming the country from one of the poorest inSub-SaharanAfrica into a middle-
income one with a dynamic private sector open to the world economy. However, despite
the goodperformance o f the economy during the 1990s, social and humandevelopment
laggedbehindand social indicators remainedpoor, even comparedto Sub-Saharan
countries. Indeed, the demographic andhealth surveys (DHS)indicated that poverty had

EconomicManagementReformSupport Operation (EMRSO) (FY99); and StructuralAdjustmentCredit-
I11(SAC-111) (FYOO). An internalBank study ratedthe PIDmoderately satisfactory andthe EMRSO
satisfactory.There was an ICR for SAC 111but it was not reviewedby IEG. There was no ICRor ES
Review for SAC-I.

                                              4


increased from 44.5 percent in 1994to 45.3 percent in 1998, and, according to the 1998-
99 DHS, some key indicators were as follows:




      [ HlVpSvalence                   I7.2percent of population (1997)

2.5     Itwas thusrecognized that the country would not beableto reducepoverty and
meet the 2015 MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs), unless the pace o freforms was
acceleratedby liberalizing and opening upthe economy further.

2.6     To address this situation, GOB prepareda Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP-I) in 1999, which was issued inmid-2000, covering amedium-termprogram over
2001-2003. A more ambitious agenda o freforms was expectedto leadto higher growth
rates and substantialpoverty reduction. The strategy was built on four pillars: (i)
acceleratingbroad-based growth; (ii)  ensuring access to basic social services by the poor;
(iii)
    expanding opportunities for employment and income-generating activities for the
poor; and (iv) promoting good governance. For each area, it spelled out specific
medium-termactions aimed at lifting constraintsto growth andreducingpoverty with a
focus onthree priority sectors: education, health, andrural development.

2.7     InNovember 2000, the Bankissuedits Country Assistance Strategy(CAS) for
FYO1-03. Its focus was to assist BurkinaFaso implement its povertyreduction strategy.
Interms ofinstruments, the CAS madea strongargument for consolidating lending
operations into fewer but broaderresourcetransfer mechanisms and, accordingly,
recommendedbudget-support operations inthe form o f PRSCs.

2.8     InNovember 2004, GOB adoptedarevisedPRSPfor 2004-2006 (PRSP-11).
Although itmaintained andbuilt uponthe mainobjectives of the 2000 strategy, it placed
greater emphasis on achieving ahigher level of growth and employment.

2.9     InMay2005, the BankissuedanewCAS coveringFY06-09. As in2000, the
Bank' strategywas fully aligned withthe revisedPRSP. Itwas built around aresults
framework that explicitly definedthe assumed causal links betweenIDA-supported
activities, direct outcomes ofthese activities, andthe country's higher level development
outcomes.

2.10    This PPAR covers two PRSCprogrammatic series, ofthree operations each,
covering 2001-2006. All operations requiredthe maintenance of macro-economic

                                            5


stability. Although the objectives o fthe two series are similar, the first focused on (i)
public sector management and governance and (ii) development, while the second
                                                    human
broadened the agenda by adding growthand employment as major objective. Table 1
shows the commonality o f objectives and components among the six operations.

3.      The Poverty Reduction Strategy and the PRSCs

THEECONOMIC        CONTEXT IN2000
3.1     Growth decelerated to 1.9 percent in2000 against a projectedrate o f 5.7 percent
due to adverse weather conditions and exogenous shocks: the increase inoil prices, the
appreciation o fthe U S dollar, andthe deterioration ofthe political situation inC6te
d'Ivoire (where 3 million Burkinabb reside), a factor that significantly reduced workers'
remittances. Inflation remained slightly negative but prices rose by year end on account
o fthe cereals shortage. The fiscal situation deteriorated duringthe year and the first
semester o f 2001 due to lower growth, the worse than expected impact o f the introduction
o fthe WAEMU's CET, andthe cut inthe excise tax on petroleum products aimed at
reducing the pass-through o f higher oil prices. There was also a delay inthe
disbursement o fprogram assistance due to diplomatic tensions over the country's alleged
involvement inthe regional conflict. To redress its fiscal stance, GOB took a number o f
short-term measures inthe second half o f 2000 to restrain some categories o f
expenditure, while protecting social outlays. Despite the exogenous shocks, macro-
economic stability was maintained and performance was satisfactory under the IMF
program. As a result o fthe deteriorating situation, GOB revised its growth objective for
the PRSP period from 7 to 6 percent p.a.

THE2000PRSP(PRSP-I)
3.2     The first PRSP, finalized inMay 2000, covered a medium-ternreform program
over 2001-2003. The strategy was based on the finding that sustainable poverty
reduction requirednot only rapidgrowth, but growth that offered increased access to
economic opportunity by the poor, was environmentally sound, andwas accompanied by
good governance. Itwas based on four pillars:

(i)acceleratingbroad-basedgrowth,

(ii)ensuringaccesstobasicsocialservicesbythepoor;

(iii)expandingopportunitiesfor employmentandincomegenerationactivities;and

(iv) promoting good governance.

3.3     Inaddition, the PRSP listed four core objectivesfor 2005:

(i)toraiserealGDPpercapita,ataminimum,by3percentannually;
(ii)toreducetheheadcountpovertyindexfrom45.3percent(the1998ratio)
     to less than 35 percent;
(iii)toraisetheliteracyratefrom19to40percent;and
(iv) to increase life expectancy from 54 to 57 years.

3.4     The June 2000 Joint StaffAssessment (JSA) by the Bank andthe Fundendorsed
the thrust o fthe PRSP, but notedthe following: (i) projected real GDP growth rate o f
                                                    the
7 percent p.a. over 2001-2003 seemed overambitious (reduced to 6 percent as noted

                                                  8


above); (ii) document contained limitedanalysis ofwhy public service quality was
            the
low, unitcosts high, and outcomes disappointing (GOB recognized this weakness and
intendedto address these questionsfollowing the completionofPublic Expenditure
Reviews (PER) inthe social sectors); and(iii)       the needto conduct systematic
consultation with the poor. GOB issued four annualprogress reports (PRSP-PR) on the
implementation of PRSP-I (2001 to 2004). Eachwas reviewedby the Bank andFund
Boards.

THE2000BANKCASANDTHERATIONALEFORPRSCS
3.5     Thethrust oftheNovember 2000 Bank CAS, covering FYO1-03, was to assist
BurkinaFasoimplementits poverty reduction strategy. Specifically, it sought to help
reduce the poverty headcountby at least 2 percentagepoints per year during 2000-2003.
To achievethis goal, the CAS was fully aligned with the four pillarsofthe PRSP.

3.6     The CAS arguedthat the main instrument to implement its objectives was direct
budget support to integrate Bankassistancemore closely with GOB'Sown budgetary
allocation and execution processes. Thejustification for a gradual shift to program
lending was based onthe following findings: (i)        several PERs hadnotedthat full and
satisfactory implementation of sectoral strategies inkey sectors (education, health, rural
development) requiredmajor improvements inpublic sector management; (ii)          evaluations
ofprevious operations had concluded that broader instruments could be effective in
supporting policy reforms and that institutional changes were neededto improve
fiduciary management; and (iii)     the Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE), carried out by
the Bank's IndependentEvaluation Group (IEG) in2000, had observedthat too often
Bankprojectshadbeenconceived independently,with littleexplicit analysis ofpotential
trade-offs amongthem. The CAE had also recommendedthat, to addressthe country's
weak institutional capacity and ensure sustainability ofthe reformprogram, "IDA should
focus chiefly on reforming governance, particularlyas it affects the environment for
private sector development and the allocation ofpublic resources"'.

3.7     To address the cross-sectoral andpublic managementissues over the CAS period,
the CAS proposed, inits base case scenario, two PRSCs (2001 and 2003) o f US$60
million each insupport of the PRSPmedium-termreformprogram. By early 2001, three

percent of the CAS base case assistance program of US$422 million for FYO1-03.

3.8     Inearly 2003, itbecameclear that therevision ofthe PRSPwouldtake longer
thanexpected, causingthe Bankto delay the preparation ofanewCAS untilGOB'
strategy would beupdated. Instead, it issued a CAS ProgressReport (CAS-PR) inMarch
2003. With relatively satisfactory progress inthe implementation o fthe PRSP, the CAS-
PR confirmed that the 2000 Bank's strategy remained appropriate andproposed to extend
it for 12-18months untilanew CAS would bepreparedbasedon arevised PRSP. Italso
confirmed continuedBank support through a selection of lending instruments, including
PRSCs.

3.9      The CAS-PR proposedtwo scenariosfor the FY04-05lending program: (i)           one
assumingcontinued vulnerability to external shocks with PRSC-I11and PRSC-IV falling
inFY04for US$40 millionandUS$60million, respectively, andPRSC-V falling in
FY05 for US$60 million; and (ii) scenario assuming a deterioration inthe
                                     another
situation inC8te d'Ivoire warranting an increaseof US$10 million for PRSC-111. In
addition, it proposedto fund PRSC-I11with a grant on the grounds o f BurkinaFaso's
meeting the eligibility criteria under IDA 13threplenishment, i.e., its vulnerability to
long-term debt sustainability due to its dependence on cotton for more than 60 percent o f
exports, and it envisagedthat the allocation could be increasedto US50 million inthe
case of a deterioration o fthe Ivoiriancrisis and assuming a satisfactory performance o f
the PRSP. As itturnedout, PRSC-I11was financed by a grant ofUS$50 millionin
accordancewiththe second scenario2.

THEFIRSTPROGRAMMATIC SERIESANDTHE2001-2003MEDIUM-TERM                          PROGRAM
3.10     The 2001-2003 reformprogram was basedon PRSP-I, the poverty profiles o f
1994and 1998, and substantial analytical work carried out over the preceding years3. All
these documents had identifiedineffective public sector institutions and weak governance
as major constraintsto growth and equitable development while an ineffective public
sector had ledto inadequate service delivery, especially inrural areas. As a result, the
program was conceived and designedto be as closely aligned as possible with the PRSP
objectives and reform areas. The ProgramDocument (PD) for PRSC-I presentedthe
policy matrix andexpectedoutcomes for the medium-termprogram (Annex C). The first
series consisted of three operations:

3.11     PRSC-14,a Credit of US$45 million, was approved on August 23,2001, and fully
disburseduponeffectiveness on October 4,2001. Itwas closed on June 30,2002, the
original date. The Credit was 35 percent ofthe total Bank budget support under the
series.

3.12    PRSC-II', a Credit of US$35 million, was approved on July 11,2002, and fully
disbursedupon effectivenesson October 31,2002. Itwas closedon June 30,2003, the
original date. The BelgianCooperation provided parallel financing for approximately
US$5 million. The Credit was 27 percent ofthe total Bank support under the series.

3.13    PRSC-1116,a Grant o fUS$50 million, was approvedon July 15,2003, and was
fully disburseduponeffectivenesson September 29,2003. It was closed on June 30,

2004, the original date. The Grant was 38 percent o fthe total Bank support under the
series.

3.14     The series built on achievements made inthe late 1990sunder the FY99 EMRSO
andthe FYOO SAC 111. Progress inthe following areas hadbeen considered necessary to
justify further adjustment support:

(i)adoption o fprogram budgets insix key ministries andpreparation o f a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) for 2001-2003;

(ii) adoption inApril andMay 2001 o ftwo decrees: (a) eliminating, as o f September 1,
2001,the automatic link between admittance to a Teacher Training College (TTC) and
civil service employment; (b) creating a new category o f regional teachers not belonging
to the civil service, with a clearly defined status similar to that o fteachers incommunity
schools; and (c) expanding the community school program so that most teachers can be
recruited as non-civil servants. Inaddition, GOB adopted a planto increase the efficacy
o fprimary schooling by introducing automatic promotion between grades 1 and2,3 and
4, and 5 and 6, limitingrepetition to 10percent for grades 2,4, and 6, and increasing
teaching hours from 660 hours to 800 hours p.a.;

(iii)progress inimplementing the public enterprise reform andprivatization program;

(iv) preparationand completion ofthe first PRSP; and

(v) creationinApril 2000 o f a Supreme Audit Institution (Cowdes Comptes - CC)as a
separate entity from the Supreme Court and transmissionto the Chambre des Comptes of
year-endbudget execution reports (draftLois de riglement) for fiscal years 1995 and
 19967.
OBJECTIVESAND COMPONENTSOFTHE FIRSTSERIES
3.15     The 2001-2003 program andthe three PRSCs hadthe same overall objective: to
support the implementationo fPRSP-I by helping GOB achieve better outcomes in the
management of public resourcesto improve basic service delivery. This was to be
achieved by pursuingfour specific objectives:

(i)strengtheningprogrambudgetslinkingallocationstospecificsectorobjectives,
strategies,and action plans;

(ii)improvingservicedeliveryinselectedlineministries;

(iii)strengtheningthefiduciaryframeworktopromoteaccountabilityandtransparencyin
the use of publicfunds, includingexternalassistance;and




7The Chambre des Comptes was not a separateentity from the Supreme Court; it was one o f its chambers,
without full autonomy. Although the C o w des Comptes was created inApril 2000, it did not become
operational untilthe end of 2002. Inthe meantime, the Chambre des Comptes continued to operate. In
1999, for the first time ina decade, the Lois de r2glement for 1993 and 1994 hadbeenenacted by
Parliament.

                                                11


(iv) strengtheningthe capacity to track and manage publicexpenditureefficiently.

3.16    To achieve the objectives, the 2001-2003 program supportedreforms intwo broad
areas:public sector reform and governance, as pre-requisite for effective implementation
of apoverty reduction strategy; andpro-poor sectoral policies and institutional changes
infive sectors: basic education, health, ruraldevelopment, water infrastructure, andthe
environment.

3.17    UnderPRSC-11, the public sector component was expandedto include reforms in
civil service anddecentralization and an improvedM&E systemof the PRSP. The latter
was inresponse to the concern expressedby the JSA inOctober 2001,which hadnoted
the lack of an adequate M&Esystem. The pro-poor componentwas also expandedto
cover environment. With PRSC-111,the agendawas broadenedby supporting reforms in
athird area, growth and employment, as it was increasingly recognized that growthwas a
key determinantofpoverty reduction. Internal Bankreviewsof PRSC-I andPRSC-11,
carried out in2002 and2003, respectively, hadnoted this shortcoming (see paragraphs
3.44 and3.45). Thus, PRSC-I11introduced triggers for PRSC-IV requiringthe adoption
of initial steps towards the privatization ofthe telecom and energy sectors and increased
flexibility inthe labor market. Growth andemployment became an important reform
area under the second series.

3.18    Although the overall and specific objectives remainedthe same, PRSC-I1and I11
introduced some adjustmentsto the policy agendato reflect the strengths and weaknesses
inimplementing the PRSP, to incorporatethe findings ofthe annualprogressreports and
the recommendationsof the JSAs inreviewingthem, andto adapt policy formulationto
evolving knowledge of existing conditions and constraints.

THE2004PRSP(PRSP-11)
3.19    PRSP-11, covering 2004-2006, was preparedinthe courseo f 2003-2004 and
issuedinNovember 2004*. Itupdatedthe strategy laidout inPRSP-I along the same four
pillars:

(i) accelerating broad-basedgrowth, through macro stability, increasedcompetitiveness
andreducedfactor costs, support to productive sectors, and accelerateddevelopment in
the rural areas;

(ii)ensuring access to basic social services by thepoor, through improved access and
quality of education, health andnutrition, potable water and sanitation, and housing and
protection;

(iii)expanding opportunitiesfor employment and income-generating activitiesfor the
poor through reducedvulnerability of agricultural activities, modernization of
agriculture, support to producers' organizations, increased and diversified rural income,
and opening upofruralareas; and



8 The fourth progressreport onPRSP-I, reviewingimplementationduring2003, was issuedat the same
time, inDecember 2004.

                                              12



(iv)promoting good governance alongfour dimensions: political, administrative,
economic, and decentralization.

3.20    The major change from PRSP-Iwas the greater emphasis on growth and
employment. Inaddition, the changes includedbroadeningthe range o f priority sectors,
the introductionofthe regionaldimension, wider involvement ofcivil society, improved
donor coordination through the adoption o f a unifiedbudget support framework, and an
overhaul of the M&E system, centered on a Priority Action Plan (PAP), an operational
document accompanying the PRSP. The expandedlist o f priority measures(food
security, access to potable water and sanitation, HIV/AIDS, development o f SMEs,
public safety, and informationtechnology) reflected the outcome of consultations with
stakeholders, but it also posednew challenges interms o f financing and o f capacity to
implement alarger numberofactivities.

3.21    The PAP becamethe operational document of the PRSP, summarizing policies,
providinga log frame, andproposing an indicative investment program. It also became
the instrumentto monitor implementation better, a concern expressedby donors since
PRSC-11. The donor community, whichhadbeenassociatedto the preparation of PRSP-
11, agreedinJanuary2004, on arevised framework for collaboration: the PAP was given
a central role inmeasuringprogressand defining disbursement criteria. The adoption of
this commonposition overcameto a large extent the previous conflict betweenpolicy-
based criteria usedby the Bank andAfDB for disbursementand indicator-based criteria
usedbybilateral donorsbyplacingthemundera unique andcoherent framework.

3.22    As inthe case ofPRSP-I, PRSP-I1set out overarching, although less ambitious,
medium-termgoals:

(i) increasingreal GDP per capita by at least 4 percentp.a. beginning in2004 (the
assumed average real GDP growth rate was 7 percent p.a.);

(ii) reducing povertyincidence from 46 percent (the 1998 ratio)' to less than 35 percent
by 2015; and

(iii) lifeexpectancytoatleast60yearsby2015throughreductionininfant,child,
     raising
andmaternal mortality.

3.23    PRSP-I1and the fourth progress report on PRSP-I were reviewed by the Boards of
the Bank andthe FundinMay 2005. The JSA concluded that PRSP-11, inaddition to
being a candidassessment ofthe poverty challenges faced by the country, improved on
PRSP-I by providing abroader debateon poverty reduction and by introducing the PAP
as the centerpieceof a more effective M&E system, an issuethat hadbeenraised
consistently by the JSA. GOB issued two annual progressreports on the implementation
of PRSP-II(2005 and 2006). Eachwas reviewed by the Bank and FundBoards.

THE2005BANKCAS
3.24     The Bank issued anewCAS inMay 2005. The CAS completion report (CASCR)
on the 2000 CAS had concluded that development outcomes andBank performance in
supporting the PRSPhadbeengenerally satisfactory. Ithadalso highlightedthe lessons
relevant for shapingthe Bank strategy for FY06-09, i.e., the importance o f a strong
country commitment and of consistencyinpolicy reform; the need for a more aggressive
approachto diversification anddecentralization to accelerate growth; the needto
strengthennational capacity; andthe need for the Bank andthe donor community to
improve coordination andharmonization so as to reduce the burdeno f aid management
onthe country. Onthis basis, the CAS' mainobjective was to continue supporting the
four pillarsof the revisedPRSP. Interms of instruments, it proposedto rely less on
traditional project approaches and increasingly on participatory analytic work, expanded
developmentpolicy lending, sector-wide approaches, and community-driven
developmentmechanisms. The CAS proposedfour PRSCs, one for eachyear over
FY06-09, for atotal of US300 million, representing 54 percent of the indicative IDA
program ofUS$560 million for FY06-09.

THESECONDPROGRAMMATICSERIESANDTHE2004-2006MEDIUM-TERM                                      PROGRAM
3.25     The 2004-2006 medium-termprogram was essentially a continuation ofthe first
program, but more prominence was given to growth and employment by including
reforms inthe telecom and energy sectors, inthe labor market, and inthe business
climate. Reforms inrural development were pursuedas under the first series but they
movedfrom the "service delivery" agenda to the "growth" agenda. Since the second
series was aligned with PRSP-11, it also adopted its results framework. The policy
matrix, expectedoutcomes, and indicators for the 2004-2006 program are inAnnex D.

3.26     Thereis not a strict correspondencebetweenthe period coveredby PRSP-I1
(2004-2006), the 2005 Bank CAS (FY06-09), and the secondprogrammatic series:
PRSC-IV-V-VI were approved, respectively, inFY04, FY05, and FY06. Although,
PRSC-IV was an interimoperation spanningPRSP-I and 11, the medium-termprogram
coveredPRSC-IV to VI. The series consistedof three operations:

3.27     PRSC-IV", a Credit ofUS$60 million, was insupport o fthe 2004 budget; it was
approvedon May 11,2004 and fully disburseduponeffectiveness on July 21,2004l'. It
was closed on June 30,2005, the original date. The share o fthis operation inthe PRSC
series was 33 percent.

3.28     PRSC-Vl2was insupport ofthe 2005 budget. A Credit of US$46.1 million and a

alignmentwith the budget cycle. Accordingly, preparationwas speededup and PRSC-IV was approvedin

The share o fPRSC-V inthe second series was 33 percent.

3.29    PRSC-VI'3, a Credit o f US$60 million, was approved on June 20,2006 and fully
disburseduponeffectiveness on August 31,2006. Itwas closed on June 30,2007, the
original date. The Credit represented 33 percent o f the total Bank assistance under the
second programmatic series.

OBJECTIVESAND COMPONENTS OFTHE SECOND SERIES
3.30    Although buildingon the first series, the second series established a new
framework for Bank assistance focused more on growth, better coordinated with other
donors, and more clearly outcome-oriented. The program was fully aligned with the
vision o fthe revised PRSP and its overall objective was to continue supporting its
implementation. Inaddition to maintaining macro-economic stability, there were four
specific medium-term objectives, consistent with the four pillars o fthe PRSP:

(i)acceleratingbroad-basedgrowth;

(ii)ensuringaccesstobasicsocialservicesbythepoor;

(iii)expandingopportunitiesforemploymentandincome-generatingactivitiesfor
the poor; and

(iv) promotinggood governance.

3.3 1   To achieve the objectives, the program supported reforms inthree broad areas: (i)
policies under growth and employment aimed at lowering factor costs, increasing
productivity, and attractingprivate investments; (ii)      policies under human development
aimed at improving access andquality, and lowering costs; and (iii)          policies under good
governance aimed at strengthening budget performance, the fiduciary framework, public
sector reform, decentralization, and environmental management.

COMMONALITY INOBJECTIVESAND COMPONENTSBETWEENTHE TWO SERIES.

DESIGN
3.33      Eachoperation supporteda one-year slice of the program basedon a Letter of
Development Policy of the Government describing its economic andpoverty reduction
policies as well as the measures plannedto achieve the PRSP objectives. Board approval
was subject to a list ofprior actions. Inaddition, the PD o f eachoperation listed
benchmarksto monitor progress inthe different reformareas and anumber oftriggers to
move to the next operation (PRSC-VI didnot, relying solely on the policy matrix for the
2004-2006 program). The distribution betweenprior actions, benchmarks, andtriggers to
move to the next PRSC for eacho fthe six operations is inAnnex E".

RESULTS      FRAMEWORK

3.34      Thefirst series. The PD for PRSC-Ipresented the key outcomes envisagedby the
endofthe program (Annex C). However, the indicators intendedto measureoutcomes
were fairly limitedand statedingeneralterms. Instead, the PD ofPRSC-I statedthat "the
Bankhas, withthe authorities, key stakeholders anddonors, elaborateda detailed
monitoringframework, based on agreed-uponindicators". These indicators are drawn for
the PRSP". The PDs ofPRSC-I1andPRSC-111didnot provide more information.

3.35      The PRSP's "detailed monitoringframework" referredto by PRSC-I hadtwo sets
of indicators: (i)   for budget management:budget execution rates; share o fbudget
effectively reaching deconcentrateddepartments; half-yearly opinion polls of users of
education and health services and of economic agents or government tenders; and gap
betweenunitprices obtainedby public biddingandthose obtained by the private sector;
and (ii) healthand education: the standardmeasures, such as vaccination rates, school
          for
enrollment rates, etc.

3.36     The adequacyofthe M&Esystemfor the PRSPandtherefore for the PRSCs
becamerapidly an issue. To comply with the recommendation ofthe JSA of PRSP-PR-I
(as noted above), GOB set up apoverty observatory with the financial assistanceof
UNDP and started preparing amore refinedlist of PRSPindicators (this became a trigger
for PRSC-11). That list, discussedby the donor community, was the first step in
developing the monitoring framework of PRSP-11.



l5Throughout this report, the period o f execution o f an operation i s defined as the period extending
between its approval andthe approval o fthe next operation. This definition applies to both series. The term
"prior actions" refers to the actions effectively taken by the Borrower prior to submission o fthe Credit to
the Bank's Board. Benchmarks, listed inthe body o fthe PDs or in matrices, monitor the execution o f
policies/actions inthe course o f the year, as definedabove, and the term "triggers" refers to the conditions
requiredto move to the following operation. Inlisting "prior actions", this report refers to the list inthe
Development Credit Agreements (DCA) andnot to the list mentioned inthe PDs, since there are
discrepancies insome cases.

3.37     Thesecondseries. The policy matrix for the second series (Annex D)had a
results framework including annual indicators consistent with PRSP-I1and relevant to the
program's objectives and appropriate for measuring their achievement. However, some
important indicators, such as maternal and child mortality, and life expectancy, were
missingfrom the lid6.

RELEVANCE OF OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN.
3.38     For both series, program and project objectives were highly relevant to country
conditions at the time they were formulated. Bothprograms were fully aligned with the
pillars o fthe PRSP andwere consistent withthe Bank 2000 and2005 CAS, themselves
aligned with the PRSP. Inbothcases, program preparationwas concomitant with the
formulation o fthe PRSP and the CAS. Objectives are also relevant to the conditions
currently prevailing inBurkina Faso. Both CASs emphasized that the mainobjective o f
the Bank assistance was to support the PRSP and that PRSCs were the main instruments
to achieve that objective.

3.39     The timing for initiating a PRSC series in2001 was propitious inthat growth had
recovered following the 1994 devaluationwhile EMRSO and SAC-I11 hadlaidthe
ground for deeper reforms, especially inpublic sector management, and therefore reforms
were rightly expected to be undertakenina favorable climate. The emphasis in2001 on
improving public sector performance and service delivery was judicious but it was
somewhat at the expense o f identifling early on a growth agenda based on increased
competitiveness, diversification, andtrade liberalization. This was noted by internal
Bankreviews o fPRSC-I andI1(see paragraphs 3.44 and 3.45) and soonbecame quite
apparent. Accordingly, growth and employment rightly received increased attention in
the second series.

3.40     The designo fthe programs andprojects was relevantto the objectives inthat the
proposed policy reforms and actions were clearly linked to three goals: greater efficiency
inpublicresourcesuse, improvedaccessto social services, and greater role ofthe private
sector as agent o f growth and employment. The choice o fbudget support was well
adapted to those objectives inthat it provided more flexibility for GOB to manage its
budgetandpoverty reductionprograms. The designwas also relevant inthe sensethat
there were links between funding andkey outputs (e.g., for service delivery), or between
time-boundactions and outputs (e.g., setting timetables for programbudgets or the
MTEF). The designalso benefitedfrom a substantial bodyo fanalytical work which
helpedpoint to specific actions.

3.41     The designo fthe second series was a significant improvement over that o fthe
first series on two counts: it had a three-year results framework specific to the three
operations and it allowed for increased coordinationwith other donors providing budget
support through the General Framework for Budget Support (CGAB) established in
January 2005. The CGAB provided for annual progress reports and ajoint performance




l6This is probably due to the fact that the next DHSwas to be camed out in2008, with its results not
availablebefore2009.

matrixwithagreed targets andindicators, thus allowing for better coordination in
performance assessment and indisbursement o f aid.

3.42     However, there were some shortcomings indesign.

(i) ofthesixoperationswasapprovedintimefordisbursementtotakeplaceearlyin
   none
the budget year because of processing delays attributable to boththe Bank andthe
B~rrower'~;

(ii) thoughpreparationoftheprogrambuiltonextensivecountryknowledgeand
    even
analytical work, there was a lack o f readiness for implementation insome cases. As a
result, the timetable plannedfor fulfilling some triggers was not realistic although
constraints to their effective fulfillment must have beenknown at appraisal: it was the
case notably for reforms inprocurement andthe operationalization ofthe Cow des
Comptes;

(iii) thesamevein,theBankunderestimatedinstitutionalweaknessesandcapacity
     in

should have argued infavor o f a TA operationto accompany the PRSC series. Although
some ongoingprojects comforted the implementation o f the PRSCs, they were no
substitutes for a TA operation: a Public Sector Management Project was foreseen by the
2000 CAS for FY03, but was not ready untilFY05, without much time to have a
significant impact on the second series (the Administration Capacity BuildingProject
was approved inMarch2005 andbecame effective inAugust 2005);

(iv) the attempt at introducing reforms inthe social sectors inrural areas while GOB'S
policies on deconcentration and decentralization had not been clearly formulated proved
frustrating with uncertain results untilthe new Local Government Code (LGC) was
adopted inlate 2004; the legal, political, andadministrative difficulties o f formulating
and implementingpolicies indeconcentration and decentralizationare notoriously
complex; they were underestimated by the Bank; and

(v) as already noted, there was hardly any M&Esystem inplace for the first series. IEG
recognizes that the Bank didnot require a coherent results framework when the first
series was formulated.

3.43     The comments made by internal Bankreviews o fthe first two operations in2002
and2003 are worth noting inthis PPARas they remainpertinent to this day.

3.44     In2002, aninternalBankreview ofPRSC-Icharacterizedthe project as
satisfactory overall. It noted, however, that, although the operation's development
objectives were likely to be achieved, its contributions to poverty reduction were limited
to enabling actions. It stressedthat the proposed reforms were certainly necessary
conditions for poverty reduction but insufficient inand o fthemselves to leadto a



17Although insupport ofthe 2001 budget,PRSC-Iwas disbursedonly inOctober2001 (this problemwas
encounteredthroughout both series, the earliest disbursementhavingbeeninJuly underPRSC-IV).

sustainedreduction, giventhe different constraints to growth. The implication was that
the agenda should have been broadened to tackle constraints to increased
competitiveness, external liberalization, and openness to the sub-region.

3.45    Similarly, in2003, a review o fPRSC-I1concluded that the project was
satisfactory overall. However, inaddition to noting that the riskshad been
underestimated, it pointed to several areas needing improvement. Particularly, it
questioned the fact that the operation was based solely on improved efficiency ofpublic
expenditure while there were other factors that might be as relevant for poverty reduction,
such as growth and increased competitiveness. The issue, already raised inthe context o f
PRSC-I, was further highlighted by the review o f PRSC-11. Three other areas were also
listed as deserving more attention: (i)the risk assessmentwas too general and did not
address specific risks;(ii)the capacity issues had not been sufficiently addressed,
especially inline ministries, since the objective o f the operation was to improve service
delivery; and (iii)there were too manytriggers.

4.       Achievement of Objectives'

4.1      This chapter assesses achievement o fthe three mainobjectives, as listed inthe
previous chapter, for both series, since the objectives and components were very similar
and virtually all reforms followed a continuous path through the six operations. Inthis
connection, it is important to note that, under the first series, reforms inthe rural
development sector were seen as addressing the objective o f growth and employmentbut
were listedunderthe objective o fimproving accessto social services, apparently because
their impactwas expected mostly inrural areas, as well as that expected fromreforms in
the social sectors. Starting with PRSC-IVYreforms inrural developmentwere explicitly
listed as part o fthose addressing growth and employment. Inthe sections below, reforms
inthe ruralsector inthe first series are discussedunder the objectiveofgrowth and
employment for the purpose o f consistency.

4.2      Inadditionto maintainingmacro-economic stability, the three objectiveswere: (i)
accelerating broad-based growth and employment; (ii)          improving access to social
services; and (iii) promoting good governance. Annexes F and Gprovide details on
outcomes for the first and second series, respectively.

A.       MAINTAININGMACRO-ECONOMICSTABILITY.
4.3      Macro-economic stability was maintained throughout the period despite adverse
exogenous factors andperformance was consistently satisfactory under the PRGF. GOB
is to be commended for its ownership o f the reform program despite the difficult
environment, particularly its determination to adhere to sound fiscal policies, a
considerable challenge inthe circumstances. Real GDP growth averaged 6.1 percent
over 2001-2006, implyingan annual increase o f about 3 percent inper capita growth.
Growth was drivenby cotton production, which rose by 75 percent from 2001 to 2006.
Inflation remained under control at an average o f 2.9 percent p.a. The fiscal deficit was
contained byprudentfiscal policies and significant inflows o f external assistance
(estimated at 9 percent o f GDP according to the ICR for PRSCs -1V-VI). Similarly, the
current account deficit was maintained within the targets, improvinginfact at the end o f
the periodreflecting large increases incotton exports due to highdomestic producer
prices. A new PRGF program was agreed inApril 2007.

4.4      Assessment. For bothPRSC series, macro-economic stability is rated substantial.

B.       ACCELERATINGBROAD-BASED               GROWTH EMPLOYMENT
                                                          AND
4.5      There were reforms insix areas: cotton, agricultural diversification, telecom,
energy, labor market, and business climate. They aimed at removingobstacles to growth
and employment, reduce factor costs, increase productivity, andpromote private sector
investment.

series and inAppendix B for each operation ofthe secondseries.

                                               20


4.6      Inthe cotton sector, wherethe traditional operator was apublic enterprise,
SOFITEX, GOB's policy was to open the sector to private investment by abolishing
SOFITEX's monopoly on cotton marketing and openingtwo o fthe three growingzones
to private operators. The process was well plannedand was carried out successfully,
however with delays at certain stages o fthe process. Assets o f SOFITEX intwo
producing zones were transferred to two private operators who started operating in
September 2004. Together, they control 15 percent o f the ginningcapacity. GOB kept
35 percent o f SOFITEX's capital but allowed it to be privately managed. Inparallel with
the privatization process, GOB established mechanisms specifying the rules regarding
price setting, credit mechanisms andrisk guarantees applicable to all actors inthe sector.
Inaddition, a cottoninter-professionalassociationwas established inFebruary 2006 to
coordinate activities inthe sector.

4.7      Cottonproduction increased from 276,000 tons in2000 to 663,000 tons in2006,
Burkina Faso becoming the largest producer inWest Africa. However, it is not clear to
what extent this large increase is due solely to the restructuring o f the sector.

4.8      Financial difficulties emerged inthe sector in2006 under the combined effect o f
low cotton prices on the world market in2004-2005 andthe large increase inproduction
over the preceding years due to the highproducer prices (after increasing by 85 percent
from 2003-2004 to 2005-2006, the harvest declined by 12.6 percent in2006-2007). The
three companies experienced financial difficulties requiring their recapitalization. GOB
andthe professioninitiatedthe revision o fthe producer price mechanism to align itbetter
to the international market. The financial restructuring o f SOFITEX was still ongoing by
mid-2007, when PRSC-VI1 was approved. InMarch 2007, GOB launched a study on the
long-term sustainability o fthe sector, including the possibility o f adopting transgenic
cotton.

4.9      Agricultural diversification. Under each o fthe first three PRSCs, there were
triggersto promote agricultural diversification by developingaction plans for agricultural
products, including cereals (millet and sorghum), rice, cowpea, fruits and vegetables,
livestock and meat, and oilseed. The results o f diagnostic studies were disseminated and
action plans for several streams were completed as well as health guidelines for livestock.
Implementationo f some plans started but progress was slow and limited, particularly in
providing support to exporters. Onthe basis o fthe studies and action plans, GOB
adopted its global rural development strategy inDecember 2003. However, effective
implementationo fthe plans was slow because o f lack of funding. As a result, there was
little practical impact o fthe efforts at diversification with no evidence on growth and
employment.

4.10     Inorder to bringthe differentagricultural sub-sectors moreinconformitywiththe
PRSP objectives and priorities, two measures were envisaged: (i)      IDA-financed rural
development operations were restructured inorder to harmonize their objectives,
implementation strategies, content, management procedures, and M&Ewith those
definedinGOB's rural development strategy and the PRSP; and(ii) reorganizationo f
                                                                         the
the ministries active inthe rural sector was to be carried out on the basis o f institutional
audits, but here also, progress was slow: by the end o f the second series, the

                                              21


reorganization ofthe Ministry ofAgriculture had started and an action planto increase
the efficiency of the Livestock Ministryhad been adopted.

4.11 Severalmeasureswere taken to reduce the vulnerability of agricultural activities,
includingimprovedaccess to ruralroads andimprovedmaintenance of departmental
roads. Finally, regulations were drafted organizing the principles andrules to govern the
transfer or delegation of missions to chambers o f agriculture, other professional
organizations, andthe private sector, but the texts hadnot been adoptedby 2006.

4.12    Intelecom,the reformcalledfor the privatizationofthe traditional operator,
ONATEL. The privatizationwas delayed on two occasions, first becauseo fpre-qualified
biddersinsistedon having amajority share, and secondbecauseofdelay inrecruitinga
privatization advisor. The privatizationwas finally completed at the end o f 2006, but
some implementationtexts for the functioning ofthe regulatory authority had still not
beenadoptedby mid-2007.

4.13    Inenergy,reformscalledfor: (i) adoptionofreviseddevelopment strategies in
                                           the
the electricity andpetroleum sectors; (ii) revisionofthe 1998law governing the
                                            the
electricity sector to adapt the legal and regulatory framework to the needs o f a privately-
operated sector; (iii)private participation inthe capital ofthe petroleum company; and
(iv) expediting work onthe powerlinebetweenOuagadougou andBobo-Dioulasso to
complete the connectionto the Ivoiriangrid andreduce the cost of electricity.

4.14    Progresswas unevenand slow: (i) strategies were adoptedby the Cabinet
                                             new
only inMarch2004, as a result of which the enactment of a revised law allowing for the
creation of a regulatory authority for the electricity sector was delayed; (ii)
                                                                              the
accounting and financial audits ofthe electricity andpetroleum companies were not
completed by the expecteddate, causingdelays inthe issuanceofthe tender for the
selection of a private operator for the management o fthe electricity company and ofthe
biddingdocumentsfor private participation inthe capital ofthe petroleum company; and
(iii) ontheOuagadougodBobo-Dioulassopowerlinewasdelayedfortechnical
     work
reasons. By the end o fthe second series, no progress hadbeen made inthese areas.

4.15    Labor market reforms. Progresswas slow because of resistance from unions to
bringmore flexibility inemployment. A revised Labor Code was enacted in September
2004, but the implementationdecrees hadnot been adopted by mid-2006. GOB was to
undertake in2004 a comparativestudy of labor market and regulations inneighboring
countries to benefitfrom broader experiences and best practices andthereby inform
discussions with employers and unions. After long delays, the study was completed in
December 2006 as an input to tripartitediscussions on reform options. The discussions
were completed inearly 2007, with the adoption o fthree decrees on overtime work, the
modalities for the implementation of the 40 hour-week innon-agricultural enterprises,
andthe conditions for dismissals.

4.16    Private sector development. Severalmeasures were adoptedto improve the
business climate: (i) entities responsible for investment registration, norms and standards,
andtrade informationwere strengthened; (ii)     atransitory VAT arrears reimbursement
mechanism was establishedto acceleratethe refundsdue to exporters; (iii)law was
                                                                             a

                                               22


enacted inDecember 2006 simplifying property registration procedures andreducing the
cost o ftransferring property; and (iv) progress was made inthe preparationo f a law on
landtenure (Loi d'orientationsur lefoncier en milieu rural). Finally, gold mining
expanded as a result o fthe revision o f the Mining Code in2003.

4.17    Assessment. Overall, resultswere mixed. The growth objective was achieved,
butthere is no evidence that itwas broad-based. Nor isthere evidence that there was any
impact on employment. Growth was largely due to the good performance o f the cotton
sector, attributable as muchto the relatively good rains over the period as to the
liberalization o fthe sector. Burkina Faso i s now the first cotton producer inSub-Sahara
Africa. However, growth was due to increases incultivated areas andnot to higher
yields, which, according to the last ICR, have declined by over 10 percent inrecent years.

4.18    Although there is no evidence that the good performance o fthe sector had any
impact on employment for the poor inrural areas or on reducing inequality, there i s a
presumptionthat it musthave hada positive impact.

4.19    Itis not surprisingthat that the liberalization ofthe cottonhadapositive impact
on production and exports since the sector had always been fairly well organized interms
o f delivery o f inputs, guaranteed prices, trade, transport, and export outlets. However, as
the ICRnotes, the good performance o f the sector should not eclipse the fact that the
industry continues to face manychallenges interms o f efficiency and competitiveness.

4.20    Incontrast to cotton, progresswas modest inagriculturaldiversification, although
a key condition for broadeningthe productive basis o f the country. According to the
ICR, production o f cereals is estimated to have increased by between 30 and 60 percent
over 2004-2006. However, productivity remains low as production is characterized by
low mechanizationand vulnerability to rainfall variation. The various action plans
carried out were infact enabling measures, and they still are to producepractical results
interms ofproduction, marketing, commercializationandexports. Successful
diversification depends on overcoming a multitudeo f obstacles for each product:
research, organization o fthe profession, quality standards, trade andtransport, etc. It i s
the result o f a myriadof factors and takes a longtime to bear fruit.

4.21    Inprivatization, labor marketflexibility, andPSD, progress was slow andlimited
with little discernible impact on growth and employment. ONATELwas privatized with
beneficial impacts on costs and access, but the process took much longer than envisaged.
Inthe energy sector, the processis notexpected to be completedbefore 2008/09
according to the ICR, with a much delayed impact on power costs, one o f the most single
factors to raise competitiveness. The difficulties o freaching a political consensus as well
as lengthy procedures are responsible for the delays. Reforms inthe labor market were
also slow, reflecting pressures from labor unions. InPSD, progress was made in
removing bureaucratic obstacles to the registration of businesses, insecuring titles,
reformingthe urbancode, etc., but there i s little evidence that these had any impact on
growth and/or employment.

                                            23


4.22    On balance, the rating is modest for both series.

c.      IMPROVINGACCESS BASICSOCIAL SERVICES
                             TO
4.23    Reforms were plannedinthree sectors: education, health andwater infrastructure.

Education

4.24    Reforms called for: (i) implementing the policies and measures enunciated inthe
Educational Policy Statement and the Ten-YearEducationPlan (2001-2010) (PPDEB)
adoptedin2001,some provisions of which hadbeenformalized by decree inApril and
May 2001, as conditions for PRSC-I (see para. 3.14); (ii) increasingbudget allocations in
conformity with the PPDEB; (iii)   improving access inthe poorest provinces; and (iv)
formulating a sectoralMTEFto manage the education budget ina more global and
coherentmanner.

4.25    Implementation of the PPDEB. To complement the measures adopted in
April/May 2001, a decree was adopted inOctober 2001,definingthe following: (i)     the
scope of deconcentrationinthe sector and the role andresponsibilities at each level ofthe
system; (ii) institutional changes needed and the volume of activities to be carried out
            the
withinthe PPDEB; and(iii) reorganizationofthe units andservices ofthe Ministry of
                            the
Primary Education (MEBA).

4.26    The newpolicies were aimed at improving access, including by deconcentrating
service delivery. Inthe absence of implementation texts of the July 2001 law creating the
regions as administrative entities andauthorizing governors to makepayment at the
regional level, GOB tested a systemconsisting of delegating the authority to make
payment inBobo-Dioulasso as apilot experiment. The experiment, which was evaluated
at the endof 2003, proved successful inreducing delays inbudget execution andthe
experiment was extendedto four other regions in2004. Itwas to be extendedto seven
more regions in2005-2006. The responsibilities for the recruitment and assignment of
teachers were transferredto the regional directorateso f MEBA in2003/04, but the
payment of salariescontinued to bemade from the central budget untilthe
deconcentrationprocess had made more progress, viz. the appointment o fthe regional
governors, the extension ofbudget managementto the regional capitals, andthe
deconcentrationofthe payroll managementsystem, all actions that took place after the
adoption ofthe LGC inDecember 2004.

4.27   The increaseinteaching hours from 660 hours to 800/900hours to improvethe
quality of educationhad been plannedas part ofthe 2001 reforms. However, by the end
ofthe second seriesit had not beenimplemented; a study was completed but an action
planto implementthe measurewas never prepared.

4.28   Financing. All PRSCsrequiredthat sufficient resourcesbe allocated to
implementthe PPDEB. The share ofprimary education intotal education expenditure
was maintained at 60 percent inthe medium-term, while education expenditure increased
from 1.6 percent of GDP in2000 to 2.3 percent in2006. (Annex B).

                                                24


4.29    Access to education in thepoorestprovinces. All PRSCs emphasized the need to
improve access inthe 20 rural provinces with the lowest coverage. The cost of education
to poor families was reduced by subsidizing school supplies, distributing books free o f
charge, andproviding schools with sufficient resources to cover basic materials and
operating costs. Access was also to be improved by expanding the number of schools
equipped withrunningwater and separate latrines for girls andby adopting multigrade
anddouble shift teaching where feasible. However, resultswere lower than expected
because of capacity constraints and delays inmobilizing HIPC resources inthe early
2000s, while the system o f sub-cycles was only introduced inthe 2003-2004 school year
and its effective implementationinall provinces remaineduncertain.

4.30    Sectoral MTEF. To obtain a better picture o fthe total resources andexpenditures
o fthe sector as a whole over the medium-tern, GOB completed a PER for secondary
education and finalized in2006 a sectoral MTEF for primary and lower secondary
education taking into account the objectives o fthe PPDEBand o fthe MDGs. Also, the
2006 program budget for primaryeducationwas strengthened inthat, for the first time
since 2001, it reflected personnel expenditures and linkedthe PPDEB, the MDGs, andthe
MTEFina consistent manner. The PPDEBwas revisedandupdatedfor the second half
ofits implementation(2006-2010) to reflect the lessons ofthe first half; and the system
o f delegation o f credits to the local level was introduced for the lower secondary cycle in
the 2006 budget.

Health

4.3 1   Reforms called for: (i)    implementing the policies andmeasures enunciated inthe
National Health Policy Document and the Health Sector Development Program(200 1-
10) (PNDS) adopted in2001, as prior action for PRSC-I; (ii)       increasingbudget
allocations inaccordancewith the PNDS; (iii)       improving access to health services and
drugs; (iv) formulating a sectoral MTEFto have a global view o fthe sector andits
finances; and (v) promoting participation inlocal co-management and activities.

4.32    Implementationof the PNDS. Inaccordance with the 2001 strategy, and with the
purpose o f facilitating access to health services, several institutional and organizational
measures were taken, such as the issuance o f administrative instructions organizing the
deconcentration anddecentralization o f healthpersonnelandtheir respective role.
However, as inthe case o f education, these could not become applicable untilthe policy
on deconcentration and decentralization was formulated and a law enacted (inDecember
2004). Inthe meantime, payment was delegated to the regional level under the Bobo-
Dioulasso experiment as for education.

4.33    Financing. All PRSCs requiredthat sufficient budget allocations be made to
implement the PNDS. Health expenditure increased from 1.3 percent of GDP in2000 to
1.8 percent in2006 (Annex B). After the closing o fthe IDA Health and Nutrition Project
inSeptember 2001, GOB providedthe resourcesto replace the IDA funds which had
financed the health districts and regional health directorates, thereby ensuring continuity
infunding.

                                              25


4.34     Pending the implementation o f budget deconcentration at the regional level, GOB
established in2003 petty cash accounts (rkgies d'avance") inall 66 health districts to
strengthen effective budget management at the lowest level o fthe regional administration
(district) andthus ensure that funds were available when needed. Managers were
appointed and trained to manage the accounts. Followingthe establishment o fthe petty
cash accounts, the share o f deconcentrated credits inthe health budget was increased by
10percent inthe 2004 budget. While the introduction o f "rkgies d'avance" was meant to
contribute to improving access, their effective functioning was hamperedby the
difficulties encountered by local personnel inusing the system, notably injustifying
expenses intime to receive subsequent tranches, inspite o f increased flexibility
introduced by M O F inits use. Pending the adoption o f a formal mechanismto monitor
the "rkgies d'avance", the Ministry o f Health (MOH) andthe Treasury put inplace an
informal mechanism. Finally, the design o f a pilot thirdparty payment system at the
local level to finance the essential health services for indigents was finalized.

4.35     Improvement in access (availability, accessibility,and quality of health care).
Access was improved inreaching wider service areas, especially inrural areas. Also,
reduced costs contributed to improving access. The mainmeasures adopted were the
following: (i) antenatal care, vaccination, and distribution o f vitamin A supplements after
the discontinuation o fthe polio vaccination days were provided free o f charge throughout
the period covered by the six PRSCs; (ii)   a system o f subsidies for obstetrical
emergencies and reduced costs o f assisted birthbecame applicable starting with the 2006
budget year; (iii) profit margins on essential generic drugs sold by the National Drug
Procurement and Distribution Company (CAMEG) and private wholesalers were limited
to maximum 25 percent; (iv) CAMEG's inventory shortfall for 45 generic drugs was
maintained at less than2 percent, against a target o f less than 8 percent; (v) transparency
inpriceswas raisedbythe adoptionandpublication, as o fMarch 1,2003, o fa nationally
applicable list o fprices for generic drugs andmedical services; the list covered
subsidized prices for 3 pediatric drugs, pediatric consultations, and cost o f birth(starting
in2004, thebudget includedthe level ofallocationsrequiredfor the provisionofhealth
services at the prices specified inFebruary2003); (vi) a revision o fthe fee structure for
physicians and services inhospitals helpedwiden access to essential services at
acceptable costs; and (vii) a system o f integratedmanagement o f childhood illnesses was
introduced in 15 health districts andwas to be extended to 15 additional districts in2006.

4.36     However, several efforts produced few results. The proposedadoption o f a
systemofperformance-based contracts between GOB and hospitals was delayed, as well
as the establishment o f an inter-sectoral coordination framework and actionplanfor
childyouth malnutrition. Similarly, the policy o f encouraging healthpersonnelto move
to rural or underserved areas remained elusive. Graduates from the national health school
were assigned directly to the regional and district levels while Community Health Centers
were to be staffed with the minimumpersonnel as required by MOH. However, it i s not
clear to what extent these measures were effectively implemented.

4.37     A trigger for PRSC-I11requiredputtinginplace incentivesto encourage health
personnel, inparticular surgical staff, nurses, and midwives, to work inrural areas,
particularly poor and inaccessible areas, so as to ensure a highlevel of coverage for key
services for women and children. The incentive system was to be based on different

                                                26


experiments carried out and on two studies, one undertakenby WHO and one locally.
Althoughthe studies were completed inMay 2003, andvalidated bythe Cabinet,
consultations with donors and unions were deemed necessary before implementing their
recommendations. An action planwas prepared but it hadnot been adopted by the end o f
the second series.

4.38     Participation in local co-management and activities. The PRSCs emphasized the
need for local communities to participate actively indecision-making. Several measures
were taken: (i) a review o fthe activities o f the Local Management Committees was
carried out covering issues such as the quality o f relations with the communities and

different administrative departments caused the necessary revision o fthe texts to be
delayed; (iii)training manual for teachers andparticipants intraining seminars for
              a

nutrition, and reproductive health were elaborated.

4.39     Sectoral A4TEF. A sector-wide MTEFwas completed inMarch2005, covering
2005-2007, including a fiamework for the annual monitoring and evaluation o f the
PNDS. It served as an input for the elaboration o fthe 2006 budget.

Water Infrastructure

4.40     The agenda focused on meetingthe MDGs. To that effect, an action planwas
prepared to reach the MDGo f halving the number o fpeople without access to safe water.
Itformed the basis o fthe water strategy inthe revisedPRSP. Inaccordance withthe
plan, several studies were launched: (i) definition o faninvestmentprogram and
                                          the
financing needsto reach the MDGs (accordingly, additional resources were allocated for
expandingONEA's hygiene and sanitation program to four cities and supporting the
water and sanitation program o f the General Directorate o f Water and Sanitation); (ii) the
preparation o f a national water program for rural and semi-urban areas; (iii)the revision
o f the framework document for the reforms and equipment maintenance insemi-urban
areas; and (iv) the revision o fthe national strategy for sanitation.

4.41     However, some projects that hadbeen plannedwere delayed untilcompletion of
the above studies: (i) the preparation o f an actionplanfor public-private partnerships was
postponed; (ii) the planned operation o fnew water concessions in 13 provinces was
delayed until studies for rural and semi-urbanareas were completed; and (iii)   strategic
sanitation planswere completed for 4 secondary cities instead o f 10 (6 were delayed by
weak capacity and inadequate funding).

4.42     A planwas also preparedto verify the list o fall users belonging to the public
administration so as to reduce GOB'Swater bill. Verification was carried out as well
control for water leaks inpublic buildings.

4.43      Assessment. Table 2 shows the progress achieved ineducation and health. The
data inthe table should be usedwith caution as there are discrepancies between sources

while some data are estimatesas of2006. Inbotheducation andhealth, access was
improved thanks to regular increasesinbudget allocations and expenditures and better
sector budget management. More clarity insector finances was achieved by bringing
more consistency betweenthe differentbudget documents (MTEFs, PBs, andthe budget)
andwith GOB'Sten-year plansandthe PRSPpriorities. However, more rapidprogress
was hamperedby the institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints inline ministries
andbythe absence of aclear framework indeconcentration anddecentralization.

4.44     Ineducation, grossenrollment increasedfrom 42.2 percentin1998-99to 66.5
percent in2006 (for girls, from 33.6 to 61.2 percent), a significant increase. However,
quality lags behind, as illustrated by the following findings: (i)                        the primary completion
rate stood at 36.4 percent in2006, increasingby 5 percent inthree years, makinghighly
unlikely to reachthe MDGgoal of universal primary education by 2015; (ii)                              the literacy

                                                      28


rate increased from 18.4 percent in 1998/99 to 21.8 percent in20032; and (iii)                the ratios
books/pupil andpupils/teacher have remained stagnant since 2004. The key obstacle to
improving quality remains the lack o fprogress inraising the number o fteaching hours.

4.45     Inhealth, accesswas improvedas evidenced by significant improvement in
vaccination coverage, and it is likely that the MDGgoal will be reached inthat respect.
However, the MDGswith respect to mortality reduction are unlikely to be achieved.
According to the DHS surveys, under-five mortality fluctuated over the past decade,
moving from 187per 1,000 live births in 1993, to 219 in 1998, and to 184 in2003. It is
unlikely that the goal o f reducing under-five mortality by two thirds from the 1990 level
(i.e., to a rate o f about 60 by 2015) will be reached. Similarly, the objective o f reducing
the maternalmortality rate by three quarters from 1990 to 2015 is unlikely to be reached.
The main obstacle to improving services i s the resistance o f health personnelto move to
rural areas3.

4.46     Inwater and sanitation, the percentage o fhouses withaccessto safe drinking
water inrural and semi-urban areas increased from 60 percent in2005 to 62 percent in
20064, while inurbanareas it increased from 54 percent in2003 to 74 percent in2006,
according to the ICR'. The policy consisting o f focusing efforts towards achieving the
MDGs,including improving sector management ina comprehensive and coherent
manner, was a sound one. But insufficient funding and weak absorption capacity may
prove a serious obstacle to completing all the necessary investmentsbefore 2015.

4.47     Onbalance, andconsidering the slow progress inimproving quality ineducation
andhealth, the rating is modest for bothseries.

D.        PROMOTINGGOODGOVERNANCE
4.48     Therewere reforms infive areas: (i) management; (ii)
                                                       budget                        fiduciary
framework; (iii)     civil service reform; (iv) deconcentration and decentralization; and (v)
environment.

BudgetManagement

4.49     Reforms called for strengthening budgetformulation and execution.

4.50     Budgetformulation. The objectives were to improvethe content o fthe budget to
reflect the priorities o fthe PRSP interms o f allocations and to strengthen budget
formulation (inter-and intra-sectoral allocations) to enhance the impact o fpublic




'The  ICRreports that it stood at 30.5 percent in2005, which would be a considerable increase intwo
years.
  Annexes F and G, drawn fiom the ICRs, provide more detailed information on outcomes ineducation
andhealth, although achievements by the end o fthe second series remainto be confirmed by the 2008
DHS.
 For water and sanitation, the baseline data for the given indicators were revised in2005 inthe context o f
formulating the action plantowards meetingthe MDGs.
 An increase fiom 54 to 74 percent inthree years seems very high.

expenditures upon growth and establish a closer link between objectives, resource
allocations, and anticipatedresults.

4.5 1   Progress was significant: (i) year, allocations for non-wage recurrent
                                        each
expenditures were increased for the priority sectors and (ii) program budgeting was
strengthened by improving the links betweenthe global MTEF, the program budgets
(PB), and the annual budget, all based on the sectoral priorities o f the PRSP. The MTEF
was adjusted on a three-year rolling basis andthe budgetandPBs were adopted based on
the ceilings set by the rolling MTEF. As a result, a more rigorous process ledto more
realism inrevenue andexpenditure estimates. This effort was supported by the
completion o f several PERs andby improved management o f the PERprocess itself.
GOB decided as early as under PRSC-I to assume sole responsibility for the PER agenda:
activities relatingto PERs, MTEFs and PBs were harmonized and coordinated under the
supervision o f a standing committee. Over the period reviewed, GOB developed
considerably its capacity to strengthen budgetformulation and assumed increased
responsibility for it, an objective o f the PRSC instrument.

4.52    Budget execution. Reforms calledfor: (i)    expanding the integrated financial
management system (IFMS) to track and manage public revenues and expenditures more
efficiently; (ii)budget deconcentration to improve service delivery; and (iii) budget
harmonization with WAEMU guidelines.

4.53    In2001, GOBcompletedaninternalreview ofits budgetaryprocess andissueda
Budget Management Reform Plan(Plan de Renforcement de la Gestion Budge'taire-
PRGB). Since the Bank andthe IMFhad completed a Country FinancialAccountability
Assessment (CFAA) and a Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) at
about the same time, the recommendations o f the latter were incorporated into a single
harmonized document inJuly 2002.

4.54    Several efforts were deployed to expand the IFMS, but delays were frequent
because o fthe need insome cases to collect the relevant data prior to installing hardware
or software or because o f technical difficulties encountered ininformation technology.
Progress was made inintegrating the following: externally financed spending; debt
management; procurement; revenue management system; and linkages with five regional
capitals. Inaddition, the software for an integratedaccounting system for local
communities was installed in 8 regions, providing an adequate fiduciary framework for
public spendingat the local level, includingthe productiono f accounting statements.

4.55    As indicatedunder the educationandhealth sections above, budget
deconcentration took the form of delegatingpayment to some regions, pending the
adoption o f coherent policies on deconcentration and decentralizationand the enactment
o fthe LGC inDecember 2004.

4.56    Inaccordance withWAEMUguidelines, arevisedorganic budgetlaw was
enacted inJanuary 2003, providing for the application o f a new budget classification, a
newchart ofaccounts, and a revised fiscal accountingframework, all to comply with
regional guidelines. The harmonized budget classification was applied starting with the
2004 budget and was incorporatedinto the Computerized ExpenditureNetwork (CID).

                                              30


Inthe samevein, the budgetwas modified to incorporate a system o ffunctional and
social budget classification with a marker for poverty spending to allow the tracking o f
poverty reductionexpenditures.

Fiduciary Framework and Transparency

4.57    Reforms called for upgrading public procurement, strengthening budget reporting
andcontrol, andpromoting stakeholders participation.

4.58    Inprocurement,the program o freforms was comprehensive. Itwas based on the
conclusions o fthe Bank's 1999 CPAR, which hadrecommendedto redress the
weaknesses and gaps inthe legal texts and to strengthen the enforcement procedures.
The legal and institutional fiamework was considerably strengthened: (i)new
                                                                          a
Procurement Code was issued meeting international standards; (ii)   regulations governing
concession and leasing contracts consistent with best internationalpractice were adopted
andissued; (iii)regulatory agency for publicprocurement (Autorite' deRe'gulutiondes
                 a
Murche'sPublics) was created, (iv) the Ministry o f Finance and Budget was reorganized
to include a department incharge o fprocurement (Direction Ge'n6ruledes Murche's
Publics) (the specific measures provided by the last two decrees were to be implemented
inthe course ofthe thirdPRSC series); and (v) conditions for the issuance and
withdrawal o f accreditation for public works were defined.

4.59    Roles andresponsibilities were clarified on the administrative side. Prior to the
reforms, there were two entities responsible for procurement, each with its own
procedures, depending on whether the source o f financing was domestic or foreign, a
system which had led to conflicts inresponsibilities, control, and information. The roles
o fthe two entities were redefined and a capacity buildingplanand a Manual o f
Procedures were prepared to strengthentheir staffs qualifications and skills andassist
them intheir functions.

4.60    Finally, to ensure better enforcement, the program called for annual verification
that 50 percent o fpublic procurement contracts were subject to competitive biddingand
for a public audit o fthe largest contracts. In2003, the EUoffered to finance boththe
verification andthe audit, but there were delays inmeetingannual targets.

4.61    Inbudget reportingand control,significant progress was also achieved. The
PRSCs required that each year budget execution reports be submitted to the supreme
audit institutionwithin 12months o fthe end of the fiscal year. The requirement was
fulfilled each year. Inaddition, inthe course o f 2001-2002, the supreme audit institution
audited the reports covering 1995-98, thereby catching up with the constitutional
requirementto have regular annualaudit. As noted above, an Independent Audit
Institution (Cour des Comptes)had been created inApril 2000; it became fully
operational inDecember 2002. A training program was conducted for the magistrates o f
the Court. The regular production and submission o f budget execution reports to the
oversight authority was a major achievement, given that the constitutional requirement
had not been adhered to for many years.

                                              31


4.62     Internal control was strengthened by increasing the staff o fthe General Finance
Inspectorate (IGF) andthe General State Inspectorate (IGE)andby conducting a capacity
buildingprogram inpublic financial management. Inaddition, a decree was prepared to
strengthen the role IGF and IGEand to harmonize the statutes o f all control services.

4.63     To bringmore clarity inmanaging public property and inanticipation o f
transferring assetsto local governments as part o f the decentralizationprocess, an
accountingsystemo f governmentproperty was prepared. Bythe end o fthe second
series, the physical inventory had been completed in43 o fthe 45 provinces and inthe
commune of Ouagadougou, but several tasks remainedto be performed to finalize the
accounting system.

4.64     StakehoZders'participation. To increase transparency inthe allocation o fpublic
resources managed at the local level, GOB posted budgetary allocations for health
facilities inpublic places inhealth districts.

Civil Service Reform

4.65     The 1998 Law on Public Sector Reform hadintroduceda merit-based personnel
management system, but the system had not been implemented inthe absence ofjob
descriptions. GOB attempted to revive the reforms by issuing instructions to apply the
system starting in2003 andby adoptingtwo decrees inApril 2003 clarifying the scope o f
the mission letters to be issuedto each ministry specifying its objectives andthe rules for
personnel evaluation. Performance-based evaluation became effective at the Treasury
only.

4.66     Two other actions fall underthis heading. The payroll andpersonnel databases at
M O F and at the Ministryo f Civil Service were reconciled, but the maintenance o fthe
system remainedhampered by insufficient financial resources and shortage o f skilled
staff. Inaccordance with a policy o f transferring personnel management to line
ministries, the budgetpayroll management system (SYGASPE) was extended to MEBA
andthe Ministryo f Secondary and Higher Educationenablingtheir humanresources
department to managetheir own personnel, but the system could not be extended to other
ministries because o f a lack o f connection with GOB'Scomputerized integrated
accounting system(CIE).

Decentralization and Deconcentration

4.67     Progresswas slow and fragmentary inimplementing deconcentration and
decentralization to improveservice delivery because the legal framework governing the
decentralization process had beenmodified several times since the enactment o fthe first
laws in 1993. Itwas still evolving in 1998,2001, and2003. Itis not until2002-2004 that
the entire body o f legislation was extensively revised leadingto the enactment ofthe
LGC inDecember 2004, which abolished all previous texts. Inthe meantime, as noted
above, resort was made to delegation o f credits to the regional level andto petty cash
advances (rkgiesd'avance).

4.68    Following the enactment o fthe LGC, the field was clear to start implementingthe
newpolicies. Regional governors were appointed and GOB startedpreparingthe

                                              32


necessary application texts o fthe Code. The latter provides that the following seven
competences be transferred to communes: pre-school education, primary education and
literacy programs, health, culture, youth, sport, and leisure.

4.69    A trigger for PRSC-VI requiredthe finalization o fthe framework for the transfer
o f resources andcompetences. The following laws and decrees were adopted to
implement the LGC: (i)    Law 014-2006 o f May 9,2006, definingthe resources and
expenses o f local governments as well as the local taxes andtax sharing mechanismswith
the Central Government; (ii) 2006-204 o f May 15,2006, governing the financial
                               Decree
and accounting regime o f local governments, including budget and accounting
classification; and (iii)Decree 2006-209 o f May 15,2006, governing the transfer o f the
seven competences listed above and of resources to urbancommunes. Inaddition, a
priority actionplanwas adopted to assist the new regional councils andrural communes.

4.70     A trigger for PRSC-VI1requiredthe effective transfer o f competences and
resources to municipalities and regions. The following actions were taken: (i) 2007the
budget included CFA Francs 6.8 billion for the regions and local governments; (ii)
institutions were established to transfer financial resources to the urbancommunes and an
InvestmentFundfor Local Governments (Fonds Permanentpour le De'veloppementdes
Colllectivite's Territoriales)was created; (iii)the responsibilities transferredto urban
communes were clarified; and (iv) Law 027-2006 o f December 6,2006, created a local
civil service.

Environment

4.71    Reforms called for promoting good environmental practices. All actions focused
on buildingcapacity inthe different ministries responsible for carrying out EAs and
applyingenvironmental guidelines. The followingwas achieved: (i) respective
                                                                         the
responsibilitieso fthe different entities involved inenvironmental impact research were
defined; (ii)three-year planfor buildingcapacity inEA was prepared, but budget
              a
allocations were sometimes insufficient to implement it; (iii)  environmental units were
created inthe ministries responsible for carryingout measures supported by the PRSCs
and a workshop was heldto familiarize their staff withthe principles andmethods o fEAs
andsocial safeguards; (iv) guidelines were prepared for the application of safeguard
policies insix sectors; and (v) the application o f environmental safeguards inIDA and
other donor-financed projects was verified but revealed a mixedrecord. The agenda also
called for the preparation o ftechnical guidelines for sector- or activity-specific EAs, but
this was not completed. Finally, inthe forestry sector, a stock taking ofthe resources was
carried out, followed by the preparation o f a master planand an investment program
permittingtheir sustainable management.

4.72    Assessment. Progress was unevenamong the different reform areas. Progress
was significant inbudget management. Improvement was steady and consistently made
inbudgetformulation withGOBnowconducting key activitiesonaroutinebasis; itwas
less so inbudget execution because o f technical issues to resolve inapplying information
technology andthe consequent need for external expertise. This, however, does not
dilute the progress made instrengthening and expandingthe IFMS. Progress was also
significant inprocurement and inbudget reporting and control. By the endo f the first

                                               33


series, the legal and institutional framework o f public procurement had beencompletely
revamped,budget execution reports were regularlysubmittedto the oversight authority,
andthe "Zois de rdglement" regularly adopted by Parliament. This was a significant
achievement on the part o fthe authorities.

4.73     Incivil service reform, progress was negligible because ofbureaucratic
complexity and resistance from personnel. Indeconcentration and decentralization,
delays were to be expected as it takes time to arrive at the necessary political consensus
on new political and administrative structures for the State. As already noted, the Bank
underestimated the political, legal, and administrative complexity o f formulating and
implementing decentralization. However, there is now inplace a coherent framework
that should greatly facilitate the delivery o f services. It is likely that, inthe absence o f
the support provided by the PRSCs, lessprogress would have beenachieved. Finally, in
environment, the first steps were taken to strengthen capacity to prepare EAs and comply
withguidelines.

4.74     Onbalance, the rating is substantial for both series because ofthe greater weight
o fthe budgetmanagement andfiduciary strengthening agenda, as a result ofwhich GOB
has successfully assumed increased responsibility for managing economic policies and
public resources, an objective o f budget support operations.

5.      Implementation,Outcomeand Ratings

IMPLEMENTATION
5.1     Implementationo fthe programs was adversely affected by external shocks,
notably the Ivoirian crisis. However, their negative impact was less severe than
anticipated: rainfalls were generally adequate, the secondary andtertiary sectors showed
greater resilience than anticipated, andproducers and traders quickly diversified
transportation routes and sources o f supplies for key inputs by revivingtraditional links
with countries other thanCBte d'Ivoire. All these factors easedthe reintegrationo f
refugees from CBte d'Ivoire.

5.2     BothGOB andthe Bank engaged inconstructive dialogues andshowed flexibility
infrne tuningtheprogram, amendingand/or adjustingtriggers, to achieve realistic and
practical objectives. Advances were recordedinareas where activities were well
identified or where reforms had already progressed significantly under the pre-PRSC
operations inthe late 1990s. Progress was less significant or slower inthe areas requiring
betteridentification o fthe issues at handor o fthe obstacles to overcome. Inthose cases,
it requiredpostponingor rewording triggers or redefining expected actions. Insome
cases, this reflectedthe fact that some actions were too demandinggiven GOB'S
capacity; inothers, activities or actions consisting o f laying the groundwork were needed
before full implementation. Inhindsight, this process hadthe advantage o f clarifying and
streamliningthe agenda from one operation to the next. Inthat connection, there is little
doubt that the first operations served as a valuable learningprocess for both GOB andthe
Bank.

5.3     There were inevitably delays. Each year, it took longer thanexpected to
implement the prior actions due to the capacity constraints o f the administration; this
contributed-inaddition to the Bank' slow processing to defeat the objective o f
                                                          -
aligning disbursement with the budget cycle. Another cause o f delay was the need for
donors to coordinate their interventions andthe disbursement o f their budget support. As
already mentioned institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints, especially inline
ministries, were a cause o f delay. Finally, progress inimproving the delivery o f social
services was "hostage" to the deconcentration and decentralizationprocess. The Bank
did not have a clear vision o fthe sequence inthe necessary steps andrequirementsto
implement such complex policies, withthe consequence that reforms inthe social sectors
were negatively affected. There was insufficient prioritization and coordination between
reforms inthe social sectors and reforms indeconcentratiorddecentralization.

5.4     Another finding emerging from implementing these PRSCs i s the difference in
the capacity to leadandimplement reforms betweenthe central andline ministries. GOB
assumed increased responsibility inmanaging the reform agenda inthe areas under the
direct control o fthe central ministries, notably MOF, where progress was generally made
ina consistent andsteady manner (although at times at a pace slower thanexpected). In
contrast, inthe areas o fpro-poor policies, where line ministries and local governments
play a much greater role, progress was uneven and was hampered by institutional
weaknesses and capacity constraints at both the central and local levels. Inthose areas,

                                                  36


progress was less uniform, more dependent on contingent factors, andthe implementation
calendar often became stretched.

OUTCOME'
5.5       Overall, progress was uneven. Macro-economic stability was maintained and
performance was consistently satisfactory under the IMF's Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) despite adverse exogenous factors.

5.6       The other specific objectives were partially met. Except for the cotton sector,
achievement under the objective o f accelerating broad-based growth and employment
was modest and serious challenges remain. Growthwas certainly not broad-based and
there i s no evidence of impact on employment, althoughthere is a presumption that
increased activity inthe cotton andother agricultural sectors ledto some absorption o f
labor. Excluding the privatization ofthe telecom company, progress was disappointing in
the other PSD areas where reforms would have the greatest impact interms o f reducing
factor costs, attracting investment, and improving competitiveness. Political andvested
interests proved to be significant obstacles.

5.7       Achievements under the objective o f ensuring access to basic social services were
largely limited to improving access, which certainly increased, butthere is no or little
evidence o f improvement inquality, as repeatedly stated by Bank documents. Key
conditions to remedy this situation are to raise the number o fteaching hours, enforce
teachers' attendance, andprovide incentives and motivation to education andhealth
personnel to move to rural areas. No progress was made inthat respect. As a result, the
MDGtargets ineducation andhealthare unlikely to be met.

5.8       Itis inthe area o fgoodgovernance where progress was most significant,
especially inthe areas o f budgetmanagement and improvement inthe fiduciary
framework, with the result o fmore discipline, transparency, and accountability in
managing public finances. Although delayed for a host of reasons, a coherent framework
for decentralization and deconcentration was adopted and institutions and structures are
now beingcreated and put inplace. This should permit more rapid progress indelivering
basic services inthe rural areas, although this will take considerable time. Incontrast to
the other governance areas, reforms o fthe civil service were negligible with no impact.

5.9       Overall assessment. The rating is based on the achievement o fthe different
objectives, takinginto account their relevance and that o f the operations' design. On
balance, outcome i s ratedModerately Satisfactory.

RISKTO DEVELOPMENT           OUTCOME
5.10      Burkina Faso will certainly continue to face very serious risks, not least the
possibility o fpolitical instability and external shocks. However, the country' strong
ownership o f the program and commitment to reforms considerably reduce the risks o f
reversal or change indirection. `Somekey factors mitigate those risks: the increased



 Outcome is assessedon the basis of relevance of objectives and design and achievement of objectives
(efficacy).

                                               37


responsibility assumed by Burkina's leaders for managing the economy andthe
institutional development that accompanied some reforms, such as inthe cotton sector,
budgetmanagement, fiduciary framework, anddecentralization. Inthat respect, the
predictability o f budget support i s a strong encouragement to deepen andbroadenthe
reform agenda. The benefits interms o freduction inpoverty and institutional
development are likely to be maintained, provided macro-economic stability is assured
andthe donor community continues to support the reform efforts.

5.1 1 However, there is no room for complacency on the part o f the authorities. Burkina
Faso faces two major challenges to further reduce poverty: one is to overcome the
institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints that retard and limit the benefits from
the reforms; the other is to raise the revenue/GDP ratio, including by developing new
sources o f growth andraising productivity, to be able to finance the poverty reduction
programs andreduce dependence on foreign assistance.

5.12     The risk to development outcome is ratedModerate.

BANKPERFORMANCE
5.13    Bankperformance in ensuringquality at entry. Both series were largely prepared
inconjunctionwiththe country's PRSPsandthe Bank's CAS. Inbothcases, the
medium-term program and individual operations were closely aligned with the PRSP and
the CAS. On most key dimensions, strategic relevance, macro and social aspects, policy
and fiduciary aspects, issues were well identified andreforms well defined. The
programs incorporatedthe lessons learnedfrom the 1990 adjustment operations, built on
a substantial body o f analytical work, andmade the necessary corrections and
adjustments as progress was beingmade along the six operations. This is best illustrated
by a broader agenda, stronger coordination among donors, anda muchimproved M&E
systeminthe second series.

5.14     However, as noted under relevance o f objectives and design (Chapter 3), there
were shortcomings inimplementationarrangements. Institutional weaknesses and
capacity constraints, especially inline ministries, were underestimated with inevitable
delays as a result. Some sub-components were not ready for implementation and
required a better definition ofthe tasks to undertake or a more precise implementation
schedule. A significant shortcoming was to attempt to improve service delivery inrural
areas without a clear vision o fhow the still evolving policies indeconcentrationand
decentralization would support - or allow - such an objective. Implementation suffered
as a result. As mentioned inChapter 3, a TA operation prior to or inparallel with the
series would have considerably reduced the negative impact o fthese shortcomings. The
absence o f an M&E system for the first series was also a shortcoming, although IEG
recognizes that this was not a requirement at the time. Onbalance, the rating i s
Moderately Satisfactory.

5.15    Bankperformance during supervision. Duringproject execution, the Bankteam
showed diligence and flexibility inits dialogue with the authorities. Realism was injected
inadjustingthe triggers andthe measuresmonitoredby benchmarks. Innovations were
proposed to circumvent obstacles, such as for budget deconcentration. There was close
coordination with the IMF and, duringthe second series, the Bank was constructive in

                                             38


harmonizing its positions with that o f donors regarding the M&E system and
disbursement. Bankperformance for supervision is rated Satisfactory.

5.16    Overall Bankperformance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

BORROWER      PERFORMANCE
5.17    GOB'Sownership o fthe programs and commitment to reforms is commendable.
Inparticular,itshowed determination inmaintainingmacro-economic stability andsound
fiscal policies inthe face of adverse exogenous sectors. This was a significant
achievement inthe circumstances. GOB cooperated with the Bank anddonors inrevising
the PRSP and inharmonizing the reform programs, the conditions for disbursement, and
the results framework, with significant added value as a result. Inthat connection, the
learning process associated with the first series had a beneficial impact on the second
series. Finally, GOB demonstrated its willingness and ability to master the discipline o f
meeting legal requirements on a regular basis, an important objective o fthe PRSC
instrument.

5.18    Borrower performance is rated Satisfactory.

MONITORINGEVALUATION
                AND

For thefirst series.

5.19    M&E design, implementation, and utilization. As noted inChapter 3, neither the
PDsnor the ICRdescribed or explained how appropriate data (input, output, outcome,
andimpact) were to be collected giventhe project objectives andgiventhe data already
available. Similarly, there is no information on the extent to which appropriate data were
actually collected or used to inform decision-making.

5.20    M&Equality is ratedNon-Evaluable for the series. IEGnotes that, at the time
the programwas formulated, Bankpolicies didnot require operations to have a
systematic formulation o f an M&E system.

For the second series.

5.21    M&E design, implementation, and utilization. The design o fthe M&E system
was satisfactory and was a major improvementover the first series. However, neither the
PDsnor the ICRprovide information on the extent to which appropriate data were
actually collected or used to informdecision-making and resource allocations.

5.22    Onthe basis o f a satisfactory designbut inthe absence o f information on
implementation and utilization, M&Equality is ratedModest.

COMPARISONWITHICRSANDICRREVIEWSRATINGS
5.23    The above ratings apply to both series (considered as a single one) andto all

6.        Main Findings

6.1       Millennium Development Goals. The poverty incidence o f 45.3 percent, recorded
by the 1998 survey (see Chapter 2), was readjusted to 54.6 percent bythe poverty
assessment conducted jointly by GOB andthe Bank in2003. The ratio was revised by
applying the same methodology to the 1998 and the 2003 data. In2003, it stood at 46.4
percent, a decline o f 8.2 percentage points, and, in2006, at an estimated 40.8 percent2.
This represents anaverage reductiono fabout 1.7 points over eight years (1998-2006).
However, over the second series, the average yearly reduction was 1.9 points, just below
the target o f 2.0 points p.a. under the medium-term program. These results are below but
consistent with the per capita growth o f about 3 percent over 2001-2006. The probability
o f achieving the goal o fhalving poverty incidence between 1990 and2015 is hardto
predict, but, assuming a continued decline o f 1.9 percent per year, the incidence would
reach about 30 percent by 2015.

6.2       The extent to which the decline inpoverty over the period reviewed here can be
attributed to the PRSCs is difficult to assess for two reasons: (i)                       inadditionto the Bank,
there was substantial budget support from the donor community insupport o fthe same
programs and same objectives; insuch a case, the impact o f-andthejudgment on                              - the
PRSCs cannot be dissociated fi-om that o f other interventions; and (ii)                      the significant
growth performance o f 6.1 percent p.a. over 2001-2006 was largely due to the good
performance o f the cotton sector, which cannot be assumed to continue at the same pace
over many years.

6.3       Ineducationandinhealth, asnotedinchapter 4, the MDGgoals areunlikely to
be reached assuming the present trends to continue, except for the vaccination coverage.
A betterjudgment will bepossible once the results o fthe 2008 DHS become available.
Clearly, GOB and the donor community must allocate more resources, time, and energy
on improvingquality: better statistical bases should be elaborated; teaching hours must be
increased and attendance enforced; readingand comprehensiontests should be conducted
systematically upon completing primary school; and incentive packages should be
devised to motivate education and heathpersonnelto move to rural areas.

6.4       Resource Mobilization. The PRSCs did not leadto improved resource
mobilization. Throughout the period, the tax revenue to GDPratio fluctuated between 10
and 12percent, well belowthe average for Sub-Sahara Africa. Although it couldbe
arguedthat this was not part o fthe objectives, it could as well be arguedthat a good
growthperformanceand an improvedmanagement o fpublic resources would have a
positive impact on revenues. Inaddition to improving tax administration, the main
challenge faced by the country is to identify new sources o f growth, the two key
conditions to raise revenues, andtherefore sustain poverty reduction efforts. It is a
challenge for boththe country and the donor community. Failure to make progress in this
area over the coming years will keepthe country dependent on foreign assistance for
manyyears, ifnot decades. Based onpresent trends, this is the most likely scenario.



 Subject to the final results of the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey to be issued in 2009.

                                                41


There is also a risk associated to continuing providing generous external assistance, Le.,
generating complacency. The Bank and other donors may consider reducing gradually
their budget support as an incentiveto reachhigherlevels o fefficiency ando f
competitiveness.

6.5     Statistical Basis. This PPARhas highlightedthe importance o f establishing a
solid statistical basis as a necessary tool to implement andmanage poverty reduction
programs. Inaddition to expanding the range o f data, a key condition is to retain quality
statisticians through adequate incentives. More resources and efforts from the authorities
and the donor community are requiredinthat area.

7.       Lessons

LESSONSBURKINAFASO
           FOR
7.1      With a large number o fdonors providing support to the country's poverty
reduction strategy, it is difficult to assess the contribution o f the PRSCs to the reduction
inpoverty over the six-year period. Thepresumptionis that their contributionwas
significant by providing a strong framework to improve efficiency in spending.
However, the good performance o fthe cotton sector and its direct impact on growth over
the period is not necessarily a sign o f a sustainable growth rate sufficient to reduce
poverty significantly over the medium-to long-term.

7.2      The two PRSC series didnot have an impact on improved resource mobilization.
The fiscal revenues/GDP ratio remained inthe 10-12percent range, a level insufficient to
sustain a policy o f poverty reduction inthe absence o f continued external assistance.
This i s the main finding o fthis report andthe main challenge faced by the country. In
turn, improvingrevenuemobilization depends ondevelopingnew sources ofgrowth and
strengthening tax administration.

7.3      Ineducation, akeyconditionto reduce poverty, anincrease inenrollment is nota
guarantee o f improved literacy. Despite considerable support to education, results in
terms o f literacy remain disappointing. Much greater effort shouldbe expended on
quality o f education. Readingtests should be conductedregularly to assess mastery o f
language at the end o fprimary school. This is essential to assess the efficacy and
efficiency o fthe education system and educationprograms and take remedial action.

7.4      Efforts are needed to strengthen capacity, especially inline ministries, and in
INDS.

7.5      Thanks to the PRSCs and other budget support from donors, GOB strengthened
its capacity to manage public resources inaccordance with its development and social
priorities.

LESSONSGENERAL
           OF             APPLICABILITY.
7.6      By supportingthe budget, the PRSC is a useful instrumentto help the borrower
assume increased responsibility inmanagingits public resources inan efficient manner,
notably by providing more flexibility and predictability.

7.7     Assessment o fperformance under PRSCs shouldbe done after a long enough
periodto allow reforms to produce identifiable outcomes andresults. Evena period o f
six years, as inthis report, istoo short to come to firm conclusions insome areas, such as
inagricultural diversification or impact onprivate investment.

7.8      Because reforms are of a medium-to long-term nature, early identification o f
institutional weaknesses and capacity constraints i s o fparamount importance.
Accordingly, remedial actions should bepart o fthe designo fthe programto ensure
readiness o f implementation. A capacity buildingoperation (or other type o f assistance)

                                              44


prior to or inparallel with a PRSC series should be carefully considered as early as
possible.

7.9     Inthe same vein, realism should guide the plannedtimetable o fsome reforms: for
instance, Bank experience shows that privatization of public enterprises takes a
considerable time giventhe complex issues arising inthe process - not least the legal
ones.

7.10    Since PRSCs usually target the social sectors, implementation requirements
expected from the line ministries concerned should be carefully identified, defined, and
planned given the fact that these ministries usually have weaker structures than central
ministries, such as the Ministry o f Finance.

7.11 Decentralization anddeconcentration are often used indiscriminately inBank
documents, while their meaningi s very different. This gives rise to confusion andthe
choice o fwords i s often misleading. For instance, measures consisting o f delegating
more authority at deconcentrated levels are sometimes presented as progress in
decentralization, while infact it does not lead to more empowerment at the local level.
Deconcentrationand decentralizationare complex matters raising manypolitical, legal
and institutional issues whichthe Regions are often not equipped to tackle. The country
lawyer (or a specialized lawyer) should be an active member o f the team duringproject
preparationand execution. Improved service delivery at the local level i s dependent on
establishingJirst workable structures at that level.

7.12    Assessment o f outcomes from PRSCs raises issues o f attribution when several
donors provide budget support for the same purposes or when other types o f operations
pursue similar objectives as the PRSCs. Inthe case o fthe six PRSCs reviewed inthis
report, there are outcomes not amenable to attribution.

LESSONS   ONPRSCCONTENT AND PROCESSING.
7.13    Inorder to assess outcome ofa medium-term program, itis essential that the
different documents o f a PRSC series be consistent incontent and format. Inparticular,
each program document should have a specific chapter discussing, ina comprehensive
andsystematic manner, what was envisaged to be done under the previous operation,
what was done, what was not done and why, including the deviations from and
corrections to the reform path: this i s essential to understanding the links betweeninputs,
outputs, and expected and actual outcomes, as well as to assessing progress towards
achieving the stated objectives. A few words ina policy matrix are not enough to shed
light on what are often complex issues. Similarlyfor statistical data: consistency over
several years i s essential. This argues for such a chapter to have the same format
throughout the series and for more continuity inresponsibility andmanagement o f the
series, more rigor inpresentation, andmore quality assurance.

7.14    Sector task managers and sector teams must be closely associated to the
formulation and implementation o f the medium-term program. To the extent possible,
they should be part o f all missions.

achievement o f PRSC objectives under the first series. They support the discussionand
ratings inthe body of the PPAR.

PRSC-I

Maintaining macro-economicstability.

        Macro-economic stability was maintained in2001. Due to external shocks
encountered in2000 (increase inoil prices; appreciation o fthe US dollar; and deterioration
ofthe political situation inCBte d'Ivoire), economic activity slowed duringthe first three
quarters o f 2001 butpicked up duringthe last quarter as a result o f very good cotton and
cereal harvests (2001-02). Real GDProse by 6.6 percent. Although inflation reached 4.9
percent due to the poor 2000-01 cereals harvest, macro-economic stability was maintained.
Except for tax revenue, all targets were met under the PRGF. Due to the slowdown in
activity for most ofthe year, tax revenue was lower than expected butthe shortfall was more
thancompensated by cuts inexpenditure andthe slow start inthe spending ofHIPC
resources. The latter was due to: (i)late contributions from some donors; (ii) approval of
                                                                               late
the sectoral allocations by the National Assembly; and (iii) need to establish proper
                                                             the
spending procedures at the local level inorder to track HIPC expenditures.

Strengtheningprogram budgeting.

        The immediate objectives were:

        I n budgetformulation: (i) adopt a budget bill for 2002 based on ceilings set with
reference to the 2002-04 MTEF and PRSP priorities; (ii)    complete program budgets (PB)
consistent with PRSP objectives inkey ministries (including Economy and Finance,
Infrastructure, Secondary and Tertiary Education), performance indicators included; (iii)
complete PERs (Economic Infrastructure and Rural Development); (iv) hold workshop to
define future agenda on PER, MTEF, andPBs.

        Implementation and outputs

        Inbudgetformulation, some triggers for PRSC-I1were fulfilledwhile others were
partially fulfilled or modified: (i) 2002 budget was adopted based on ceilings set by the
                                  the
2002-04 MTEF, includingincreased budgetaryallocations to the social sectors; (ii)     PBs

consistent with the PRSP were completed for all ministriesagainst a target o f six; and (iii)
PERs were completed for Rural Development' and Transport Infrastructure but those for the
Ministry o f Justice and the Ministry of Secondary and Tertiary Educationexperienced delays
due to slow disbursement o f funds from identified donors; inview o fthis, the Bank and GOB
agreed inMarch2002 to change the trigger relating to these two PERs into a benchmark
consisting o f holding a workshop to analyze the strengths and weaknesses o fthe PER, MTEF
andPBprocesses anddefine anagenda for future actioninthese three areas2.

          Theimmediate objectives were:

          In education:(i)   implement the Education Policy Statement and Government Action
Planinbasic education; (ii)      implement a mechanism for subsidizing school supplies inthe 20
provinces with the lowest schooling levels; (iii)       increase access to education inthe 20
provinces by expanding the number o f schools -equipped with runningwater and separate
latrines for girls -inthe 20 rural provinces with the lowest coverage, by ensuring that
schools utilize multigrade teaching where populationdensity is too low to provide for six
separate grades, andby expandingdouble shift teachinginurbanareas where there is excess
demand; and (iv) lowering the cost o f education to poor families by continuing to provide
books free o f charge, ensuring sufficient resources to rural schools to cover basic materials
andoperatingcosts.

          In health,there were three sub-areas, where reforms were called for:

          Improvementin health services:(i)       introduce policy and institutional measures
extending the number o fpreventive services at the primary health care level free o f charge;
(ii) implement a planto staff CSPS with a minimumpersonnel inaccordance with n o m s
established by M O H and reiterated inthe PRSP; and (iii)           continue efforts to boost
immunization coverage rates with a particular focus on targeting rural areas inaccordance
with PRSPtargets;

          Increase in heaZth$nancing: (iv) introduce appropriate measures to reduce the profit
marginon essential drugs soldby CAMEG, with a view to reducingthe cost ofdrugs to
users; (v) maintain incidence o f CAMEG's inventory shortfalls for 45 generic drugs at a level
below 8 percent; (vi) provide financial resources inthe 2002 budgetto replace IDA funds
which were financing health districts andregional health directorates under the Healthand

  There is no explanation inthe PDs o feither PRSC-I or PRSC-I1why a PER for Rural Development was a
trigger for PRSC-I1when it had already beena prior action takenbefore approval ofPRSC-I (cfr. D C A for
'PRSC-I,conclusions
          Schedule 2).
  The              andrecommendations o fthe workshop were to be consolidated into an action plan on the
basis of which outcome-oriented policy actions were to be selected for PRSC-111.

         Participation in local eo-managementand activities: (viii) review issues related to
COGES including quality o f relations with communities andhealth sector actors and the
adequacy o f financial management arrangements.

         In rural development: (i) upthe cotton sector to several operators; (ii)
                                    open                                                end
SOFITEX monopoly on cotton marketing; (iii)         open up two new cotton producing zones to
new private investment inginning; (iv) establish a calendar o f actions needed over the next
 18 months to prepare the sector for new investors innew zones; (v) liberalize cotton seed
marketing;(vi) restructure, by end2001,rural development operations under implementation
inorder to harmonizetheir objectives, implementationstrategies, content, andmanagement
procedures and monitoring and evaluation with those definedinthe LPDRD andPRSP; (vii)

livestock (cotton, h i t s andvegetables, livestocklmeat, cowpea, oilseeds), and (viii) finalize
TORSfor institutionalaudits o fthe Ministries o fAgriculture ando fLivestock.

        In environment: (i) a three-year capacity buildingplanfor EA; (ii)
                             prepare                                                   establish
small EA focal points inthe key ministries involved inpolicy reforms listed as prior actions
for PRSC-11; and (iii)  clarify the mandates and responsibilities o f CONAGESE and DGPE in
those areaspertainingto EA compliance and enforcement.

        Implementation and outputs.

        Basic education. There was one trigger to move to PRSC-11, Le., the need to define
the following: (i) scope o f decentralizationinthe sector and the role andresponsibilities
                   the
at each level o fthe system; (ii) the institutional changes needed andthe volume o f activities
to be carried out withinthe ten-year educationplan; and (iii)   the reorganization o f the units
and services ofthe Ministry o f Basic Education. The trigger was fulfilled by the adoptiono f
a decree defining the above.

        Underbenchmarks, PRSC-I requiredthat progress be made inimplementingGOB'S
EducationalPolicy Statement and GOB'SAction Plan inbasic education, two sectoral
documents whose adoption had beenformalized by decrees inthe course o f 2001 as prior
action for PRSC-I. These provided inter alia for: (i)   abolishing the link between admission
to teacher training college and civil service employment (effective September 2001); (ii)
reducing the length o ftraining o fteachers to one year and specifying that the recruitment o f
newly trained teachers would be at decentralized levels by community or private schools; and
(iii)introducing automatic promotion between grades 1and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6, limited
repetitionto 10percent for grades 2,4, and 6; and increased learning hours from 660 hours to
800 hours p.a. Some ofthese measures became effective but others were not; for instance,
the effective increase inteaching hours to improve the quality o f education hasprovedto be
elusive upto the end o fthe second programmatic series.

        There were three benchmarks to monitor progress inaccess to education inthe 20
rural provinces with the lowest coverage: (i)  the subsidizationo f school supplies was
achieved; (ii) the expansioninthe number o f schools equipped with runningwater and
separate latrines for girls (by adopting multigrade and double shift teaching where feasible)
was slower thanexpected becauseo f delays inmobilizingthe HIPC resources for 2001; and
(iii) reductioninthecostofeducationtopoorfamilieswasassuredbythecontinued
    the
distribution o fbooks free o f charge andthe provision o f sufficient resources to cover basic
materials andoperating costs.

        Health. There were three sub-areas where reforms were called for:

        Improvement in health services (availability, accessibility, and quality of health
care).   The trigger for PRSC I1was fulfilled: the number o fpreventive services at the
primaryhealthcare levelprovided free of charge was further extended; the planto staff
Community Health Centers with the minimumpersonnel provided by M O H continued to be
implemented (the target o f 65 percent by the end o f 2001 was exceeded); andthe vaccination
coverage, particularly inrural areas, was increased inaccordance withPRSP targets.

        Increase in healthjkancing. The trigger for PRSC-I1was fulfilled: (i) profit
                                                                                  the
margins on essential generic drugs sold by the National DrugProcurement andDistribution
Company (CAMEG) andprivate wholesalers was reduced to maximum 25 percent; (ii)
CAMEG's inventory shortfall for 45 generic drugs was maintained at less than2 percent,
against a target o f less than 8 percent; (iii)
                                             GOBprovided the resources inthe 2002 budgetto
replace the IDA funds which financed the health districts andregional health directorates
under the HealthandNutritionProject, which closed in September 2001; this ensured
continuity inquarterly disbursement to "top off' financing from other sources; and (iv) a
beneficiary assessment was completedto ascertain the views and perceptions o fthe
population regarding the quality and access to health care services, includingfinancial, socio-
cultural, and geographic barriers.

        Participation in local co-managementand activities. A review ofthe activities o fthe
Local Management Committees was carried out covering issues such as the quality o f
relations with the communities andhealth agents, and the adequacy o f financial management
arrangements.

        Rural development. For the cotton sector, there was one trigger for PRSC-I1
requiringthe opening up o fthe cotton sector to several operators, implyingthe abolition of
the monopoly o f SOFITEX. The trigger was fulfilled by the adoption inDecember 2001 o f
two decrees, one abolishing SOFITEX monopoly incotton marketing, the other opening two
o fthe three producing zones to private sector investment inginningactivities. Inaddition, a
calendar o f actions needed over a period of 18 monthsto prepare the sector for new investors
inthe two zoneswas prepared. The trigger requiringthe liberalization ofcotton seed
marketingwas also fulfilled, except that the modalitiespertainingto auction salesremained
to be studied.

        The trigger requiringthe restructuring o f IDA-financed rural development operations
inorder to harmonizetheir objectives, implementationstrategies, content, management
procedures, and M&Ewiththose definedinGOB'S strategy for the rural sector andthe PRSP
was also fulfilled. Finally, the trigger providing for the development o f action plans in
productionstreams other thancotton and priority programs inagriculture and livestock was
partially fulfilled: a diagnostic study on cowpea was completed, but for h i t s andvegetables,
livestock andmeat, and oilseed, terms o freference were either ready or underway by the
time PRSC-I1was approved. Underactions monitoredbybenchmarks, healthguidelines for
livestock were enforced, but the institutional audits o fthe ministries active inthe rural sector
were not completed; instead, only terms o freference for the Ministries o f Agriculture and o f
Livestock were finalized.

        Environment:the rural development component o fPRSC-I included environmental
actions to be completed before PRSC-11, although they were not triggers. Progress was made
as follows: (i) respective responsibilities o fthe different entities involved in
                 the
environmental impact research were defined; (ii)three-year planfor buildingcapacity in
                                                      a
environmental assessment was prepared; and (iii)      environmental focal points inthe ministries
responsible for canying out measures supported by the PRSCs were created.

Strengtheningthe fiduciary framework.

         Theimmediate objectiveswere:

        Inprocurement: (i)    approve the new regulatory decree for public procurement; (ii)
redefine the role o fthe two major departments DGCOOP andDCMP, limitingDGCOOP's
role to lending and disbursement procedures; (iii)    present TORs and launchthe expression o f
interest for the selection o f a consultant for the elaboration o f a new Procurement Manual;
(iv) present a Capacity BuildingPlan(objectives, activities, calendar, budget) for
strengthening the DCMP andDGCOOP, inthe light oftheir newroles; and (v) elaborate
TORs and launchthe expression o f interest for the selection o f a consultadindependent
auditor to verify that at least 50 percent o f public procurement for FYOl is subject to
competitive procedures.

        In budget reporting: (i) budget execution reports for FY99 and FYOO andtheir
                                  submit

operationalizing the Supreme Audit Institution (Cour des Comptes);(iii)       appoint 3
magistrates to the Cow, including the president; and (iv) finalize the CFAA study and
present an action planharmonizing the CFAA, PRGBand ROSC;

        In stakeholders'participation: adopt transparent mechanisms for the allocation o f
resources managed at the district level (e.g., posting budgets allotted to each health facility in
publicplaces inthe districts).

strengthen the analytical capacity to analyze the impact on poverty o f different policy
reforms; and (iii)    elaborate a set o fpreliminary estimates, linkingthe growth andpoverty
frameworks.

          Implementation and outputs

          Procurement. Inthe all important area o f public procurement, little progress was
achieved under PRSC-I ifjudged against the triggers andbenchmarks. Agreed actions to be
implementedhadbeenbased onthe conclusions o fthe Bank's 1999 CPAR, whichhad
recommended to redress the weaknesses and gaps inthe legal and institutional framework
andto strengthen the enforcement procedures. The trigger for PRSC-I1built onthese and
called for implementinga comprehensive procurementprogram covering five major
activities: (i)  adoption o f a procedure manual; (ii)    redefinition o fthe roles ofthe two entities
charged with public procurement and adoption o f capacity buildingmeasures; (iii)                 revision o f
the general procurement rulesto make them consistent withbest internationalpractice; (iv)
facilitation o faccess by Small andMedium Enterprises (SME) to public procurement; and
(v) verification that 50 percent o fpublic procurementare subject to competitive biddingas
providedby law and that the largest contracts are subject to public audit.

          InDecember 2001,the BankandGOBdiscussedthe 1999CPAR andarrived at the
conclusion that there was a lack o f capacity to implement most o f the actions planned and
that TA was needed. Accordingly, a less ambitious and more realistic program and timetable
were agreed3.While the original planabove called for effective adoption and implementation
o fthe actions described above, the new agreement was substantially less constraining.
Action (iii)   above was fulfilled by the adoption inMarch2002 o f a decree addressing some
weaknesses of the procurement code4. The other actions were toned down or delayed.
Actions (i), and
               (ii), (v)werekeptastriggersforPRSC-I1butwerelimitedtothesubmission
o f TORSfor consultants to prepare the procedure manual andconduct the audit andto the
presentation o f a capacity buildingplanto strengthen the two entities responsible for public
procurement. The adoption o f the manual, the implementation o f the capacity buildingplan,
andthe completion o fthe audit report were changedto triggers for PRSC-111'. There is no
information inBank documents on action (iv).




3It is not clear why there was a lapseoftwo years betweenthe completion ofthe 1999 CPAR andthe
Bank/Borrower discussions ofDecember2001, since the review ofthe CPAR and an agreementon activities
andtimetable would be expectedto havetakenplace duringproject preparation. Neitherthe PD for PRSC-I1
nor the ICRprovide any clarification onthis question.
4However, the new decree didnot fully meet international standards and was subject to further discussions
betweenthe Bankand GOB.
 Although the PD for PRSC-I1discussesthe issues surroundingthe changes inthe trigger, it states that ". ...All
prior actions for PRSC-I1have beensatisfied, althoughthe current program i s somewhatless ambitious than
that originally envisaged". ProgramDocument for PRSC-11, ReportNo. 24310-BUR, June 20,2002, p.27,

        Budget reporting. The trigger for PRSC-I1requiring MOF to submit the budget
execution reports for 1999and 2000 to the SupremeAudit Institution(Chambre des
Comptes)was fulfilled, but the one requiring the implementation of an action planfor the
operationalization of the Cour des Comptes (formally created inApril 2000) was missed.
Practical difficulties andprolonged negotiations on the requiredfunding for the Cour des
Comptes'headquartersand staffing made it impossible to satisfy the trigger. The effective
operationalization ofthe Cour was thus moved as a condition for PRSC-111. However, to
satisfy the trigger, it was modifiedto cover the submission of an action planfor the
operationalization ofthe Cour by December 2002 andthe appointment inJune 2002 of three
magistrates includingthe Presidentofthe Cow6.

        Onthe other hand, progresswas made inexternal budget oversight intwo important
respects: (i) inthe courseof2001-02, the SupremeAudit Institution(Chambre des Comptes)
audited the budget execution reports covering 1995-98, thereby catching up with the
requirementto haveregular annualaudits; and (ii)           following the completion in2001 of
GOB'S own internal review ofpublic financial management (the Budget Management
ReformPlan-PRGB), o fthe CFAA, ando fthe IMF's Report on Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC), there was aneed to harmonize the conclusions andrecommendations of
the three documents. InJuly 2002, the Government adoptedan ambitious reformprogram
for budget management building onthe recommendations o fthe three documents.

        Stakeholders'participation. The trigger for PRSC-I1requiring increased
transparency inthe allocation ofpublicresources managedat the local level was satisfied by
posting budgetary allocations for health facilities inpublic places inhealth districts.

Tracking and managingpublic expenditure.

        The immediate objectives were:

        In budget execution, monitoringand deconcentration: (i)          extend integratedfinancial
management system (IFMS) by adding the module for external financing management
(DGCOOP); (ii)    createpetty cashaccounts (rkgies d'avance) at the level o f Regional Health
Directorates and HealthDistricts; (iii)    organizethe regionalization of payment order issuance
through the creation o f a legal framework for the appointment of "delegated payers" and
"secondary payers" within ministriesto empower regional government entities; and (iv)

Pendingtheir issuance, GOB decidedto test the new system o fdelegating such authority at
the regional levelby creatingapilot experiment inthe secondcity ofthe country, Bobo

petty cash advances (rkgiesd'avance) inhealthdistricts to speedupbudget management at
the regional level.

Maintainingmacro-economicstability.

        Macro-economic stability was maintained in2002. Performance under the PRGF was
generally satisfactory; the arrangement expired inDecember 2002 and a new one was
approved inJune 2003. Real GDP growth declined to 4.7 percent in2002, reflectingthe
difficult external environment and a lower growth incereal production. Inflationrose to 3.9
percent by year-end due to the disruption intrade andtransport consequent to the Ivorian
crisis. The fiscal deficit was contained below the PRGFtarget despite weak tax revenues due
to the disruption intrade and unforeseen current expenditure linkedto the risingoil prices,
the May elections, andthe Ivorian crisis. However, the increase incurrent expenditure was
more than compensated by reduced domestically-financed capital expenditure reflecting
mainly weak administrative capacity, including inthe social sectors. Cash shortages, delays
inallocatingHIPCresources, andweak absorptive capacity limitedthe catching-up ofHIPC
spending: although the pace o f spending increased in2002, it was insufficient to absorb the
2000-01 residual and the resources released in2002.

        The immediate objectives were:

        I n budgetformulation: (i) adopt, by May 1,2002, the MTEFfor 2003-05 that i s
keepingwith the revisedandupdated PRSP, andadopt in2002 the 2003-05 PBs consistent
withthe MTEFandPRSP; (ii)        incorporate into the 2003 budget the recommendations o f the
PERs; and (iii)  implement the actionplanto improve the PER, MTEF, and PB processes.

        Implementation and outputs

        Budgetformulation. The trigger for PRSC-I11 was fulfilled: the MTEF for 2003-05
was prepared reflecting the priorities ofthe revised andupdated PRSP, andthe 2003 PBs
were consistent with the MTEFand the PRSP. The 2003 budget includedincreased
allocations for the social sectors and reflected the recommendations ofthe PERs for
education, health and infrastructure. GOB also preparedthe actionplanaimed at
harmonizing and coordinatingactivities relating to PERs, MTEFs and PBs and created a
standingcommitteeto planthe PER program and supervise its execution; accordingly, the
PERs for the Ministryo f Secondary andHigher Education andthe Ministryo f Justice were
scheduled for 2003. Approved inDecember 2002, the 2003 budgetwas amended by a
supplementary budget inMay 2003 to respond to the changed macro-economic situation
resultingfrom the crisis inCBte d'Ivoire.

plans and improve market access for a variety o f commodities (e.g., cereals, fruits and
vegetables, sesame); and (iv) complete the institutional reform analyses ofkey rural
development ministries (Agriculture, Animal Resources and Water & Environment) and
implement recommendations.

        In environment: (i) a workshop to share and disseminate the content o fnational
                              hold
EAprocedures andWorld Bankenvironmental and social safeguards to facilitate ministries'
compliance; and (ii) prepare technical guidelines for sector- or activity- specific EAs.

        Implementationand outputs

        Education. There was one trigger for PRSC-111, i.e., the requirement that sufficient
resources be allocated to the Ministryo f Basic Educationto implementthe ten-year
education plan. The trigger was fulfilled: the share o fprimary education intotal education
expenditure was maintainedat 60 percent inthe medium-term,while the share o f education
intotal government expenditure was raised from21.6percent in2002 to 23 percentinthe
2003 budget. Improved access to education inthe 20 rural provinces with the lowest school
coverage was maintained by the continued applicationo fthe special mechanisms adopted
underPRSC-I. GOB started preparing a medium-termbudgetand expenditureprogram
includingdomestic andexternal funding consistent withthe ten-year planinthe perspective
o fproducinga full sectoral MTEF.

         Health. There were three sub-areas:

         Improvement in health services (availability, accessibility, and quality of health
care). There was a trigger for PRSC-I11requiringto put inplace incentives to entice health
personnel, inparticular surgical staff, nurses, and midwives, to work inrural areas,
particularly inpoor and inaccessible areas, andto ensure a highlevel of coverage for key
services for women andchildren (the incentive system was to be based on different
experiments carried out and on studies). The trigger was not fulfilled: two studies, one by
WHO, were completedinMay 2003, but GOB wishedto consult withdonors and civil
service unions before implementing their recommendations. Other actions taken inthis sub-
area were: (i)  administrative instructions for deconcentration and decentralizationo fhealth
personnel were issued, butthe recruitment plans remained to be developed; and (ii)     further
efforts were made to raise the DPTC3 vaccination rate inrural zones to 70 percent by mid-
2003.

         Increase in healthfinancing. The trigger for PRSC-I11requiring the adoption and
publication o f a nationally applicable list o fprices for generic drugs and medical services
was fulfilled; the measure, applicable on March 1,2003, covered subsidized prices for 3
pediatric drugs, pediatric consultations, and cost o f birth(prenatal care and vaccination
services for children were already free). Other measures included: (i)    the establishment o f
"rkgies d'avance" inall 66 healthregions anddistricts, the appointment and training o ftheir
managers, andthe transfer o f resources by the Treasury; and (ii) finalization o f the design
                                                                     the
o f a pilot thirdparty payment system at the local level to finance the essential health services
for indigents.

         Participation in local co-management and activities. The following was done: (i)      the
draftingo ftexts organizing the decentralization o fhealth personnel andtheir respective role
-the texts were to become applicable whenthe law ondeconcentration anddecentralization
was to enter into force; (ii)the completion of a study ofthe legal framework o f the Local
Management Committees ando fthe composition ofhealth center staff and their respective
functions; (iii) the preparationo f a training manual for teachers andparticipants intraining
seminars for healthcenter staff; and (iv) the elaboration o f community-based strategies for
malaria, nutrition, and reproductive health.

         Rural development. Inthe cotton sector, the trigger for PRSC-I11was partially
fulfilled. Itrequiredthe continuedimplementationo fthe 18-monthprogram to prepare the
two producing zones selected for new investors. This covered several actions, some o fwhich
were taken, others delayed: (i)committee was created to advise and monitor the
                                 a
implementationo fthe decrees opening the two zones to private investors; (ii)    a firm was
recruitedto perform an evaluation o fthe assets inthe zones; (iii)   biddingdocuments
outliningthe rules andconditions for awarding contracts were prepared, butonly the
technical part o fthe biddingprocess was launched prior to approval o f PRSC-111; and (iv)
mechanisms were established specifying the rules for all existing and future actors inthe
sector regardingprice setting, credit mechanisms and risk guarantees, as well as the role o f
the cotton interprofession; however, the practical application ofthese mechanisms was
delayeduntilafter the sale o fthe two zones.

         Inthe areaofagricultural diversification, actionplanswere finalized for cereals
(millet, sorghum) and oilseeds, while the planfor fruits andvegetables was to be completed
by December 2003. A fruit terminal with cooling facilities was opened at Ouagadougou
airport. The institutional audit o f the ministries active inthe rural sector was further delayed,
as only the audit o fthe Ministryo f Agriculture was to start inthe second half o f 2003.

        Environment. There was no trigger for PRSC-I11butthere were two benchmarks to
monitor progress indisseminating environmental awareness and good practice: (i)        a
workshop was held to introduce the principles and methods o f EAs and social safeguards to
facilitate compliance by the ministries implementingmeasures supported by the PRSCs; but
(ii) preparationoftechnicalguidelinesforsector-oractivity-specificenvironmental

          Implementation and outputs

          Procurement. The trigger for PRSC-I11was partially fulfilled. Progress was made
under the comprehensive procurement program, elaborated under PRSC-I: (i)                a high-level
working group responsible for defining and overseeing the procurement reforms was created
inDecember 2002; (ii) work ledto the adoptionbythe Cabinet inMay 2003 o fa revised
                           its
decree meeting the standards o f international practice and to the preparation o f a procurement
planfor 2003; (iii) draft Procurement Manual was completed; (iv) the draft capacity

buildingplanwas finalized; and(v) the EUoffered to finance the audit relatingto the
verification o f 50 percent o fpublic procurement ando fthe 2001 largest contracts (the audit
was expected to be completed by end 2003).

          Budget reporting andfinancial management. There were two triggers for PRSC-111.
Bothwere fulfilled. The first requiredthe submission o fthe budgetexecution report for 2001
to the Chambre des Comptes by December 2002; it was submittedwith a four-month delay.
The second required the enactment o f a revised organic budget law inline withregional
guidelines. The law, enacted inJanuary 2003, laid the foundation for the application o f a
new budget classification, a new chart o f accounts, and a revised fiscal accounting
framework, all to comply with regional guidelines. Underone important benchmark, the
Government adopted several actions to bring more rigor to the execution o f the budget in
accordance with the planharmonizing the recommendations o fthe PRGB,the CFAA, and
the ROSC. Finally, a draft decree was prepared to strengthen the role o fthe General State
Inspectorate (IGE) andthe General Finance Inspectorate (IGF)7. The Cour des Comptes
became operational at the end o f 2002.

          Civil service reform and decentralization. There was no trigger for PRSC-111, but
progress was to be monitored by benchmarks. Inthe area o f civil service reform, the 1998
Law on Public Sector Reform hadintroduced a merit-basedpersonnel managementsystem,
butthe system hadnot beenimplementedinthe absence o fjob descriptions. Progress in
implementing the relevant provisions o fthe law was as follows: (i)          instructions to apply the
merit-based system starting in2003 were issued; (ii)          two decrees were adopted inApril 2003
clarifying the scope o fthe mission letters to be issuedto eachministry specifying its
objectives and the rules for personnel evaluation; and (iii)       the personnel databases between
M O F and the Ministry o f Civil Service were unified, although inconsistent or missing files
for 9,000 civil servants remainedto be reconciled.

         The immediate objectives were:

        In budget execution, monitoring and deconcentration: (i)                 expandthe Integrated
Financial Management System(IFMS) by integrating the existing debt management system
(SYGADE-DDP) and beginning the process of extending the systemto the regional level
underthe decentralization process(regional CID); (ii)             undertake a feasibility study of an

(Education, Agriculture) basedonthe needs ofthe concernedlocal and regional
administrations; and (iv) operationalize the regionalization ofpayment order by June 2003
through: (a) revision of budget regulations to reflect changes inthe order o fpayment
authority and (b) creation of budget administration at the regional level linkedto the CID, as

 The 1998 and 2001 texts on decentralization had been very partially applied and were not very satisfactory. It
became increasingly clear that a gradual approach was necessary, by which deconcentrated levels of the
administration were to be strengthened first. Inthe course of 2002,2003, and 2004 the legislation was
extensively revised to make it not only more coherent but also to reflect this gradual approach. This ledto the
enactment inDecember 2004 of the Local Government Code which abolished all previous texts.

Maintainingmacro-economicstability.

        Macro-economic stability was maintained in2003 andperformance underthe PRGF
was satisfactory. Real GDP increased by 8 percent reflecting a better performance than
expected inagricultural production. Inflation declined to less than 2 percent by year-end as a
result o f the ample food supply andprudentfinancial policies. Fiscal performance was
satisfactory with revenue higher than expected duringthe second halfo f the year" and
lower-than-projected expenditure. The current account deficit narrowed as a result o f higher
cotton exports and lower-than-programmed imports. The year was marked, however, by a
large shortfall inbudget support and concessional loans: the second tranches o f boththe EU's
grant andAfDB's SAC slippedto 2004 andseveral donors did not disburse their program
assistance inview o fthe better-than-expected economic situation.

        Health. There were two sub-areas, where reforms were called for.

        Improvement in healthservices (availability, accessibility, and quality of health
care). There was a trigger requiringcontinuedprovisiono f essential medication andcare as
decided over the previous years. The trigger was fulfilled: the distribution o f free vitaminA
supplements after the discontinuation o f the polio vaccination days continued; the price
structure for generic drugs and essential medical services continued to be applied; and the
2004 budget included the level o f allocations required for the provision o fhealth services at
the prices specified inFebruary2003. Newly educated health staff o fthe national health
school were directly assigned to the regional and district levels. Finally, although the studies
on incentives for health staffto work inrural areas were validated, an actionplanfor their
implementationwas not prepared.

        Increase in healthfinancing. The share o fdeconcentrated credits inthe health budget
was increased by 10percent inthe 2004 budget and, pendingthe adoption of a formal
mechanismto monitor the "rkgies d'avance", MOH andthe Treasury put inplace an
informal mechanism. Preparation of a MTEF started and was to leadto the preparation o f a
sector-wide MTEF. A fiamework for the annual monitoring and evaluation o fthe ten-year
health planwas adopted inNovember 2003.

included important increases for environment, allocations for capacity buildingwere
insufficient; (ii) guidelines were preparedfor the application o f safeguard policies insix
sectors; (iii) ministries (transport, finance, and energy) convertedtheir focal points for

environmental safeguards to permanent units; and (iv) the verification o f the application o f
environmental safeguards inthree IDA projects was conducted and it revealed a mixed

        Procurement. The trigger for PRSC-IV was partially fulfilled: the effective
application o fthe May 2003 decree was verified by the IGF for a sample o f contracts; the
audit revealedthat the new decree was generally respected. However, verification o fthe
application o fthe new Manual of Procedures and o fthe standarddocuments for a sample o f
procurement in2003 could not be completed given the time necessary to validate the latter.
The audit ofprocurementcontracts in2001 and 2002, financed bythe EU, started inMarch
2004. With regardto benchmarks, a draft decree for leasing and concession contracts
meeting international practice was finalized; two ministerial directives (arrgte's)taken by the

requiring the implementationo fthe region as a deconcentrated entity andthe adoption o f the
application texts o fthe 1998 legislationon decentralization. The trigger was not fulfilled due
to the extensive revisions o fthe legislation and application texts during 2003-04, a process

Growth and private sector development.

        As indicated inthe chapter on the 2001-03 Medium-term program, the agenda of
PRSC-I11was broadened to include policies more directly aimed at promoting growth and
employment, a policy area assuming greater importance inthe second series. It i s therefore
appropriate to separate it from the other objectives.

        The immediate objectives were:

Maintainingmacro-economicstability

       Macro-economic stability was maintained in2004. Although the country suffered
from adverse exogenous shocks in2004 (sharp fall inthe price o fcotton, the mainexport;
sharpincrease inoilprices; a locust invasion coupledwith a milddrought; continued political
instability inCBte d'Ivoire; andappreciation o fthe CFA franc against the U S dollar), macro-
economic stability was maintained and performance under the PRGF was satisfactory. Real
GDPgrowth declinedfrom 8 percent in2003 to 4.6 percent in2004, against a target o f 6
percent, reflecting a sharp decline incereal production because o fthe drought and locust
infestation insome regions. Inflationremained low. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants)
was contained at 8.6 percent o f GDP thanks to higherthan expected revenues and lower
expenditures. However, with fiscal revenue persistently weak, the fiscal deficit was entirely
financed by external financing with grants accounting over half. The current account deficit
(excluding transfers) was maintained at below 11.O percent o f GDP due to a sharp increase in
cotton exports as the 2003-04 crop was sold before the fall inworld prices. The good export
performance offset the impact o fthe higher oil prices.

        Implementation and outputs.

        Inthe rural sector, the trigger requiringthe privatizationof SOFITEX was fulfilled
bytransferring its assetsintwo producingzones to two private operators, which started
operating inSeptember 2004. GOB, which kept 35 percent o f SOFITEX's capital, allowed it
to be privately managed. Other measures dealt withthe competitiveness o f the agricultural
sector: (i)regulations were drafted (but not adopted by mid-2005) organizing the principles
andrules to governthe transfer or delegation o fmissions to chambers o fagriculture, other
professional organizations, andthe private sector; (ii)  the institutional audit o f the Ministry o f
Agriculture, Water, and Fisheries was completed but an action planto implement its
recommendations remainedto be prepared; (iii) action planwas adopted to increase the
                                                    an
efficiency o fthe Livestock Ministry; and (iv) implementation o fthe action planto improve
the profitability o f cereal production andpromote food security continued.

        Telecomand energy sectors. The requirement o fbringingONATELto the point o f
sale was technically fulfilled, butpre-qualified bidders rejected the terms o f the privatization
and insistedon having a majority share. After discussions with the Bank, GOB agreedto sell
anoutright majority to potential bidders. The delay caused the timetable to be revised and
the final sale was expected for the second quarter o f 2006. Inenergy, the trigger for PRSC-V
required that GOB adopt the changes to the regulatory and legal framework applicable to the
electricity sector inline with its strategy. The trigger was partially fulfilled by the adoption
o f a decree inMarch 2005, butthe draft legislationhad not been enacted by mid2005. GOB
also started preparingthe privatizationo f the petroleum distributioncompany by carryingout
the financial audits o fthe years 2002-04.

        Private sector development. A revised Labor Code was enacted by Parliament in
September 2004 but the implementation decrees had not been adopted by mid-2005. The
comparative study of labor laws andregulations incountries of the sub-region was launched.
Several measures were adopted to improvethe business environment: additional resources
were provided to the one-stop shop for newinvestors; a project aimed at strengthening
Fasonorm and training o f Tradepoint staff was launched; and an interim report was prepared
for revising the regulations applicable to wholesale and external commerce.

        Implementation and outputs.

        Ineducation, expendituresincreased from2.6 percent ofGDP in2004 to 2.7 percent
in2005. A sectoral MTEFwas preparedfor primary educationanda PERcompletedfor
secondary education, but a MTEF covering bothlevels was still to be prepared. The policy o f
subsidizing schooling inthe 20 provinces with the lowest school enrollment was pursued
(andwas extended to most regionswith UNICEF financing). A study onthe effective
number o fteaching hours was completed, showingan average of 660 hours against the short-
andmedium-termobjectives o f 800 and900 hours, respectively; an action planwas under
preparation to address the issue. As one o fthe tools to monitor implementation o fthe PRSP,
the Statistics Office conducts an annual tracking survey aimed at evaluating the execution o f
expenditure and the availability o f school materials: the 2004 survey, reporting on 2003,
showed a significant increase inresources channeled to education facilities at the local level.

        Inhealth,expenditures decreasedfrom 2.0percent ofGDPin2003 to 1.9percentin
2004, but the documentationoffers no explanation for this decline (presumably due to delays
inconstructionofschools). Therewere two triggersto move to PRSC-V. Bothwere
fulfilled. One requiredthe preparationo f a sectoral MTEFfor 2005-07 inline with GOB'S
ten-year healthplanandthe MDGs. It was completed inMarch2005 as an input for the 2006
budget. The second trigger required designing a system o f subsidies for obstetrical
emergencies. Progress was mixed inother reform areas: (i)     the monitoring o f the "cash
advance" system to healthdistricts was hampered due to the difficulties encountered by local
personnel inusingthe system; (ii)   consultations among different administrative departments
causedthe revision o fthe texts governing the functioning o f local health management
committees to be delayed; (iii)  delays also affected the adoption o f a system o fperformance-
based contracts between GOB andhospitals; (iv) an action planfor the application o f a
system o f incentives for healthpersonnel was preparedbut had not been adopted by mid-
2005; and (v) a study on the increase inchildyouth malnutrition and its regional variation
was launched but its completion andpreparation o f an action planwere delayed.

         Water infiastructure. Progress was mixed. Several studies andaction plans were
launchedto improve the management framework o fthe sector, i.e., the definition o f an
investmentprogram and financing needs to reachthe MDGs; the preparation o f a national
water program for rural and semi-urban areas; the revision o fthe framework document for
the reforms andequipment maintenance insemi-urban areas; andthe revisiono fthe national

        Implementation and outputs.

        Budgetformulation. The trigger for PRSC-V was fulfilled: the 2005 budget was
based on the sectoral ceilings o f the 2005-07 MTEF and inline with the priorities o f PRSP-
11. Allocations for non-wage recurrent expenditures were increased significantly inthe
priority sectors: health, social action and national solidarity, basic education, secondary and
higher education, and rural development.

        Budget execution. The trigger for PRSC-V was partially fulfilled. Several actions
were undertaken on the basis o fthe AFRITAC report: (i)project database was constituted
                                                             a
for all externally financed investment spending; (ii) the tables o fcredit andgrant agreements
were verified; (iii) role o f all agencies involved inthe management o fthe foreign debt
                     the
was clarified, and a similar effort was undertakenfor grant financing but was delayed
becauseo fthe different procedures usedby donors; and (iv) work was launchedto determine
whether the debt software (SYGADE) could be used as the instrument for the monitoring o f
all external financing includinggrants.

        Furtherprogress was made onthe computerization o fthe revenue management
system (CIR): based on the institutional and technological options adopted, work started on
buildingthe software but completion was not expected beforethe endo f2005; With regard
to deconcentration, a progress report was completed confirming the benefits o f the first
experience o fbudgetdeconcentration inBobo Dioulasso, Le., reduced delays inexecuting
the budgetand emergence o f local entrepreneurship. Launchedin2003, the experiment was
extendedto four other regions in2004, and was to be further extended to seven more regions
in2005-06.

        Procurement and transparency in the use ofpublic funds. Buildingon achievements
underthe first PRSC series, further progress was achieved: (i)decree creating a committee
                                                                   a

conditions for the issuance andwithdrawalo f accreditation for public works were prepared;
(iii)softwarerequiredtofollowtheprocurementprocessinamannerconsistentwiththe
    a
existing expenditure framework was developed; and (iv) the Inspection Ge'ne'ralede I'Etat
(IGE) continued to conduct audits and controls o fprocurement contracts. Two other
measures were taken to promote accountability and transparency inthe use o fpublic funds:
(i) triggerrequiringtheadoptionofadecreetoregulateconcessionandleasingcontracts
   the
and ensure their consistency withbest international practice was fulfilled; and (ii) trigger
                                                                                       the
requiringto start implementinganactionplanfor the creation o fan accounting system o f
government property was partially fulfilled because o f delays inimplementing some o fthe
tasks (purchase o f software; training o f staff; and starting the physical inventory o f
government property).

        Oversight and ex-post control. Continued progress was made indelivering public
accounts intime to the oversight bodies: (i)   the budget execution report for 2003 was
reviewedby the Cour des Comptes andthe Loi de RGglement was approvedby Parliamentin
December 2004; (ii) final accounting statements (comptesde gestion) for 2001-03 at the
                      the
central level were submitted to the Cow des Comptes, but those at the deconcentrated levels
and o fpublic enterprises were not because o fcapacity constraints at the local level; and (iii)
                                                                                              a
training program for the magistrates o fthe Cour was implemented.

        Public sector reform and decentralization. Inpersonnel management, the trigger for
PRSC-V was fulfilled: the software for the integrated accounting system for local
communities was finalized andbecame operational inthree communities; it was to be
deployed in 10more in2005. Under benchmarks, the following actions were taken: (i)        the
budgetpayroll management system (SYGASPE) was extended to the Ministries o f Basic
Education ando f Secondary andHigher Educationpermittingtheir humanresources
department to manage their own personnel, but the system could not be extended to other line
ministriesbecausethey were not connected to GOB's computerized integrated accounting
system (CIE); and (ii)  the performance-based evaluation system o f staff became effective at
the Treasury.

        Indecentralization, implementationofthe deconcentratioddecentralization policies
continuedbut at a very slow pace. The 13 regional governors were appointed following the
enactment o fthe Local GovernmentCode inDecember 2004 and the application texts ofthe
Code were being prepared to implement the region as a deconcentrated entity. Inapplication
o fthe Code, GOB started transferringto decentralized bodies the competences andresources
identified bythe Code: pre-school education, basic education and literacy programs, health,
culture, sport, and youth and leisure.

        Environment. There were no triggers but work undertakenunder previous PRSCs
was pursued: (i) continued implementation o fthe capacity buildingprogram for
environmental assessments; (ii)   nine additional ministries created a permanent unit to
develop environmental safeguards but this was hampered by a lack o f financial resources;

and (iii) supervision o fenvironmental management plans for IDA and other donor-
         the
financed projects continued. Inaddition, GOB launched a master planand some pilot
projects to improve the management o f forestry resources.

Maintainingmacro-economicstability.

        Macro-economic stability was maintainedin2005. Despite adverse external shocks
in2005, macro-economic stability was maintainedandperformanceunder the PRGFwas
satisfactory. Real GDP growth rebounded from 4.6 percent in2004 to 7.1 percent, against a
target o f4.4 percent, on account o f record cereal andcotton harvests. The strong growth
performance more thanoffset the negative impact o f the deterioration inthe terms o f trade.
Inflation rose to 6.4 percent under the combined effect o fhigher oil prices and increased food
prices duringthe first halfo fthe year but inflationary pressures eased at the end o f the year
as a result o fthe good 2005-06 harvest. The 2005 fiscal deficit was smaller thanprojected
underthe PRGF,despite a revenue shortfall, because many expenditure authorizationswere
not executed. The current account deficit (excluding official transfers) widened as a result of
the higher oil prices.

        Inthe rural sector,the emphasis ofthe reformagendashiftedfrom the cotton sector
to the promotion o f agricultural diversification. Inthe cotton sector, the inter-professional
association aimedat strengthening coordination inthe sector, was establishedinFebruary
2006. The trigger for PRSC-VIwas fulfilled: standards andnorms were approved for
oleaginous (sesame, cashewnuts, shea butter) and cowpeasto promote trade andtechnology
transfer. Other actions were taken to promote diversification: (i) vulnerability o f
                                                                   the

        Telecomand energy sectors. The prospect of bringing ONATEL to the point ofsale
andtransferring its assets to anewprivate operator bythe endo f2005 was not achievedas
there were delays inthe recruitment of aprivatization advisor. As a result, it was now
expectedfor the endof 2006. Inenergy, the law on the newregulatory and legal framework
inthe electricity sector was enactedallowing for the creationofaregulatory authority. But
there were delays inthree areas monitored by benchmarks: works on the power line between
Ouagadougouand Bobo-Dioulasso were delayed becauseo fthe need for reliability tests; the
accountingand financial audits ofthe electricity andpetroleum companieswere not
completed intime causing delays inthe issuance o fthe tender for the selection o f a private
operator for the management ofthe electricity company and ofthe biddingdocuments for the
private participation inthe capital ofthe petroleum company.

       Private sector development. Some measures were adoptedto simplifythe
requirements for private investment. However, inthe all-important reformo fthe labor
market, progresswas mixed: (i)   although a revised Labor Code hadbeen enactedin
September 2004, the implementation decrees had still not been adoptedby mid-2006, partly
because ofresistance from unions; and (ii)comparative study on labor laws andregulations

        Budget management and ex-post control. There was one trigger for PRSC-VI. It was
partially fulfilled: the accounting system for government property was to be operational and

the physical verification completed. Physical verification was completed in43 o f the 45
provinces and inthe commune o f Ouagadougou anda private firm was recruited to finalize
the accounting system. The 2004 budget execution report was reviewedby the Cour des
Comptes and the draft Loi de R2gZement was submittedto Parliament in September2005.
The accounting statementsfor 2004 were submittedto the Cour des Comptes.

        Public sector reform and decentralization. Incivil service reform, the deployment of
the budget payroll managementsystem (SYGASPE) to line ministriesmade little progress.
Indecentralization, the trigger for PRSC-VIwas partially fulfilled. Itrequiredthe
finalizationofthe framework for the transfer o fresources and competences to communes.
The following was achieved: (i)  GOB adopted a draft law defining the resources and
expenses of local governments as well as localtaxes and tax sharingmechanisms with the
Central Government (the draft law was expectedto be enactedby Parliament inmid-2006);
(ii) definedtheaccountingandfinancialregimeforlocalgovenunents,including
    GOB
budget and accounting classification; (iii) draft devolutiondecreeswere adopted for the
effective transfer of functions and assets to urbancommunes; and (iv) a priority action plan
was adoptedto assist the newregional councils andrural communes. Other actions included
the deployment ofthe software for anintegratedaccounting system for local communities in
8 regions, which is a key step inthe decentralization process as it ensures an adequate
fiduciary framework for public spendingat the local level, includingthe productionof
accounting statements (comptes de gestion).

        Environment. Furtherprogresswas made in(i)       implementingthe capacity building
planfor environmental assessment; (ii)   controllingthe application o fthe national regulations
inenvironmental assessments; and(iii)    supervising IDA and donor-financed projects. A
stock taking ofthe forestry resourcesandthe formulation o f an investmentprogram
permittingtheir sustainable managementwas launched.

Maintainingmacro-economicstability.

        Macro-economic stability was maintained in2006 and performance was satisfactory
underthe PRGF. InApril 2007, the IMF approved anewPRGF arrangement covering 2007-
10. Real GDP growthreached5.5 percent in2006, against atarget of 5.2 percent, due to
favorable rainfalls while activity was also good inthe construction and service sectors.
Inflationremained low at 2.4 percent. Revenues, at 12.4 percent o f GDP, were lower than
projected underthe PRGF, mainly becauseof lower profit taxes from the cotton companies.
However, the fiscal deficit was contained due to higher grants for capital expenditures and
lower total expenditures. Despite continuing highoil prices and low cotton prices, the current
account deficit improved, mainly becauseo fbooming cotton exports encouragedby
unsustainably highdomestic producer prices.

Acceleratingbroad-basedgrowth and expandingemployment.

        The immediate objectives were thefollowing:

       Inprivate sector development: (i)   adopt and implementthe action plandrawn from
the Trade Diagnostic Study, includingassessingandaddressingthe issue ofVAT refundsfor
exporters withinthe existingregulatory framework; (ii)   improve the business climate by
implementingGOB'Sactionplanbasedonthe "Doing Business Report"; and(iii) the         pursue
implementation ofthe pilot landtenure security programintargeted provinces and approve
the strategy for landtenure security inrural areas as a critical step toward the adoption o f the
framework law on rural landtenure.

       Implementation and outputs.

       Inthe rural sector, there were no specific actions envisagedunderPRSC-VIfor the
cotton sector. Despite the good macro-economic performance in2006, financial difficulties
emergedinthe cotton industry under the combined effect of low cotton prices on the world
market in2004-05 and the large increase inproductionover the preceding years due to the
highproducerprices (the 2006-07 harvest declinedby 12.6 percent). As a result, the three
cotton ginningcompanies experiencedserious financial difficulties that requiredtheir
recapitalization; GOB andthe profession also initiatedthe revisionofthe producer price
mechanism to align it better to the international market. The financial restructuring o f
SOFITEX was still ongoing by mid-2007, whenPRSC-VI1was approved. InMarch2007,
GOB launched a study on the long-term sustainability o fthe sector, including the possibility
of adopting transgenic cotton.

       Telecomand energy sectors. The privatizationof ONATEL was completed at the end
of 2006. However, some implementation texts for the functioning ofthe regulatory authority,
ARTEL, had still not been adoptedby mid-2007. Inenergy, no progresswas made: private

delayed.

        Private sector development. There were three triggers aimed at improvingthe
business climate to move to PRSC-VI1 and they were fulfilled: (i)ministerial decision was
                                                                     a
issued establishing a transitory VAT arrears reimbursementmechanism to accelerate the
refunds due to exporters; (ii)law was enacted inDecember 2006 simplifying property
                               a
registrationprocedures andreducing the cost oftransferring property; and (iii)
implementation o f a pilot landtenure security program was pursued in26 provinces; a draft
strategy for landtenure security inrural areas was prepared; and consultations were heldwith
stakeholders before the drafting o f a general law on landtenure (Loi d'orientationsur le
foncier en milieu rural). Inthe reform o fthe labor market, the comparative study on labor
market laws andregulationswas completed inDecember 2006 as aninputto tripartite
discussions on the reform options. The discussions were completed inearly 2007 with the
adoption o fthree decrees on overtime work, the modalities for the implementation o fthe 40
hours week innon-agricultural enterprises, andthe conditions for dismissals.

         Theimmediate objectiveswere:

        In educationand health: transfer the responsibilities and resources to municipalities
andregions, as evidenced by (i)    allocating resources to regions and communities; (ii)setting
upthe institutionalmechanisms for the transfer offinancial resources to urbancommunities,
including the establishment o fthe Investment Fundfor Local Governments, the clarification
o fthe transfer o f mandates andresponsibilities to regions and urbanmunicipalities, and the
adoption o f a legal framework for the transfer o f humanresources.

        In water:implement the activities o fthe roadmap established by GOB to reachthe
MDGtargets for water and sanitation, includingadequate funding for the program budget o f
the GeneralDirectorate o fWater and Sanitationandfor the expansiono fthe hygieneand
sanitation promotion programofthe urbanwater public utility (ONEA) to four newtowns.

        Implementationand outputs.

        Ineducation,actual expenditures were estimated to have stabilized at 2.9 percent o f
GDP in2007. Neither the PDfor PRSC-VI1nor the ICRprovides information on
measures/actions implementedduringthe execution o f PRSC-VI after its approval. In
particular, there i s no information on whether the various measures and/or actions initiated
underPRSC-V were pursued, completed, or still delayed.

        Inhealth, actual expenditures were estimated to have increased substantially in2007
to 2.8 percent of GDP from 2.1 percent in2006. The PD for PRSC-VI1provides no
information on actions monitored by benchmarks duringPRSC-VI execution, but the ICR

PRSC-V) helpedwidenaccess to essential health services at acceptable costs, thereby
implyingthat the new structure became applicable under PRSC-VI.

for the expansionof ONEA's hygiene and sanitation program to four cities, and increasing
the budget of the General Directorate of Water and Sanitation insupport of its water and
sanitationprogram.
