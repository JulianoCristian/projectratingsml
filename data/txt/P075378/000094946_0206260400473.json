The\n            project is designed to help the Government achieve better\n            outcomes in public resource management by: 1) strengthening\n            program budgets, linking allocations to specific sector\n            objectives, strategies, and action plans; 2) improving\n            service delivery in education, health, and rural\n            development; and, 3) strengthening the fiduciary framework,\n            to promote accountability, and transparency in the use of\n            public funds, including external aid. Nonetheless, the main\n            risks to this operation, and its reform program, come from\n            political instability, vested interests, and fiduciary and\n            institutional issues. However, to minimize those risks,\n            reforms are being implemented in a sensitive context, and in\n            participation with opposition parties in the political\n            dialogue; and, notwithstanding vested interests, and\n            fiduciary risks regarding the use of public funds, such\n            should be mitigated to a substantial extent by the design,\n            and content of the project, given that the supported, main\n            reform measures, will have been taken prior to Board\n            presentation, and, by the fact that substantial technical\n            support will be provided."}, "docdt": "2002-06-20T00:00:00Z"}
