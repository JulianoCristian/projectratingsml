3. Program Description

3.a. Overall program

1.      A series of three PRSCs was designed in 2001 in line with the policy framework of the PRSP
and focusing on two broad areas: public sector reform and governance and sectoral policies for the
poor. The first component, reflecting objectives of the first and fourth PRSP pillar, included
strengthening of the budgetary process, improving audit functions, revising procurement regulations,
introducing budget deconcentration, and reforming the civil service. The second component, based
on PRSP pillars 2 and 3, incorporated measures to improve service delivery in education and health
and strengthen income-generating agricultural activities. The supported measures were perceived as
inputs for improving economic management and social service delivery, considered to be essential to
reach PRSP objectives.

3.b. PRSC-2 description

2.      PRSC-2 ­ approved in June 2002 in a total amount of US$35 million ­ is the second
operation in the series of three PRSCs initiated in 2001. It supports the same objectives in the
medium-term than PRSC-1 ­ achieving better outcomes in the management of public resources, and
strengthen basic service delivery in the social sectors ­ but updates the detail of the program based on
experience gained during the implementation of PRSC-1. The updates were expected as measures to
be associated with successive credits in this series of PRSC were to be broadened to include selected
policy measures drawn from the PRSP agenda, to accelerate growth and improve service delivery, in
addition to a continuing focus on public finance management.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

3.      The government has broadly satisfied all original triggers and benchmarks related to PRSC-2.
New measures introduced under PRSC-2 compared to the original framework described in the
program document for PRSC-1 ­ and including some changes in triggers and benchmarks ­ are

primarily attributable to the need to: (i) modify the medium-term program to reflect strength and
weaknesses in policy implementation since PRSC-1; (ii) incorporate the finding of the PRSP-PR1 and
the CFAA; and (iii) adapt policy formulations to evolving knowledge of existing conditions and
capacity constraints. For instance, PRSC-2 introduced a new section on PRSP Monitoring and
Evaluation to further strengthen the program originally envisaged in PRSC-1, as the JSA of the
PRSP-PR noted that increased efforts were required in the areas of poverty monitoring and
evaluation. Policy measures undertaken under PRSC-2 are discussed in table 1 in annex A. Given
the lag in translating policy actions in impacts, outcome achievements will be discussed in the
programmatic ICR for the last PRSC of the series.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

4.      In executing the 2002 budget, the government faced unexpected spending needs related to the
Ivorian crisis with substantial unplanned expenditure for security purposes and humanitarian aid
estimated at more than 0.5 percent of GDP, and rising oil prices with higher subsidies for electricity
fuels and butane gas throughout the year. Moreover, with the onset of the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire in
September 2002, the vulnerability of the Burkinabè economy was exacerbated as the country is
heavily dependent on the Abidjan port for imports and exports and on Ivorian inputs for certain
industrial activities. With the closure of the border, railway operations stopped and Burkinabè
operators were forced to divert trade to other ports in Benin, Ghana, and Togo at higher costs and to
find new suppliers for consumption goods and essential inputs. As a result, consumers face higher
costs, and some businesses had to reduce work hours or close down. Livestock exports to Côte
d'Ivoire largely ceased with repercussions on cash incomes in rural areas.

5.      Notwithstanding the difficult overall context for the implementation of the 2002 budget, it is
remarkable that the government was able to achieve a further significant increase in executing social
expenditure. Domestically-financed social expenditure, including HIPC-financed expenditure in the
priority sectors, increased from 4 percent of GDP in 1999 to 5 percent of GDP in 2002.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

6.      Overall Bank performance is satisfactory. As for PRSC-1, PRSC-2 is an integral part of the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) presented to the Board on November 30, 2000 (Report 21285-
BUR), and its objectives are well aligned with Government's development agenda, priorities and
policies set out in the June 2000 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. Lessons learned from the
implementation of PRSP and PRSC-1 were incorporated in the design of PRSC-2.

7.      Overall Borrower performance is satisfactory. The good policy implementation record in
PRSC-1 and PRSC-2 is a strong of the Borrower ownership and commitment to the program
outlined in the PRSCs in June 2000. The swift and efficient reaction to the Ivoirian crisis has also
helped the Government to mitigate the adverse impact, thus allowing the continuous
implementation of its poverty reduction strategy supported by the PRSCs.

Quality at Entry Assessment by QAG of PRSC-2

8.       The QAG panel rated the overall quality at entry satisfactory. The strategic relevance and
approach dimension were rated highly satisfactory. The risk assessment dimension was rated marginally
satisfactory and all other dimensions were rated satisfactory. Bank processes were also rated satisfactory.
The strong features of PRSC-2 identified by the QAG panel included the alignment with the PRSP and
the CAS, the inclusion in its design of lessons drawn from the satisfactory implementation of the PRSC-1
program, strong participation by the client in all aspects of PRSC-2 preparation, reflecting good
ownership, and good collaboration with IMF and other donors. Areas needing improvement included the
justification for basing PRSC-2 only on improved efficiency of public expenditures (improving the public
financial management systems and improved pro-poor expenditure allocations within key sectors, to
achieve better public services delivery), largely excluding other issues which may be significant for
poverty reduction, such as general growth and competitiveness. The panel would also have liked greater
elaboration of issues which may constitute a major risk to overall growth and poverty reduction, such as
regional differences within the country. The panel felt the risk assessment was rather general in nature
and does not discuss specific risks or risks mitigation measures related to PRSC-2. The operation also
appears somewhat weak on capacity building issues in line ministries given that improved service
delivery is a key objective of the operation. Lastly, the QAG panel felt that there were too many triggers,
which is inconsistent with the concept of moving to " fewer and better" conditions or benchmarks in Bank
operations.


7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

9.       Overall, the satisfactory progress made since the approval of PRSC-2 warranted the move
to PRSC-3.

10.      PRSC-2 could not be also aligned with the budget cycle as previously sought, and this should
be a priority in the next operation.

11.      More attention should be paid in the subsequent operations, starting with PRSC-1, on
capacity building in line ministries given the focus on improving service delivery.
