twenty\n            administrative districts of the Nepal Terai. Improvements in\n            production will be brought about by the wide adoption of low\n            cost, labor-intensive agricultural practices, improved\n            varieties of seeds, and provision of fertilizer. The project\n            will comprise: (a) reorganization and strengthening of\n            agricultural extension services; (b) strengthening and\n            reorientation of applied and adaptive research; (c)\n            strengthening the coordination between research and\n            extension services; (d) establishment of regular monitoring\n            and evaluation procedures; (e) local and overseas training\n            of staff, studies and provision of consultants; (f)\n            establishment of regional training centers, and offices and\n            housing for field staff; (g) facilities, equipment and\n            vehicles to support extension and training programs; and (h)\n            provision of fertilizer."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
