Extension and Adaptive Research Project is early and\n            sustained improvement in agricultural production,\n            particularly foodgrains, in eight of the twenty\n            administrative districts of the Nepal Terai. Improvements in\n            production will be brought about by the wide adoption of low\n            cost, labor-intensive agricultural practices, improved\n            varieties of seeds, and provision of fertilizer. The project\n            will comprise: (a) reorganization and strengthening of\n            agricultural extension services; (b) strengthening and\n            reorientation of applied and adaptive research; (c)\n            strengthening the coordination between research and\n            extension services; (d) establishment of regular monitoring\n            and evaluation procedures; (e) local and overseas training\n            of staff, studies and provision of consultants; (f)\n            establishment of regional training centers, and offices and\n            housing for field staff; (g) facilities, equipment and\n            vehicles to support extension and training programs; and (h)\n            provision of fertilizer."}, "docdt": "1981-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
