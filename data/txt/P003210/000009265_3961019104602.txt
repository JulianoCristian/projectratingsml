MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ZAMBIA
FOR A SECOND SOCIAL RECOVERY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to Zambia for the equivalent of US$30.0 million, on
standard IDA te-ms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Second Social
Recovery Project. The Government and beneficiaries will provide US$14.7 million and
donors the remainder.
2.     Background.  In 1991 a national survey revealed that about 69 % of all Zambians were
living below a level sutficient to provide basic needs. The Poverty Assessment (1994) suggests that
the prevailing picture is still the same: within that poverty ridden majority the depth and severity of
poverty varies from a mean of 29 % in rural areas to 8 % in urban aleas; .infant mortality has
increased from 97 per, 000 in the eighties to 107 per 1000 in the nineties; more than one third of
school age children do not attend school in the appropriate grade; 20% of rural households and 6%
of urban households are numbered amongst the ultra poor, with expenditures of less than 25% of
the core poverty baseline. The Zambian Government is pursuing a major restructuring and
adjustment effort to put the country on a pro-poor growth path. Major areas of emphasis are:
macroeconomic stabilization, facilitation of private sector development and targeted interventions
for the poor. The existing Social Recovery Project (SRPI) was initiated as an integral part of this
reform program, both helping expand infrastructure in poor areas, and providing targeted
interventions to poor communities. Also, SRP I has played a role in helping to assure the political
and social sustainabilitv of the reform program, by showing that Government, in partnership with
communities, is willing and able to assist with high priority local development efforts. The
Poverty Assessment highlights the need for community-based implementation of a number of
activities such as feeder roads, water supply systems, peri-urban public infrastructure and
rehabilitation of social service delivery systems. It also endorses the Government's emphasis on
devolution of safety net activities to local groups and the need to ensure that interventions are
planned and implemented with the participation of the poor.
3.     Three independent evaluations and several beneficiary assessments have shown the
importance of such interventions. The ongoing project has enjoyed an accelerated rate of
disbursements resulting in the project being fully committed by February 1995, and expected to be
fully disbursed one year ahead of schedule. Government has recognized that in the SRP, they have
created an efficient mechanism for creating and refurbishing social sector infrastructure.
4.     Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is to assist the Government of
Zambia's poverty reduction program through financing community initiatives and building capacity
for poverty monitoring and analysis. In addition to funding community initiatives to help mitigate
the negative effects of the economic crisis on the poor, the same mechanism will be utilized to
stimulate economic growth at district and community level through the support of economic
infrastructure such as markets, rural bridges and earth surface roads, safe water points etc. The
project will thus support community-based rehabilitation and improvement of the social sector and



economic infrastructure. This support will facilitate ongoing decentralization efforts in Zambia
and assist communities, NGOs and Government to learn how to become partners in the country's
development. Additionally, the Project will support both participatory and quantitative systems for
monitoring living conditions in the country. It will also continue to support action oriented poverty
research through a Study Fund which builds on the success of the Fund established under SRP 1.
5.     Project Description. In order to achieve the above objectives, the Project will work
closely with provincial and district level management in the line ministries to identify community
needs and promote community participation in the preparation and execution of Project activities.
The Project will consist of three major components:
(a)    Community Initiatives (US$35.8 million or 75% of total project costs):
community-based micro-projects identified, prepared and implemented by
communities, with appraisal and supervision from the Micro-projects Unit (MPU);
a sub-component vill finance capacity building in the processes of identification,
preparation, appraisal and implementation of micro-projects for communities and
local agencies of the line ministries;
(b)    Poverty Monitoring (US$2.7 million or 5.7% of total project cost): an annual
quantitative Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS) based in the Central
Statistics Office of the National Commission for Development Planning, and a
number of complementary qualitative participatory assessments to be carried out
by the Participatory Assessment Group (PAG), an NGO being created for the
purpose;
(c)    Poverty Analysis (US$I. I million or 2.3% of total project cost): policy relevant
research on poverty and social issues in a demand-driven framework, through a
Study Fund designed to be particularly responsive to sector ministry needs.
Institution building runs as a thread through all components of the Project, and includes the
extension of limited technical assistance to the Microprojects Unit until the mid-term review;
limited technical support for the Poverty Monitoring component; community, district and
provincial capacity building; and logistical support including office equipment and vehicles.
Because of procurement/disbursement definitions and procedures the costs for these elements are
drawn together and represent 17% of total Project cost.
6.     A breakdown of the costs and the financing plan are showvn in Schedule A. The methods
of procurement and the disbursement schiedule are shoNvn in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Zambia are shown in Schedule C
and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 14329-ZA dated May 25, 1995 is also
attached.
7.     Project Financing. Total Project costs are estimated to be US $47.7 million over a five
year period, with IDA financing 63%. The Country contribution consists of 'cash and kind' inputs
from bencficiary communities towards their micro-projects (23%), and Government (8%) to a total
of 31%. Participation of donors involved in the previous project (Sweden, Norway) has been
assured, but details are still being finalised.

8.     Project Implementation. The Project will be managed by the existing MPU in the Office
of the President, attached for administrative purposes to the National Commission for Development
Planning. The Project will follow the procedures established under SRP1 and the guidelines found
in the implementation manuals prepared during SRP1 and revised as a result of the various
evaluations and the mid-term review of that project. Recognising the need for long term
sustainability of community involved development, IDA will assist Government in devising an
effective modus operandi which, by mid-term review, will enable functions of the Project to be
absorbed into channels acceptable to IDA and the Government.
9.     Project Sustainability. The sustainability of Project activities is enhanced by the fact
that microprojects are all proposed and implemented by local communities and thus reflect their
own assessment of the situation. As most of the civil works are rehabilitation, there will only be a
minor impact on the recurrent budget of the Government; where there is need for additional staff
or other expenditures, the relevant line agency will be required to indicate that such resources are
available. The restructuring of the Government's budget in favor of social sectors and basic
infrastructure in general, and particularly towards operating costs for primary level services
supported under the Economic and Social Adjustment Credit (No. 2577-ZA), will help ensure that
sufficient Government funding is available.
10.    Lessons from Previous IDA Involvement. IDA has supported more than 30 social
funds, including several in Africa. These have proved to be effective ways of providing resources
for poverty reduction as long as the initiatives are managed autonomously, have rigorous but
simple procedures, are flexible in procurement and disbursement, and emphasize supervision,
monitoring and community participation. Strengths and weaknesses in SRP 1 have been identified
through three external evaluations: (a) a Technical Evaluation, which examined the project designs
utilized, the implementation procedures used, and the capacity of the communities to implement
self-help projects; (b) Beneficiary Assessments which reviewed the evaluation of community needs,
appropriateness of microproject identification and their impact from the perspective of the actual
beneficiaries; and (c) a Management Audit which assessed the efficacy of the project cycle and its
disbursement procedures. The overall picture from these evaluations is very positive. However,
three areas for improvement did emerge and have been emphasized in the Project. First, the Project
will aim to diversify the portfolio of microprojects, assisted by a participatory process which will
build community capacity and create a sensitivity to the importance of a multi-sector approach to
the reduction of poverty (as of now, 70% of SRP I's microprojects are in the education sector, 11%
in health, 5% in safe water supply). Secondly, sector Ministries will be encouraged to perceive the
Project as an implementing agency for their policies by the MPU working in closer cooperation
with their agencies at provincial and district levels. Finally, the Project will pay greater attention to
the problem of targeting communities designated as poor and vulnerable because of difficulty of
access or other reasons. Here too, increased use will be made of participatory methods in assisting
such communities to articulate their priorities and meet requirements for microprojects.
11.    Rationale for IDA Involvement and Relationship to CAS. The overall objective of the
Bank's assistance strategy in Zambia, as stated in the most recent Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS)(Memorandum of the President, Economic and Social Adjustment Credit Report No. P6248-
ZA, 2/15/94), discussed by the Board in March 1994, has been to promote sustainable economic
growth, and to reduce poverty by: (i) supporting macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reform
policies; (ii) promoting private sector development and greater public sector efficiency; and (iii)
increasing targeted direct assistance to the poor and vulnerable groups. This Project is fully
consistent with the CAS in its focus on targeted assistance to the poor and vulnerable, with its



- 4 -
emphasis on building capacity at community, district and provincial levels. SRP1 has already
made a significant contribution to the CAS through increased public sector efficiency, tapping
private community resources, and promoting poverty reduction. The Project continues this
approach with increased attention to targeted interventions. Other donors are supporting other
aspects of safety net operations. The Government has asked for IDA's involvement in this area
based on its considerable experience with other social fund operations across the world and the
central role IDA has played in the past, both conceptually and directly through SRP 1 and the
development of integrated sector operations ongoing in health and agriculture, and under
preparation in education.
12.    Agreed Actions. As a condition of effectiveness, the Government will have demonstrated
that at least half of the 1995 budget allocation for the Social Recovery Fund will have been
disbursed to the MPU. As a condition of effectiveness for the Nonvegian Grant, the Government
will present a workplan acceptable to IDA, indicating the proposed and ongoing activities for the
Central Statistics Office, and the staff allocations. Agreements were also reached on arrangements
for the implementation agency, government counterpart contribution, and procurement, audits, and
reporting.
13.    Environmental Aspects. As the Project is focused on the rehabilitation or expansion of
existing infrastructure, it has been placed in category C. The microprojects selection criteria, as
spelled out in the Implementation Manual for the MPU, include environmental impact evaluations
consistent with the recently completed National Environmental Action Plan. The overall impact on
the environment is expected to be small but positive. In particular, rehabilitation of water supplies,
and sanitation facilities have a direct, positive impact on the environment of affected communities.
14.    Poverty Category. The project is part of the core poverty program for Zambia and is
included in the program of targeted interventions because of its emphasis on support to poor and
vulnerable communities in the rehabilitation of essential community infrastructure. The project
also contains significant elements of civil service reforrn in supporting the decentralization process
through capacity building at district and provincial levels.
15.    Participatory Approach. Preparation of the Project has been built on extensive client
consultation and participatory assessment which became part of the implementation for SRP 1.
The recommendations in three Beneficiary Assessments carried out in SRP I are being implemented
in this follow-up Project. Discussions bctwecn the MPU and line Ministry officials at
hcadquarters, provincial and district levels have also contributed to the development of the Project.
Involvement of the SRP I implementation team and oversight of the Project's preparation by the
SRP steering committee, ensure that projcct design reflects a consensus vieNv within Government
and the NGO communitv.
16.    Project Benefits. Thc Project will provide improved and more extensive infrastructure
for the delivery of health, education and safe water serviccs to poor urban and rural communities.
Through the provision of small scale economic infrastructure it will enhance the capacity of
communities (especially of women's groups where these projects are in water supply) to increase
incomes, reduce vulncrability and strengthen self-reliance. The mechanisms utilized for the
delivery of micro-project support stimulate increased community ownership, and an improved
capacity to create and manage participatory development. In the medium tcrm, the experience will
help solidify ongoing decentralization efforts and enhance the capacity of community groups to
manage their own development programs.

17.    Project Risks. The main risks of social fund type projects have been lack of community
participation and poor implementation because of Government's limited capacity - particularly at
local level. SRP I has a proven track record which suggests that the methods which have evolved
for identifying, appraising and implementing micro-projects will minimize these risks. In addition,
the Project will include positive steps to broaden community participation in the identification
process, and improve district level capacity through training and involvement in the microproject
cycle. There is a,so a risk that changes in policy or ministerial structures and responsibilities will
threaten the non-sectoral base from which the MPU operates. This risk will be minimized by
actively pursuing sector ministry involvement and responsibility for the infrastructure being
developed or reh, bilitated.
18.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Credit wvould comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Page 3 of 3
1.    Zambia's investment portfolio is growing rapidly, with two new investment projects in
FY94 and four more in FY95. As a result, annual disbursements under the investment credits are
increasing and by May 31, 1995 reached US$ 39.8 million. The percentage of the total
investment portfolio which has been disbursed remained constant in FY94 and FY95, at about
14 percent (low because most of the portfolio is under three years old). In FY95, disbursements
for the structural adjustment credits have also remained constant, as compared to FY94, at about
US$150 million.
2.    As of March 31, 1995, the disbursement lag for the investment portfolio was about 17
percent'. To address issues associated with slow disbursements, during the past twelve months
the disbursement officer visited Zambia more regularly, the Resident Mission appointed a local
procurement/disbursement analyst and dormant Special Accounts were reactivated. As of March
31, 1995, only two Special Accounts remained inactive compared to seven in January 1994.
3.    For the projects disbursing at a slower pace than originally estimated, the status is as
follows:
Petroleum Rehabilitation (C2621)  Not yet effective; effectiveness conditions expected to be
fulfilled by July 1995.
PIRC II (C2523)                  Second tranche release is under management review and is
expected to be recommended shortly to the Executive
Directors.
Financial and Legal Management  Bids for the largest procurement packages, accounting for
Upgrading (C2535)                more than one third of the total IDA financing, were
evaluated in March and are expected to be signed shortly.
Transport Engineering (C2515)    Nearly all contracts have recently been cleared by the Bank,
and the Government has strengthened project management
by appointing the Executive Director of the National Road
Board as the Project Coordinator.
Coffee II (C 1743) and Ag. Res. &   The disbursement level is expected to increase with the
Ext. (C 1746)                    integration of both operations into the Agricultural Sector
Integrated Project (ASIP).
4.    Zambia has made a commendable effort in bringing overdue audits of project accounts,
special accounts, and statement of expenditures up-to-date, and currently has one of the best
records for audits in the region.
I For all active investment projects comprising the Bank's country portfolio, the percentage difference between
actual disbursements and the cumulative disbursement estimates as given in the 'Revised Forecast' in the MIS
system.
