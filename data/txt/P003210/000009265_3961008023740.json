The project will finance community initiatives\n            which assist the poor and vulnerable to meet their own\n            objectives during the adjustment period and thereby allow\n            faster economic and social recovery. The community-based\n            micro-projects will include the rehabilitation and\n            improvement of existing infrastructure and social service\n            delivery. The project will also improve the capacity of\n            communities and government staff to plan, appraise, manage\n            and maintain investment projects through the experience\n            gained in such micro-projects. The project will also enhance\n            the capacity of Zambian institutions to collect and analyze\n            poverty related data. The beneficiary communities will be\n            involved in the information gathering as well as in the\n            planning, design and implementation of the micro-projects.\n            The project will strengthen the communities' abilities\n            to take charge of their own development, rekindle the spirit\n            of self-help, and strengthen the capacities of the relevant\n            institutions to gather, analyze and act on relevant\n            information. In order to achieve its objectives the project\n            will have three components. The first is a community\n            initiatives component which will finance microprojects\n            identified, prepared and implemented by communities with\n            appraisal and supervision from the Microprojects Unit (MPU);\n            a sub-component will finance capacity building in\n            microprojects implementation and decentralized government\n            agencies. The second component will finance capacity\n            building and data collection through a Living Conditions\n            Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and a systematic participatory\n            monitoring and assessment system. The last component will\n            finance policy relevant research on poverty and social\n            issues in a demand-driven framework, building on the success\n            of the Study Fund under the First Social Recovery project."}, "docdt": "1995-06-05T00:00:00Z"}
