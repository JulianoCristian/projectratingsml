The lessons\n            learned from this project include: 1) Involvement of\n            district level staff in the provision of technical support\n            to communities has been beneficial. 2) Capacity of district\n            level staff to plan, appraise, approve, and finance\n            community initiative is variable, and their capacities\n            should be strengthened in systematic way before they can\n            take over these functions. 3) Continued training of district\n            staff in participatory methodologies, technical aspects, and\n            gender sensitivity will improve their ability to interact\n            with communities. 4) Requiring community contributions\n            instills a sense of ownership and responsibility for\n            sub-projects, thus increasing sustainability. 5) A more\n            coordinated approach to development in the districts could\n            mitigate duplication of efforts by various partners who are\n            supporting development activities in communities. 6)\n            Maintenance issues are currently addressed up-front in the\n            community initiative cycle. 7) The use of standard designs\n            should be tempered with capacity of those implementing. 8)\n            The requirement that 50% of the project committee be\n            comprised of women has increased the decision-making role\n            that women play in community affairs. 9) Providing formal\n            linkages between those undertaking qualitative analysis and\n            those carrying put quantitative analysis can provide\n            government, NGOs, and donors with more robust information on\n            which to formulate poverty policies."}, "docdt": "2001-05-09T00:00:00Z"}
