        Four Development Support Credits (DSC I-IV) were given to the Government of the
People's Republic of Bangladesh (GOB) during June 2003 through June 2007, in the amount of
SDR 624.7 million (US$900 million equivalent).        DSC IV, the last of the credit closed on
December 31, 2007. DSC IV was complemented by two supplemental financing of $175 million.

        This report was prepared by Zaidi Sattar (Consultant, SASFP) and is based on interviews
with World Bank staff (headquarters and the country office), key government officials, members of
civil society, and materials from project files. Vivek Suri (PRMED) was the peer reviewer. Zhu
Xian was the Country Director at closing of DSC IV, while Christine Wallich saw through DSC I-
III; Sadiq Ahmed was the Sector Director and Kapil Kapoor the Sector Manager for Bangladesh
throughout the DSC operations. Kapil Kapoor was the task leader for DSC I, Anthony Bottrill for
DSC II, Anthony Bottrill and Sandeep Mahajan for DSC III, and Sandeep Mahajan for DSC IV.
Vinaya Swaroop (Lead Economist for Bangladesh) provided overall guidance to the ICR team
which consisted of Diepak Elmer, Abul Basher, Rejwana Farah, Aneeka Rahman, and Shah Nur
Quayyum, with research support from Sanjana Zaman and Farria Naeem, all of SASPF. Zahid
Hussain, Sakuntala Akmaneena, Alan Townsend, Mohammed Iqbal, Raihan Elahi, and Zafrul Islam
provided additional inputs and feedback. Mehar Akhter Khan was instrumental in retrieving SAP
data and skillfully formatting the ICR document. Mildred Gonsalves provided program assistance.

        A list of government officials and members of civil society, who were interviewed in
Bangladesh, is provided in Annex 7. The ICR Team would like to express thanks for the excellent
cooperation we received from the government officials in assessing the impact of DSC operations.

 F. Results Framework Analysis

 Program Development Objective:

         The programmatic credits of the DSC series were designed to support the government's
 strategy for supporting pro-poor growth by improving the investment climate on the one hand and
 strengthening broad-based governance through institutional changes. The four credits assisted
 Bangladesh's reform efforts to (a) strengthen core governance functions, with emphasis on
 reforms in public procurement, budget management and tax administration; and (b) improve the
 investment climate by maintaining macroeconomic stability, deepening domestic deregulation
 and trade liberalization, and strengthening the performances of the banking and energy sectors
 and state-owned enterprises.

 PDO 1: Satisfactory implementation of an adequate macroeconomic framework.
 Value
 Comments: Macroeconomic sustainability has been ensured throughout the period.             See Table 2:
 Bangladesh Macroeconomic Indicators (Section 2.1).

 PDO 2: Increase in revenue-GDP ratio in excess of 11 percent of GDP.
 Value (%)                10.1             10.3          10.2           10.5         10.4          11.4
 Comments: In the absence of much needed reforms in revenue administration -- some envisaged under the
 DSC series, but complied only in letter not in spirit -- targeted increase in revenue to GDP ratio did not
 occur, except in FY08, the sustainability of which remains to be seen.

 PDO 3: Increase in share of domestic activity-based taxes in total revenue to more than 50 percent.
 Value (%)                48.2             49.2          49.7           49.6         57.9          57.9
 Comments: Progress was achieved in reducing reliance on import-based taxes. This trend has continued.

 PDO 4: Debt to GDP ratio remains less than 50 percent.
 Value (%)                52.7             51.1          51.0           50.1         46.5          44.4
 Comments: At under 50% of GDP and falling, central government debt liability continues to be low and
 sustainable.

Comments: 12 months target - 90% achieved; 4 months target - modestly achieved mainly due to a low
rate of compliance for contracts at the ministerial and cabinet level approvals, where elapsed time between
bid opening and award averaged 7 and 9 months, respectively.

PDO 7: Nonpartisan active pursuit of suspected cases of serious corruption and corrective actions,
including prosecution, where appropriate.
Value (quan/qual)
Comments: There were no prosecutions of any prominent politician or official during 2002-06, aside from
minor disciplinary actions of officials, which did not lead to any prosecutions and who were sometimes
restored to previous jobs. During the Caretaker Government's tenure (2007-08), there was a sharp upward
spike as the anti-corruption drive went into full swing. By 2008, as the anti-corruption drive faltered in the
effort to secure the political parties' participation in the election--considered a priority national objective to
ensure a free, fair and credible election, the number of prosecutions fell and there developed a distinct
selectivity/arbitrariness in prosecutions and successful bail applications.

PDO 8: Reduction in crime.
Value (%)                   32.8                                                          14.6
Comments:      Data taken from Bangladesh Investment Climate Assessment Survey (2002 and 2007),
indicating percentage of firms reporting crime, theft and disorder as major or severe obstacle. There
appears to have been a significant reduction in business perception of crime as a major obstacle.


PDO 9: Improved public perception of justice system integrity and effectiveness.
Value (quan/qual)
Comments: There has been a steady deterioration in public confidence in the courts. Under the Caretaker
Government law and order drive, overall perceptions of the justice system and various institutions
improved. The police have been the least trusted public institution in opinion surveys. While police
performance is generally agreed to have improved during 2007-08, the judiciary provides a more sobering
picture ­ despite positive changes in the formal legal framework, there has been little done to arrest the
longer-term decline in judicial quality and integrity.

PDO 10: Increased trade-GDP ratio.
Value (%)                   28.6             29.3            30.7           33.9          40.3            42.3
Comments: In terms of current account transactions, Bangladesh appears much more integrated globally.

Comments: While average nominal protection did decline, trends in effective protection remains unclear. In
FY09, ERP certainly increased with tariffs on inputs substantially reduced, while the top rate on final goods
remained unchanged.

                   DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT CREDIT SERIES (I-IV)
            IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT


The Backdrop

        Historically, Bangladesh has not been in the forefront of reformist economies. For the
past three decades or more, reforms have occurred, in small rather than big steps, with a gradual
rather than big bang approach. This is because changing the status quo in Bangladesh, as in many
developing economies, poses enormous political, cultural and social challenges.          Sweeping
changes in any policy is often difficult to carry out. That is why, so very often, reform successes
need to be judged on the basis of partial rather than full implementation of all components.

        Implementing policy and structural reforms is not always purely a matter of economics.
Serious political economy considerations come into play.           For most governments, being
politically correct has been just as, if not more important, than making the right or tough
economic choices. For instance, subsidies on agricultural inputs, gas, power and petroleum
products, and on exports, have always been popular, regardless of the economic rationale against
them. So, it is no surprise that reducing subsidies has been an uphill task as part of any reform
proposal. Likewise, closing or divestment of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is not an easy
option. There are jobs at stake, often by the thousands. The political cost at times may be so
prohibitive that even after a formal commitment to any development partner from government,
the prescribed change either does not happen or happens very slowly. Even a reversal cannot be
ruled out, should political circumstances change.

        It is in this light, therefore that the reform activities supported under the DSC
programmatic framework need to be assessed.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

        At the turn of the century, Bangladesh economy showed potential for moving to a higher
growth trajectory, but institutional and policy constraints hindered realization of that potential.
History shows that broad-based reforms in Bangladesh moved in roughly 10-year cycles. Pro-
market reforms of the early 1980s were followed by deepening of market-oriented reforms
starting in 1991, which transformed the management of the economy in fundamental ways: the
role of the public sector in the marketplace was reduced through broad-based deregulation,
making room for market orientation of production and distribution, removal of price controls,
liberalization of trade and investment, moving from fixed to flexible exchange rates, and closure
and privatization of some state-owned enterprises.          Together, those policies represented a
significant departure from the historical stance in favor of government ownership and
intervention in markets.

        There is ample evidence which shows that these aforementioned reforms paid large
dividends in the form of higher growth and poverty reduction. During the 1990s, GDP growth
averaged nearly 5% annually, compared to 4% in the previous decade, and headcount poverty
declined by roughly 1 percentage point every year--the fastest in decades. But by the close of
1990s, Bangladesh's appetite for reforms had ebbed; corruption and poor governance became
endemic.



                                                 1

         Early in the 21st century, it was time for another round of reform initiatives. A new
Government was in charge with reform-leaning leadership at the helm. This offered a window of
opportunity to kick start broad-based reforms in economic policy and institutional management
that had slowed considerably in the late 90s. In 2000, one-half of the population of 135 million
lived below the poverty line. To reduce poverty faster and achieve human development targets
under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it was estimated that economic growth would
have to reach 6-7 percent annually.1 This posed the biggest challenge to the political leaders and
policy makers who formed the new government in 2001.               In the top echelons of power,
responsible for economic policy, there was a realization about the opportunity at hand, but so
were the challenges. It was clearly time for a second wave of reforms.

         The agenda for reforms was quite substantial. By the close of 2001, macroeconomic
slippages began threatening economic stability. Due to profligate spending towards the latter part
of 1990s, fiscal deficits trended upwards beyond a sustainable level, and exports, foreign
exchange reserves, and growth suffered from post-9/11 shocks. Power sector was in crisis as
power shortages gripped the nation and stifled progress in business and industry. The nation's
principal seaport, Chittagong, was burdened with archaic customs and port administration
resulting in poor handling of cargo and the longest ship turnaround times in the region.
Institutions that ensured transparency and accountability of government were either dysfunctional
or non-existent. Endemic corruption was eating at the vitals of the nation's body politic, resulting
in a loss of 1-2 percentage points of GDP annually. Together, these factors made it difficult for
Bangladesh to address its main challenge of reducing poverty substantially, generate adequate
level of investment and create enough jobs for the extra million work force being added every
year. If these issues were to remain unaddressed, achievement of MDGs for Bangladesh would
have become impossible.

         In its interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), the new Government laid out
an ambitious set of poverty reduction targets and social development goals that were consistent
with, and at times even exceed, the MDGs. The I-PRSP (A National Strategy for Economic
Growth Poverty Reduction and Social Development) identified four main pillars for policy and
institutional reforms to reduce poverty: macroeconomic stability to accelerate pro-poor growth;
improving governance to sustain growth and poverty reduction; investing in human development
to enhance human capabilities; and social protection to reducing vulnerabilities and improving
income generating opportunities. The formulation of the I-PRSP was appropriately seen by
country's development partners including the Bank, as government's ownership of the core
reform agenda confronting the nation.

         The Bank's ongoing Country Assistance Strategy was geared to moving towards
programmatic lending in support of reforms and selected investment operations and technical
assistance in alignment with the priorities in the nation's poverty reduction strategies (I-PRSP and
PRSP). Accordingly, the DSC series was launched, comprising four constituent credits (DSC I-
IV) totaling $900 million, together with supplemental and additional financing of another $175
million (Table 1). First, the I-PRSP was presented to the Boards of the IDA and the IMF in June
2003. In supporting the implementation of the government's growth and poverty reduction
strategy, the Board of Directors of IDA approved the first DSC of $300 million on June 19, 2003.

         The DSC series supported wide ranging reforms in institutions of governance and
economic management. Many of the reforms required making tough choices. For the first time,

   IDA supported reform package went beyond the traditional economic framework (designed along
   the lines of the Washington Consensus) by bringing certain core governance and institutional
   reforms on board. Critiques were quick to point out that the Bank did not have any convincing
   analytical work to establish the harmful nexus between poor governance and economic
   performance. On the contrary, there were Bank reports that highlighted the Bangladesh paradox
   of progressively improved economic performance in the face of deteriorating governance. Thus,
   critiques argued that the package of governance reforms appeared ad-hoc and their sequencing
   left much to be desired.

            In consequence, over the five years of the reform program, political commitment of the
   Bangladesh leadership ebbed and flowed. Progress in implementation was therefore uneven. It is
   fair to say that a good deal of the progress was made during the two years (2007-2008) when the
   country was run by a non-political, military-backed technocratic caretaker government (CTG).
   The CTG presented an apparent window of opportunity to press forward with reforms that failed
   to gain traction, such as in the area of anti-corruption, state-owned banking and telephone board
   corporatization, and power sector restructuring. Not only DSC4, but two supplementary financing
   totaling $175 million, and even a transitional credit (not part of DSC) of $100 million, all were
   processed within the two years of CTG's tenure. It goes to the credit of the Bank team's
   preparedness, built on past experience. While most of the reforms undertaken by the CTG appear
   irreversible, there is apprehension that some reforms might be reversed, nullified2, or, at the very
   least, softened through amendments.

   1.2      Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators:

            To support Bangladesh's reform efforts over a medium-term framework, the
   development objectives of the DSC series were designed under the rubric of two broad strategies
   of strengthening core governance functions and improving investment climate. Key objectives of
   the program, as laid out in the four program documents, included


   2 The new government which succeeded CTG ratified only 16 of the 122 Ordinances that were passed into
      law by the CTG, implying others were automatically nullified. Among those not ratified included DSC
      reform components: The Right to Information Ordinance, three separate ordinances which turned Biman
      Bangladesh Airlines, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, and Dhaka Electricity Authority into
      public limited companies from government agencies, and two ordinances ensuring separation of the
      judiciary from the executive branch of the government. But the PM did give assurance that some
      Ordinances, not ratified, but considered of heightened public interest, might be tabled afresh, with
      appropriate revisions, in Parliament to be passed into law with retrospective effect.

1.4     Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

        The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) made governance reform the centerpiece
of the reform agenda that was to be supported. This was to be complemented by measures to
improve investment climate in order to set the ground for private sector development as the chief
driver of economic growth. The government's poverty reduction strategies as reflected in the I-
PRSP and PRSP, made similar arguments for accelerating growth and making progress on
MDGs. Recognizing the criticality of these two policy areas the DSC series charted out a set of
program activities that would

    · strengthen core governance functions, with emphasis on reforms in public procurement,
        budget formulation and budget execution, tax administration, and public administration;
        and

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1      Program Performance:

Macroeconomic management

         An overarching theme of the DSC series was to assist in creating and maintaining a stable
macroeconomic framework which is critical for any growth enhancing strategy. The program
was bolstered contemporaneously by the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
which ran concurrently until the conclusion of DSC IV in June 20073. Sound macroeconomic
management became a notable achievement of the DSC program. Between 2001 and 2005,
headcount poverty declined by roughly 2% per year while the economy registered GDP growth of
over 5.5% per annum (Table 2).

         Several macroeconomic fundamentals had weakened in the late 1990s, revealing signs of
unsustainable fiscal balances, largely due to unbridled growth of expenditures without
commensurate growth of revenues, mounting SOE losses and rising contingent liabilities. The
external environment also experienced a setback following events in September 2001, leading to
significant erosion in foreign exchange reserves, and slowdown of exports and economic growth.
These slippages highlight the fact that the stability of the macroeconomic environment cannot be
taken for granted and continued vigilance and effort are essential.

         The Government's medium-term macroeconomic framework (MTMF), developed under
the I-PRSP provided for the maintenance of sustainable fiscal deficits and targeted acceleration in
the rate of economic growth. The framework envisaged a realistic recovery of GDP growth rates
anchored in low inflation, larger investments by a more vibrant private sector, and further
building up of human capital and physical infrastructure. Fiscal projections, under the MTMF,
were consistent with Bangladesh's reform needs, with increased revenue mobilization and better-
prioritized expenditures being central elements of the budget strategy.

         Bangladesh maintained an impressive overall record of macroeconomic stability during
FY03-08, broadly in line with program objectives, marked by an upward growth trend; fiscal
sustainability and cautious monetary management. Prospects for fiscal sustainability benefited
most from curbs on wasteful expenditures and improved deficit financing patterns--with
restrained domestic financing and greater reliance on concessional external financing. Growth,
which accelerated from 4.4% in FY02 to 6.2% in FY08, has been broad-based, cutting across all

3  The last PRGF review which was due in May-June 2007 never materialized due to non-fulfillment of
   revenue targets and critical tax reforms.

major economic sectors and benefiting from robust demand in both domestic and export markets.
Enhanced revenue mobilization was one goal that remained persistently short of target. This was
compensated by underutilization of Annual Development Program (ADP) spending resulting in
keeping fiscal deficits within budget targets. Otherwise most of the macroeconomic objectives of
the PRGF program (therefore, DSC) were achieved and this is all the more impressive given the
pressures emanating from sustained high global oil prices, rising food costs and devastating
natural disasters. Reform of the foreign exchange regime--floated since May 2003--made possible
sustained growth in exports and remittances and helped the economy to weather external shocks
from rising oil prices and the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) quotas, and facilitated
the buildup of international reserves.

Strengthening core governance

        The DSC series supported the country's program for structural and institutional reforms
that were needed to lay the basis for vibrant private sector growth and for poverty reduction.
These reforms have included the financial sector, state-owned enterprises, the energy sector,
telecommunications, the government's own fiscal operations, anti-corruption, and public
administration.       Improvements were made in the budget formulation process, revenue
mobilization, public expenditure planning and financial management, public procurement,
monitoring and accounting. It is worth noting that effective implementation of a big chunk of
governance reforms were actually done under the non-political, technocratic CTG, which showed



                                                6

greater resilience in forging ahead with politically sensitive reforms such as in empowering the
Anti Corruption Commission. These governance reforms in Bangladesh were prompted by the
paradoxical situation of good development outcomes contrasting sharply with the country's
record of poor governance.

         Anti-Corruption Commission. Bangladesh was ranked as the topmost corrupt country in
the world by Transparency International's corruption perception index for five consecutive years
(2001-2005). Endemic corruption raised the costs of doing business and, according to Bank
analysis, shaved a few points off the economy's growth rate. The DSC program addressed this
sticky problem head on by requiring the establishment, staffing and strengthening of an
independent Anti-Corruption Commission and making it effective. During DSC I-III, the ACC
was formed but lacked effective operationalization for want of proper leadership and resources.
The commitment of the government to this important institution was questionable at best. The
CTG transformed the ACC with new leadership which jump started its activity and created
substantial impact in reducing corruption. In 2007 and 2008, Bangladesh was ranked below 10th
in TIB's list of perceived corrupt countries of the world.

         Public Financial Management. DFID had been in the lead from the donor side in
supporting the government's PFM program, while the Bank led donors' support to the
procurement reform program. The objective in this context was to improve the transparency and
efficiency of public expenditures and financial management, including procurement. Bangladesh
did make steady progress in improving the transparency and competitiveness in public
procurement--an area typically rife with corruption. Despite strong resistance from powerful
vested interests, the Parliament adopted a new law on public procurement in July 2006, with most
provisions that were in line with well accepted international practices. However, it is naïve to
expect that corruption in public procurement would be totally eliminated after enactment of a new
law, which went through substantial modifications prior to enactment to make it fit with ground
realities. Prevalence of this law enhanced transparency and accountability. However, combined
with ACC's aggressive anti-corruption drive during the CTG period, the law allegedly has had a
deleterious effect on the contract decision-making process of the government and has apparently
slowed ADP implementation lately.

         The Government has strengthened strategic budget planning by expanding the medium-
term budget framework (MTBF) approach; the system now covers about 65% of budgetary
expenditures and emphasizes better integration of the revenue (recurrent) and development
(capital) budget planning processes at the center and line ministries. To strengthen budget
execution, serious efforts are being made to improve the accuracy and timelines of expenditure
and public debt information, notably by computerizing accounting transactions. Reform efforts
have also sought to strengthen the transparency of fiscal information and key institutions of
accountability in PFM with the preparation of a comprehensive, medium-term, rolling Public
Financial Management Improvement Plan (PFMIP) that lays out a series of second-generation
PFM reforms. Furthermore, in FY07, GoB has begun setting up a technical support unit for the
Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC), established with IDA support under DSC II. The
PAC made good progress in reducing the backlog of audited accounts for discussion in the
legislature. The upshot of all this has been a reduction in expenditure leakages, greater
accountability, and more transparent procurement.

         Separation of Judiciary. A notable governance impact came through the separation of the
judiciary from the executive ­ something political governments always promised but reneged on.
The CTG addressed this challenging issue by actually implementing the final steps for the
separation, which the DSC program had on the agenda from the start. Passing of the Right to


                                                7

Information Act in 2008, prompted by DSC IV, was no less path breaking. With lukewarm
support from the government, progress in public administration reforms was nominal, at best.

Improving the Investment Climate

        Financial sector. The objective here was to improve governance and efficiency of the
financial system. However, the Bank's expectations for radical transformation had to be tempered
by the lack of similar commitment from the government which clearly appeared unprepared or
unwilling to go toe to toe with the Bank's initial approach for radical restructuring of the banking
sector. Yet, two achievements stand out. The Government passed the required amendments to
Bangladesh Bank Order 1972 and Bank Companies Act 1991. The amendments gave the central
bank of the country greater autonomy and authority on exchange rate and monetary policy, as
well as bank supervision. Also, the NCBs, re-named State-owned Commercial Banks (SCB), and
Specialized Development Banks (SDBs) were brought under the purview of BB.

        Privatization of all four NCBs ­ the Bank's initial approach ­ never received the
government's nod. In the end, the Bank settled for privatization of the smallest NCB, Rupali
Bank, while encouraging the restructuring of the others. In the end, privatization of Rupali fell
through, despite the government's best intentions and preparations. Corporatization of the other
NCBs was not achieved until the CTG was on board. Restructuring has been proceeding albeit at
a slow pace. The size of NPLs as percentage of NCB loans, which declined to 22% by 2006, shot
up to 29% in 2007, prompted by loan defaults due to SIDR and floods, as well as reclassification
of SOE loans without government guarantees as NPLs. On the plus side, there was significant
reduction in SCB share of banking sector assets, improved indicators of banking soundness,
higher profitability, and lower spreads between lending and deposit rates.

        Revenue mobilization. Bangladesh collects lower revenue as a percentage of GDP (11.2%
in FY08) than most of its comparators in the developing world. Low revenue constrains the
Government's ability to provide public goods and services. At the same time, it undermines fiscal
sustainability over the long-term. The malaise in tax administration was deep-rooted as reflected
in poor taxpayer services; lack of transparency in collection; inadequate audit and enforcement,
and protracted taxpayer disputes, all of which have hampered revenue collection. Nothing short
of a complete overhaul of the National Board of Revenue ­ the tax authority ­ would change this
scenario, in the assessment of several analytical reports done by the Bank, and other development
partners. But ground realities suggested a sequenced approach, with small but critical
improvements in different aspects of tax administration.

        The Bank has been engaged in NBR for well over a decade and the problems have been
clearly identified. UK's DFID had a presence through its Reforms in Revenue Administration
(RIRA) project, which saw the introduction of Large Taxpayer's Unit (LTUs) for VAT and
Income Tax. IMF sought to bring strategic changes through its PRGF agenda ­ e.g. revising VAT
and income tax laws. While cooperation among the three agencies was notable, commitment of
NBR's frequently changing leadership and staff waxed and waned, not to mention that there was
also an under-current of opposition to any change to the status quo. These were not the best of
circumstances for executing some of the difficult tax administration reforms under DSC. Thus
achievements were modest: NBR's adoption of a Strategic Development Plan, which laid down
the roadmap of reforms, was a notable milestone, but there was little appetite for its
implementation so that, over a period of five years, there was little results to show on the ground.

        Overall, progress on tax reforms has been slower and more uneven than envisaged,
resulting in the weak revenue mobilization response. Tax administration reforms that have been


                                               8

implemented are expected to have long gestation before tangibly impacting revenue mobilization.
Moreover, progress on tackling tax policy loopholes and improving customs administration
(especially on the HR side) has been lacking. Tax reforms, therefore, will require closer and
more sustained attention of policy makers for quite some time to come. A surge in tax revenue in
FY08 under the CTG did raise the tax-GDP ratio by almost 1 percentage point -- an elusive goal
for many years. Sustaining this improvement will certainly be a formidable challenge.

         Trade liberalization. After several years of reform hiatus, steady progress has been made
on trade liberalization since 2002. Trade policy reforms were necessary to improve the business
environment and enhance competitiveness of Bangladeshi producers in the international market.
This was done through deepening trade liberalization by removing all QRs, and gradually scaling
down nominal and effective protection. Average nominal protection fell from 29.4 percent in
FY02 to 24.3 percent in FY07, then to 21.9% in FY08 and is currently at 20.1%. The reduction
in nominal protection was accompanied by complete elimination of trade-related QRs. Removal
of a longstanding ban on a wide range of textile imports in the FY06 budget was particularly
significant. In addition, authorities further liberalized the exchange regime by free floating of the
Taka in May 2003. Benefiting from these liberalization measures, the ratio of trade to GDP
increased from 28 percent in FY00 to 38 percent in FY06. However, in FY09, average nominal
protection was reduced by cutting back rates on raw materials, capital goods, and intermediates,
while leaving the top rate in tact. That, in effect, has raised effective protection to import
substitutes, thus contravening the very objective of reducing tariff rates.

         Notwithstanding this progress, the remaining trade liberalizing agenda remains
substantial. Despite the declining trend, average nominal protection in Bangladesh is the highest
in the region and among the highest in the world. This, together with cumbersome trade
facilitation procedures, an inefficient duty drawback system, and severe infrastructure bottlenecks
at the port, has resulted in the anti-export bias leveling off at relatively high levels since the late
1990s. This works against the emergence of new export activities and expansion of the export
activities in non-RMG products. Bangladesh's export orientation compares unfavorably with
other Asian economies, and its export base is heavily concentrated in the garments sector--RMG
exports account for about 75 percent of merchandise exports--where the extent of the anti-export
bias is much lower because of the duty-free environment it is accorded.

         State-owned Enterprises. An important element in the Government's I-PRSP and PRSP
to improve the climate for private sector-led growth was the complete withdrawal of the state
from participating in manufacturing activity and significantly reducing the adverse impact of
SOEs on the economy. The DSC program set the goal of reducing financial losses of SOEs by
scaling down the state's role, strengthening their financial performance, and sticking to a hard
budget constraint. In July 2002, the Government opportunistically closed Adamjee Jute Mills
(AJM), the largest jute mill in the world, employing about 25,000 workers and accounting for
about 10 percent of annual SOE losses. The Government successfully negotiated the terms of
closure with the workers and their unions, including a retrenchment package that had been
designed to minimize social dislocation caused by the layoffs. These VRS schemes were
supported under IDA's concurrent project, Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization (EGBM).
AJM has now been converted into a fully functional and vibrant Export Processing Zone with a
potential for creating 100,000 jobs, of which 6,724 have already been created.

         This, and the Government's apparent willingness to close more SOEs, offered the
requisite signal for the DSC to incorporate a program of closures and privatization of SOEs.
However, procedural challenges proved far too great. So, rather than setting target numbers of
privatization, over time, the Bank chose to move at the speed with which the government could


                                                 9

resolve the procedural challenges. The pragmatic approach was to stick to hard budget constraints
and progressively call for reduction of SOE losses ­ an approach taken in the later DSCs.

        Ownership of this aspect of reform did not go deep enough, though a section of
policymakers thought it was right for the government to get out of the business of running
industries, such as jute, textiles, and the like. But political opposition to wider privatization was
too strong for the government to stick to any schedule of divestment with the result that, under
DSC, progress achieved was modest relative to the initial target.

        Power sector. Power sector reforms were a critical component of the overall DSC
program. World Bank's ICA repeatedly identified poor quality power supply as a binding
constraint on economic growth. Firms surveyed reported persistent supply issues, significant
losses of production and sales, and great frustration with the corruption associated with the sector.
According to the ICA, shortfalls in electricity could be costing the country two percentage points
of growth per year.

By 2003, power shortages emerged, with growing demand outstripping supply and generation
capacity. Yet reform progress in the power sector has been extremely slow while Bangladesh was
slipping into a power crisis of major proportions.

        The DSC program sought to improve availability of power and enhance efficiency of the
sector. The following actions were embedded:

    · Passing Energy Regulatory Commission Act, setting up BERC and making it effective
    · Adopting a pricing formula for gas, power, petroleum, and fertilizer
    · Restructure debts/arrears of power entities
    · Adopt a 3-year Power Sector Reform Plan

        While the efficiency of the power sector was improved somewhat and some measure of
financial restructuring accomplished, no additional capacity was generated through independent
power producers (IPPs) by the end of 2008. In order to attract private investors into public
biddings for an IPP, the balance sheets of power sector entities needed to be improved first. There
were some successes and significant failures. System loss was reduced from 29% to 21% and
collection efficiency improved. Arrears came down from over 14 months to 3 months equivalent,
but the balance sheet of BPDB ­ still a public entity -- deteriorated, with losses mounting to Taka
9 billion in FY08 compared to an operating surplus of Tk. 1.6 billion in FY02.

        By 2007 the groundwork was laid for a transparent process of procuring a new IPP plant.
A least-cost generation plan was adopted; and a reputable international transactions adviser was
recruited. However, the bidding process remained tainted until the CTG took office. No IPP
contract cold be awarded as of 2008. In addition, no significant capacity was added to the grid by
rehabilitating older plants due to gas shortages that emerged since 2005. The additional capacity
to be created by the small power plants (SPP) will only come into operation by June 09.

        The main achievements of the DSC program could be described as:

    · The establishment and operationalization of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory
        Commission (BERC), which is playing the lead role in setting tariffs, issuing licenses,
        and providing regulatory oversight.
    · Corporatization of several generation, transmission, and distribution companies
    · Introducing transparency in the public bidding process of power plants.

        Over the course of the DSC operations, progress on triggers was uneven, though some
aspects of the program were notably successful and have proven sustainable. In reality, more was
achieved under DSC IV than was possible throughout the course of DSC I-III. Nevertheless, the
program did help GOB advance on several important policy and regulatory issues including
captive generation policy, IPP development, and generation financing.             This record of
performance reflects the wide, multi-sectoral scope of the DSC program, but also the deep-rooted
and complex problems that need to be addressed in the energy sector. For these reasons, one of
the conclusions of the DSC program was that in future, energy sector reform would be best
served by a separate, sector DPC operation.

        The outcome was Bank support for Power Sector DPC of $120 million and financing of a
public power plant ($250 million Siddhirganj 350MW power plant), the loan for which has been
approved in FY08.

        Energy pricing. At the outset, the DSC targeted financial restructuring of the energy
sector by improving the financial viability of the power and gas sectors and paring down the
losses of BPC, the public petroleum monopoly. In the end, this target appeared unrealistic for lack
of political ownership. Although under DSC I the government did agree and adopt a pricing
framework for petroleum, gas and power, the actual implementation never came about.
Subsequent adjustments in petroleum prices, and modest revisions of power and gas tariffs, were
ad hoc and inadequate. It never resolved the financial insolvency of the energy entities. The
rationale for energy pricing revision also lay in the government's fiscal sustainability which was
supported by IMF's PRGF.          Regardless of the economic justification, creeping inflation
domestically since FY03 made it difficult for the government to accept a pass-through of rising
global oil prices. Eventually, energy pricing framework thus disappeared from the DSC and
PRGF radar. The saving grace was the transfer, under the CTG, of BPC losses from quasi-fiscal
operations on to the budget, thus bringing transparency to the state obligation.

        Telecommunications. At the turn of the century, Bangladesh lagged behind all South
Asian countries in terms of the coverage and quality of telecommunication services. Competition
and private investment were limited and tariff levels were distorted. The DSC program aimed at
improving the availability and enhancing the efficiency of telecommunication services, mainly by
corporatizing and restructuring the publicly-owned monopoly, Bangladesh Telegraph and
Telephone Board (BTTB), and by introducing competition in local and long distance services
through appropriate changes in the law.

        Bangladesh has seen major progress towards the creation of a competitive and efficient
telecommunications sector. The BTTB was restructured into a public limited company -- BTCL.
BTRC has been operationalized and made effective. New private operators have entered the
market and teledensity has increased significantly. The cost of fixed and mobile phone calls,
including national and international long-distance calls, has declined due to competition. The
mobile phone market has seen a rapid expansion with the entry of six operators, including a
public-owned company. In 2008, the number of mobile users in the country reached 40 million.

       To summarize, it is fair to say that a lot of development diplomacy was involved in
converting a highly ambitious reform agenda into a more pragmatic package that contained
enough critical mass to still make an impact. For instance, ensuring a hard budget constraint was
found more practical and sustainable than obtaining closure or privatization of all SOEs.
Likewise, more traction was gained through a trimmed version of banking reforms which
nevertheless delivered lasting results in the financial sector

2.2    Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

       During the two years of the CTG, decision on reforms and their implementation
appeared to be quick as a result of strong ownership of the government. It is not yet clear
whether this trend will be sustained as there is considerable uncertainty about ownership
within the two major political parties. Even civil society has traditionally shied away from
playing an advocacy role when it comes to Bank programs.

       One major factor that needs to be taken on board while crafting the reform agenda
and its implementation format is the antagonistic and highly confrontational relationship
between the two major political parties. Observers of Bangladesh society believe this
antagonism prevents Bangladesh from reaching its full potential as a functioning democracy.



                                                    15

Shrill political differences, often manifest in violent clashes, preclude any sort of debate or
political consensus on reforms from emerging: As a result, reform measures, rather than gaining
momentum, have been stymied for lack of entry points. The new government, which won a
sweeping mandate on a "charter of change", might bring fresh opportunities to the table.

        Reforms ­ especially difficult ones -- tend to have the greatest chance of success if
undertaken in the early months/years of the tenure of a political government in power. That is
when elections are not in the radar screen of policymakers and there is greater willingness to take
firm actions despite political opposition. DSC III was delayed largely due to political sensitivities
relating to several prior actions, e.g. effectiveness of ACC, divestment of Rupali Bank,
privatization of SOEs, energy price adjustments, and corporatization of BTTB. With elections
scheduled for January 2007, the incumbents were unwilling to handle any reforms that appeared
to be politically unpopular.

        One notable factor to be recognized in Bangladesh government agencies or SOEs is
opposition from within which tends to get reinforced with the help of political connections.
Examples of internal resistance to reforms may be found in NBR, jute and textile mills owned by
the government, and also in former NCBs. Besides fending off political opposition (could be from
ruling party workers or opposition), in these instances there is also the challenge of overcoming
internal resistance that could undermine reform efforts.

        A weak governance environment is among the most important constraints hindering
development in Bangladesh and the political will to tackle it will shape the success of future
reform efforts. While progress has been made in some areas of economic governance during the
DSC period - especially due to improvements in the macroeconomic management, banking
sector, procurement, and state-owned enterprises - the unfinished agenda remains large. The
Government's capacity to tackle these issues is very limited. The civil service remains
relatively low-quality and lacks proper motivation because of a weak incentive system, while the
Government has extremely low resources at its disposal because of weak revenue generation
capacity. The highly centralized political and administrative system weakens capacity to deliver
and monitor service delivery. The new Government, however, has expressed its commitment to
tackle these issues under a strong mandate for change.


        External factors can also influence incentive for reforms or their implementation. Since
2003 the rise in petroleum prices and, subsequently, the onset of a global commodity price
inflation, made the government unwilling to go for anything but minor adjustments to kerosene
or diesel prices. It judged that full energy price adjustments would be too painful and politically
difficult. Prior to the budgetary provisions made by the CTG in 2008, the Bangladesh
Petroleum Company continued to suffer financially from artificially low diesel and kerosene
prices and interest on its mounting debt. By FY08, BPC's accumulated losses were approaching
$1 billion or close to 2% of GDP, and rising. This situation was not sustainable. Nevertheless, all
the gas and fuel price adjustments during 2004 and 2005 did not fully reflect international price
changes, nor did the government implement an automatic pricing formula, due to the concerns
for giving impetus to imported price inflation. The situation has changed dramatically since July
2008, with petroleum prices plummeting and giving BPC some windfall profits for a change.

        Finally, timing is critical. The Bank ought to be commended for their preparedness to
support a broad-based reform program should the political leadership so decide. Knowing full
well that reform momentum is strongest at the early stage of a government's tenure, Bank AAA
like Policy Notes for the Next Government identified key policies and sector issues that needed to



                                                 16

be addressed by the new government on a priority basis. These short policy notes laid the ground
for informed dialogue between the Bank and GOB leaders in articulating an agenda for action
that then came to be supported by a programmatic operation ­ the DSC.

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

         Programmatic operations, with one-tranche release of funds, have to take on board
completion of prior actions at the start of each operation. Each DSC was therefore preceded by
agreed reforms that were carried out to the satisfaction of IDA. Furthermore, a Medium-Term
Structural Program Matrix FY04-08 was formulated with outcomes and monitorable indicators. It
is true that sometimes agreement on prior actions had to be reached on a scaled down version of
proposed reform actions in light of what was considered doable within the time frame. Again, it is
also a fact that while prior actions were met, some quantitative indicators were not met at the
conclusion of DSC IV, although there was progress towards the goals. For example, while
quantitative targets in respect of deepening trade liberalization were met, the goals of higher
revenue/GDP ratio remained unfulfilled, as prior actions were largely scaled down versions of the
original reforms intended for revenue administration.

         By far the most successful aspect of the reform envelope was the maintenance of the
macroeconomic framework tied to the requirements of IMF's PRGF. Prior to each operation,
there was adequate information exchange between the MOF and Bank staff on various
quantitative targets the compliance of which provided the preconditions for moving with the next
operation. Data on most macroeconomic aggregates are readily available on websites of
Bangladesh Bank or MOF, and closely monitored by IMF and Bank staff on a regular basis.

         Perhaps it was not by accident but by design that MOF took the role of coordinating the
reform agenda across ministries and government agencies. Traditionally, the Minister of Finance
is the seniormost member of the cabinet and wields a lot of influence in the highest level of
government decision making. Likewise, the Finance Secretary is usually the seniormost
bureaucrat having a lot of leverage over his colleagues by virtue of holding the purse. As such,
MOF played the coordinating role and often effectively mediated between the Bank team and
implementing agencies in getting traction on difficult reforms.

         The sustained attention by the bank throughout the DSC series to key elements related to
macroeconomic stability, procurement, banking, and the power sector has been the strongest
aspect of monitoring. DSC III document lays down with utmost clarity the tracking of progress
against the approved triggers. The capacity of accountability institutions was also assessed very
well.

         The ultimate goal of the reform program envisaged under the DSC operations was to
create conditions for accelerating growth and reducing poverty. Monitoring progress on this front
required improving the capacity of the key monitoring institutions and improving the quality of
information systems. In recent years, capacity improvement in monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
has occurred along multiple dimensions. Technical assistance from the World Bank, including an
ongoing Institutional Development Facility grant, has helped BBS improve the survey quality and
speed of data processing over successive rounds of HIES. The capacity of BBS to measure and
analyze poverty has benefited from close on-the-job collaboration with the Bank. A number of
training courses and workshops--some administered by the World Bank Institute--have further
enhanced the analytical capacity at BBS as well as other government departments and
nongovernment think tanks. The Government wishes to continue upgrading the capacity for
M&E, with necessary support from development partners. While continuing with the current



                                               17

technical support on poverty monitoring and analysis, the Bank is also expanding its assistance to
BBS. A new subproject for BBS under EMTAP proposes to help design systems to monitor (a)
welfare indicators and correlates of consumption poverty more frequently than currently possible,
and (b) labor market indicators annually rather than the current practice of every 3­4 years
through the Labor Force Survey.

2.4      Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation

         The DSC program ended with the signing of the fourth operation, DSC IV, in June 2007.
To sustain the momentum of reforms initiated, two supplemental financing arrangements had to
be devised in quick succession (September and December, 2007) to compensate for shocks
emanating from global commodity price escalation and natural disasters in the form of cyclones
and floods that played havoc on the economy and its people. Record shows that the reform
momentum continued, especially when the two-year transitional caretaker government (CTG)
was proactive in completing many unfinished reforms (e.g. NCB restructuring, transparency in
bidding process for power plants) and making progress on others (e.g. regulatory streamlining).

         Budget support operations like the DSC have gained popularity amongst key decision-
makers in Government. The new Government that took power in early January 2009 has shown
interest in moving forward with more budget support operations. In launching such operations, it
is worthwhile to keep in mind that reforms cannot be brought to fruition unless there is "real"
ownership of the borrower rather than an opportunistic response to Bank-formulated triggers.
Experience of DSC series suggests that interest in such operations might not necessarily imply
their genuine ownership of the reform agenda embedded in a programmatic operation. Real
commitment to reforms ­ or some component thereof -- could be paper thin especially if they are
formulated without full participation of the key stakeholders..

         Given that the new Government in its Election Manifesto has committed to revise the
PRS-II formulated by the CTG after a thorough evaluation within six months of assuming office,
the next budget operation is likely to be a PRSC. Ownership concerns notwithstanding, there is
little doubt that the unfinished reform agenda remains vast. Key reform actions in the
Government's medium-term policy matrix that could be considered for support under such an
operation include the following:

· Trade liberalization. Since Bangladesh continues to have one of the most restrictive trade
     regimes in the world, there is scope for further deepening trade liberalization. Other reform
     issues include: (i) substantial progress on merger of remaining supplementary duties with
     existing customs duty rates, ensuring one tariff rate for each tariff line. (ii) substantial
     progress on elimination of protective use of VAT. (iii) continued phased reduction in average
     nominal protection rates.

· Banking Sector Reforms. A large reform agenda looms in the state-owned banking sector,
     particularly with respect to divestment of NCBs. However, the painful and protracted
     experience of sale of Rupali Bank well before the financial crisis pointed to the fact that the
     implementation of divestment has high risk of failure. In light of the global financial crisis,
     the proposed banking sector reform needs major rethinking. Clearly, the prospect of further
     divestment and privatization of NCBs does not look very realistic for the coming months, if
     not years, if aimed primarily for sale to international banks.

· Public Expenditure Management.            (i) Extension of the pilot MTBF approach to more
     ministries. (ii) Increased role of high-level decision makers in budget planning through the
     operationalization of the Budget Management Committees.



                                                  18

· Public Financial Management. (i) Phased implementation of the PFMIP. (ii) Establishment
    in line ministries of planning and budgeting wings and functional financial management units
    within them.

· Procurement Reforms. (i) Establishment of an electronic government procurement system at
    CPTU, and piloting of the system at key agencies such as RHD, LGED, REB, BPDB,
    BWDB. (ii) Strengthening of CPTU with appropriate staffing and infrastructure.

· Tax Administration. (i) Creation of three new member positions at the NBR Board, to take
    charge of the functional responsibilities of audit, ICT, and HR that have temporarily been
    assigned to existing members. (ii) Establishment of a unique taxpayer identification number
    for both Income Tax and VAT. (iii) full automation of export and import cargo clearance
    including remote DTI facilities.

· Macroeconomic Stability. Adherence to the macroeconomic framework agreed with the
    IMF. Further monetary tightening to ward off inflationary pressures, full adjustment of
    energy prices to their cost recovery levels to bring energy companies to at least a break even
    point, and continued flexible use of exchange rates to cope with external pressures.

· Power Sector Reforms. (i) Implementation of the FRP, including by completing financial
    restructuring of power sector companies and ensuring BPDB's full financial recovery. (ii)
    Enabling private investment in power generation through a fair, transparent, and competitive
    bidding process, adhering to least-cost principles. (iii) completion of the Generation
    Financing Strategy.

· Governance Reforms. (i) Improve regulatory environment for the private sector; (ii) develop
    an effective competition policy; (iii) reduce administrative barriers; (iv) establish policies
    friendly to foreign direct investment; and (v) deepen financial and banking sector reforms.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

         The Bank's support under the DSC series ­ focusing on core governance reforms and
improving the investment climate for private sector growth ­ is in line with the Government's
priorities as laid down in the I-PRSP and PRSP documents. GOB's emphasis in the I-PRSP
(2003-06) was on (a) accelerating pro-poor growth, (b) improving governance to sustain high
growth, and (c) human development. While GOB's human development priority in education and
health was covered under separate IDA programs, such as the Education Sector DSC, PEDP-II,
and HNPSP multi-donor SWAP, DSC series targeted improving core governance and the
investment climate for accelerating growth and reducing poverty, which was also consistent with
on-going CAS pillars for 2001-04. The 2006-09 CAS, with its focus on improving the investment
climate and empowering the poor, also recognized core governance as the principal challenge for
attaining the poverty and human development goals set out in the MDG and endorsed by the
Government's PRSP.

         Thus the Bank's country support programs were consistent with the Government's plans
and priorities. The DSC program played a critical role in improving macroeconomic management
and ensuring that economy's internal and external balances are within sustainable limits.
Financial sector reforms put the banking and financial sectors on a sound footing that prevented
Bangladesh from being embroiled in the immediate effects of the 2008 global financial




                                               19

meltdown. Improvements in public expenditure and public financial management have helped to
check corruption and reduced leakage and wastage in use of public resources.

DSC I:

Rating: Satisfactory

         Being the first in the series, formulation of prior actions and triggers required
considerable reflection and analysis by Bank staff and key policy makers. The original agenda
had to be trimmed in light of ground realities in Bangladesh. Yet what was achieved through this
first DSC could be termed substantive: legislation establishing an independent Anti-Corruption
Commission, commencement of procurement reforms, independence of the central bank in
monetary and exchange rate policies and bank supervision (including NCBs), and closure of the
largest jute mill with VRS support provided under EGBM.

DSC II:

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

         As the reform program progressed, the Bank continued to pursue the most difficult areas
such as energy sector and SOE reform, and anti-corruption measures. But progress on these two
fronts was marginal, at best. While the government of the day said they were committed to anti-
corruption, they did not walk the talk. Likewise, in the energy sector, although legislation for
setting up the Energy Regulatory Commission was passed, financial restructuring in that sector
remained unfulfilled. However, internal discussions and feedback from government counterparts
indicated that the Bank had initially put up too tall an agenda that had little chance of success. As
such, the Bank team found it more practical to demonstrate flexibility in accepting moderate
rather than full realization of reforms in respect of anti-corruption measures and energy sector
activities. Modest progress was made in financial sector reforms and public administration (e.g.
outsourcing of support services), and preparations began in formulating a FOIA.

DSC III:

Rating: Satisfactory

         After two successful DSC operations, the Bank had gained sufficient experience to
nuance the targeting of difficult reforms. For instance, following some tough decisions on closure
of large state-owned enterprises, such as Adamjee Jute Mill, concern had emerged about
inadequate growth in employment and the paucity of good and willing investors, causing a more
cautious implementation of privatization and closures of sick industries. Again, after pursuing a
plan for privatization of all four NCBs, the Bank realized the enormity of the task and settled for
privatization of the smallest bank and corporatization and restructuring of the others. Significant
progress was made in trade liberalization when the government agreed to wipe the slate clean of
QRs, even removing the ban on textile imports, a ban that existed since independence. These
cases illustrated the need to approach reform implementation more pragmatically than the
textbook approach would justify. This strategy yielded positive dividends in terms of outcome in
a difficult political environment with elections on the horizon.




                                                20

DSC IV:

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

         In January, 2007, a caretaker government (CTG) led by technocrat ministers, had
replaced the democratically elected political government. Bank experience worldwide suggests
difficult reforms are easier managed under such governments though sustainability could be
tenuous. Such was the case with most prior actions under DSC IV, which got done fairly rapidly.
Indeed, the CTG went beyond the listed reform actions taking the initiative for broader reforms in
institution and governance: e.g. separation of judiciary from executive, Freedom of Information
Act, several electoral reforms, effective improvements in procurement and bidding for large
public projects. In respect of anti-corruption, the ACC went on overdrive with remarkable results
as was evident in Bangladesh coming out of the top ten countries ranked by TIB's corruption
perception index. While recognizing the role of CTG in giving traction to some reforms, it must
also be acknowledged that, in Bangladesh, many challenging reforms ­ such as privatization,
deregulation and trade openness -- were initiated and implemented under elected governments.
Evidence shows that these reforms ­ though partial in content ­ have been more sustainable in the
long run.

3.2      Achievement of Program Development Objectives:

Objective 1: Ensuring macroeconomic stability.

         The overarching theme of the DSC program was to create and maintain a stable
macroeconomic framework which is critical for accelerating economic growth. The program was
bolstered contemporaneously by the IMF's PRGF which ran concurrently until conclusion of
DSC IV (June 2007).

         This goal was achieved by adhering to prudent expenditure levels, enhanced revenue
mobilization, restricting fiscal deficits to reasonable levels, and capping domestic financing
requirements. Consequently, public debt outstanding and debt service ratios remained within
moderate levels throughout.

         Bangladesh maintained an impressive overall record of macroeconomic stability during
FY03-08, broadly in line with program objectives, marked by an upward growth trend; fiscal and
external sustainability and cautious monetary management. GDP growth, which accelerated from
4.4% in FY02 to 6.2% in FY08, has been broad-based, cutting across all major economic sectors
and benefiting from robust demand in both domestic and export markets. Enhanced revenue
mobilization was one goal that remained persistently short of target. This was compensated by
shortfalls in ADP implementation, resulting in constrained fiscal deficits which remained within
target.

Objective 2: Improving transparency and efficiency of public expenditure and financial
management

         This objective was pursued through a more accountable and transparent public
procurement system (PPR) with low level of corruption, strengthened financial accountability and
improved resource management and control within line ministries (MTBF), and reduced
expenditure leakages and improved quality of services.




                                                 21

         This part of the reform package is still on-going, though substantial progress has occurred
already with 14 ministries already within the MTBF framework, and greater transparency
achieved in the overall procurement process. Yet it would be naïve to expect that corruption
levels in public procurement are significantly down due to the PPR law and regulations.
However, evidence suggests that the PPR might be too stringent resulting in a deleterious impact
on project implementation. Whether it is due to a steep learning curve, or lack of incentives from
closing of corruption opportunities, or sheer indecision of project managers, is still to be seen.

Objective 3: Strengthening and modernizing revenue mobilization

         Efforts were made throughout the DSC program to introduce significant changes in
revenue administration. A Strategic Development Plan was drafted and the Bank provided
technical assistance for implementation of certain key components such as changing NBR
management from a tax-by-tax organization to a functional system. There was intense
cooperation amongst Bank, IMF and DFID, in assisting NBR to bring about change in its
organizational structure.

         Achievements in core NBR reforms turned out to be minimal and sporadic, at best,
largely due to lack of appropriate leadership for a good length of time. Stubborn internal
resistance to any change of the status quo made progress on critical reforms difficult.

Objective 4: Improving governance and efficiency of the financial system

         Governance of the financial system has been significantly improved through legislative
changes that strengthen the role of the central bank, both in the conduct of exchange rate and
monetary policy and in the supervision of banks. Bangladesh went to a floating rate in May 2003
though the central bank does intervene to ensure the orderliness of exchange rate changes. A
major example of the central bank's increased power is its purview over the NCBs and SDBs that
it gained from the amendments to the Banking Companies Act, a core condition of the DSC.
NCB assets have decreased from 47% of total financial sector assets in 2002, to about 30 percent
currently.

         The DSC reforms were a step towards a market-based financial sector resulting in a more
viable and efficient system of financial intermediation.

Objective 5: Improving the business environment and competitiveness.

         Apart from attempting to restructure the financial sector, the DSC program sought to
improve the business environment by enhancing competitiveness. This was to be done by
deepening trade liberalization though the removal of all QRs and gradual reduction of nominal
and effective protection.

         At the end of the program, we find complete elimination of all QRs, flexible exchange
rates to uphold export incentives and competitiveness, and generally lower trade protection.

Objective 6: Reducing state role in SOEs and strengthening their financial performance

         In the early years of the DSC, the Government demonstrated its commitment to divesting
itself from the manufacturing sector. Most notable was the closure of three large, state-owned
jute mills, including the largest (Adamjee, which was losing an estimated $15-20 million per
year) with over 25,000 workers. Although severance costs were quite high ($70-80 million for


                                                 22

Adamjee alone and approaching $200 million overall, supported through IDA's EGBM project),
long term savings will far outweigh the short-term costs. Since the closures, the value of annual
production and exports of jute have nearly maintained levels of recent years, indicating that there
had been a large excess capacity in the sector.

         There was concern that the Privatization Commission has had limited effectiveness, in
part due to the fact that it deals only with operating SOEs, while the line ministries, which have
limited expertise in privatization, are handling the closed SOEs. In response, the Government has
adopted guidelines to delineate the responsibilities of the Privatization Commission and line
Ministries for the liquidation of the closed SOEs.

Objective 7: Addressing governance constraints to energy infrastructure

         The goal was to move towards an efficient and financially viable energy sector. The
reform of this sector is particularly important to fiscal sustainability because losses and leakage in
this sector are substantial. It is also important to reduce losses and leakage in order to gain public
compliance with paying cost recovery tariffs (where individual consumers pay higher rates).
While some steps were taken toward achieving these objectives, implementation has fallen far
short with scheduled price increases not instituted.

         A major achievement in this sector is the setting up and operationalization of the Energy
Regulatory Commission (ERC), though much of the progress has taken place during the tenure of
the CTG (DSC IV). There was little headway under DSC I-III albeit it can be said that some
groundwork got done so that BERC and other institutional reforms could move fast subsequently.
The BERC ­ still facing obstacles and challenges from the political leadership -- is asserting its
independence and is expected to ensure progress toward better governance in an important sector
of the economy.

         Energy pricing goal remained largely unfulfilled. Petroleum pricing formula indicated
under DSC was never implemented; gas and power tariffs were partially adjusted without
conforming to any logical economic principles. The rationale of macroeconomic sustainability
foundered on the anvil of prohibitive political costs of the measure. In relative terms, the CTG
made more significant adjustment in petroleum prices, gas and power tariffs, than was done in all
the years since DSC I.

Objective 8: Establishing and operationalizing an independent Anti-Corruption
Commission

         This objective was partly met prior under DSC II-III, when the Commission was indeed
set up but its staffing and operations fell far short of what was intended. With the coming of the
CTG, this Commission was able to go into high gear with significant impact on curbing grand
corruption at the national level.

Objective 9: Enhancing the performance of the judicial system

         The strategic requirement for achieving this objective was the separation of the judiciary
from the executive ­ an action promised by previous political governments but never fulfilled.
This was done fairly early in the tenure of the CTG and necessary steps are on to complete the
various formalities in the operationalization of this historic decision.




                                                 23

Objective 10: Improving availability and enhancing efficiency of telecommunication
services

         The DSC program aimed at improving the availability and enhancing the efficiency of
telecommunication services, mainly by corporatizing and restructuring the publicly-owned
monopoly, Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB), and by introducing competition
in local and long distance services.

         Bangladesh has seen major progress towards the creation of a competitive and efficient
telecommunications sector. The BTTB was restructured into a public limited company -- BTCL.
New private operators have entered the market and teledensity has increased. The cost of fixed
and mobile phone calls, including national and international long-distance calls, has declined due
to competition. The mobile phone market has seen a rapid expansion with the entry of six
operators, including a public-owned company. In 2008, the number of mobile users in the country
reached 40 million.

         It is relevant to point out that the whole package of policies supported under the DSC
program could fall under the rubric of what is now described as Washington Consensus Plus. It
goes beyond the earlier adjustment programs that emphasized macroeconomic stability,
privatization, deregulation, and trade liberalization. Those were the focus of Bank support in
Bangladesh in the early 1980s (modest reforms) and, subsequently, in the early 1990s (more
vigorous). This time around, governance and institutional reforms have been part of the core
reform agenda. This departure from the past seems to be in line with the thinking of economists
like Sir Nicholas Stern, who argued that there was nothing wrong with the Washington
Consensus except that it ignored the role of institutions in achieving the objectives of economic
policy reform.

3.3      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating:

         Rating: The overall rating of the program is satisfactory. This assessment is made
despite the fact that the entire reform agenda was not completed. It is also true that often, prior
actions were completed in letter, though not in spirit. In assessing a broad-based program such as
the DSC, which involved complex sector reforms as well as cross-cutting governance and
institutional reforms, it is important to keep in mind what is realistically achievable in the
Bangladesh context of inertia in the status quo. Reforms happen in Bangladesh in small steps.
And it did, under the DSC program.

3.4      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts:

(a)      Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

         Government's poverty reduction strategy (PRS) rested on a policy triangle involving pro-
poor economic growth, human development and good governance. With the help of a series of
interlocking and sequenced policy reforms, the DSC series supported the Government's strategy
to foster poverty alleviation by targeting critical reforms in core areas of governance by (a)
improving economic management with the goal of maintaining macroeconomic stability, (b)
improving the budget formulation and execution process, (c) reforming tax administration, (d)
helping establish regulatory commissions in energy and telecommunications, and (e) establishing
and strengthening the Anti-Corruption Commission. The other focus of DSC reforms was on
improving the investment climate which would create conditions for private sector to create jobs
and drive pro-poor growth. Reform areas covered under this included (a) further trade


                                               24

liberalization, (b) restructuring banking and energy sectors, and (c) privatizing state-owned
enterprises. Although the human development component of the government strategy was not
directly addressed in the DSC series, these were complemented by another concurrent series of
adjustment credits for the education sector ­ three Education Sector DSCs during 2003-05 -- that
supported reform measures in secondary education with the goal of enhancing governance and
improving the quality and relevance of secondary education.

         Together, these reforms made significant contribution in raising GDP growth rate to 6
percent per annum during the entire period of the DSC program (FY04-08). These developments
along with the relatively stable inequality helped Bangladesh to make good progress in reducing
poverty in the recent years. Poverty declined by an annual rate of 1.8 percent during 2000 to
2005, compared to a rate of poverty reduction during 1990-99 which was about 1 percent per
annum. Natural calamities and food price shocks have slowed down the progress in reducing
poverty since 2007. Still Bangladesh appears to be on track to achieve the Millennium
Development Goal of halving the number of people living in poverty from the 1990 level by 2015
if the current growth performance continues.

         Although gender and social development aspects were not directly addressed by the DSC
reforms, its IDA complement, ESDSC, did contribute to achieving significant progress in
ensuring gender parity in secondary enrollment. Furthermore, the package of reforms under
ESDSC which aimed at improving system governance and teacher quality have attracted poor
children to school, thus raising the prospects for better labor market outcomes and also higher
social returns to their schooling.

(b)      Institutional Change/Strengthening:

         Critiques of the Washington Consensus had argued that macroeconomic stability,
privatization, deregulation, and trade liberalization, might be good objectives to strive for, but
without complementary institutions, such reforms were doomed to failure. Therefore, unlike past
adjustment support (e.g. ISAC I & II), the DSC program fully recognized the importance of
institutional changes for making reforms sustainable. Core governance reforms were an essential
component of the program agenda. Bank analytical research also showed that Bangladesh
economy was deprived of nearly two percentage points of growth due to the deep-rooted nature
of corruption in society. Thus setting up the Anti-Corruption Commission, Bangladesh Energy
Regulatory Commission, passing the Freedom of Information Act, and the Procurement Act, were
key components of the DSC program. Institutional reforms or changes implemented through the
program included:

         Some changes, like the separation of judiciary from the executive, did not happen
because of the requirements of DSC, but because the CTG took the bold step in fulfilling a long-

felt need of the people, an issue that was scuttled by past political governments. True, the reform
agenda was not completed. But the glass is half full, rather than half empty. There have been
changes that can be summed up as substantial.

(c)      Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts:

         (Positive) Though SOE privatization was only partially implemented, corporatization of
NCBs and bringing them under the supervision of BB made application of hard budget constraint
a reality. SOEs have come to terms with the idea that they will not have the support of the
Finance Ministry in meeting their wage bills. Consequently, there has been rationalization of
personnel and scaling down of wage bills in all SOEs.

         Though closure of the largest jute mill, Adamjee, preceded DSC I, VRS arrangement was
made under the program for some 25000 workers. The premises of Adamjee Jute Mills was
converted into an Export Processing Zone, which has created investments of several hundred
million dollars and companies have already employed over 6,000 workers, with the potential for
employing 100,000 when the entire EPZ is fully operational.

         Substantial in-house capacity in handling macroeconomic issues has been developed in
the Ministry of Finance since the beginning of the DSC operation. MOF has taken public debt
sustainability more seriously and constituted a debt management unit. MOF has spearheaded two
recent Ordinances on its own: Public Monies and Budget Management Ordinance 2008, to give
legal cover to MTBF; and Financial Reporting Ordinance 2008, which would govern financial
activities of corporate entities.

         (Negative) The Bank has taken a lot of flack for supporting closure of state-owned jute
and textile mills under DSC. Though golden handshakes were given out with DSC monies, the
fact that alternative employment was not available for most retrenched workers and it was
difficult to show direct job creation in other areas in consequence of the DSC programs, these
retrenchment programs remained highly unpopular giving vent to populist opinion that the Bank
was creating poverty rather than reducing it. Another allegation that was frequently labeled
against the Bank was that while it supported closure of jute mills in Bangladesh, it was promoting
jute industry in India with financial support.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

         Broadly speaking, there are four possible risks to development outcomes: political risk,
whereby actions initiated by the previous government is reversed or cancelled; fiduciary risks
arising from fungibility of funds for budget support; risks from capacity constraints; and
economic risks.

         Political Risks. The sustainability of the DSC reforms and processes that were set in
motion lies in the approach taken by the newly elected government that assumed power in
January 2009. Though politics have been confrontational between the two political adversaries,


                                                26

when it comes to economic policies, there is no fundamental difference in approach. Therefore,
one should not expect complete reversal of most reforms. However, since the government is
actively reviewing all Ordinances (120 of them) passed by the CTG (all of which are subject to
ratification by the current government), some of which might be related to reform initiatives, it
would not be surprising to see some instances of cancellation. Vulnerable to such government
action are reforms like passing of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), reopening of state-
owned jute mills, scaling down of public corporations like BCIC, BADC, BSFIC. Impartial
observers of the scene feel sustainability of some reforms could be at stake because of lack of
ownership and inadequate involvement of broad-based political community and key stakeholders.
Fortunately, both major parties agree on the broad reform priorities. In addition, to influence the
sustainability and deepening of the reforms, the timing, scale, and scope of future budget support
operations would be linked to continued commitment of the Government to the reform process.

         Fiduciary Risks. Fungibility of funds implies that budgetary resources may be diverted
or misused, which poses a particular risk to programmatic operations.             The Government,
however, has a good record of allocating public spending to key development sectors, including
social spending and infrastructure. To further mitigate the risk, auditing arrangements and
financial management within government ministries are being strengthened with DFID's
assistance (FMRP). The new procurement law and its implementation rules should further reduce
the scope for misuse of budgetary funds in contracting. External oversight by the C&AG's office
is also being strengthened. These measures should mitigate the overall fiduciary risks associated
with the performance of the PFM systems. To enhance the safeguard framework, Bangladesh
Bank has started strengthening its financial management with support from the IMF and the IDA-
financed Central Bank Strengthening Project.

         Implementation capacity risks. Implementation capacity is a serious bottleneck in
Bangladesh, suffering from centralized public administration and unsatisfactory performance of
the civil service. Decentralization of responsibilities to local governments will help, but this
process will take time. Ongoing reforms in public administration to strengthen civil service
incentives and quality, accountability and training will be useful.           The Bank and other
development partners are also providing technical assistance to strengthen capacities in a number
of core areas of economic management including banking, taxation, the budgetary process, and
the energy sector.

         Economic Risks. The main economic risk stems from the weak financial condition of
SOEs, especially those in the energy sector. Sustained large losses at the energy sector SOEs
have led to a build-up of outstanding liabilities at these SOEs and exacerbated the financial
fragilities of the NCBs that are directed to finance their losses. The Bank has worked closely
with GoB on this issue, continually encouraging depoliticization of price adjustment, and
providing on-demand analytical notes to help inform GoB's decision. Authorities have already
responded by implementing power tariff increases in March 2007 and fuel price increases in April
2007 and again in July 2008 to stem losses at BPC and BPDB, respectively. Authorities have also
significantly reduced BPDB's payment arrears to IPPs and stepped up efforts to recover power
utilities' accounts receivables. Further, off budget losses on BPC account have been put on the
budget and the government is providing explicit support from the budget to BPDB to put the
sector back on financial recovery path. Finally, the Government has corporatized the loss-making
national airline, Biman, and has sought technical assistance from the Bank and the IFC to support
this move. Another important source of economic vulnerability is the persistently low tax
mobilization, which severely curtails GoB's ability to provide public goods and services and is a
source of risk to long-term fiscal sustainability. To address this, authorities would need to step up
implementation of the tax administration modernization program (being supported by IDA and



                                                 27

other development partners) along with legislative reforms to correct major tax policy distortions
and strengthening of customs administration.

         The sustainability of the DSC-supported reform program is rated moderate for the
overall program for the immediate and medium terms. There are, however, significant concerns
and some reform measures appear more sustainable than others. The rising level of political
opposition to some of the reforms (e.g., the closure of the three jute mills in Khulna, one of which
was reopened later) has led to delays in financial sector and SOE reforms.

         The Bank has anticipated potential social problems that come with large retrenchments.
If the released workers squander their severance pay, they will be vulnerable. To reduce this risk,
there is a micro-enterprise and counseling component ($10 million) financed by DFID under the
Bank financed EGBM project. The EGBM is a hybrid project that also funds further severance
payments.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1      Bank Performance

         No policy package in Bangladesh can be meaningful unless, at the end of the day, its
focus is on the reduction of poverty that afflicts nearly one-half of Bangladeshis. The DSC series,
in line with the objectives of the CAS, was, therefore, well-founded in its economic and strategic
rationale in its support for the Government's national poverty reduction program.

         At the close of the 1990s, Bank analyses suggested that the fundamental problem in the
financial, energy, and infrastructure sectors was the poor quality of governance coupled with the
absence of some key regulatory institutions. The agenda for reforms was vast and accumulating
over time. Bangladesh experience suggested that reforms had to look for suitable entry points.
The Bank seized the opportunity for progress in some key structural areas, offered by the election
of a reform-leaning Government seeking to raise the country's economic performance and who
willingly sought the Bank's analytic and financial support.

         The new government came to power in October 2001. Though tacit understanding was
reached between GOB and the Bank for going ahead with a programmatic loan, it took nearly 18
months for the two sides to reach agreement on a core set of reforms with prior actions. DSC I
was approved by the Board in June 2003. Clearly, the initial euphoria for wide ranging reforms
gave way to pragmatism on both sides, prompted by capacity constraints and ownership concerns.
For instance, to end mounting losses of BPC which undermined fiscal balance, Bank insisted on
the "implementation" of a pricing formula for adjustment of petroleum prices, followed by
revision of gas and power tariffs. Ultimately, the Bank settled for the government's "adopting the
pricing framework" for DSC I. On banking reforms, the goal of privatizing all four NCBs was
whittled down to just one: Rupali Bank.

         The operation, so designed, was more realistic, and incorporated a set of interlocking and
sequenced policy reforms and actions necessary to raise the country's economic growth rate to 6-
7 percent, with a focus on pro-poor growth and improved core and sectoral governance. The
policy measures, although ambitious in some cases, were achievable and based on significant
policy and technical dialogue with the client and a strong working relationship with the
government counterparts.




                                                28

         Lessons learnt during the first two operations were applied in negotiating the remaining
DSCs. One clear lesson was that if the Government is unwilling to undertake a particular reform,
no amount of conditionality, however sugar-coated that might be, can ensure effective
implementation or achievement of goals. The proposal for energy price adjustments had serious
political ramifications in the context of rising inflation and the Government, including the CTG,
stood their ground. Use of the pricing formula was never made a prior action for any of the later
DSCs.

         Institutional reforms take time to mature and cannot become effective via one-off
measures. Therefore, the sequencing of reforms justifies the programmatic approach in the reform
agenda in order to be politically sustainable. The series of operations have exhibited a consistent
medium term results framework, including a set of outcomes for the overall program, with
specific triggers and prior actions needed to get to the next operation. The Bank also ensured that
no triggers would be included without prior sound analytical work.

         The single tranche operation was appropriate in terms of minimizing the problems faced
by IDA in its past policy oriented operations under which actions promised for the future were
usually not implemented by the Borrower as anticipated. Finally, Bangladesh policymakers, like
in most developing countries, had become tired of loan conditionalities. Hence, the idea of
supporting a set of policies that had already been adopted by the Government seemed like the
right approach, although this reduced the size and coverage of reform agenda targeted.

(a)      Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry (i.e.,      performance   through   lending
phase):

Rating: Satisfactory

         DSC I: The quality at entry was assessed as satisfactory by both the QAG and ICR. The
credit amount was raised from $200 million to $300 million during the process of Board
approval. Though ICR on DSC I did not find the full justification for this change, the reason
could be found in the fact that around this time the Bank's overall lending had reached a historic
low, and the Bank's Board felt that, given Bangladesh's performance in growth and human
development areas and its satisfactory debt levels, there was enough justification for a higher
disbursement. The Bank took measures to ensure borrower ownership of DSC II triggers,
including detailed discussions and negotiations of individual triggers at top levels, including the
Prime Minister and at the Ministry of Finance, as well as public dissemination of the revised
triggers. Indeed, the Bank avoided describing them as conditionalities, referring to them instead
as prior actions or indicative triggers which had inherent qualities of flexibility. The Bank also
coordinated closely with the IMF, in complementing the IMF's PRGF in ensuring a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework and some difficult financial sector reforms.

         DSC II: This operation followed completion of the core reform agenda in DSC I. The
Bank showed both determination and flexibility in helping the Government to pursue a politically
challenging, growth-oriented strategy requiring institutional changes. As the reform program
progressed, the Bank continued to pursue the most difficult areas such as energy sector reform
and anti-corruption measures. But progress on these two fronts was marginal, at best. However,
internal discussions and feedback from government counterparts indicated that the Bank had
initially put up too tall an agenda that had little chance of success. What was finally agreed as
prior actions was a trimmed reform agenda which still fell short of realization in respect of anti-
corruption measures and energy sector activities.




                                                29

         DSC III: After two successful DSC operations, the Bank had gained sufficient experience
to nuance the targeting of difficult reforms. For instance, following some tough decisions on
closure of large state-owned enterprises, such as Adamjee Jute Mill, concern had emerged about
inadequate growth in employment and the paucity of good and willing investors, causing a more
cautious implementation of privatization and closures of sick industries. Again, after pursuing a
plan for privatization of all four NCBs, the Bank realized the enormity of the task and settled for
privatization of the smallest bank and corporatization and restructuring of the others.

         DSC IV: In January, 2007, a caretaker government (CTG) led by technocrat ministers,
had replaced the democratically elected political government. Bank experience worldwide
suggests difficult reforms are easier managed under such governments though sustainability could
be tenuous. The Bank found this as another window of opportunity to initiate difficult reforms or
put unfinished agenda back on track. The Bank's preparedness and partial progress through
earlier DSCs yielded results: ACC and BERC were activated, and difficult energy price
adjustments accomplished.

         One Supplemental ($75 million) and another Additional financing ($100 million) to DSC
IV were approved by the Bank Board in response to the severe cyclone and floods that wreaked
havoc to the Bangladesh economy in late 2007. These financing were meant to ease the pressures
on the budget in the wake of the cyclone and floods and to allow the reform program under DSC
to continue.

         Together with the Supplemental and Additional Financing credits, a total of $1.075
billion of IDA credit got disbursed ­ a significant amount under one credit umbrella, for an
economy of $65 billion in 2007 when the credits ended. Each of the DSC was also aligned with
the budget cycle, so that disbursements helped to finance a substantial portion of the budget
deficit of 3-4% of GDP, thus obviating the need for domestic financing to the extent of some
$200 million each year. Complimentary reforms in the areas of tax administration, and financial
management was funded under DFID grants, while human development aspect was pursued
through a health sector multi-donor SWAP, HNPSP. There was thus no co-financing of DSC
operations with other donors.

         In sum, it is true that the grand scheme of reforms contemplated by the Bank at the
initiation of DSC I was subsequently trimmed and reduced to more pragmatic levels in light of
political sensitivities and institutional capacities. Nevertheless, a substantial measure of reforms
got done over the period of roughly five years that helped to streamline governance in key areas
such as energy, power, SOEs, financial sector, trade policy, revenue mobilization, and public
administration. In this light, Bank performance overall can be rated satisfactory. However, it
must be noted that, given Bangladesh's economic performance, which is well below potential,
much more could have been achieved, if the Bank could have mustered greater political will at
the outset.

(b)      Quality of Supervision (including M&E arrangements):

Rating: Satisfactory.

         Quality of supervision. The Bank has been active in all reform areas. It has worked with
the Government to identify needed actions, showed flexibility in reaching understanding with
GOB, and has been pushing for progress consistently throughout the DSC and beyond. Bank team
had a harmonious and cordial relationship with GOB counterparts throughout the tenure of the
program, which made possible regular exchange of information, especially on monitorable


                                                 30

indicators. With active participation of the Country Director(s) the triggers for each DSC have
been reviewed and modified to increase borrower ownership and enhance implementation. The
DSC II and III were appropriately delayed pending satisfactory progress with respect to the prior
actions incorporated. The CTG presented a two-year window in which to implement many
politically sensitive reforms. The Bank seized the opportunity and crafted DSC IV along with two
supplementary financing operations (responding to natural disasters and global commodity price
hike). DSC operations have concluded, now that the Government has drafted an update of the
PRSP. The Government's PRSP also includes a monitoring framework, incorporating indicators,
sources and institutional arrangements for monitoring and providing feedback to policymakers.
However, successful monitoring would depend critically on institutional arrangements and their
capacity The Bank appears to be showing reasonable flexibility on the follow-up program in the
form of a PRSC that will ensure continuation of Bank support for the overall reform agenda. It is
up to the new Government, elected in December 2008, to consider moving on the reform path
already articulated or strike an alternative medium-term agenda.

(c)      Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

         Satisfactory. On balance, the overall Bank performance is rated satisfactory. Given the
rather challenging landscape for reforms, the Bank did a fairly decent job of development
diplomacy to break into some difficult reform areas hitherto untouched (e.g. ACC, FOIA). Also,
the Bank prepared and supervised the four-plus operations over a period of four years rather
inexpensively, at $1,460,187 for programmatic loans totaling one billion and 75 million dollars
equivalent.

5.2      Borrower Performance

(a) Government performance

Overall, government performance was moderately satisfactory to satisfactory. The team in the
Ministry of Finance appeared to be the most proactive throughout the course of the program.
Partly, this was because MOF had the best information on the magnitude of the budget deficit and
available sources of financing. They were also programming expenditures on a certain
assumption of external financing that had to be secured in order for the budgeted program to be
fully realized. This realization was less appealing to, say, the energy ministry. Bank task
managers had to repeatedly inform and remind agencies, such as the NBR, about the
commitments and obligation under the agreed prior actions. Consequently, while MOF provided
leadership on the government side, there were times when there was breakdown of coordination
and follow up actions. It is fair to say that project support or sector DPLs tend to get more
focused attention of concerned ministries than does a budget support operation which becomes a
baby of the MOF.

Nonetheless, it must be acknowledged that, despite capacity constraints in various government
agencies involved, they were ultimately brought together in the final stages of each DSC to
deliver a critical mass of reforms with completed prior actions which the Board found adequate to
give its stamp of approval. Needless to mention, once the CTG was in place by January 2007,
negotiating the terms of DSC IV and taking it to Board approval perhaps took the least amount of
time as the government showed remarkable proactively in pushing forward hitherto mired
reforms. Two supplementary financing ($175 million) and even a Transitional Support Credit of
$100 million were approved in the short span of 12 months or so.

(b) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:


                                                31

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

For reasons noted above, overall borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

        The Bank must maintain a close dialogue with political parties out of power and with
other key opinion makers to have a better assessment of the support for reforms. This approach
is strategic and must be done even while working closely with and supporting like minded
governments. Such an approach helps to mitigate risks of possible reversals if and when the
ruling parties change, and to avoid the appearance of playing favorites.

        The Bank needs to do much more targeted and tailored engagement and
communication with stakeholders, quite apart from the Government. This is needed for
deepening ownership and support for reforms under programmatic loans, such as the DSC. Such
an approach becomes all the more critical during the tenure of an elected government which tends
to be disproportionately sensitive to public opinion and is, oftentimes, reluctant to make
unpopular policy choices.

        In Bangladesh, with limited implementation capacity and considerable political
uncertainties, reforms need to be opportunistic. The content and phasing of reforms will de
determined by the capacities of the reform champions to form coalitions and implement them.
The triggers for future operations, therefore, should be interpreted as indicative and subject to
change, provided of course these changes are broadly consistent with the overall focus of the
PRSP and are also likely to contribute to the outcomes being pursued. Triggers also need to be
backed by analytical work to ensure well-designed reforms.

        A difference needs to be made between real ownership of reforms from perceived
ownership arising from the prospect of receiving concessional IDA credit. At times, the
Government has a tendency to accept conditionalities which they do not intend to follow through.
Few in Government were opposed to the idea of central bank independence in running monetary
and exchange rate policies. Amendments to the Bangladesh Bank Order 1972 breezed through the
cabinet. Not so for the reforms in restructuring or privatization of NCBs, or for the financial
restructuring of power sector entities. Although some of these were incorporated as triggers in the
DSC program, they were never brought to fruition.

        Reforms with the best economic rationale have no chance of success if political costs
are prohibitive. Take the case of energy pricing formula promoted under the DSC from the start
(FY02-03). Though fiscal sustainability was undermined by the huge gap between administered
prices and procurement costs of petroleum, and pricing of domestically produced gas well below
its economic or supply price, creeping domestic inflation at the time ­ following a long period of
low inflation ­ made it difficult for the government to accept a pass-through of rising global oil
prices. If energy price adjustments fueled domestic inflation, consequent political unrest would
cost the government significant amount of popularity, and perhaps, the next election. The Bank's
analytics, however well grounded, failed to sway the political leadership.

        Finding a reform champion was only the first step in initiating a broad reform agenda
at the national level. Broad-based reforms work best if the Finance Minister takes the role of
reform champion. In Bangladesh, he happens to be the senior most cabinet minister with a lot of




                                               32

clout across ministries. His support in the cabinet and rapport with the Prime Minister were
crucial elements in getting reform actions implemented across agencies of government.

         Need to maintain flexibility in the design and implementation of reforms to take
account of unforeseen external and domestic developments. Examples are the implementation
of energy price and SOE reforms. World petroleum product prices had soared from roughly $30
a barrel on average in mid-2003 to around $40 a barrel in mid-2004. The automatic pass-through
of this to domestic consumers, while economically desirable, proved difficult in practice. The
Government was worried about the adverse implications for inflation and political resistance.
Similarly, following some tough decisions on closure of large state-owned enterprises, such as
Adamjee Jute Mill, concern had emerged about inadequate growth in employment and the paucity
of good and willing investors, causing a more cautious implementation of privatization and
closures of sick industries. Both cases illustrate the need to approach reform implementation
more pragmatically than the textbook approach would justify.

         DSC being budget support operations, the Bank was right in having close and regular
interactions with the Ministry of Finance. But the overall program covered several ministries
and government agencies, not all of which appeared in the Bank's radar. The Bank ought to have
a strategy of including these ministries/agencies for better results, particularly when the
coordination role of MOF shows cracks or weakness.

         In the worst of circumstances for reform, the criticality of staying engaged with the
government and key actors in the country can never be underestimated. Bank relationships with
the government can have their moments of hope and disappointment. Windows of opportunities
come at regular or irregular intervals. Election cycles are important to take note of. A
programmatic operation is likely to have greater success in achieving results if initiated in the
early phase of a new government. Reforms ­ particularly difficult ones ­ are unlikely to go
anywhere in the last years of a political regime.

         Small and meaningful changes are important and not to be overlooked. The Bank has
been proactive in identifying a vast reform agenda at the start of every decade. Only a small part
of the agenda will ever get fulfilled. The strategy should be: if one component of the program
does not succeed, don't drop the whole program. Continue with making some headway. Don't
expect implementation of the whole program ­ ever. For instance, privatization of all four NCBs
was part of the original reform agenda for the financial sector. This never happened, but many
substantive improvements did take place, like central bank independence, and corporatization of
NCBs and bringing them under the supervision of BB.

         The binding of investment and policy reform did not have a good record in Bangladesh
for supporting sustainable reform (or, in some cases, even sustainable investments)--the
primary reason being that policy and investment activities operate on such different timelines, and
with different stakeholders, that it is unwieldy to try and bind them together too closely. In past
investment operations in Bangladesh, the approach was to combine specific investment lending
with sector reform conditionality. This simply did not work, as it ignored the political economy
aspect of structural reforms. Tax administration reforms are worth a mention. It required
institutional reform, change management, and investment in information systems ­ both software
and hardware. The budget support operation (DSC) provided the needed leverage, and opened
doors for institutional changes, while a complimentary TA (IDA grant) laid the technical
foundations to absorb a major investment operation which was on the ready to deliver resources
for comprehensive system upgrades. Though design was appropriate, it turned out that a lack of
competent and stable leadership at NBR stifled progress in tax administration reforms.


                                               33

         South Asia's experience has had a major influence on Bank thinking in this area, and has
contributed to OPCS guidance on sector-wide conditionality in investment lending operations--
which is have no such conditionality, provided that key sector reforms can be supported through
other mechanisms such as budget support operations (e.g DSC). The approach is also endorsed
by IEG work in this area. At the core of this thinking is the realization that with specific
investment loans, the point of maximum leverage on reform-related matters occurs in advance of
Board presentation, and then it is gone. With budget support operations, particularly one that is
well-rooted in a reform strategy that has deep ownership on the part of Government (under the
CTG in Bangladesh), the points of pressure are multiple and recurring, translating into higher
probability of successful and sustainable reform.

         No trigger should be included in a program unless it is backed up by sound analytical
research. Furthermore, triggers need to be flexible to incorporate evolving priorities and findings
of additional ESW/AAA. Bank experience over the course of the DSC operation highlighted the
need for flexibility so that formulation of prior actions to fulfill a trigger was never carved in
stone ­ a clear appreciation of ground realities.

         It is important to keep the overall program simple and focused on a few critical
reforms. A reform agenda that is too broad could become complex and diffused, and would likely
involve too many prior actions. In such a case, there is strong likelihood for the best to become
the enemy of the good, thus threatening the entire program. After the first DSC, the Bank was
eager to keep the core agenda short and simple. The strategy in DSCIV was to ask the
government to devise a program that the Bank would support.

         The Bank needs to keep in mind a realistic timeframe for some reform actions to be
fully implemented. Broad-based reforms in the area of public administration and governance
require a much longer timeframe than the typical 3-year horizon of programmatic adjustment
credits. Expectations about how much progress can be made in these areas will need to be
modest. The other implication is that our engagement in this area will need to be on a long-term
basis. There were also long delays in taking DSC II and III to Board because several prior actions
took more time to complete.

         Reforms are also likely to be more sustainable if Opposition parties are both informed
and consulted about long-term poverty-reducing programs. This appeared to be a weakness in
the DSC program which lacked buy-in of opposition parties to some of the good reforms.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

Borrower comments:

Impact of DSC Series support (FY2003-FY2007) and its effectiveness

         The broad objective of the Development Support Credits (DSCs) was mainly to help
reducing poverty in Bangladesh through implementation of I-PRSP and PRSP. In line with this
objective, a series of single tranche adjustment operations within a medium term framework
implemented through the government under the assistance from the World Bank and IMF (under
PRGF). They are 5 in numbers called Development support Credit (DSC) number i, ii, iii and iv
(first and second supplemental Financing). The underlying strategy of the DSCs was to assist the
implementation of the Government's Development Agenda and reforms initiatives to attain the


                                                34

objectives of the PRS and the MDGs thereby (detail of the DSC objectives can be viewed in
Annex-A).

Impact of DSCs

        The impact of the DSCs was mostly positive. Some impacts are tangible while others set
the ground for future development. All positive changes, however, cannot be attributed directly to
support received through DSC Series. Support received from other development partners, e.g as
IMF, ADB, DFID during the currency of the DSC support period, also contributed to the
outcome. Finally, improved governance scenario during the last couple of years has had direct
bearing on the outcome during DSC IV period.

The efforts and achievements by the government during FY03-08 (the period when the DSCs was
utilized) are evaluated under few broad areas that are relevant to DSC objectives.

MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

        Bangladesh achieved remarkable macroeconomic stability during FY03-08 period.
Following are the summary of the key achievements in this area:

     · GDP growth steadily reached to 6.2% in FY08 from 4.45 in FY02 with a peak 6.6% in
        FY06. This all-round performance in major contributing sectors allowed the economy to
        withstand the adverse impact of the severe global crisis during FY07 and FY08;
     · Generally the period was marked by low inflation growth (except the latter years), higher
        private sector investment growth and robust demand in domestic and export markets;
     · The exchange regime went floating during FY03 which contributed towards remittances
        and exports growth to give overall sustainability despite the oil price shocks and adverse
        effect with the end of MFA;
     · The economy was resilient despite repeated natural calamities like floods and cyclones
        that caused huge loss of crops, assets and lives;
     · Poverty has been reduced by 8.9% in 2005 compared to 2000;
     · As a result of a series of reforms, fiscal management returned to a prudent path with
        lower and stable fiscal deficit, declining debt to GDP ratio and growing revenue to GDP
        ratio.

GOVERNANCE:

        The DSCs were effective in supporting the government's structural and institutional
reform to a great extent. Given the challenges for such reforms, government succeeded in starting
many of them very effectively. The reforms sought in this area take a long span of time to
implement while gestation period for reaping the benefit is longer. The impacts of DSCs can be
summarized as follows:

a) Public Financial Management

        Reform in this area started before the DSCs were disbursed. However, significant reforms
has taken place during FY03-08 period including
     · Preparation of Medium Term Public Financial Management Plan (PFMIP) helped setting
        the medium term vision and sequencing of the series of reforms that laid the foundation
        for good governance.



                                                35

     · Preparation of budget under Medium Term Framework is a major reform linking
         resources to policy objectives. The outputs are compared to preset indicators to determine
         the outcome. The new approach covers 65% of the total program budget. The new budget
         approach devolved authority for resources allocation decisions to line ministries to
         achieve the sectoral and PRS objectives. It also aims to integrate revenue and
         development budget.
     · Organizational and technical set up for public cash, debt and contingent liabilities
         management, debt servicing liabilities management (DSL) through establishing Treasury
         and Debt Management Wing in the Finance Division has enabled a series of critical
         reforms.
     · Computerization of all treasury transaction dealing branches of banks is another
         significant reform that set the ground for timely and accurate cash flow information.
     · Enactment of Public Procurement Law in 2006 that streamlined the anomalies in
         procurement aimed making the development process more efficient;
     · Induction of web based Integrated Budget and Accounting System (iBAS) is one of the
         major additions in the PFM reform ensuring availability of timely and reliable budgeting
         and accounting information.
     · Banking supervision has improved substantially by allowing Bangladesh Bank greater
         autonomy on issues of exchange rate, monetary policy, bank supervision and personnel
         management through necessary amendments in Bangladesh Bank Order, 1972. The
         Bank Companies Act 1991 was amended brought NCBs and Specialized Developed
         Bank under the purview of Bangladesh Bank.
     · Enactment of Budget Management Ordinance, Anti Money Laundering Act, Fiscal
         Responsibility Act paved the way for some remarkable reforms during the period.

b) Anti-Corruption Commission

         In line with the DSC objectives in restoring good governance, setting up of ACC has
initiated awareness about the importance of anti-corruption measures in all sectors of the country.
The success of the Commission not only penetrated the roots but also facilitated greater
accountability and transparency in government and in other sectors. Continuation of such efforts
will ensure a faster growth through checking misappropriation of scarce resources.

c) Revenue Mobilization Reforms

         Despite the fact that government revenue to GDP ratio of Bangladesh is one of the lowest
in the world, several functional and structural reforms took place that contributed towards gradual
increase in total government revenue over the years. The major achievements include setting up
of Large Tax Payer Unit, Automation of Dhaka and Chittagong Customs House while adoption of
Strategic Development Plan of NBR to revitalize revenue collection system is a major step
forward.

d) Trade liberalization

         The main agenda in this area were deepening liberalization of trade by removing all quota
restrictions and scaling down nominal and effective protections gradually. . The achievements in
the area are:
     · Average Nominal protection fell from 29.4% in FY02 to 21.9% in FY08
     · Removal of ban on wide range of textile in FY06;
     · Trade to GDP ratio increased to 38% in FY 06 from 28% in FY00;



                                                36

    · Exchange rate regime was liberalized in 2003 by free floating Tk/US$;

e) Power Sector Reforms

         Power sector remained focused in the development agenda. Result of the reforms in this
sector was not impressive. Long time required for bidding, re-bidding and implementation,
capital intensive nature of plant and private sectors' inability to invest in such capital intensive
projects can be attributed for this drag. Lingering political transition process and complex
contract awarding have also contributed significantly. Bank's support for power sector
institutional reforms has helped in unbundling the old organisations into new companies,
enhancing social awareness, and reducing system losses. However, there has been some new
addition to power capacity through power rentals companies and small IPPs under World Bank
supported IPF Facility.

(f) State Owned Enterprises Reform

         Role of the DSCs were significant in reforming the SoEs to reduce the financial losses
and to reduce the adverse impact on the economy. Notable achievements thus can be noted
despite the slow pace of such reforms due to procedural challenges. Notable of the reforms
include
    · Closure of Adamjee Jute mills in 2002, reducing 10 percent SOE lose reduction was
         facilitated, mainly through "golden handshake" programs through World Bank supported
         EGBM project.
    · Privatization of loss making SOEs got momentum during the period;
    · 3 nationalized commercial banks were corporatized.

(g) Progress in Women's Advancement and Rights

         Bangladesh has made measurable progress in women's advancement and rights in a
number of areas. Following are few of them:
    · Poverty in women-headed households has declined to 21.9% in 2005 from 35.4% in
         2000.
    · Women's participation in the labour force increased to 29.2% in FY06, from 26.1% in
         FY03;
    · The female students' stipend programmes have increased participation of girls;
    · The proportion of non-pregnant mothers in the chronic energy deficiency situation
         declined from 44.2 % in FY00 to 32.2% in FY05.
    · Maternal mortality decreased to 3.37 per 1000 life births in 2006 from 3.65 in 2004.
    · Maternity leave for government employees has increased to four months from 2005;
    · To ensure social protection for women, the social safety net program for Old Age
         Allowance, Widow Allowance, Acid-burnt victim support, Maternity Allowances for
         Pregnant Women and Lactating Mothers and a VGD Programme continues with wider
         coverage and increased rate as applicable.

DSCs and Allocations in the Priority Sectors

         The support received under DSCs was used as direct budget support with resources being
directed to selected priority sectors of the Government. We have identified in the foregoing,
where mileage has been achieved through reforms by strengthening core governance including
budget management, tax administration and public procurement. The DSC series aimed to



                                               37

     improve investment climate by securing maintenance of macro economic stability, deepening
     domestic deregulation, liberalized trade regime, improving banking and energy sectors and the
     SOEs.

               The table below shows the changes in the government's budget allocation during FY03-
     09 for sectors which incorporates priorities of the DSCs. In broad sweep, most of the listed
     sectors have had their allocations topped up under the DSC series support and the achievements
     listed above are their reflections. However, the ebbs in the flow of allocations in the time series in
     some sectors can be explained in the following:

           · In FY05 the allocation declined in Health Sector owing to the capacity problem arising
               out the transition from HPSP to HNPSP;

           · Negative change (-10%) in the infrastructure sector in FY06 and FY07 since the
               allocation in the ADP for the year was not utilized as no power generation projects were
               implemented;

           · The decline (-11%) of allocation in other sector during FY 07 was contributed mainly due
               to the capacity constraints in the Ministry of Industries in utilizing the ADP allocations

             Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
There was no Borrower's ICR but comments received on the draft ICR are reproduced
verbatim below.

Dr. Zahid Hussain,
Senior Economist, World Bank,
Dhaka, Bangladesh

Dear Dr. Hussain,
Subject: Comments on ICR Report

Please refer to World Bank letter of February 19, 2009, addressed to Secretary, ERD on
Implementation Completion and Results Report of DSC Series 1-IV (2003-2007). You will recall
that earlier we have provided GoB's view on how well the DSC series were used.

We would now like to offer Finance Division's broad comments on the ICR Report. While we
have been more exhaustive in our earlier dispatch on utilization of the loan, we would prefer to be
brief.

The moderately satisfactory rating of GoB performance as borrower appears to be broadly
objective and dispassionate. However, there are areas where successes were underrated. For
example in FY 2007-08, revenue collection far exceeded the target, with a net addition of 1.1
percent of GDP over the previous year. The ICR commented that enhanced revenue mobilization
was "one goal that remained persistently short of target". We, however, recognize that the grand
scheme of reforms, as designed in early days of engagement, had to be scaled down in light of
existing political sensitivities and institutional capacities.

The World Bank ­ GoB partnership in the form of DSC series direct budget support has been
extremely helpful in bringing much needed reforms in budget management, public procurement
and tax administration. The credit series also supported financial sector reforms, trade
liberalization and governance issues.

With DSC support achieving its broad objective, we would now look forward to further
engagement of World Bank in PRS Credit.

Thanking you,

Arastoo Khan
Additional Secretary, Finance Division
