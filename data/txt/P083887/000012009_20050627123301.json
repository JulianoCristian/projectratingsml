This Simplified Implementation\n            Completion Report (SICR) provides the following findings and\n            implications for subsequent operation(s). The project sought\n            to continue supporting Government's efforts to\n            stabilize the macroeconomic environment, improve the\n            investment climate, and strengthen economic institutions.\n            While progress continued in each of these areas, on the\n            institutional front, notable achievements included the\n            establishment of the Energy Regulatory Commission, and the\n            Anti-Corruption Commission, with some progress in\n            strengthening tax administration and banking sector\n            regulation by the Bangladesh Bank. However, these can only\n            be viewed as incremental steps in what is necessarily a\n            long-term and complex process of institutional building.\n            Future operations need to be realistic in setting goals in\n            this area; since local capacity is very weak, therefore, the\n            Bank and the donor community will need to stay engaged,\n            providing support over a long period. Project experience\n            confirms that strong country ownership is essential for the\n            success of reforms, best when the designs of these are\n            homegrown. The reform process in the banking sector, for\n            example, progressed slower than initially anticipated, due\n            to inadequate attention given to the political economy,\n            considerations which led to setting some over-ambitious\n            goals. The political difficulty of implementing energy price\n            increases was seemingly, also underestimated in designing\n            the reforms. Also important, are future adjustment\n            operations, which should be more closely aligned to the\n            budget. In this regard, the Bank team is working with the\n            Ministry of Finance to enhance the policy orientation of the\n            budget, through the development of a medium-term budget framework."}, "docdt": "2005-06-17T00:00:00Z"}
