3. Program Description

3.a. Overall Program

Development outcomes in Bangladesh have been impressive, particularly since the early 1990s. The average
citizen is 60 percent richer today and the poverty rate has fallen by over 10 percentage points relative to 1990.
Despite Bangladesh's constant exposure to weather-related shocks, growth has been remarkably stable;
Bangladesh is among a handful of countries to have sustained positive per-capita growth since the early 1990s.
Bangladesh's progress on non-income measures has in many ways been even more impressive than on income
measures. It has moved to near universal primary enrollment for both genders, and, since independence, has
more than doubled the secondary enrollment rate, more than halved the child mortality rate, and increased life
expectancy by over 15 years. The decline in infant and child mortality rates since 1972 has been among the
fastest in the developing world. With the fertility rate down from 6.3 children in 1975 to 3.3 in the mid-1990s,
the annual population growth rate has fallen to 1.5 percent a year.

Seeking to build on this impressive record, the Government has laid out in its interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) an ambitious set of poverty reduction targets and social development goals that are
consistent with, and at times even exceed, the MDGs. The I-PRSP identified four main pillars for policy and
institutional reforms to reduce poverty: Macroeconomic stability to accelerate pro-poor growth; improving
governance for sustaining growth and poverty reduction; investing in human development to enhance human
capabilities; and social protection for reducing vulnerabilities and improving income generating opportunities.
The I-PRSP was presented to the Boards of the IDA and the IMF in June 2003, at which point the Boards
agreed that it provided a cohesive policy framework for implementing a pro-poor growth strategy and a sound
basis for the preparation of a fully participatory PRSP.


3.b. DSC2 and Its Relationship to the Overall Program

The Development Support Credit II (DSC2), in the amount of US$200 million, was the second in a series of
operations to support the Government's medium term reform program, alongside the PRGF supported by the
IMF. The operation built on the experience in implementation of DSC1, which was the first adjustment
operation in Bangladesh since the mid-1990s. A US$200 million DSC3 is scheduled to be presented to the
Board sometime in the fall of 2005; most of its prior conditions have been met.

DSC2 sought to support a subset of the overall reform program aimed at improving prospects of pro-poor
growth and strengthening the economic institutions. For that, it emphasized a satisfactory macro-framework,
including more efficient budgetary allocation, financial and energy sector reform, SOE reform, trade
liberalization, modernization of the National Board of Revenue (NBR), and improved economic governance.

Financial sector reform continued with progress on the divestment of one bank (Rupali) and the preparation of
two others (Agrani and Janata) for future divestment, as well as improved prudential regulations. SOE reform
continued from DSC1, particularly restructuring, downsizing, and reduction of manufacturing SOEs' losses. In
the energy sector, DSC2 focused on reduction of arrears to the power sector, corporatization of two distribution
companies, unbundling of gas transmission to GTCL, and initiating the establishment of the Energy Regulatory
Commission (ERC).        Trade liberalization included a reduction in the average level of protection and
rationalization of tariff rates, although some backtracking took place on coverage of para tariffs. In tax
administration, the NBR undertook to prepare a modernization strategy and to initiate its implementation. In
governance, DSC2 supported the establishment of the anti-corruption commission and anti-corruption plan, and
implementation of revised procurement rules and new standard bidding documents. Governance actions also
included strengthening the independence of the Auditor General and the Government's efforts to resolve more
quickly any serious audit irregularities raised by the Public Accounts Committee.

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

All core conditions were achieved. Annex 1 provides the results to date for the core and non-core measures,
including outputs and outcomes. Good economic performance was recorded in FY04-05, partly in response to
the improvements in the policy environment. GDP growth reached 5.5 percent in FY04 and is expected at
about 5.2 percent in FY05 despite the severe floods during July-September 2004.1

Macroeconomic stability and sustainability have been sustained and a macroeconomic framework conducive
to growth has been developed through a series of supportive actions backed by the Bank's DSCs and the IMF's
PRGF program, which remains on track. Prospects for fiscal sustainability benefited most from curbs on
wasteful expenditures and improved deficit financing patterns ­ with greater reliance on concessional external
financing. Fiscal correction has also involved improved quality of expenditure, with increased budgetary
support to growth-oriented activities such as development of infrastructure and the rural economy. Fiscal
deficit was contained at 3.2 percent of GDP in FY04 and is expected to increase to 4.2 percent in FY05 in part
due to flood relief efforts. Monetary policy has largely followed a prudent course by supporting private sector
growth, while containing inflation at around 6 percent and resisting pressures to accommodate fiscal deficits.
Some inflationary pressures built up earlier this year, mainly due to the transmission of global commodity price
inflation and flood-induced food price increases in FY05. Monetary policy, initially slow in its response, has
been considerably tightened since March 2005.

Export growth, responding to trade liberalization measures and structural improvements to domestic
competitiveness, has remained strong, reaching 16 percent during FY04 and a further 15 percent growth on the
year until April 2005. Import growth, too, has been strong, fueled by higher oil and commodity prices, rice and
wheat imports to cover shortages caused by floods, and sharp increases in demand for intermediate goods and
capital machinery. Strong performance of exports and remittances together with liberalization of the exchange
market has enabled foreign exchange reserves to build up to a more comfortable level of three months of import
cover; reserves had fallen to a critical level of one month import cover in December 2001.

Financial sector reforms have been encouraging, and the sector's performance reflects that. The agenda of
privatizing the nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) has moved forward, although at a pace slower than
originally envisaged in the face of the political difficulties of the reform. The Government has been making
progress in implementing the actions necessary to bring Rupali Bank to the point of sale; a new management
team has been appointed for Agrani Bank; and management advisers are in place for both Janata and Sonali
Banks. New lending by NCBs has been capped, and their share of loans has been reduced from about 70
percent five years ago, to about 40 percent today. Prudential regulations have also been brought closer to
international standards. To strengthen the banking sector, the Bangladesh Bank has lowered the single exposure
limit and required banks to place loans overdue by more than 90 days in Special Mention Accounts on which
interest may not be counted into income. These measures have produced positive banking sector outcomes.
Private banks have strengthened their financial positions and are steadily increasing their share of the market at
the expense of the troubled Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs). Between 1998 and 2004, the market
share of the NCBs fell from 54 percent to 40 percent while their net NPL ratio fell from 27 percent to 18
percent; the net NPL ratio of private banks fell from 16 percent to less than 3 percent over this period.

The financial position of the SOEs has been strengthened through reforms such as a more efficient pricing
framework, partial divestment, and withdrawal of direct and implicit budgetary support. Despite the politically
charged nature of the reform, the Government was able to reduce the number of manufacturing sector SOEs
from 121 in FY01 to 92 in FY04 and the employment level in these from 134,000 to 83,000. Slower progress
on privatization was made in FY05, with successful privatization of 6 SOEs and approval of the process for 5
others. However, there has been a visible improvement in the SOEs' financial performance. Manufacturing


1World Bank and AsDB estimates put total losses to assets and output at about $2 billion, or 3¾ percent of GDP.


                                                           3

sector SOEs, for instance, have cut their losses for four consecutive years now; achieving a 60 percent reduction
in their losses since 2001. Non-manufacturing SOEs, not including the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (for
which see separate discussion below), recorded a profit for the third consecutive year. In other measures, the
Government has cut funding of public sector jute mills; consequently, 12 previously loss-making jute mills are
virtually non-operational due lack of working capital. In FY05, about 10,000 SOE employees chose early
retirement under the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS). To further support the workers availing the VRS, the
Government has put in place counseling and retraining programs; these are being funded under the Bank's
Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project. BRAC, a renowned NGO, has been awarded the task of
providing counseling and training, and the project also undertakes social tracking of the retired workers.

The DSC-supported program is beginning to show results in the energy sector. Reform measures aim at
improving its operational efficiency, financial viability, and regulatory environment, and the corporate
governance structure within sector utilities. An independent Energy Regulatory Commission was established in
FY04 and recently made operational with the selection of a chairman and allocation of a dedicated budget.
Arrears in the power sector have been reduced, from an equivalent of 8 months in FY03 to 7 months by end-
FY04 and are expected to fall further to under 4 months by end-FY05, and two more distribution companies
have been corporatized. Some progress has also been made in restructuring the petroleum and gas sectors,
including inter alia financial restructuring and autonomy, and consolidation of all gas transmission assets in Gas
Transmission Company Ltd. (GTCL). In response to more than doubling of international gasoline prices,
domestic petrol prices have increased by 43 percent over 2002-2005, while the prices of kerosene and diesel
have been increased by 48 percent (30 percent during FY05). The Government felt that a full pass-through of
international price increases as per the agreed pricing formula was politically not feasible and also presented a
risk of rising inflation. Despite an overall improvement in the financial position of SOEs as discussed above,
insufficient petroleum price increases have resulted in financial distress for the Bangladesh Petroleum
Corporation (see Section 5 below).

Progress has been made on trade liberalization, partly as a result of engagement under the DSCs. The top
customs duty rate was lowered to 25 percent in FY04 (from 32.5 percent in FY03), the number of customs duty
rates were rationalized to 4 (from 5 before), some para tariffs (e.g. regulatory duty) were removed, and the para
tariff rates rationalized.2 The Government has also removed all remaining trade-related QRs.

A number of public administration reforms have been implemented in recent years. Promotion policy has
been improved for Class I officers and there is enhanced emphasis on merit in performance evaluation and
career development. An improved training policy has been issued and more importance is being given to
training, particularly in public sector management, for promotion. A Career Planning Wing (CPW) was created
in the Ministry of Establishment in September 2003 and, based on its work, initiatives are underway to improve
career planning and effective deployment of Class I officers. Further, a proposal to organize ministries around
four clusters is under consideration. Deliberation and preparatory work that could lead to the development of a
senior civil service or management pool are also underway. The Government has contained employment
growth of support staff at Class III and IV levels by maintaining a freeze on new post creation and keeping
control over the filling of vacant positions. Outsourcing is being selectively practiced within the public sector.

Efforts are also being made to improve governance in areas such as procurement, financial management,
fiscal reporting and watchdog institutions. Improving governance remains a high priority and a challenge (see
Section 5 below) but there is progress in this area. In the area of economic governance, a number of recent
sectoral reforms in banking, state-owned enterprises, public administration, and the trade system should narrow
the scope for corruption, as well as improving the efficiency of the economy and the quality of service delivery.
In addition, reforms in procurement, financial management, and anti-corruption will have long-term benefits in

2Some backtracking was seen with an expansion of the coverage of para tariffs in the FY05 budget. The unweighted
average protection rate still fell from 29.1 percent in FY04 to 26.5 percent in FY05.


                                                               4

lowering corruption once these are fully effective. The activities of NCBs, previously a huge source of
corruption through directed credit, have been curtailed through tighter MOUs. The culture of non-payment to
energy companies has been another root of systemic corruption. Recent successful efforts to reduce the stock of
arrears to power companies and improved collection of current bills have addressed this partially. Trade
reforms have reduced the discretionary powers at the customs.

 The Public Accounts Committee has been reestablished and has already made good progress in reducing the
backlog of audit objections; by December, 2004, the backlog had been reduced by 26 percent. Implementation
of the ROSC recommendations is also underway. In other related actions, the Government implemented new
procurement regulations (October 2003), adopted new implementing procedures and key standard bidding
documents, and significantly reduced the layers in procurement approval procedures. The new procurement
regulations have increased awareness among the contracting/ business community and contributed significantly
towards harmonizing donors' and GOB procurement procedures.                A unique procurement tracking and
monitoring system through an integrated MIS is expected to be fully functional by July 2005. A new
procurement law, including provision of concessional contracting/BOT is being prepared, and should be placed
with the Parliament before the end of FY05. Value for money audits (performance audits) are being introduced
and audit committees have been setup in 22 ministries to resolve outstanding issues. An independent Anti
Corruption Commission Act was passed by Parliament in February 2004, providing the Commission with a
mandate to prevent corrupt practices and investigate specific offenses. Efforts are ongoing to design the
organizational structure of the new entity and to operationalize it.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

A weak governance environment is among the most important constraints hindering development in
Bangladesh and the political will to tackle it will shape the success of future reform efforts. While progress has
been made in some areas of economic governance during the DSC period - especially due to improvements in
the banking sector, procurement, and state-owned enterprises ­ the unfinished agenda remains large. The law
and order situation is weak and concerns about a rise in political corruption are being raised by international
observers. The Government's capacity to tackle these issues is very limited. The civil service remains
relatively low-quality and lacks proper motivation because of a weak incentive system, while the Government
has extremely low resources at its disposal because of weak revenue generation capacity. The highly centralized
political and administrative system weakens capacity to deliver and monitor service delivery. The Government,
however, has expressed its commitment to tackle these issues.

Another major issue is the antagonistic and highly confrontational relationship between the two major
political parties that prevents Bangladesh from reaching its full potential as a functioning democracy. Shrill
political differences, often manifest in violent clashes, preclude any sort of debate or political consensus on
reforms from emerging: As a result, reform measures, rather than gaining momentum, have tended to be
opportunistic and sporadic. With the next round of general elections scheduled for January 2007, the political
landscape for deepening of structural reforms is becoming even more difficult.

The main external factor is the continued increase in imported petroleum prices. The Government increased
kerosene and diesel prices by Tk 3 a liter in January and again roughly 30 percent in May, but it judged that full
energy price adjustments would be too painful and politically difficult. The Bangladesh Petroleum Company
has therefore continued to suffer financially from artificially low diesel and kerosene prices and interest on its
mounting debt. The resulting losses during the FY05 are estimated to exceed $300 million. Despite the losses,
BPC must still pay taxes, and is borrowing from domestic and foreign banks to pay its tax bill. BPC's annual
tax bill is close to Tk30 billion, equal to almost $500 million. Its accumulated losses over the past five years are
approaching Tk 70 billion, equal to about 2 percent of GDP. The Bank has pointed out to the Government that
this situation is not sustainable. The Government increased gas prices in July 2004 and January 2005, as agreed




                                                         5

with the Bank, but has not adjusted prices fully in line with the formula linking domestic gas prices to the world
price of fuel substitutes, which have risen further during FY05.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank Performance. The DSC work is fully consistent with the objectives of the last CAS and with the Bank's
recent country and sector work. The Bank has worked closely and cooperatively with the Borrower to continue
supporting the national poverty reduction program. The Bank showed both determination and flexibility in
helping the Government to pursue a politically challenging, growth-oriented strategy. As the reform program
has progressed, the Bank has continued to pursue the most difficult areas such as energy sector reform and anti-
corruption measures. The Bank has also coordinated closely with the IMF, with the DSCs complementing the
IMF's PRGF. The Bank also collaborates with other multilateral and bilateral development organizations in
Bangladesh. Overall Bank performance was satisfactory.

Borrower Performance. The Government was generally committed to the program, but faced strong political
challenges, both in terms of entrenched interests as well as broader resistance to some of the more painful
reforms, such as energy price adjustments. The Government has demonstrated a willingness to face these
challenges and to keep moving toward a more open economy.                  Borrower performance was, therefore,
satisfactory.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

DSC2 sought to continue supporting Government's efforts to stabilize the macroeconomic environment,
improve the investment climate and strengthen important economic institutions. Progress has continued in each
of these areas. On the institutional front, notable achievements included the establishment of the Energy
Regulatory Commission and the Anti-Corruption Commission, and some progress in strengthening tax
administration and banking sector regulation by the Bangladesh Bank. However, these can only be viewed as
incremental steps in what is necessarily a long-term and complex process of institutional building. Future
operations need to be realistic in setting goals in this area; since local capacity is very weak, the Bank and the
rest of the donor community will need to stay engaged and provide support over a long period.

Experience with DSC2 confirms what the Bank has learned elsewhere--that strong country ownership is
essential for the success of reforms and the designs of these are best when homegrown. External agents like the
Bank can be useful in catalyzing the domestic forces of change in addition to the financial resources and
technical assistance they can bring. The reform process in the banking sector, for example, progressed slower
than was initially anticipated because inadequate attention may have been given upfront to the political
economy considerations which led to setting some over-ambitious goals.                 The political difficulty of
implementing energy price increases was likely also underestimated in designing the reforms.

It is also important that future adjustment operations be more closely aligned to the budget. In this regards, the
Bank team is working with the MoF to enhance the policy orientation of the budget through the development of
a medium-term budget framework.
