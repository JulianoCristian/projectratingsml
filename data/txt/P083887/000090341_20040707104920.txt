                 THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OFBANGLADESH
                        DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT CREDIT I1

                               Credit andProgram Summary


Borrower:     The People's Republic o fBangladesh


Amount:       SDR 136.8 million (US$200 millionequivalent)


Terms:        StandardIDA terms; 40-year maturity and 1O-year grace period


Description:  The proposed Credit i s the second in a planned series of programmatic
              operations in the context of a medium-term reform framework, alongside the
              PRGF supported by the IMF. The Credit aims to enhance Bangladesh's
              growth and poverty reduction prospects through continued support to
              implementation in key areas o f the country's poverty reduction strategy. The
              poverty reduction strategy focuses on acceleration o f pro-poor growth;
              promoting good governance, investing in human development, promoting
              women's advancement and ensuring social protection. The operation builds
              on the experience in implementing the First Development Support Credit
              (DSC I).

              The key areas ofreform supported under the Credit are summarizedbelow:


               0Satisfactory implementation of the macroeconomic framework agreed
                underthe IMF-supportedPovertyReductionand GrowthFacility.
                Inthe financial sector, theareasofsupport arepreparationfor privatization
                and management support for some nationalized commercial banks and
                issuanceofprudentialregulations.
               0In the area of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), the operation supports
                divestiture, closure and downsizing of selectedenterprises.
                The improvements supported inthe energy sector include :financial action
                plan and restructuring of debts o f power entities; monitoring and
                dissemination o f key performance indicators; corporatization of power
                companies; financial restructuringingas; pre-privatization work for oil and
                gas companies; and functioning o f the EnergyRegulatory Commission.
                Ingovernance, the operation is supporting actions ina number of areas :
                functioning o f the independent Anti-Conuption Commission and wider
                anti-corruption measures, including reforms in banking, SOEs, tax
                administration, public procurement; tracking o f public spending leakages;
                establishment o f Public Accounts Committee; and actions to strengthen the
                independence of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.
               0The operation i s supporting improvements in selected areas o f public
                administration: personnel management; compensation system; merit-based
                promotion and outsourcing.

Benefits:    As inthe case of DSC I, reforms supported under the proposed operation
                                       the
             are likely to have a positive impact on economic growth, exports and better
             incentives for private sector investment, with positive implications for poverty
             reduction. Over the longer term, progress in institutional reforms supported
             bythe Credit is expected to promote sustainedmacroeconomic stability, more
             effective government institutions, private sector development, including
             privatization, improved public service delivery, and enhanced transparency
             and good governance These reforms will helpreduce corruption and improve
             inthe climate for privateinvestment.


Risks and
Mitigation   There are several risks. First, the pace o f reform could slow down inthe run
Strategy:    up to the next election in2006. Resistance to large-scale reforms could also
             grow if the social impact o f reforms i s not mitigated adequately. The
             Government has done well thus far in actively consulting labor leaders and
             workers and ensuring that their concerns are taken into account in designing
             retrenchment programs. The Government now needs to buildstronger internal
             agreement among ministries and in Parliament and the country on the PRSP.
             Second, governance problems could affect growth and service delivery to the
             poor, and pose a serious risk to the sustainability and efficacy of reform
             efforts in Bangladesh. Fungibility o f funds implies that budgetary resources
             could be diverted or misused, which poses a particular risk to operations, such
             as DSC 11. The Government, supported by the donor community, including
             under the Bank's DSCs, has already made impressive inroads on several
             fronts to address these risks. The Government has a good record of allocating
             public spending to social sectors with encouraging outcomes in human
             development. Financial management i s being strengthened. The new
             procurement regulations should reduce the scope for misuse o f budgetary
             funds in contracting.     Tracking studies of major spending on health and
             education should also help to curb leakages. External oversight by the office
             o f the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) is also being strengthened.
             Third, the scheduled removal of export quotas under the Multi-fiber
             Agreement (MFA) at end-2004 could affect garments exports, comprising
             three-quarters of total export earnings, catering mainly to the EU and U S
             markets, where Bangladesh has enjoyed quota fi-ee access due to its LDC
             status. This in turn could affect jobs in the sector where 1.8 million women
             are employed. The needed actions are buildingo f foreign exchange reserves,
             promotion o f export diversification, reduction o f anti-export bias, and
             improvement in the investment climate, that are being supported directly or
             indirectly through the operation. The recent improvement in macroeconomic
             performance including the buildup o f reserves should also help mitigate this
             risks.


             Overall, the Government's pro-reform stance and commitment to the
             development o f a comprehensive PRSP and its effective implementation, as
             also reflected by its recent policy statements at the Bangladesh Development
             Forum inMay 2004, provide a reasonable basis to expect that the above risks
             will be mitigatedto a considerable extent. The support to prudentpolicies and
             institutional reforms, particularly improvements in governance, under the

              proposed operation, reinforced by the IMF-supported PRGF, and            other
              programs/actions supported by the Bank and other donors i s likely to reduce
              the above-mentioned risks considerably. Bangladesh has graduated from a
              low case to a base case through a more pro-reform stance, and i s preparingits
              poverty reduction strategy and will need considerable support from the Bank
              and other development partners to implement the strategy.

                                           I.INTRODUCTION

1.1     Bangladesh has sustainedhigh rates of economic growth, with impressiveimprovements in
social indicators, despite facing numerous development challenges. GDP growth has averaged more
than 5 percent a year during the 1 9 9 0 ~ ~
                                         over which period there has been an encouraging reduction inthe
percentage o f population living below the poverty line. Importantly, Bangladesh has continued to make
progress with human development and many of the social indicators exceed those in countries with
comparable per capita income. However, since the country i s starting from a low base, there i s an urgent
need to accelerate the rate of economic growth and ensure that the economy achieves its MDG targets.
The Government, elected in 2001, has pursued ambitious reforms to stabilize the economy and improve
its medium-term structure with the objective of accelerating growth. This will be key not only for
increasing employment opportunities and reducing income poverty directly but also to achieving
improved social outcomes. An interimPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) was discussed at the
Boards o f the IMF and the World Bank inJune 2003 and implementation of the I-PRSP i s underway. A
full PRSP is expected to be completed end of this year. The implementation of the I-PRSP program is
being supported by a multi-year program of the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
and a series o f adjustment operations from the World Bank, the first of which (Development Support
Credit I)was approved bythe BoardinJune 2003.

1.2     Macroeconomicpolicieshaveremainedon track, and the Government hasprogressed with
structural and institutional reforms despite an increasingly difficult political situation. Growth
continued to recover during FY2004 and fiscal and monetary prudence helped contain inflationary
pressures. Prudent macroeconomic management also helped maintain reserves and helped to keep low
domestic and external debt servicing. Regarding structural and institutional reforms, further progress has
been made inimproving public spendingpriorities and the implementation o f the budget. The new FY05
budget has announcedmeasures to liberalize trade and strengthen tax administration. The Central Bank's
oversight of the banking sector has been further strengthened and the Government has sought
management support for the four troubled nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) with a view to
offloading substantial shareholdings from three o f them. Reforms have helped reduce manufacturing
state-owned enterprises' financial losses.

1.3     The Government has initiated and mainstreamed a program aimed at improving
governanceand reducingcorruption. The Government's governance improvementand anti-corruption
strategy, which i s still evolving, recognizes that the roots o f associated problems are deep-seated and
multi-faceted. Quick solutions are not available and actions are needed on a broad front and need to be
continued over a longer term. Many o f the governance challenges are cross-sectoral, but some are sector-
specific. At the sectoral level, reforms inbanking and SOEs are helping reduce the scope for corruption.
The Government has also outlined a strategy to modernizethe National Board of Revenue to increase the
effectiveness and equity with which taxes are collected. This should not only mobilize more revenue to
fund social programs and infrastructure but also reduce the scope for tax evasion and corruption.
Similarly, important initiatives are underway inthe energy sector and inthe health and education sectors,
which will improve sector performance and reduce the scope for theft and leakages. At the national level,
a concerted effort i s underway to improve the effectiveness o f the public sector and reduce corruption.
Thus, the Government has given greater weight to merit inrecent promotions to the senior civil service.
The Cabinet Committee on Good Governance and Administrative Reforms, chaired by the Finance
Minister, has initiated consideration o f further reforms, including appropriate remuneration, abolition of

the secrecy culture and improved performance standards. The Government's new regulations on
procurement, issued in late-2003, streamlined the bidding system for public contracts and increased
transparency. Parliament passed an Act to create an Anti-Corruption Commission in February 2004. In
responseto a Supreme Court directive on the separation of executive andjudiciary, the Government has
nominated members o f a new Judicial Services Commission. Initiatives to tighten financial management
are also a welcome step to reduce corruption. Specifically, the Government has decided to introduce
internationalaccounting standardsthrough a new Financial ReportingAct and to create an oversight body
to improve the quality of the accounting profession in the corporate sector. This should increase
transparency throughout the business sector and help lenders and investors channel funds to good
performing firms. Mindful of the difficult law and order situation, the Government has decided, too, to
introduce reforms to the police force. This should increase personal security, especially for the poor and
vulnerable, and improve the climate for business.       These are important initial steps and reflect the
Government's intentionto tackle the governance challenge ina concerted manner.

1.4      The Government has set ambitious targets for poverty reduction and social improvements.
Public spending has continued to give priority to health and education sectors and sectoral reforms are
underway to improve delivery of related services. The I-PRSP aimed to accelerate pro-poor economic
growth, foster the human development of the poor, advance the position o f women, strengthen social
protection, support local participation, reduce inequality and care for the environment. The preparation of
the full PRSP is now underway. Wide consultations are beingheld to ensure the participatory nature of
the PRSP. Thematic groups of senior officials, organized by the Poverty Focal Point in the Planning
Commission, are developing policies to achieve these objectives for consideration by the National
Poverty Reduction Council, chaired by the Pnme Minister. The Government i s consulting stakeholders
from civil society across the country inmeetings, arrangedbyDivisional Commissioners.

1.5      The Government aims to maintain macroeconomic stability during FY2005, and further
improve the climate for private investment and growth. The ongoing reform program will be based
again on a macroeconomic framework agreed with the IMF under its PRGF. It also intends to pursue its
structural reform agenda, especially to create an environment where a strengthened financial sector can
support private investment, inefficient state-owned firms are less of a drag on the economy, the
performance of the energy sector improves and the competitive environment i s enhanced. These are key
to improved growth, jobs and incomes. Increased public sector effectiveness, enhanced governance and
service delivery will be key elements o f the program to improve law and order, personal security and
better social services.

 1.6     The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), discussed by the Board in 2000, included
programmaticlending in support of reforms and selected investment operationsin alignment with
the prioritiesin the I-PRSP.The CAS Progress Report was presentedto the Board inJune 2003. The
current series of annual single tranche DSCs supports economy wide reforms. The main focus i s on the
growth agenda and on reforming the public sector. Reforms in the social sector are being supported
through other sector wide and investment operations, including an education sector adjustment credit.
Once the full PRSP i s completed, we anticipate moving to a PRSC, provided the Government's new
budget and expenditure management plans are in place.         A new CAS is being prepared alongside the
Government's own PRSP.

 1.7     Inview of satisfactory implementation of the DSC Iagenda and good progress with the DSC I1
reform agenda, the Government has requested for financial assistanceunder DSC 11. Inparallel, the IMF
i s responding to the Government's request to proceed with the Second Review o f the PRGF. The rest of
this document is organized as follows. Section I1 analyses recent economic developments, policy
performance under DSC Iand the challenges ahead. Section I11describes the Government's Poverty
Reduction Strategy, followed by a review in Section IV of the implementation record so far. Section V

          11.RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS,POLICIESAND CHALLENGES

 A. RecentEconomicDevelopments

2.1     Economic activity continuesto expand Growth hasbeen stimulated by a pick up inexport and
domestic demand. GDP, which grew by 5.3 percent inFY03, seems likely to have expandedby a further
5.5 percent in FY2004 (See Table 1). The rice harvest appears to have been at least 5.4 percent bigger
than in FY03.    Industrial output o f both large and small firms has continued to expand strongly.
Construction appears to have remained strong, reflected inrising demand for materials (cement and iron
rod). Higher exports and remittances have supported domestic demand, which has also led to increased
imports and a widening trade deficit. Risingremittances, however, have offset this and kept the current
balance in small surplus. Official reserves have risen to $2.6 billion, equal to about 3 months of imports.
The nominal exchange rate has stayed relatively stable against the U S dollar since the currency was
floated at end-May 2003. The exchange market was liberalized further in December 2003, with the
removalof the remainingmargin requirements for the opening ofletters of credit on imports.

2.2     Increasedcredit helpsboost domestic demand Bothhouseholds and companies havebenefited
from a strong increase in the availability o f credit from banks. This is likely to have been further
encouragedby a reduction o f the Statutory Liquidity Requirement inNovember 2003 from 20 percent to
16 percent. Bank Rate was lowered from 6 percent to 5 percent at the same time. Treasury bill rates
declinedby 3 percentage points during the first half o f FY03. Commercial bank lending rates to the
private sector declined only modestly, reflecting competition from higher yielding National Saving
Certificates (NSCs). The NSC rates were reduced in early-January 2004, and commercial bank lending
rates have subsequently eased. Outstanding credit to the private sector rose strongly inthe year to early-
2004.

2.3       Sluggish public spending limits fiscal stimulus. A fiscal stimulus was built into the FY04
budget, but slow budget implementationhas limited this boost to demand. Revenue collection grew by
9 percent duringthe first nine months of FY04 against the 15 percent targeted for the whole year, but the
pace of Annual Development Program (ADP) spending remainedalso slow. So, the FY04 budget deficit
i s likely to have been around 4 percent of GDP, compared to the targeted 4.8 percent.

2.4       Higherfood prices increase inflation.Consumer price inflation reached a year-on-year peak of
6.7 percent inNovember 2003, reflecting increased administered prices, higher imported food prices and
the taka's weighted nominal depreciation. The Government tightened fiscal policy and monetary
conditions. ADP spending on lower priority areas was trimmed by Tk 13 billion ( 6.5 percent of the
original ADP budget). The revised budget targeted an overall deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP. On the
monetary front, the Bangladesh Bank intensified reverse rep0 operations and Treasury bill sales to mop
excess liquidity. Inflation fell below 6 percent again, but the inflation target o f 4.5 percent for the year
was revisedupwards to 6 percent.

 B. PolicyPerformanceunder Development Support CreditI

2.5       Reforms emphasized in the Bank's first Development Support Credit (DSC I)included
implementation o f the macroeconomic program agreed with the IMF, financial sector strengthening,
privatization and restructuring o f State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), establishment of an energy sector
regulatory and pricingframework, andnumerous measuresaimed at improving government effectiveness,
integrity and transparency. Macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory. Progress has also been
made with structural reforms, though the Government has become more opportunistic, and some reforms
have been slower than anticipated, reflecting growing political and social tensions and inadequate
implementationcapacity.

2.6       The macroeconomic program remains on track. Fiscal and monetary policies have been
prudently managed during FY2004, and the authorities responded quickly to the emerging risk o f higher
inflation. In particular, the Government strengthened efforts to meet its revenue targets while curbing
spending. It increased excise on cigarettes and introduced tax stamps for soft dnnks and soap inMay. It
strengthened tax administration, particularly through the large tax payer unit (LTU) for income tax and
the new Central IntelligenceUnit.

2.7       Banking reforms are progressing. Financial regulation and governance, particularly in the
nationalized commercial banks (NCBs), and high and downwardly rigid interest rates were identified in
DSC-I as priority areas for reform. Special audits o f the NCBs show that nonperforming loans in these
banks are larger than official figures previously indicated, butNCBs closed a further 100 surplus branches
duringFY2004, andthe Government hasadheredbroadly to the reformstrategy agreedwith the Bank and
the IMF. A Financial Adviser has been appointed to help bring Rupali Bank to the point o f sale. A
private management team has been approved for Agrani Bank. Management advisers are being appointed
for Sonali Bank. Freshtenders, however, havebeeninvited for advisers to Janata Bank.

2.8       Power prices have been increased but adjustments to oil and gas prices were postponed
until very recently. The DSC Iidentified the need for key reforms in the energy sector. The Energy
Regulatory Commission Act has been passed by Parliament, and two Commissioners appointed to the
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), making it operational. A chairman is being sought. The
Government agreedto adopt an interimpricingframework for electricity, gas andpetroleumproducts as a
step towards commercializing the energy sector and to help guide the ERC. Electricity prices were
adjusted in September 2003. The Government increased kerosene prices in May 2004 by 17 percent to
align them with diesel prices in order to discourage adulteration, increased prices ofjet fuel by Tk.2 per
litre, furnace oil by Tk.4 per litre and bitumen by Tk.500 per metric ton. However, full adjustments under
the agreed formulae for gas and other petroleum productswere not made, reflecting Government concerns

about rising inflation and the adverse impact on the poor. Meanwhile, higher world prices have increased
costs substantially for Bangladesh PetroleumCorporation.

2.9     Closures of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have become more selective, although continued
progress is being made in reducing SOE losses. After.a strong move with privatization and closing
down large loss malung SOEs in FY2003, the privatization or closure of manufacturing SOEs has been
slower due to increased litigation and opposition to retrenchment in some areas, despite availability of
voluntary retirement schemes (VRS). Nevertheless, the Government has transferred 13 enterprises to
private buyers. It has also proceeded with selective "downsizing". Some 5 enterprises were downsized in
FY2004 with roughly 10,000 workers retired. Preliminary estimates suggest that manufacturing SOEs'
losses fell by 20 percent in FY2004. The Government has issued tender notices to privatize a further 5
firms.

2.10    Public administration reforms progress. Promotions of senior civil servants in 2003 gave
greater weight to merit than in past years. The Government has also created a Career Planning and
Training Wing inthe Establishment Ministry, which should improve the professional experience of civil
servants and enhance policy-makmg capacity. It has continued to freeze new hiring in non-essential
services and will abolish unnecessary positions. The Government continues with the complex task of
improving the management o f the judiciary and separating magistrates from the administrative cadre. A

2.11     Developmentsin Public Financial Accountability. The Public Accounts Committee has been
reconstituted and is functioning. Actions to strengthen the independence of the Comptroller and Auditor
General have been identified and are being pursued. Some Ministries, including Finance, Education and
Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, are publishingannual reports, but more work
needs to be done to rationalizethe reporting formats andprocedures and institute their timely submission
to relevant oversight entities. The FY05 Budget includes for the first time a summary of each ministries
activities during the past fiscal year and the programs and projects to be supported in the year ahead. It
would be desirable to strengthen the capacities of three city corporations for timely preparation of
financial statements, in line with the recent initiative o f Dhaka City Corporation, so as to make the
audited statements available to the public on a timely basis.

2.12     Broad reforms aimed to improve governance and reduce the scope for corruption. The
Government's reforms across wide areas o f the economy, including banhng, industry and public
administration, should reduce the scope for corruption, as well as improving the efficiency o f the
economy and the quality of service delivery. (See Box 1). Corruption undermines economic growth by
distorting the allocation of resources and by discouraging both domestic and foreign investors. Recent
World Bank research' suggests that poor governance, including weak law and order and corruption, is an
important factor explaining why Bangladesh has not realized its growth potential. In addition to the
actions listed in Box 1, the independent Anti Corruption Commission Act was passedby Parliament in
February 2004. The Commission will have a broadmandate to prevent corrupt practices and investigate
specific offenses. The Selection Committee for choosing a shortlist o f candidates for the three
Commissioners has been created. A date for implementation o f the Act now needs to be set, and the
commissioners appointed by the President on the advice o f the Prime Minister. These combinedmeasures
should help to curb corruption inmany fields, but this and future governments may also needto consider
other actions, including electoral reforms and greater transparency in political financing, as part o f a
wider dnve against corruption.

2.13     Social service delivery is being streamlined. The Government and development partners have
moved towards a more programmatic approach to delivering human services in order to improve
coordination and reduce transaction costs. In health, the government i s preparing a Health Nutrition
Population Sector Program (HNPSP). In primary education, the Government has collaborated with
development partners to develop PEDP-I1 as a sub-sectoral program approach. This initiative could
represent a major step in addressing primary education issues holistically. In secondary education, the
Government has made progress inundertakmg the first phase o f a medium-term reform agenda aimed at
addressingsystematic govemance issues that hinder raising quality and improving equitable access.

2.14     Overall impact of reforms has been positive. In terms o f outcomes, the overall impact o f
reform implementation has been broadly positive. The macroeconomic balances are much improved.
Lower fiscal deficits, exchange rate liberalization and supportive monetary policies have helped contain
the pressure on the balance o f payments despite rising imports. Higherremittances have helped increase
reserves from a low o f $ 1.6 billion in June 2002 to $ 2.6 billion inJune 2004. Inflation i s contained at
around 6 percent. Economic growth continues to recover from the low point in 2002 and i s estimated to
have risen to 5.5 percent in FY2004. This implies a per capita growth o f about 4.0 percent, which is
healthy by international standards although still lower than the rate needed for rapid poverty reduction.
Operating losses in manufacturing SOEs continued to fall in FY2004, although losses in some energy
companies, notably BPC, rose. Lower fiscal deficits and banking reforms are improving the financial
environment for private investment by contributing to a reduction in lending rates. As well, private
investment i s benefiting from better export incentives through exchange rate liberalization.

                      111. GOVERNMENT'S POVERTYREDUCTIONAGENDA

3.1      The Government has set ambitious targets for faster poverty reduction by 2015 (see Table
2). The Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, published in March 2003, stresses the need to create
more employment opportunities for Bangladesh's growing labor force through accelerating pro-poor
economic growth, fostering human development of the poor, advancing women, strengthening social
protection, supporting local government, reducing inequality and caring for the environment.

  Bangladesh, 2003)

3.2       The Government aims to speed economic growth. The Government is relying on faster growth
to achieve better outcomes for poverty and key social indicators than envisaged in the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs, for example, look for Bangladeshto halvethe proportion o f the
population living inpoverty from 59 percent in 1990 to 30 percent by 2015. The Government, however,
aims to reduce poverty to not more than 25 percent o f the population by 2015. This would require a
reductionof 3.3 percent a year, compared to 1.5 percent duringthe 1990s. Inthe I-PRSP, the Government
estimates that removing the impediments to growth could allow GDP to increase to 7 percent a year and
enable poverty to fall faster than inthe past.

3.3       The Government is also seeking to build on the progress already achieved during the 1990s
to achieve better education and health outcomes. The targeted rates o f improvement in adult literacy,
and primary and secondary school enrolments are all within the performance ranges reached during the
1990s. The health targets for lower infant and maternal mortality, higher life expectancy and reduced
child malnutrition, however, will all require an acceleration inperformance compared to past trends.
The mainfeatures ofthe I-PRSP were:

     0    Accelerating pro-poor economic growth to an annual rate of 6.5-7.0 percent or more over the
          next decade through balanced macroeconomic policies, leveraging globalization through liberal
          trade policies, creating an investment-hendly climate for the private sector, strengthening the
          financial system, promoting good governance, supporting agnculture and rural non-farm growth,
                                                 7

       encouraging a competitive manufacturing export sector and medium and small domestic
       enterprises,   improving infrastructure especially power and ports, developing information
       technology and scaling up microcreditprograms.
   0   Fostering human development of the poor through control of communicable diseases,
       widening access to essential health services with additional funding matched by improved
       governance, strengthening targeted food programs to combat malnutrition, strengthening
       incentives for school enrolment among the poor especially for girls, increasing resources for
       education with improvements ingovernance to raise its quality.
   0   Women's advancement and removing gender gaps will be promoted by combating negative
       sex ratios, e.g. in literacy, work force participation, property rights and access to credit, violence
       against women, high maternal mortality, restrictions on women's employment and economic
       opportunities.
   0   Strengthening social protection to help the poor cope with shocks to their incomes through
       improved social safety nets, helping workers retrenched during industrial restructuring,
       encouraging self-help community groups, providing the poor with access to credit to ease the
       burden of shocks, ensuring public health provision to those suffering from income loss,
       strengthening disasterprevention, mitigating the effects o f disasters and improving law and order
       to reduce the threat of violence to the poor, especially women.
   0   Supporting Local Government and broadening participation by creating popularly elected
       local governments with adequate financial and administrative powers to enhance local
       accountability.
   0   Policies and institutions for reducing inequality through distribution o f state-owned land,
       review o furbanland uses and improved landtenure and administration.
   0    Caring for the environment by balancing the livelihood requirements of existing populations
       with the need to avoid degradation of natural resources, and by integrating environmental with
       the Government's overall povertyreduction strategy.

3.4     The Government identified four main pillars for policies and institutional reforms to reduce
poverty in the I-PRSP. Development partners, including the Bank, are supporting these pillars in many
cases. See Annex C for details. The Government's policy priorities for FY04-FY06 inthe I-PRSP were

        Pillar1-Macroeconomicstability to accelerate pro-poor growth.
        Attain fiscal stability, raise revenue to 12 percent of GDP, spend about 5.1 percent o f GDP on
        poverty reductionprograms and increase investment enough to accelerate economic growth to 7
        percent. Improve the quality, auditing and tracking o f public spending. Continue to encourage
        remittances through legal channels and discourage money laundering. Promote export
        diversification. Rationalize import protection. Implement banking reforms, reduce SOE losses.
        Rationalize the power sector. Tackle infrastructurebottlenecks which hamper private-led growth.
        Improve transport, especially through better road maintenance and road links to rural markets.
        Meet growing needs for power through better regulation, financial restructuring o f major utilities
        and further involving the private sector in generation and distribution. Encourage private
        participation in ports and telecommunications. Involve local governments in design o f local
        infrastructure projects. Improve regulation o f telecommunications sector and enhance service
        quality through competition. Implement a comprehensive technology policy.

     0   Pillar 2: Improving governancefor sustaining growth and poverty reduction
         Strengthen political governance, especially the role of Parliament and its standing committees.
         Ensure decentralization and devolution o f power, defining functions of effective local
         government institutions with appropriate fiscal and administrative measures. Improve law and
         order. Introduce police reform. Promote unhindered information flow. Separatethe executive and
         judiciary. Create a Judicial Services Commission and Judicial Pay Commission. Modernize the
         legal system. Establish an Ombudsman and an Anti-Corruption Commission. Reform the civil
         service, based on professionalism, meritocracy and improved career planning. Improve economic
         governance and create an environment for private-led growth. Improveprocurement.


     0   Pillar 3: Investinginhuman development to enhance human capabilities
         Implement sector policies in education, health and social protection within a 3-year rolling
         medium-term macroeconomic framework. Increase education's share in government budget.
         Improve access and quality o f education. Track spending and monitor outcomes. Implement
         sector-wide healthprogram. Fillvacant posts for doctors and nurses. Track health spending.


     0   Pillar 4: Social protection for reducing vulnerabilities and improving income generating
         opportunities.
         Factor gender concerns into macroeconomic framework and sectoral strategies.Increasewomen's
         participation indevelopment. Strengthen social solidarity and capital. Improve safety nets for the
         poor and address their vulnerabilities through microcredit, public health, disaster prevention and
         mitigation, and help for retrenched workers. Assist the poor's access to assets, e.g. through land
         tenure reform and distribution of land and ponds to the landless. Support pro-poor rural housing
         and urban land use. Integrate environmentalconservation into the national development strategy.

3.5      Based on the experience on implementation o f the I-PRSP, the Government i s now preparingthe
fullPRSP.The Government hascreated 12Thematic Groups, supportedbythe PovertyFocalPoint inthe
Planning Commission and by consultants from the Bangladesh Institute o f Development Studies (BIDS)
and elsewhere to develop further the PRSP priorities. These Thematic Groups have reinforced ownership
o f the PRSP across the whole government. The Government now needs to devise detailed programs
within the Medium-term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to deliver the PRSP goals. Important next
steps include cross-sector coordination between the various groups to design the most effective programs
to achieve its aims, Cabinet agreement on the priorities for the next three years and budget allocations in
linewith these choices withinthe MTEF, startingwith the FY06budgetto be announced inJune 2005.

                                  IV. Implementationofthe I-PRSP

4.1      Implementation of the government's I-PRSP started inFY03. The summary of the Government's
reform record so far and the planned actions for the future i s contained inthe medium-term policy matrix
contained in Annex B. It i s important to note that the long list o f actions contained in the matrix i s the
Government's own program. The DSCs support only a subset of these reforms.

Pillar 1 Macroeconomic stabilitv to accelerate uro-Door growth
          -

4.2      The Government's strategy involves: creating a stable macroeconomic framework; opening the
economy through liberalizing trade; strengthening the financial system; resolving loss making enterprises
and promoting privatization; and strengthening infrastructure. Implementation o f related policies and
institutions will support growth through a stronger role for the private sector, greater international
competition, efficient financial services and lower cost of doing business.

(i)Creatingastablemacroeconomicenvironment

4.3      In June 2003, the Government adopted its first medium-term macroeconomic framework
affirming a commitment to macroeconomic prudence and deepening structural reforms. The framework
has recently been revised to reflect FY04 outturns and new information on the medium-term
macroeconomic prospects. The updated medium-term framework envisages an acceleration in GDP
growth: from 5.3 percent in FY03 to 5.5 percent in FY04 and FY05 and 6.0 percent a year thereafter.
Such faster growth would require a higher level of investment and more efficient investment decisions
than inthe past. Achievement of these, intum, assumes an acceleration inthe pace o f structural reforms
to tackle supply-side bottlenecks.

4.4      Fiscal policy aims to support growth while maintaining debt sustainability:The new FY05
budget presented to the Parliament on June 10, 2004, i s consistent with the agreed medium-term
macroeconomic framework. The Government intends to increase the fiscal deficit slightlyto allow higher
development spending inpriority areas -infrastructure and education inparticular. ADP spending will be
restructured, drawing on recommendations of the Public Expenditure Review Commission.* No new
unapproved ADP projects will be added to the program inorder to avoid undermining the quality of ADP
projects. The Government recently started implementing procurement guidelines that will enhance
transparency and expedite release of funds. The government i s strengthening monitoring and traclung
public expenditure to ensure effectiveness o f developmental spending. The Government also aims to
broaden its revenue effort to compensate for envisaged reductions in trade taxes. The increased fiscal
deficit, however, will be financed entirely by grants or highly concessional donor support. Domestic
public sector borrowingwill be restrained to 1.9 percent o f GDP from FY05 onwards to prevent crowding
out o fprivate investment.

4.5     Monetary policy will be directed to moderating inflation. Monetary prudence is to
complement the fiscal stance in order to ensure low and stable inflation and steady growth of liquidity,
creating conditions for sustainablecredit expansion to the private sector. Monetary growth is projected to
accommodate faster GDP growth with moderate inflation and a steady increase inexternal reserves. The
authorities are committed to intervening inthe exchangemarket only to counter disorderly conditions and
to buildreserves.To strengthen efficiency of the banlung sector, Bangladesh Bankhas started to publicize
market information, has developed a secondary market for government securities to circulate surplus
funds better among banks, and is worlung to improve the functioning of the money market. Future
actions to broaden and deepen the government securities market will include volume-based auctions and
introductionof long-termtreasury bonds.

4.6      Exports face MFA phase out. Exports, which rose rapidly during FY04, may increase less
quickly in FY05 after the MFA phase out, which presents considerable risks. The garments sector
accounts for about 75 percent o f exports. The impact o f slower exports growth on output will be limited
by the fact that imports to the RMG sector will be correspondingly lower, but employment could be
adversely affected. About 1.8 million workers, most o f them women, are employed directly by the sector
and another million workers by ancillary units relying mainly on the RMG sector. Export growth,
however, i s assumed to recover to a 4-5 percent a year over the medium-termin response to reforms
targeting domestic and external competitiveness. The Government recently set up a highlevel committee,
chairedby the Principal Secretaryto the Prime Minister, to develop a post-MFA strategy.

4.7      Fiscalconsolidationhas helpedrestoredebt sustainability: Measures since FY2002 to reduce
the fiscal deficit and rely more on highly concessional external financing rather than expensive domestic
borrowing mean that the current government debt stock now appears sustainable over the medium-term,
as long as the Government does not revert to costly domestic borrowing (see Table 4). The IMF estimates
that the sustainable level of the government's primary deficit i s 2.7 percent o f GDP. The Government's
fiscal correction lowered the primary deficit to 1.5 percent o f GDP inFYO3, and it i s projected over the
medium-term to remain around 2.2 percent of GDP, consistent with debt sustainability. To reduce
pressures on debt sustainability the Government i s taking measure to reduce losses from SOEs. External
debt obligations remain at comfortable levels and, given their largely concessional attribute, do not
present any risk to external debt sustainability. The ratio o f external debt-service to exports i s likely to
remain around 5.5 percent over the mediumterm.

 (i)Openingtheeconomythroughliberalizingtrade

 4.8     The Government has acted to put trade liberalizationback ontrack after a reversal inFY2004.
 Average protectionwas lowered from 25 percent to 22 percent inFY2003, butthis progress was partly
 reversed inFY2004 due to higher supplementary and regulatory duties reintroducedfor revenue reasons,

                                                 11

and averageprotectionedgedup again to 25 percent (Figure 1and 2). Newmeasures inthe FY2005
budgetannounced onJune 10puttrade liberalizationback ontrack byreducingthe top tariffrate from
30 percent to 25 percent along with substantialrationalization o fthe multi-tiered structure ofthe tariff
system. The scope ofthe para-tariff systemhas been substantially reducedandrationalized. Preliminary
estimates suggest that averagenominal protectiono f the new system will be lowered to 21 percent in
FY2005.

4.9      Quantitative restrictions (QRs), however, remain an important source o f protection, and the case
for tariff-conversion o f these i s strong. Bangladesh reduced substantially QRs to protect domestic
industryinthe early-l990s, butitremains the only country inSouth Asia with QRs on imports (see Table
5). About 2.2 percent o f tariff lines, equal to 0.5 percent of import value, are still subject to trade-related

QRs, including agricultural products, packaging and textiles. Almost 40 percent o f all QRs apply to
textiles. The readymade garment export sector imports textiles duty-free under bonded warehouse
facilities, but otherwise textile imports are banned. This cumbersome system is susceptible to corruption
through leakage into the protected domestic market, with rents accruing to illegal importers instead of
customs revenue to the Government. Bangladesh committed to phase out QRs on all 122 items in the
WTO Committee on BOP in 1999. The recently publishedImport Policy Order 2003-06, reduced the
number of items subject to QRs down to 60, but left many trade-related bans and restrictions in tact.
Following consultations with stakeholders inthe textiles sector, the Government has shown a willingness
to gradually phase out the textile import bansbybringingamendments to the PO. Removingmost o f the
QRs are an important reformpriority.

4.10     Bangladesh would also benefit from increased foreign investment, particularly in the face of the
phase out of MFA quotas, when new industries and market opportunities will be needed, and new jobs
created for those threatened with unemployment. The ban on FDI in the garment sector outside EPZs
needs to be lifted as a priority to support this sector post-MFA. The Government has shownits support for
this policy and is engaged with the principal stakeholders - Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and
Exporters Association- for a final decision.

(iii)Strengtheningthefinancialsystem
4.11     The Government aims to strengthen the financial system's ability to support privatesector
growth, in particular by restructuring the four relatively inefficient and under-capitalized nationalized
commercial banks (NCBs) and over time implement the agreedNCB resolution strategy. NCBs' share of
total assets in the banking system has fallen from 54 percent at end-1998 to 43 percent at end-2003.
Banks are pursuing large defaulters, and their non-performing loans have fallen from 40 percent o f loans
to 29 percent over the same period, but they remain under-provisioned and under-capitalized. Private
commercial banks have increased their share o f the market from 27 percent to 40 percent and have
reduced non-performing loans from 33 percent to 12 percent. In aggregate they are meeting their capital
adequacy targets. BangladeshBank is also improving the supervision of all banks. Enhanced facilities are
being made available for borrowing by small and medium enterprises which have increased output
particularly rapidly in recent years. Financial reporting and auditing standards are also to be improved,
which should give both lenders and investors greater confidence in their ability to assess companies'
performance.
4.12     Restructuringplansfor NCBshave evolvedsinceDSC-I.A new time-bound strategy hasbeen
agreed between the govemment, the IMF and the Bank. An Adviser has been appointed to bringRupali
Bank to the point of sale by December 2004. A management team i s being appointed to support Agrani
Bank. Management advisers have been selected for Sonali Bank, and fresh bids for advisers for Janata
Bank are beingsought. Iti s essentialthat potential investors should be "fit and proper" to runbanks.

4.13     BangladeshBank is bringing prudentialregulation into line with internationalstandards.
Currently, loans are classified as `sub-standard' ifnot servicedregularly for more than 6 months but less
than 9 months, as `doubtful' ifnot serviced for more than 9 months but less than 12 months and as `bad-
debt' if not serviced fully for more than 12 months. According to international standards, these limits
should be 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. The treatment o f interest on non-performing loans likewise
needs to be brought into line with international standards. Inparticular, banks may not count interest on
non-performing loans. Banks also need to wait 6 months before reclassifying restructured debts as
performing. The Cabinet has approved amendments to allow Bangladesh Bank to make the necessary
alterations to loan classification standards. Regulations on provisioning and capital adequacy generally
meet international standards, although these need to be extended to include contingent liabilities. Banks
are requiredto have met at least 50 percent o f the enhanced9 percent capital requirement by March 2004
and 100 percent by March 2005. Most o f the private commercial banks are on track, but the NCBs will
not be able to meet up the requirement. Bangladesh Bank i s hiringa supervision andregulation expert to
assist it in ensuringbanks' compliance with international standards. The expert is expected to start work
from mid-2004. Bangladesh Bank is also strengthening its own management. New national and
internationalhumanresource advisors started work earlier this year.

4.14     Enhanced credit proposed for small and medium enterprises. Bangladesh Bank is keeping
open its refinancing window for all private commercial banks, andrecently BRAC Bank usedthis facility
to expand its SME enterprise loan portfolio. The refinancing window is being used as an instrumentof
monetary policy by the Bangladesh Bank. With donor support, including from the World Bank, the
government i s making an effort to enhance the access of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to
institutional credit. Some banks, e.g. BRAC and MIDAS, had been trylng to lend to SMEs, but many
banks preferredto deal with larger clients, reflecting the perceived risks o f advances to smaller enterprises
and the higher cost of monitoring and supervising them. They also imposed stringent collateral
requirements. Finally, banks had an incentive to invest inhighyielding Government securities rather than
SMEs. One option being considered is to restructure the existing agricultural credit line available at the
Bangladesh Bank to include Small Enterprise Fund (SEF), supported by donors. Banks using SEF
resources would still decide their own lending and be accountable to shareholders and supervised by the
regulators.


                                                 13

4.15     The Government has embarked on a strong program to improve accounting and auditing
standards. It has endorsed a recent Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC), which identified
shortcomings in accounting and auditing regulations, divergences between national and international
standards, inadequate institutional capacity to support high quality corporate financial reporting,
weaknesses in the accountancy profession, including education and training, differences between formal
requirements and actual practices, and lack o f effective enforcement mechanisms. The Government has
strengthened the Stock Exchange Council (SEC) and has formed a high-powered Steering Group to
recommend amendments to the Companies Act 1994 and Insurance Act 1938, and draft legislation to
create an Accounting and AuditingStandards Board. The Government acknowledges that inthe long-term
it will needto implement the ROSCrecommendations, includingenacting anewFinancialReportingAct,
adopting international financial reporting standards and international standards on auditing for public-
interest entities3, and issuing simplified financial reporting standards for small and medium-sized
enterprises. It also intends to issue a code of ethics for professional accountants. It will establish an
independent Financial Reporting Council to monitor and enforce accounting and auditing standards and
codes. It will also strengthen the regulatory capacity of the SEC, Bangladesh Bank and the Controller of
Insurance.

4.16     The Govemment will support twinning arrangements for the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Bangladesh. It will back enhanced training programs by the Institute of Management Accountants of
Bangladesh, as well as improvements in the curriculum and teaching in accounting programs of
universities and colleges to familiarize students with international standards. The Bank has agreed to
harmonize its own technical assistance inthis area with the Asian DevelopmentBank, which proposes to
help strengthen regulatory and supervisory capacity o f the SEC and improve governance and operations
o f market intermediaries.

(iv) Resolvingloss-makingstate enterprisesand encouragingprivatization

4.17     The Government remains committed to dispose of all manufacturing SOEs and stemming
their losses. The Government has decided that a phasedapproach to downsizing may be needed and will
limit downsizing to 5-10 enterprises a year out of the 100manufacturing SOEs still inthe public sector.
New procedures will share any losses between the Govemment and private creditors. However,
Government i s stressing financial discipline to stem remaining SOE losses. They are being downsized,
rather being closed. This policy appears to have been driven by (a) the political fall out o f closing three
jute millsinKhulna at the end o f 2003 which resultedinriots, several murders, a political backlash by the
oppositionparties, and the subsequent re-opening o f these mills inthis politically volatile region, (b) the
concern that this wouldjeopardize the SOE reform agenda, and (c) firmer policy actions that downsizing
would not lead to the same political consequencesinthe lead up to the elections. Employment is growing
across the economy, but the Government is also seeking to encouragejob creationby small and medium-
size enterpriseswith the support o fthe Bank's Enterprise Growthand Bank Modernization loan.

4.18     Downsizing may create a moral hazard or "revolving door" ifretrenched workers may be rehired
as a result of political changes or pressure. The Government, however, considers that downsizing will
reduce substantially the fiscal drain fi-om SOE losses and will pave the way for full closure of these firms
after the elections. It points out that even where workers have been retrenched without full closure, no
workers have beenrehired. Safeguards against this include abolition o f any retrenched positions, a freeze
onnew SOEhirings, and arequirementthat the Ministry of Finance will approve any new SOE hirings.



   Public-interest entities may be defined by the nature of their business, their size, or by their corporate status by
virtue of their range of stakeholders. Examples of public interest entities might include banks, insurance companies,
investment funds, pension funds, publicly traded companies, and all other large-size enterprises including state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

                                                     14

4.19    The institutional aspects of implementationof privatization strategy is being re-examined.
The Privatization Act was passedin2000 and the Privatization Policy was gazetted in2001.The Cabinet
Committee, however, didnot approve draft regulations to implement the Act, and inJune 2003, it directed
that only loss-making SOEs which were still in business, would be handed to the Commission for
privatization. Most SOEs, however, tend to be closed before being liquidated or privatized, takmg them
out of the Privatization Commission's responsibility. They have been handed instead to line ministries,
which typically do not have the expertise to privatize them. The Privatization Commission's role, vis-a-
vis line ministries, needs to be defined, its procedures streamlined and its capacity enhanced through
stronger management expertise and staffing if the privatization process is to be reinvigorated. More
broadly a divestiture plan is needed to move more public enterprises into the private sector. Cabinet
endorsement o f such a plan would give a clear signal of the direction of Govemment policy. The limited
availability of domestic investors with bothcapital and know-how, however, is a constraint and increases
the needto pay special attention to the quality o f divestment.

(v) Enhancinginfrastructure -power, energy, roads, telecommunications, water

4.20    Key reforms aim to improve power supply and finances. The govemment has launched a
broad range o f measures to improve both the supply and finances o f the power sector, including a new
regulatory framework, reduced system losses, better account collections and tariffs that reflect better the
costs o f supplying differentconsumers. It i s setting intrain a crucial financial restructuring o f the sector
with a view to stemming lossesand reversing the build-upo f arrears. Itaims to attract private investors to
the sector, either directly or as joint venture partners. It has begun to unbundle distribution, with
management expertise being sought through international competitive bidding. Another initiative that
would increase available supply quickly would be a new framework allowing owners o f existingprivate
generators to sell surplus power to the public grid.

4.21     The Power Division o f the Ministry o f Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR)
estimates that generation capacity will have to increase to 5,400 MW in FY2007 from its present 3,600
MW to meet peak demand. The investment required by FY 2007 is likely to exceed $lbillion. The
Govemment expects about 30 percent to be financedby Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the rest
byjoint ventures and the public sector, including donors. Most of this financing, however, remains to be
secured.

4.22     The Energy Regulatory Commission has been established. The Energy Regulatory
Commission (ERC) Act was passedin2003. Two commissioners have been appointed, and a chairman i s
beingsought. The Commissionwill draft codes for operation o fthe power gndand distribution, as well as
formulate and approve tariffs and oversee licensing procedures. Interim arrangements, however, need to
be agreed to allow the MEMR to continue to set tariffs until the ERC is ready to assume this role. The
Bank will support the new ERC with technical assistance.

4.23     Improved collections improve revenues and curb losses. Poor power supply has been largely
due to inadequate maintenance ofpower plants, transmission lines, distributionnetworks andalso lack of
new investment. Technical performance has been inadequate. Financial performance has also been
inadequate. Prices, which do not cover supply costs, coupled with low revenue collection, have caused
liquidity problems. To address these concerns, the Government has urged utilities to reduce losses and
improve billing and collections. Power system losses have been reduced from 33 percent inFY2000 to
28 percent in FY 2003. Revenue collection increased from 91 percent o f bills to 97 percent during the
same period. Collection rose from 61percent o f energy generatedto 70 percent.

4.24     Urban household electricity tariffs raised and arrears reduced for government bodies. The
Government committed inMay 2003 to adjust power pricesto ensure the sector's efficiency and financial
viability and to eliminate price distortionsbetween various consumers. InSeptember 2003 the residential

                                                  15

urban tariff was adjusted. The Government has also taken actions to bring its arrears with the Power
Development Board (PDB) to 3 months level and intends to maintainthis standard. The Government has
also agreed to take similar actions for Dhaka Electricity Supply Authority (DESA) once DESA presents
reconciledclaims for outstanding arrears. To ensurethat arrears stay at the 3 month level, the Ministryo f
Finance has agreedto convene a meeting o f concerned power entities on a three month cycle andresolve
any outstanding arrears problems. Despite these progress, further actions are needed to strengthenpower
entity finances, including regular power tariff adjustments. The Government i s aware o f these challenges
and i s engaged in a dialogue with the Bank to help implement power sector reforms. The Bank proposes
to support this through a Power Sector Development Technical Assistance Project (PSDTA) - once
MEMR's Power Cell is inoperation. The project will helpthe govemment, (i) a time-boundplan
                                                                               prepare

                                       improve

4.25     The Government has begun to unbundle the power sector to encourage accountability and
efficiency. Transmission has been transferred to the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB). In
distribution, the Dhaka Electric Supply Company (DESCO) was established to take overDESA's role in
North Dhaka, followed by the West Zone Power Distribution Company with ADB financial support.
ADB is also supporting the corporatization of BPDB's North-west Zone before June 2004.                The
Govemment i s also interested to corporatize the remaining South and Central Zones. Ashuganj Power
Company, the first public generation company, has also recently been created. The Government also
intends to corporatize the Shiddhirganj power plant and three planned 120 MW peaking power plants.
The Government is seekingjoint ventures with the private sector to increase generation capacity.

4.26     Management sought internationally to improve distribution. Highlosses and poor collections
have been draining distributors' finances. Reforms to date which include corporatization followed by
appointment o f new managers recruited from the local private sector have not produced the expected
results. The Government, therefore, now intends to follow a different model for the proposed Southern
Zone Power Distribution Company. After transferring BPDB assets, a qualified firm will be selected
through intemational competitivebiddingto managethe new company for 3 to 5 years under performance
basedremuneration. Inaddition to meetingperformance targets, the management firm will berequiredto
manage the company's assets, train staff and improve institutional arrangements to encourage the long
term sustainability and financial viability o f the new company.

4.27
available in the country - mostly for back up supply to industry - but there are no policy guidelines for
         Private power plants could add to capacity. More than 500 MW of captive power plants are

these captive plants to sell power to the grid. These are neededto ensurethat low cost power i s purchased
first. Duringpeakhours, when demand exceeds supply, having a policy framework to allow BPDB to buy
power from these plants could help meet shortages. Other consumers might also be willing to buy power
directly from captive power plants if they could use the gnd for transmission. Policy guidelines on sales
by small power plants to BPDB and other customers, as well as use of the public sector transmission and
distribution system shouldbe introduced.
4.28     Gas price adjustments are being made. The Government agreed inMay 2003 that gas prices
would be increased in September 2003, March 2004 and September 2004. The September and March
adjustments were missed. To compensate for this the Government has agreed to adjust gas prices by 3.5
percent effective July 1,2004, with a further adjustment of 2.3 percent inJanuary, 2005. The Government
i s also preparing a gas strategy for complete restructuring o f the sector, in particular unbundling
transmission from exploration, production, and distribution. The gas transmission company has already
taken over all gas transmission linked to the gnd. The Bank will support the implementation o f the gas
strategy with technical assistance.

4.29    Price adjustments and restructuring are key for petroleum sector. Inrecognition of the key
role of the petroleum sector including its fiscal impact, the Government embarked in FY2003 on a
restructuring and reform program, including:

0   Adoption of a petroleumproducts pricingframework, under which domestic petroleumprices were to
    be linkedwith internationalimport parity price (IPP), and any increase or decrease was to be passed
    to consumersperiodically.
0   State-owned entities in the petroleum sector were to be restructured, and given full managerial
    autonomy to operateas corporate entities to serve their customers; and
0   Assets were earmarked for privatization so that a competitive and efficient petroleum sector could
    develop.

4.30    Implementation of these measures has been partial. The price of kerosene was raised to parity
with diesel prices in May 2004, but prices of other petroleum products have not been adjusted since
January 2003, even though international oil prices have risen steeply. The Government i s concerned
about the adverse social and political implicationso fpassingthrough such large, unanticipatedincreasein
world oil prices. To partially compensate BPC for resultant losses, the tax rate has been reduced.
Nevertheless, substantial losses will prevail if world oil prices stay at their present levels. Progress with
privatization i s also slow. Presently, the Government is focussing on privatization o f the lubricant
companies. A consultant has been appointed and its report i s due inend-June. The Government i s aware
that stronger efforts are necessary in the petroleum sector. Needed reforms require adherence to the
pricing formula, and an action plan for restructuring and privatization, with clear monitorable steps,
designatedresponsibilities and target dates announcedby the Government, andimplementation initiated.

4.3 1    The Government aims to improve performance of the telecommunication sector. Key
elements are liberalizing the licensing regime, establishing an interconnection framework and
restructuring the state company, BTTB. The new Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory
Commission (BTRC) has already announced a licensing framework, and new private sector PSTN
operators have recently been licensed, and VOIP operators will be licensed later in 2004. The BTRC has
also approved an interconnection framework, designed to enhance competition and encourage new
investment. The National ICT Task Force has endorsed the restructuringo f BTTB into a limitedliability
company by end-2004, and consultants to assist MOPT with this are expected to be appointed by July
2004. These rapid steps to improve telecommunications have been accompanied by a doubling in
penetration from less than 1 percent in 2002 to more than 2 percent in 2003. Long distance and
international access charges were reduced by 55 percent on May 1, 2004. The initial cost o f mobile
handsets, however, remains highat around $80, reflecting duties, fees, royalties andVAT, which excludes
many potential customers. The FY 05 budget has proposed to reduce the custom duty for the mobile
handsets, which will reduce its price.

4.32     Government approves water strategy. The Prime Minister has approved a long-term (25 years)
National Water Management plan ("),              which provides an integrated multi-sectoral approach to
water management. The plan i s for use by all agencies dealing with water ie. about 24 national
organizations and nine ministries, as well as development partners. The NWMP has significant
implications for investment inthe sector. Itaims to reduce vulnerability, improve drinkingwater, enhance
productivity of agriculture andfisheries, and enhance water transport (the cheapestmode).

Pillar 2: Improving governance for sustaining growth andpoverty reduction

4.33     Key reforms under this pillar aim to increase government effectiveness, accountability and
transparency. Bangladesh has suffered for too long from a reputation for poor governance - despite its
very real achievements in economic growth and poverty reduction. The country's reputation has
discouraged both domestic and foreign investment, holding back growth. The Government, therefore, i s

                                                 17

committed to improve governance across the board through wide and specific measures, as summarized
inBox 1earlier. Itis redefiningthe relative rolesofpublic andprivate sectorsbyremovinggovernment
involvement in commercial activities and transferring these to the private sector while allowing for
competition. Many o fthese government activities (e.g inbanlung, state-owned enterprises, infrastructure)
are not only inefficient but have been major sources of corruption. The Government aims to increase the
effectiveness o f its own operations through enhanced revenue mobilization, improved budgetary
processesand greater focus onperformance-related public spendingprograms. It also intends to provide a
more enabling environment for service delivery by improving the efficiency, integnty and accountability
of the public administrationthrough civil service reforms and ending the "culture of secrecy". It seeks to
enhance the independence andprofessionalism of the judiciary. Reforms of the police will be designed to
reduce crime and improve security for all.

(i)Enhancingrevenuemobilization.

4.34    Govemment revenues from tax and non-tax sources remain low compared to other countries in
South Asia and elsewhere, limitingthe public sector's capacity to meet demands for health, education and
infrastructure services. Modernizationof the National Board o f Revenue to make it effective and efficient

4.35     The Government is preparing a broad strategy to modernize the NBR to increase revenue
and enhance taxpayer services. Roughly 80 percent of government revenues come from tax collection.
The recent Revenue Reform Commission report suggested ways of improving revenue raising. Reports,
sponsored by donors (including the IMF and Bank) have concluded that revenue collection might be
raised by perhaps 30-50 percent, equal to 3 to 5 percent o f GDP, ifthe government sustained a medium-
term reform strategy. The NBR's current tax-by-tax organization i s not well suited for modem tax
administration. The Govemment, therefore, plans to move in phases towards a functional approach
instead, which would allow greater standardization o f work processes across taxes, more effective
division of labor, improved monitoring of staff, and reduced compliance costs for taxpayers. The strategy
should include institutional changes to strengthen the Board, secure better voluntary taxpayer compliance
but also improve audit and enforcement, coupled with humanresource changes, better business practices
and an information technology strategy. NBR might be given enhanced powers to manage its budgetary
and human resources. Such a strategy would need to be sustained over several years to be effective. The
Bank, together with DFIDand the IMF, is ready to support the NBR's efforts to modernize.

4.36    Organizational changes will need to be accompanied by improvements to the tax structure. A
strategic shift is necessary away from undue reliance on trade taxes, which distort incentives, to taxes
based on domestic activity, such as income tax and VAT. Coverage of income tax will need to be
expanded. The VAT base will need to be broadened, and its structure revisedto ensure that it i s indeeda
tax on value added rather than a surrogate excise tax. Trade taxes will need to be rationalized to reduce
the scope for rent-seeking and speed customs clearance. Currentinitiativesto enhancerevenue include:

    Income tax: In a country with 140 million population, only 1.6 million are registered taxpayers, and
    barely 500,000 pay income taxes. Some 90 percent o f income tax revenues come from 1000 tax-
    payers. The NBR, assistedby DFID's RIRAproject, has set up a Large Taxpayer Unitto facilitate tax
    recovery from the largest taxpayers.

    VAT: inthe new FY05 budget, the Government has announced the decision to create an LTU for
    VAT before the end of 2004. In the long-term, it would be more effective for the NBR to have a
    single LTU for both        income taxes and VAT, but in the short-term this was considered
    administratively infeasible.

     Trade taxes: The Govemment has taken significant steps to rationalize the tax system by reducing
    trade taxes in the FY05 budget. Nevertheless, there i s still scope for plugging revenue leakages in
    customs and facilitating swift clearance o f cargo through application o f IT systems, such as
    ASYCUDA++, which i s already operational in four key customs ports. It i s crucial that the system
    operate within a "closed loop" environment excluding any manual interference.

(i) ImprovingPublicExpenditureandPublicAdministration

4.37     Public administration and expenditure, together with financial controls, are key to public sector
management. Budget and expenditure management are being improved gradually, but improvements in
the state administration and civil service have been modest. A more comprehensive approach i s
warranted, where reforms can progress in small steps across a broad range o f related areas.            The
Government i s aware ofthe immense reformchallenge here and the long-term nature o frelatedreforms.

PublicExpenditureManagement

4.38     The government has made progress in the recent years in improving basic budget management
systems, especially budget execution. It has strengthened and rationalized the budget accounting offices,
while separating accounting and auditing functions. The information flow on budget transactions from
the local level to accounting offices andthen to the Ministry o f Finance has beenfacilitated and its quality
and timeliness improved. On-line electronic data transmission now allows the central government
accounts to be compiledandreportedwithin five weeks o fthe end o f eachmonth.

4.39     Major issues, however, remain especially inbudget formulation. The budget formulation process
remains an annual routine with little policy orientation.      It lacks a coherent strategic medium term
framework, where sector policies are linked to the allocation o f resources. More importantly, any effort
to introduce those linkages i s undermined by separate budget preparation processes for investments (the
so called development budget) andrecurrent expenditures (the revenue budget). The budget classification
remains very heterogeneous making it very difficult to identify any policy direction in the budget.
Further, the classification structure does not equally apply to the investment spending. These features
undermine the effectiveness of expenditures and make it difficult to address poverty reductionobjectives,
or improve budget and service outcomes.

4.40     Improving budget formulation to link policy planning and expenditure allocation should be a
priority, ifthe Government i s to embark on strategic initiatives such as the PRSP. The Govemment aims

                                                19

to start moving to a MediumTerm Expenditure Framework4 (MTEF). It has already reclassified around
50 development projects and aligned them with the overall budget classification5. It plans to continue
until all projects have been reclassified and the revenue and development budgets have been fully
realigned. With regard to budget strategy formulation, the government plans to proceed gradually by
usingselectedministries as pilots for preparation o f sectoral medium term expenditures. The goal is to
extend the approach to other sectors and then the entire budget. This effort will have to be accompanied
by changes in the budget process itself including, among others, the annual budget guidelines (call
notice), unifiedexpenditure ceilings for the revenue and development budget, and the unification o f the
budget preparation timetable for revenue and development budgets. The Bank is ready to work with the
Government on its public expenditure programs to achieve the PRSP priorities, e.g. inhealth, education,
infrastructure, public administrationand home affairs, including spendingon the police.

PublicAdministrationReform

4.41      Government prepares for reforms of public administration. The Committee on Good
Governance and Public Administration, chaired by the Finance Minister, has instructedsenior officials to
prepare recommendations for an appropriate remuneration structure for the public administration,
abolition of the culture of secrecy, adoption of citizedcustomer charters, development o f accountability,
introduction of performance standards, accelerateduse of information technology, restructuring o f Wings
invarious ministries, the institution of meritas the criterion for appointment andpromotion, elimination
of inter-cadre discrimination, revision of the age o fretirement and the use o f training. This initiative gives
the opportunity for a wide overhaul o f the public administration. Recommendations are due to be sent to
the Prime Minister for approval. The Committee i s also consideringa report, covering not only personnel
management, remuneration and training o f civil servants but also the use of information technology in
government and ministries' wider functions. Four ministries have recently beenreorganized into two.

4.42      The Government recognizes that a more effective public administration is crucial for improving
services and reducing poverty. Under the program, supported by DSC-I, all routine recruitment against
vacant posts has been stopped, except for essential staff such as nurses, doctors and teachers. Recruitment
of staff in key posts on contract from the private sector continues. Promotions of senior civil servants
recently have given greater weight to merit. The Government has also decided to group ministries with
similar technical and professional staff requirements into "clusters", and transfers o f civil servants with
these skdls will be concentrated within the relevant clusters to allow them to gain deep professional
experience. The Government i s also outsourcing services, such as security guards and cleaning. The
complexity and the need for coordination, broad support and consensuson reforms, however, suggest that
stronger "driving" institutions are merited at the center of the government to ensure implementation.

(iii)Improvinggovernmentfinancialaccountability

4.43       Government initiates reforms on Public Financial Management. Significant reforms have
been made in public financial management. The ongoing Financial Management Reform Program
(FMRP), funded jointly by DFID and the Netherlands, aims to (i)strengthen auditing and improve
parliamentary scrutiny (ii)enhance fiscal management and the regulatory framework (iii)                         improve
expenditure management in line ministries and the timeliness and quality o f government accounts. The
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) o f the Bank and UNDP provided a basis for key


 A mediumterm expenditure framework is a new approachto budgeting which aims to linkpolicyplanningwith
the allocation o fresourcesthrough the budget.
* Overall   budget classification inthe context o fthis note refers to the classification o f expenditures into
a h s t r a t i v e units, functional, sub-functional and economic categories according to the General Financial
Statistics or UNinternationally recognized standards.
6The quality o f financial accountability andtransparency inBangladesh was assessed and improvements
recommended ina Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) carried outjointly by the World Bank and
                                                          20

policy reforms through DSC-I and an Institutional Development Fund(IDF) grant. Further reforms will
be supportedthrough DSC I1andthe Economic Management Technical Assistance Project.

4.44     A recent constitutional amendment raisedthe retirement age of Comptroller and Auditor General
(C&AG) to 65 years or full five years o f service. The auditing and accounting functions have been
broadly separated. The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) no longer reports to the C&AG, although
the latter still reports to the Finance Ministryfor budget andmanpower. Some accounting responsibilities
also remain with the C&AG in defense and railways. Interchangeability of staff in audit and accounts
functions still riskconflict o f interest, butthe Government does consider separation a priority. The C&AG
has prepared a strategic actionplan, whichhas been endorsedby the Finance Ministry and now needs the
approval o fthe Establishment Division.

4.45     The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has been re-established and is functioning. The recent
welcome decision of the major opposition party to rejoin Parliament and its committees should help
strengthen independent parliamentary oversight. Recently the PAC has taken steps to clear backlogs for
1972-1990. It is also reviewing audit reports according to the importance of the issuesraised, irrespective
of the year. Infuture, the Ministry of Finance will also have discretion to withhold funds from agencies
that fail to resolve satisfactorily within 180 days serious financial irregularities identified inaudit reports,.
The PAC has suggested formation of a cell inthe government to monitor prompt implementationo f PAC
recommendations. Some secretarial and technical support i s being provided to the PAC, but the
committee will be challenged to become fully effective, review numerous audit reports in a timely way,
issuerecommendations anddirections.

4.46     Budget MonitoringCommittees have been formed insome ministries and Financial Management
Units are being set up in five ministries in addition to seven previously done. The FMRP will help
develop these FMLTs, depending on their ADP budgets' size. Ownership by ministries and provision of
human and material resourceswill be crucial for their sustainability. A central reconciliationunit has also
been established in the office of CGA to improve the quality o f Government accounts. The envisaged
adoption and implementation o f International Public Sector Accounting Standards should enhance
reliability and transparency o f Government financial statements. InApril, 2004 the Ministry o f Finance
issued a notification to all concerned ministries that all projects utilizingdonor funds through the Special
Account must submit a bank statement to the concerned CAO in addition to sending monthly accounts.
Furtherprogress is needed to computerize all financial transactions inthe Government and the bankmg
system.

4.47      Some selected ministries (ERD, MOF, Education and LGED) are publishing annual reports
though they are not in standard format and are not submitted to parliamentary committees. More work
needs to be done in this regard to rationalize the reporting formats and procedures and to formalize the
submission of these reports to oversight committees within a reasonable time. The ongoing FMRP
program will provide some support in this regard. There i s considerable backlog in the preparation of
financial statements by city corporations where substantial amount o f capacity buildinghas to take place
before they are mandated to publish these statements. Intervention in this area is being considered for
improving the capacity o f the Dhaka City Corporation through the ongoing Dhaka Urban Transport
Project. Boththese reforms will take 2 to 3 years to yield tangible results.

(iv) Improvingprocurement

4.48      Under the Public Procurement Reform Project, the government established a Central Procurement
Technical Unit (CPTU), with staffing funded from its own resources. Meanwhile, it completed two


UNDP in2001and inthe Report onthe Observance of Standards and Codes (R0SC)- Fiscal Transparency Module
completed inJune 2003 bythe IMFwith Bankparticipation.
                                                   21

critical actions under the project: (i)
                                      mandated newprocurement regulations inOctober 2003, and (ii)       and
issued its implementation procedures in March 2004.          The procurement approval process, revised
delegation of financial powers, and key standard bidding documents are at the final stage of approval/
issuance. As regards capacity building, CPTU and its consultants (LO, Turin) in collaboration with
Bangladesh Institute of Administration Management (BIAM) developed a critical mass o f 16 Training o f
Trainers (TOTS)in the first batch, provided short-training on the Regulations to 88 senior-staff, and
conducted main procurement training course on goods/ works/ services for 205 staff in seven batches
duringOctober 2003 to April 2004. CPTUhas established a website (phase I)and is publishingcontract
awards above $200,000. All are helping improve the procurement environment

(v) Freeing access to information.

4.49     The I-PRSP indicated that the Government plans to promote unhindered flow of information
across Government agencies, private sector and civil society.           The Cabinet Committee on Good
Governance and Administrative Reforms recently identified as a priority reforms to abolish the secrecy
culture in civil service. The Official Secrets Act o f Bangladesh has been reformed to reduce its scope.
The Law Ministry i s also loolung at international experience with a Freedom of Information Act to
examine its importance andrelevance to the Bangladeshi context.

(vi) Actions to combat corruption

4.50     The Government is acting to combat corruption. Reforms of the banking system, state-owned
enterprises, public procurement and the tax system, especially Customs, and the various initiatives
underway in sectors such as energy, education and health should reduce scope for corruption. Planned
measures to increase transparency o f corporate reporting and improve quality o f accounting and auditing
should impose greater discipline on the private sector. Improvedpublic financial management and public
accounting shouldlikewise reduce the scope for corruption inthe Government itself. Increased scrutiny of
service delivery in major sectors, such as education and health, should reduce leakages of public
 spending. Reestablishment of the Public Accounts Committee, the separation o f the accounting and audit
 functions within government, and the strengthening o f the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General
 should improve scrutiny o f the public sector. In addition, the Government obtained Parliamentary
 approval o f the Anti-Corruption Commission Act inFebruary 2004 to create an independent commission
to address corruption. The Act has been gazetted and a Selection Committee appointed to establish the
 Commission. The Selection Committeehas already begun its work.

 (vii) Separating Executive and Judiciary

 4.51    Government initiates steps to comply with Supreme Court directive. Separation o f the
judiciary from executive control is important to establish the proper rule of law, but has been a
 contentious issue inBangladesh. Compliance with successive Supreme Court directives has been gradual
 andincomplete. Mainelements o f the Supreme Court rulingin1999 were (i)        security o ftenure for judges,
 (ii) ofsalary,(iii)
      security               institutional independence o f the Subordinate Judiciary from Parliament and
 the Executive,. (iv) recruitment to the judiciary by a separate Judicial Service Commission, and (v)
 financial independence of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court already has its own budget, and
 SupremeCourtjudges are independent o f the Law Ministry. Subordinatejudges, however, are still subject
 to the Law Ministry for salaries, transfers and promotions etc. Creation of a separate Bangladesh Judicial
 Service (BJS), therefore, needs to be gazetted without delay. More than 300 posts are vacant in the
 subordinate judiciary, contributing to long delays in civil trials and criminal appeals, although the newly
 created Speedy Trials Tribunals have accelerated disposal of serious criminal cases. Recruitment to the
 BJS will be done by a new Judicial Service Commission. This committee was formed in early-2004,
 although the rules governing its responsibilities have not been published. Under the Constitution, the
 Supreme Court will beresponsible for superintendence of the BJS, but rules governing the BJS still need

                                                 22

to be promulgated by the President. A Judicial Pay Commission also needs to be created, but may be
delayed by concerns about possible salary differences with civil service pay scales. The Supreme Court
ruling o f 1999 also stipulated thatjunior magistrates shouldbe separate from the Executive. The Supreme
Court already supervises the judicial functions of both full-time Metropolitan magistrates and the judicial
work o f part-time district magistrates, whose primary responsibility i s as Assistant Commissioners. Both
sets of magistrates - about 600 - remain subject to the Establishment Ministry for transfers, promotions
etc. N o timetable hasbeen set for the complex task o f separating these magstrates fiom the Executive.

(ix) Reforming the police to enhance security for both businesses and the poor

4.52     The Government plans a program to reform the police. The Ministry o f Home Affairs i s
planning a program to reform the police force as lack o f personal security not only undermines business
confidence but also affects the poor particularly adversely. Discussions are presently underway with
several donors on how support can be provided for this initiative and The Government i s loolung at
examples ofpolice reform implementedinother parts o f the world.

Pillar 3: Investinginhumandevelopment to enhance humancapabilities

(i)Deliveringbetterhealthservices

4.53     The Government has adopted a revised reform programinthe health sector. Bangladeshhas
made impressive health gains over the last few decades and health indicators compare favorably with
other countries o f similar income levels. Yet, important indicators such as fertility rate and immunization
coverage have stagnatedduringthe past decade, the incidence of injuries andnon-communicable diseases
i s increasing, and tuberculosis (TB) and HIV/AIDS are posing new threats to people's health and
productivity. Recent evidence shows that inequities in health are increasing with a substantial under
consumption o f basic services such as child and maternal care among the poor. A rising population
(estimated to reach 200 million in 2025) means that bold actions will be requiredto reach the MDGs. In
June 2003, the Government decided to take a fresh look at the sector wide approach initiated in 1998 and
formulated a revised reform agenda, based on the I-PRSP7. The new program underscores the need for
better targeting resources to the poor, outsourcing basic services to privateproviders andpiloting demand
interventions. The Government intends to make public services more accountable at the local level,
although this will require careful study o f fee systems, as well as budgeting and accounting provisions.
The Government will also provide incentives and accreditation systems to expand provision o f quality
tertiary care. It aims to address urgently governance issues inthe sector. The revised agenda reverted to
the earlier decision to unify the Health and Family Planning wings of the MOHFW, implemented in
FY2003 but then reversed. Implementation o f the new agenda has been slow but i s expected to take off
with the start of the next program inJanuary 2005. Once the next sector program is agreed and financing
inplace, capacity and skills inthe sector shouldbe reviewed, including humanresources development,
andinstitutional andincentive structures to support good management.

 (i)Improvingeducation

4.54      Bangladesh has made significant progress, especially in increasing access and gender equity at
both primary and secondary levels. The tertiary sector, while small, has grown rapidly - especially with
the growth o f private universities. Poor quality and outcomes, however, mar much o f the education
 system. Attendance rates are low (62 percent), teacher absenteeism i s high (up to 20 percent), the
 curriculum i s o f limitedrelevance, and teacher-pupil contact time i s very low. Fewer than 10 out o f every
 100 students entering school complete grade 12. Governance i s a key constraint. Accountability and
 incentives, and checks and balances for teachers and administrators are weak. Neither the Ministry o f

                                                  23

Primary and Mass Education (MoPME) nor the Ministry of Education (MoE) has sufficient capacity to
monitor quality o f instruction. Governance problems in teacher recruitment, training, and supervision
contribute to low motivation o f the teachers to teach and highabsenteeism. Community involvement in
education has increased, but no significant power has yet been devolved to communities or local
governments at either the primary or secondarylevels.

4.55    New strategies aim to enhance the quality of education and access.           The Government's
medium-term strategies for primary and secondary education aim to enhance quality and ensure equitable
access to education. Key elements include greater accountability and transparency, more emphasis on
monitoring and evaluation, and improving teacher quality through better recruitment and training.
Education reforms focused on enhancing accountability at the secondary level have been implemented.
Criteria have been developed for independent agencies to evaluate non-government schoolskolleges to
receive government recognition and subsidies. Textbook production for grades 11 and 12 has already
been privatized and the Cabinet has approved a phased textbook privatization for grades 6-10, to be
completed by FY2008. New national procurement guidelines have enhanced transparency incivil works
contracting.

4.56    Standardized examinations have been instituted country-wide at Grade 6. Achievement i s also
being measured through standardized examinations inGrade 8. The Government has agreed to increase
enrollments and improve the quality of education in the non-formal sector for primary age children.
MoPME i s also implementing the Primary Education Development Program, supported by 11
development partners. The Cabinet has approved an incentive system to attract and reward qualified
teachers. Both MoPME and MoE plan to improve incentives for teachers. Ministers are also discussing
how to reduce unduly frequent transfers of staff. The separation of teachers from the civil service could
be animportant step indevelopment o fthe profession.

4.57    Both MoPME and MoE are also moving towards more devolved governance, where central
government will be responsible for formulating policies, financing, setting quality standards, and
monitoring and evaluation, while local government will be responsible for administering the system and
monitoring school performance. MoE and MoPME are institutingperiodic surveys to track outcomes and
public expenditures. Stipend programs are to be evaluated with a view to improve their design and
effectiveness. Standardized and.transparent criteria are being developed for teacher recruitment. A task
force will also develop a strategic plan for the higher education, which will define the roles of public
andprivateuniversities, as well as funding.Improving governanceis embedded inthe reforms. Better
incentives for the financing and provision o f education, and greater accountability should reduce rent-
seelung opportunities and enhance cost-effectiveness.

Pillar4: Social Drotectionfor reducing vulnerabilities andimproving incomes

4.58    High poverty leaves many households vulnerable to falls in income as a result o f sickness,
seasonality o f earnings and employment, and natural disasters including floods, droughts and cyclones.
The poor are also much more vulnerable to environmental degradation with severe adverse health
consequencesresulting from polluted water and air. The poor's ability to cope with these i s hinderedby
low levels o f education, highnumbers o f children out of school, and limited access to land and modem
amenities. They are highly concentrated in low-paying, physically demanding, and socially unattractive
occupations. Children, the elderly, and women who are widowed, divorced or separated, are especially
vulnerable. Government policies to promote economic growth and invest inhuman capital offer the best
prospect of reducing poverty in the medium to long-term. However, safety net programs and social
protection are also needed.    The main elements of the Government's social protection strategy include:
introduce gender concerns into macroeconomic framework and sectoral strategies; increase women's
participationindevelopment; strengthen social solidarity and capital; improve safety nets for the poor and
address their vulnerabilities through microcredit, public health, disaster prevention and mitigation, and

                                                 24

help for retrenched workers; assist the poor's access to assets, e.g. through land tenure reform and
distribution o f land and ponds to the landless; support pro-poor rural housing and urban land use;
integrate environmentalconservation into the nationaldevelopment strategy.

 (i)Creatingahealthyandsafenaturalenvironment:

4.59      The Ministry o f Environment and Forest (MoEF) and World Bank are to produce jointly a
Country Environmental Analysis (CEA). This will focus on improving the health o f the poor, ensuring
the sustainability o f the natural resources on which they depend, and reducing their vulnerability to
naturaldisasters. The healthpriorities will include (i)  acute respiratory infections, due largely to exposure
to smoke from biomass fuels, (ii)     diarrheal disease caused by poor sanitation, and (iii) threat of
                                                                                                 the
arsenicosis. Natural resource o f gravest concem to the poor include depletion o f open-water capture
fisheries, and soil degradation. Climate change i s likely to increase the frequency of flooding and
cyclones, and hence the need to limit the poor's vulnerability. Current environmental priorities for
poverty reduction are largely rural, but this will change as Bangladesh's populationbecomes increasingly
urban, and industrial production contributes an ever-growing share o f the economy. The CEA will
examine priority actions necessary to strengthen environmental management o f urban and industrial
pollution.    These measures are likely to focus first on improving govemance through increased
transparency in environmental decision-making, and then on extending the coverage of environmental
managementonce its quality has improved.

4.60      Air quality inDhakaimproved significantlywiththe removalof 2-stroke 3-wheelers inDecember
2002, but the benefits are being lost due to an influx o f diesel commercial vehicles, many o f which are
gross emitters o f particulate matter (PM). Annual average P M levels in 2003 were more than double the
proposed health-based Bangladesh air quality standards. Other pollutants are much lower than the
proposed standards. The Ministryof Environment and Forest, however, introduced a Special Regulatory
Order (SRO 88) supposedly to control air pollution inMarch 2002. This would require the compulsory
installation o f catalytic converters or diesel particulate filters on all vehicles. These measures, however,
would not be effective in reducing PM emissions with the current fuel quality and vehicle fleet
composition. They would cost probably inexcess of US$100 million countrywide, without corresponding
environmental or health benefits. This SRO was issued non-transparently and without adequate
consultation with stakeholders and professional bodies. A moratorium should be put on its
 implementation, and an independent technical review o f its efficacy conducted. A time-bound policy for

pollution - should be announcedto address the air pollution probleminDhaka.
 the removal o f grossly polluting diesel vehicles - which are knownto contribute disproportionately to P M


                        V. THE BANK'SCOUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY

 5.1      The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy is geared to moving towards programmatic
 lending in support of reforms and selected investment operations and technical assistance in
 alignment with the priorities inthe I-PRSP. The CAS Progress Report, presentedto the Board inJune
 2003, suggestedthat the Bank should provide wide-ranging mixture o f lending and non-lending support
 to the four pillars o f the Government's poverty reduction strategy, often in collaboration or alongside
 initiatives by other members o f the active and varied donor community in Bangladesh. Within lending,
 we are employing a flexible mix o f programmatic assistance, investment lending and TA credits. The
 Development Support credit, in turn, will support further improvements in policies and institutions.
 Following the completion o f the full PRSP, expected in FY05, a new CAS will be prepared. h e x C
 details how the Bank and other partners are coordinatingsupport for implementation of the I-PRSP.

 5.2      The Bank is supporting the Government's efforts to sustain macroeconomic stability and
 accelerate pro-poor growth under Pillar 1 ofthe I-PRSP, alongside the PRGF providedby the JMF. The
 Bank i s worlung closely with DFIDto help modernize the NBR and enhance its revenue raising capacity

                                                  25

through the new Economic Management Technical Assistance Program. On the expenditure side, the
Bank has advised the Government on the observance of standards and codes in public accounting,
alongside IMF encouragement of fiscal transparency. DFID, in turn, has begun a five-year Financial
Management Reform Program to improve financial performance in both the Finance Ministry and line
ministries. The Bank has also focused on strengthening the financial sector through assisting Bangladesh
Bankwith a Sector InvestmentLoan andhelpingto finance teams o f advisers to restructure and ultimately
divest most o f the NCBs through its Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization operation. The ADB is
workmg to buildcapacity at the SEC. The Bank's EGBMproject i s also designedto finance the voluntary
redundancy costs o f workers retrenched from loss-making SOEs, as well as encourage creation of new
opportunities insmall and medium-sized enterprises. Other donors are encouraging development o f SMEs
and business services.

5.3      Improved infrastructure is essential to the Government's strategy to accelerate growth.
Energy, especially power, is a key element of this. The Bank is supporting restructuring of the power
sector with a new Power Sector Technical Assistance operation, alongside support for improvements in
the energy regulatory environment by ADB and USAID. Many donors are supporting generation,
transmission and distribution, including private participation, and the Bank i s preparing a Chittagong
Power Distribution Project for FY2005. The Bank also has an ongoing project to support renewable
energy development inrural electricity, while other donors are extensively involved with us inwidening
the coverage o f rural electrification. The Bank is providing technical assistance to modernize the
telecommunications sector and corporatize BTTB. The Bank is providing financial support through
investment loans for private involvement in infrastructure, Dhaka urban transport, municipal services,
roadrehabilitation and maintenance, as well as ruraltransport improvements. Other donors are supporting
roads, railways and rural infrastructure. The Bank is financing fisheries development, while ADB, DFID
and UDAIDare supporting improvements inagricultural productivity.

5.4      Under Pillar 2 o f the I-PRSP, improving governance, the Bank has provided technical assistance
to design and implement new public procurement regulations and is helping to finance improvements in
capacity in the legal and judicial systems. It has also worked with UNDP to assess financial
accountability and to strengthen the office of the Controller and Auditor General. Other donors are
engaged across a wide range o f governance improvements, including the UN, EU, Norway and USAID
promoting democracy, ADB providing technical assistance to help establish the Anti-Comption
Commission, DANIDA supporting creation of an Ombudsman, ADB, the UN and USAID supporting
decentralization efforts, and DFIDfinancing the training o f senior civil servants.

5.5      Under Pillar 3 of the I-PRSP, investing in human development, the Bank plans to finance a
major education sector adjustment loanto improve the quality o f secondary education. It i s also helpingto
finance a second sub-sectoral Pnmary Education Development Program, financed by an ADB-led
consortium o f 11 donors. The Bank i s planning a new health sector loan with Canada, the EU, Sweden
and DFID. It i s helping to finance the national nutrition program and funding HIV/AIDS prevention,
alongside the UN,USAID and DFID. The Bank i s working alongside other donors to improve water and
sanitation services. Inparticular, it i s financing arsenic mitigation measures, alongside Australia, Sweden,
Switzerlandand USAID.

5.6      Under Pillar 4 of the I-PRSP, social protection - reducing vulnerabilities and improving
income generating opportunities, the Bank is financing a Social Investment Program and Microfinance
11.It is providing a Learningand Investment Loan for improving financial services to the poor. The ILO
andUNDP are supporting the Government's preparationof an actionplan to generate employment inthe
non-formal sector. The LO, Norway, USAID and DFID are helping the Government develop a plan to
provide decent work and eliminate child labor. The Government has also created a new Cell within the
Police Department to address trafficlung in women and children. The ADB i s helping with the
Government's social protection policies. Canada, Norway, DFID and the UN are supporting rural

                                                   26

poverty alleviation. The Bank is providing a LE for conserving aquatic biodiversity. A large number of
other donors are supporting biodiversity, conservation and improving resource management. Finally, the
UN,theEU, the Netherlands, Norway, DFIDandUSAIDare supportingmoves to improvehumanrights.

5.7     The CAS Progress Report, discussed by Executive Directors in June 2003, indicated that
Bangladesh had met the conditions for Base Case lendingo f $550 million inFY2004 and $700 million in
FY2005. These conditions include satisfactory macroeconomic performance, progress with structural
reforms and improvedportfolio performance. Inorder to move to a HighCase of $750 million inFY2004
and $900 million inFY2005, the CAS ProgressReport looked for continued macroeconomic stabilityand
further progress in governance and in at least two priority sectors. The governance improvements
included malung the independent Anti-Comption Commission operational, separating public audit and
accounting, and reforming procurement. Among the four priority sectors, triggers included satisfactory
progress with reforms in the financial sector, energy and infrastructure, state-owned enterprises and the
social sector, especially priority actions ineducation and health.

5.8     A new Country Assistance Strategy is being prepared and will be aligned with the emerging
PRSP. Consultations with stakeholders have begun. Continuedprogrammatic lending for macroeconomic
management and structural reforms are again likely to be at the center of the new strategy with strong
emphasis onbothgovernance and improvements inthe social conditions o fthe poor.

5.9     Non-lending instruments: A variety of non-lending instruments are being used to help
implement our CAS and support the government's I-PRSP. We have now completed the full range of
core diagnostic ESW- - Poverty Assessment (2002), Public Expenditure Review (2002), Development
Policy Review (2003), Country Procurement Assessment Review (2001) and Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (2001). Other related diagnostic works have also been completed recently
including the Financial Sector Assessment (2003) and the Review of Standards and Codes (2003). These
analyhcal work have provided the basis for our policy dialogue inrelated areas while also underpinning
the reforms in DSCs and inputs to the PRSP process. Focused diagnostic work on a range o f public
sector management including: Taming the Leviathan (2001); The Challenge o f Corruption inBangladesh
(2001), A Citizen's Score Card (2002), have provided considerable insights on the core challenges inthe
public sector and ideas for reforming them. Inprivate sector, the Investment Climate Assessment, the
FSAP and related sectoral reports on trade, agriculture, nonfarm employment, health sector and public
enterprises have provided the analytical underpinnings for sector policy dialogue and reforms in these
critical areas o f reform. New work on export competitiveness will strengthen the dialogue on trade
reforms Overall, the analytical basis for the current phase o f reforms i s quite solid. As reforms deepen,
more sector work will be needed inpublic service delivery reforms, infrastructure development, NGOs,
micro-credit, water resource management andpublic private partnerships.

                     VI. REFORMSSUPPORTEDBYTHE PROPOSEDCREDIT

6.1 The proposed credit is the second in a planned series o f programmatic operations inthe context o f a
medium-term reform framework, alongside the PRGF of the IMF. The DSC-I1 uses the framework o f
DSC-I, focusing directly on the implementationof the first two pillars of I-PRSPdealing with growth and
public sector effectiveness. Reforms under the third and fourth pillars dealing with human development
and social protection are pursued through other planned and ongoing operations (education sector credit
and investment operations). It i s important to note that these pillars are inter-related and actions are
needed on all fronts to achieve sustained progress with MDGs. Thus, without rapid, broad-based growth
(Pillar-I), consumption poverty cannot be reduced. Also growth will provide the resources needed for
implementing human development and social protection programs (Pillars I11 and IV). Similarly,
governance and public sector improvements (Pillar II)      are critical for improving the investment climate
requiredfor rapid growth as well as for improving public service delivery. Ifthe Govemment i s able to
complete the full PRSP by December 2004, we will move to a PRSC framework with commensurate
changes inthe design o f the operation. Additionally, the triggers for DSC-I1 and the triggers proposed

that the Govemment has adapted its pace of reformin some areas, while inother - sometimes new areas -
for DSC-I11 aim to build on the experience with implementation of DSC-I. Inparticular, it recognizes

it is ready to move forward morerapidly.

Lessons from DSCI

6.2       The experience duringthe past year with the measures supported under DSC-Ihas generally been
favorable, as notedinparagraph2.14 above. Several lessonshave emergedfrom this implementation.

      0   Need to maintain flexibility in the design and implementation o f reforms to take account o f
          unforeseen extemal and domestic developments. Examples are the implementation o f energy
          price and SOE reforms. World petroleum product prices have soared from roughly $30 a barrel
          on average inmid-2003 to around $40 a barrel inmid-2004. The automatic pass-through o f this
          to domestic consumers, while economically desirable, has proved difficult in practice. The
          Govemment i s worried about the adverse implications for inflation and political resistance.
          Similarly, following some tough decisions on closure o f large state-owned enterprises, such as
          Adamjee Jute Mill,concern has emerged about inadequate growth inemployment andthe paucity
          o f good and willing investors, causing a more cautious implementation of privatization and
          closures of sick industries. Both cases illustrate the need to approach reform implementation
          more pragmatically than the textbook approach wouldjustify.
      0   In countries, like Bangladesh, with limited implementation capacity and considerable political
          uncertainties, reforms need to be opportunistic. The content and phasing o f reforms will be
          determined by the capacities of the reform champions to form coalitions and implement them.
          The triggers for future operations, therefore, should be interpreted as indicative and subject to
          change, provided o f course these changes are broadly consistent with the overall focus o f the
          PRSP and are also likely to contribute to the outcomes being pursued. Triggers also need to be
          backedbyanalytical work to ensure well-designed reforms.
      0   Reforms also have a better chance o f success ifthey are harmonizedwith other programs, e.g. the
          FMRPandthe Finance Ministry's reformagendaandthe HNPSPreforms.
      0   Reforms are also likely to be more sustainable if Opposition parties are both informed and
          consulted about long-termpoverty-reducingprograms.
      0   Finally, broad-based refoms inthe area o f public administration and governance require a much
          longer timeframe than the typical 3-year horizon o f programmatic adjustment credits.
          Expectations about how muchprogress can be made inthese areas will need to be modest. The
          other implication i s that our engagement inthis area will needto be on a long-termbasis.

Summary Assessment of Progresswith DSCI1Triggers

6.4 The review suggeststhat overall progress with DSC I1triggershasbeenpositive. The macroeconomic
framework i s on track, banking and SOE reforms have proceeded with some minor variations and broad
governance reforms have moved ahead. In the energy sector several structural reforms have moved
ahead, although progress on the privatization front has been inadequate. The other area where there has
been significant shortfall i s regarding implementation o f energy price agreements under DSC I.This i s
largely due to unanticipated surge inworld oil prices and the Government considers a full passthrough of
these increases to consumers as politically impossible. It has nevertheless made some minimum
adjustments in gas, kerosene and petrol prices and has also reduced the taxes on petroleum products.
While all energy product prices excluding domestic taxes exceed international prices, including tax
(weighted average rate of about 30%) the domestic prices fall short for kerosene and diesel. Since these
products account for some 75% o f total oil consumption, the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation i s
incurring losses. The resultant adverse impact o f higher petroleum costs on BPC's finances has been
offset by the lower central Government deficit. Importantly, the Government has taken new measures
relating to tax revenues and trade tariff reductions inthe FY05 budget that strengthen the overall reform
programand demonstratethe Government's resolve to stay the course on reforms.

Priorities for next phase of reforms

6.5 The Bank remains committed to supporting broad reforms by the Government inpursuito f the goals
set out in the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy. The Bank expects to continue to provide
programmatic support as the Government moves to the next stage o f its reforms and develops its PRSP.
A satisfactory macroeconomic framework will remaincrucial to createstable conditions for private sector
investment. Financial sector reforms will need to be pursued steadily with the first NCB, Rupali bank,
brought to the point of sale and management improvements inthe other NCBs. Firmadherenceto MOUs,
agreed with the IMF and the Bank will be essential. A new element in improving conditions in the
financial sector should be introduction o f new financial reporting standards and strengthening of the
accounting profession. Progress with restructuring state-owned enterprises will continue to be important.
Special attention will again need to be paid to reducing losses, especially in the energy sector. Timely
price adjustments are likely to play a keyrole, as will development o f a strategy for financial restructuring
of the power sector. Further progress inreducingprotectionwill beneededto openthe economy.

6.6 Increasing the effectiveness o f the government will also be important, including phased
modernization o f the National Board of Revenue, progress with new budget processes and public
expenditure allocations, and further reforms o f the public administration. Further measures to tackle
corruption and increase transparency will be key. The Anti-Comption Commission will need to become
fully operational.

6.7 Among other reforms, improved delivery mechanisms for education and health services will also be
important. The Government should also consider ways inwhich social protection mightbe better targeted
and gaps in the present system filled. The Government's decision to prepare an Environmental
Assessment i s also welcome. Further actions in some other PRSP-identified areas would also be
welcome, including (i)   decentralizing power and resources to local communities at the upazilla or district
level, (ii)mainstreaming improvements in the position o f women in development programs, access to
services andjustice, and employment opportunities, and (iii)   pursuinga comprehensive strategy for farm
and non-farm rural development - to improve the rural poor's prospects and reduce incentives to migrate
to cities.

Indicative Triggers for DSC I11

6.8 As mentioned earlier, the DSC I11will continue to use the framework of DSC Iand 11, focusing
directly on the implementation of the first two pillars of I-PRSP dealing with growth and public sector
effectiveness. The indicative triggers for DSC-I11arenotedbelow.

MonitoringandEvaluation

6.9 Improving the quality and effectiveness o f economic and social policies will require more timely and
reliable information for policy analysis and assessing outcomes. The I-PRSP outlines a monitoring
framework, which includes monitoring indicators, data sources, and institutional arrangements for
monitoring and providing feedback to policymakers (See Annex D for details). Sources include existing
data as well as planned annual surveys for tracking intermediate indicators related to access, usage, and
satisfaction with public services. Existing surveys such as the Household Income and Expenditure
Survey, the Labor Force Survey, Child Nutrition Survey, Demographic and Health Survey, Maternal
Health and Mortality Survey, EPI Coverage Evaluation Survey, Service Delivery Survey, Census o f
ManufacturingIndustries andVital Registration Survey -are being strengthened for periodic generation of
data andredesigned to facilitate monitoring o f I-PRSP targets.


6.10     The I-PRSP signals the Government's intentionto rely increasinglyon thirdparty data inorder to
minimize reliability problems associated with administrative data reported by implementing agencies.
Tracking and reporting spendingarebeingpilotedunder the FMRP inthree social sectors and covering 30
districts. These will be expanded to cover other expenditures and districts. The Municipal Review
Committee at LGRD has initiated ranking o f municipalities based on indicators, such as coverage o f
services, revenue collection, expenditures etc. Data are collectedby LGRD's Municipal Support Unit.


6.11     Successful monitoring depends critically on institutional arrangements and their capacity. A
National Poverty Focal Point has been created inthe General EconomicsDivision (GED) o f the Planning
Commission to monitor poverty and track progress in implementing the national strategy for economic
growth and poverty reduction. The NPFP is expected to grow and function as an institutionally effective

                                                 32

and technically competent Poverty MonitoringUnit with strong inter-ministerial linkages and interactions
with various stakeholders outside the Government. Under the ongoing PRSP preparation work, the
poverty diagnostics, drawing on quantitative and qualitative information, should be used to set medium
and long-term outcome-oriented targets. These should be linked to macroeconomic, structural and social
policies. The Poverty Monitoring Unit should also consult civil society regularly on PRSP progress. BBS
and the Ministry of Planning plan to develop a National Databank to provide an integrated database
accessibleto all government departments and BBS.


6.12    These efforts to strengthenmonitoring and evaluation systems provide an excellent opportunity to
evaluate the various reforms supported under DSC-11. If implemented successfblly, they should further
improve the quality o f information and analysis for decision-making and inculcate a stronger results
orientation within government. However, much work lies ahead in data collection, analysis and its
linkages with policy and indicators. One o f the key outputs of the monitoring system envisaged i s an
annual report on poverty reduction and social development, providing an overview of progress in
achieving economic growth, human development, poverty reduction, gender equality and analysis of
factors behindthe observedtrends andtheir policy implications.


CreditAdministrationandFiduciaryCompliance

6.13    Borrower,CreditAmount andFinancialmanagement: The borrower is the People'sRepublic
o f Bangladesh. A single tranche Credit o f about SDR 136.8 million (US$200 million equivalent) would
be made available upon credit effectiveness, anticipated for early August. The closing date of the Credit
i s December 31, 2004. Proceeds o f the Credit will be disbursed to a special account of the Ministry o f
Finance established at Bangladesh Bank for this purpose. The Credit will follow the Bank's simplified
disbursement procedures for adjustment operations and will not be linkedto any specific purchases and
no procurement requirements will be needed. If any portion o f the Credit proceeds i s used for ineligible
purposes as defined by the Development Credit Agreement, the International development Association
(IDA) will require the Borrower either to return that amount to the deposit account or refundthe amount
directly to IDA. The Ministry o f Finance and the Bangladesh Bank will maintain an appropriate
accounting systemto account for the receipt and use of credit funds.


6.14    Fiduciary Risk and Audit: The IMF Safeguard Assessment conducted in September, 2002
concluded that financial management in Bangladesh was weak. To enhance the safeguards framework,
the Bangladesh Bank has started strengthening its financial management with IMF support and the IDA-
financed Central Bank Strengthening Project. A time table has been set for the adoption by the
Bangladesh Bank Board o f International Accounting Standards as its accounting framework.            The
financial statements o f the Deposit account will, upon request from the Association, be audited by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA under terms o f reference in accordance with international
standards on auditing.


EnvironmentalIssues

6.15    This structural adjustment operation does not have any direct environmental implications.
However, as noted inparas(4.58-4.59), Bangladesh has serious environmentalissues that pose substantial
social and economic concerns. So, the timely completion of the proposed Country Environmental
Assessment and supporting related policy and institutional reforms i s a critical element of the Bank's
dialogue and assistancestrategy inBangladesh.




                                               33

                                      VII. BENEFITS AND RISKS

7.1     Benefits. The reform program supported under DSC-I1 has substantial potential benefits. The
implementation o f DSC-I has already shown good outcomes in terms o f exports, growth, and better
incentives for private sector investment. As indicatedby past experience in Bangladesh and elsewhere,
these have positive implications for poverty reduction. Over the longer term, progress with institutional
reforms supported by the credits leading to more effective government will improve public service
delivery, reduce corruption and improve the investment climate for private investment. These are critical
for achieving sustained higher growth and lower poverty.

7.2      Political and social risks: As the 2006 general elections draw closer, the pace o f reform could
slow. Broader public resistance to large-scale reforms could also grow if the social impact of reforms i s
not mitigatedadequately. As the reform efforts are deepened, it will therefore be important to monitor and
accurately assess the social impact of adjustment. The Government has done well thus far in actively
consulting labor leaders and workers and ensuring that their concerns are taken into account indesigning
retrenchment programs. It will be important to create new employment opportunities relatively quickly
and insufficiently large numbersto offset the impact of the redundancies expected from the restructuring
of public-owned enterprises and nationalized commercialbanks.

7.3      PRSPownership: Sustainedimplementationofreforms will depend onbroadnational consensus
on key elements of the agenda. In the absence of this, reforms could falter or be reversed. The
Government, therefore, needs to build not only a strong internal agreement among ministries and its
supporters in Parliament and the country on the PRSP. It also needs to allow the Opposition and civil
society as a whole to participate fully inpreparation of the PRSP, so that it genuinely reflects a national
consensus on the priorities for poverty reduction and the policies to achieve them. This i s particularly
important, given the low implementationcapacity inmany areas and the confrontationalnature o f politics.

7.4      Governance problems could overwhelm--especially those arising from widespread corruption,
a fragile law and order situation, and bureaucratic inefficiencies. As indicated by the experience with
reforms in this area supported under DSCs, institutional improvements needed to mitigate this are
necessarily slow-moving and will have to be inherently indigenous. The Government, supported by the
donor community including under the Bank's DSCs, has already made impressive inroads on several
fronts to address this, including new regulations for public procurements, tighter controls on new lending
byNCBs and establishment of the independent Anti-Comption Commission. Deeper andmore sustained
efforts, however, are required.

7.5      Budgetary and fiduciary risks: Fungibility of funds implies that budgetary resources may be
diverted or misused, which poses a particular risk to operations, such as DSC 11. The Government,
however, has a good record o f allocating public spending to key development sectors, including social
spending and infrastructure. Auditing arrangements and financial management within government
ministries are being strengthened under the FMRP. The new procurement regulations should reduce the
scope for misuse ofbudgetary funds incontracting.

7.6      Tracking studies of major spending on health and education should also curb leakages. External
oversight by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office is also being strengthened. These measures
should mitigate budgetary risks, but their effectiveness will depend crucially on the swift resolution o f
serious financial irregularities, identified by the C&AG, and on readiness by the Finance Ministry to
impose financial sanctions on errant agencies and programs. The envisaged adoption of International
Public Sector Accounting Standards should ensure appropriate disclosures o f sources and uses o f
Government funds along with its financial positions. To enhance safeguard framework, Bangladesh Bank
has started strengthening its financial management with the support from IMF and the IDA-financed
Central Bank Strengthening Project. A timetable has been set for the adoption by the Bangladesh Bank o f
InternationalAccounting Standards as its accounting framework.


                                                 34

7.7      Implementation capacity risks: Implementation capacity i s a serious bottleneck. This partly
reflects the overly centralized nature of public administration. Decentralizationof responsibilitiesto local
governments could help, butunfortunately, there i s no political ownership. At the central level, capacity i s
constrainedby the weaknessof civil service. Ongoing reforms inpublic administrationto strengthen civil
service incentives, accountability and training will help. Bank and other donors are also providing
technical assistance to strengthen capacities ina number o f core areas o f economic management including
banlung, taxation, public spending and energy. Technical work and broad engagement with a range o f
interested parties on the decentralization agenda i s also planned to build a stronger constituency on this
key reform.

7.8      External risk: RMG exports comprise three-quarters of total exports, catering mainly to the EU
and U S markets where Bangladesh has quota ffee access due to its LDC status. The scheduled removal o f
RMG quotas under the Multifiber Agreement at end-2004, therefore, poses considerable risks to the
economy. The impact on net export earnings will be contained by the corresponding reduction inRMG-
related imports, but the overall adverse impact on output and employment could still be substantial
because a large part of the manufacturing and service sectors depends on RMGs. To mitigate these risks,
the authorities need to build foreign exchange reserves and, over the medium term, promote export
diversification, further reduce anti-export bias, and improve the investment climate. Continued
engagement with IMF and the World Bank on macroeconomic and structural reforms will help achieve
these objectives and reduce external vulnerability.

         Dear Mr.Wolfensohn,

                         Letterof DevelopmentPolicy-Development Support Credit4

         1.       Introduction

         1.1      The Government has madekrther progress duringFY2004with the wide-ranging
         reform program on which it embarked when it took office in October 2001. Fiscal and
         monetary policies have again been prudent. The taka's exchange rate has been steady.
         We have taken krther steps to strengthen the structure of the economy and to improve
         economic governance. Economic growth has picked up, led by a strong increase in
         exports. Inflation has been contained - despite higher international prices. The current
         balance of payments remains in surplus. Reserves are around three months of import
         cover. The steady and determined pursuit of reforms - sometimes in difficult domestic
         and external circumstances - is laying the basis for our longer-termgoal of accelerating
         economic growthto reduce poverty more rapidly and improvethe socialconditionsofthe
         poorest members of our society, especially in rural areas where most of the population
         lives, andespecially for women.

          1.2      Inrecent months, we have beenengagedinwide consultationswith all sectorsof
         society across the whole country, as we prepare the Government's National Strategy for
         Economic Growth, Poverty Reductionand Social Development, (NSEGPWRSP) which
         we intend to complete by December 2004. This Letter of Development Policy lays out'
                                                                                                             ~

         what the Government has done in the past year and the krther reforms planned in the                  '

          years ahead, and seeks continuingadjustment support from the World Bank. Our program
          will emphasize prudent macroeconomic policies and steady structural reformsto improve
          the climate for private investment to create jobs, raise incomes and speed growth and
          poverty reduction. The Government's own spending will be based on a rolling three-year
          investment program, designed to translate the priorities of the PRSP into improved
          infrastructureprovisionandbetter services for the poor.

          2.       MaintainingMacroeconomic Stability

          2.1      Economic growth accelerated from 5.3 percent in FY2003 to an estimated 5.5
          percent in FY2004, led by both strong external and domestic demand. Activity in
          industry, services and exports all expanded. Rising prices of imported food, contributed
          to an increase in inflation during the later half of 2003, but the Government responded

                                                                  *
with a prudent tightening of fiscal and monetary policies and the rise in prices was
contained at around 6 percent for the year. On the fiscal side, weaker than anticipated
revenues promptedthe Government to step up its efforts to strengthenrevenue collection
and to trim ADP spending relative to the FY2004 budget plan. The National Board of
Revenue intensified its efforts to collect VAT, the newly created Large Taxpayer Unit
&TU) selected cases for audit and began additional collections, and the new Central
IntelligenceCell started to identify possible tax evaders. Revenue is estimated to have
increased from 10.3 percent of GDP in FY2003 to 10.6 percent in FY2004. Current
spending rose broadlyinline with budget but ADP spendingfor the year was some Tk 13
billion below plan, reflecting mainly the trimming of low priority projects but also some
limitations on implementation capacity. The central government budget deficit is
estimatedto havebeenaround4.2 percent ofGDP, comparedto the target of4.8percent,

2.2     Bangladesh Bank has pursued a cautious monetary policy in light of the risk of
higher inflation. The end-year targets for the growth of broad money and credit to the
private sector were both scaled back. The limit on banking system credit to the
Government was also trimmed in line with the lower fiscal deficit. In the face of
continued inflows of remittances, BangladeshBank has acted to S i t excess reserves. A
primary dealer market for government securities was launched in December 2003, and
the interbank market has been strengthened to improvethe allocationof liquidity among
banks.

2.3     Merchandise exports are estimated to haverisen by around 15 percent inFY2004,
led by readymade garments and frozen food. Imports, too, increased strongly, reflecting
both inputs to the RMG sector and expanding domestic demand. Increasedremittances,
however, seem likely to have helped to keep the current account in surplus for the year,
Reserves, in turn, were around $2.6 billion at end-FY2004       - equal to three months
imports, The taka, which was floated in May 2003, has stayed broadly stable against the
US dollar and has depreciatedby around 3 percent inreal effectiveterms duringthe past
year. This could give exports a fillip in the wake of the phase out at the end of 2004 of
the Multi-Fiber Arrangement from which Bangladesh benefits, particularly in the US
market.

3.      Structural and institutional reforms

3.1     The Government has continuedto press ahead with the structuraland institutional
reforms needed to lay the basis for vibrant private sector growth and for poverty
reduction. These reforms have included the financial sector, state-owned enterprises, the
energy sector, telecommunications, the government's own fiscal operations, renewed
trade liberalization,andbroad-basedgovernance measures,

0      Financial sector - Our objective is to strengthen the banking sector so that finance
       can be mobilized and intermediated efficiently to creditworthy borrowers, and the
       country's savings can be used for productive investment. In particular, we have
       continued the process of reforming nationalizedcommercial banks (NCBs). These
       have adhered to firm Memoranda of Understanding, covering their lending



                                             2

                                                                *
  activities and recovery of non-performing loans. We have also moved ahead with
  appointing an Adviser to bringRupali Bank to the point o f divestment by the end of
  2004. We have selected a management team for Agrani Bank and management
  advisers for Sonali Bank. We have put out fresh tenders for management advisers
  for Janata Bank. The strengthening of management in NCBs should both curb their
  losses and make them attractive to "fit and proper" investors in due course. The
  Cabinet has approved amendments to existing law to allow Bangladesh Bank to
  align its prudential guidelines with international standards. We intend to present
  these amendments to Parliament at the earliest opportunity, and Bangladesh Bank
  will .issue all necessary circulars to align loan classification with international
  practice in phases agreed with IDA upon completiono f a study by December 2004.
  The first circular to initiateimplementation will be issuedby March2005.
0 State-owned entemrises - We have continued to reduce the losses of state-owned
  enterprises in manufacturing through a mixture o f closures and downsizing. Losses
  of state enterprises in manufacturing fell by an estimated 20 percent between
  FY2003 and FY2004. In light o f opposition to some closures, we have adopted a
  more selective approach, according to local circumstances. Among the 27 mills
  closed in the past two years, 12 have been transferred to the private sector, and six
  are in the process of being transferred. Currently, 25 manufacturing state enterprises
   are listed for privatization. BSFIC has been downsized. The activities of BADC and
  BCIC are being scaled back.
0 Enerw - Restructuring the energy sector remains a high priority for the
   Government. The Government has created an Energy Regulatory Commission, and
   its first members have been appointed. The Commi`ssion is intended to play a key
   role in creating an environment, where the energy sector can contribute hlly to our
   growth objectives. Adequate and reliable electric power is essential for economic
   growth. We have made further efforts to improve the finances o f the major
   electricity utilities Household tariffs were increased in September 2003 to better
   reflect the cost of supply. BPDB has reduced again its generating loss and improved
   collections. The Government has committed to reduce its own payables to BPDB
   and DESA to not more than three months o f accounts payable by July 7, 2004. It
   intends that payables by autonomous entities and private consumers should be
   reduced to not more than six months payablesby December 2004 and not more than
   three months payables by June 2005. Transmission lines have been handed over to
   PGCB.      West Zone        Distribution Company      has been corporatized,      and
   corporatization o f North-West Zone is in process. Our naturalgas resources needto
   be developed and used efficiently. We have, therefore, increased gas prices by 3.5
   percent, and we intend to increase prices by a further 2.27 percent not later than
   January 1, 2005. Thereafter, prices will be reviewed monthly in line with formula
   agreed with the Association, so that ifthe variation is greater than 10 percent prices
   will be adjusted immediately, otherwise, they will be adjusted on April 1 and
   October 1 each year in line with the formula. The increase in world oil prices and
   hence our imports have posed a heavy unanticipated extra cost on Bangladesh and
   the finances of the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC). We increased
   kerosene prices by 17 percent in May, to align them with diesel prices and
   discourage adulteration. We have also increased the prices of furnace oil, jet fuel

  and bitumen. My budget tax measures will mitigate the full domestic impact of
  higher petroleum costs on BPC. We are committed to reduce BPC's losses
  substantially in FY2004/2005, and we intend in future to implement petroleum
  priceadjustmentsinline with the'formulaagreedwith IDA inMay2003.
0 Telecommunications       - The Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory
  Commission has been established and is already active. It has announced a new
  licensing framework and has begun to license private operators. BTTB will be
  turned into a limited liability company by end-2004. In my recent Budget, Ialso
  reducedtaxes on mobile handsetsto makethem accessible to a wider section of the
  population. These changes have helped double telephone penetrationbetween 2002
  and 2003.
a Economic management - The Government has made krther efforts to strengthen
  economic management. A Macroeconomic Policy Analysis Unit has been createdin
  the Finance Division. A Public Debt Management Unit is also in process of being
  established. The Government has adopted ,a Financial Management Reform
  Program, and Financial Management Units are being created in line ministries in
  stages. The Government recently merged four ministries into two and has taken
  steps to improve public administration, including merit-based promotion and
  encouraging professionalism through creating clusters of ministries and enhancing
  training.
  Public spending - The Government is committed to unify the current and capital
  spendingbudgets. It transferred some SO projectsfrom the development budget to
  the current budget in.thepast year. Ministries' current and capital expenditures in
  the latest budget were presented together. They were also linked clearly to
  ministries' planned activities and programs in FY2004/2005. The Budget focuses
  on programs aimed at poverty reduction and human development, including
  agriculture, irrigation, labor and employment, ruraldevelopment, education, health,
  women and child and youth development, water resources, energy and power,
  infrastructure, railway and inland water transport,           rural   infrastructure,
  telecommunication, foreign investment and export sectors. Education receives the
  largest allocationin the Budget with 13.4 percent of spending, directed inparticular
  to reducing teacher shortages in primary schools, increasing classrooms and
   providing more books. Infrastructureis being improved for secondary and tertiary
   education, and girls' education will again be supported through the stipend
   program. The Government is also increasing spending on health, as it plans to
   implement a new three-year Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector Program
   (HNPSP). The Budget provides support for agricultural irrigation, comrriodity
   exports, improved agricultural credit terms and agricultural research. The Budget
   also increases allowances for the aged, widows, destitute women, victims of acid
   bumsandthe homeless.It also raises provisionfor vulnerable groups.
  Revenue mobilization - The Government has continued its efforts to strengthen
   revenue collection. Revenue is estimatedto have risen from 10.3 percent of GDP in
  FY2002/2003 to 10.6 percent in FY200312004. The Budget aims to increase
   revenues fbrther to 11 percent of GDP in FY2004/2005. It also hrthers the
   Government's strategy of reducing reliance on trade taxes and increasing its
   relianceon domestic taxes. A reductioninthe top import tariff rate from 30 percent



                                         4

     to 25 percent, coupled with lowering supplementary duties and trimming the
     number of both tariff and duty tiers, has cut average protectionfrom more than 24
     percent to less than 21 percent. This is in line with the Government's policy of
     liberalizing the economy through integration with the rest of the world. The
     Government has also simplifiedthe income tax system and given taxpayers greater
     certainty by announcingthat the FY2004/2005 rates will also apply next year. It has
     widened the coverage of VAT. It has also announcedits intentionto modernizethe
     NationalBoard of Revenueto improve tax administration, facilitate self assessment,
     reducethe discretionary powers oftax officialsand encouragea taxpaying culture.
0    Governance -     Bangladesh has achieved remarkable progress in economic growth
     and poverty reduction. The Government, however, recognizesthe need to improve
     governance across the boardthroughwide and specific measures. It introducednew
     public procurement regulationsin 2003, which should improvethe transparencyand
     accountability of public contracts and reduce the scope for corruption. Tighter
     auditing of public spending and the strengthening of the Comptroller and Auditor
     General's Department, coupled with heightened oversight by the Public Accounts
     Committee, should improve the performance of government departments
     themselves. The new tracking studies of spending on education and health should
      curb the leakage of funds. The Government's reforms inthe banking sector and in
      state enterprises should also reduce the misuse of funds. Our proposed introduction
      of a new Financial Reporting Act, coupled with oversight of the accountancy
    . profession, should improve corporate accounting. Parliament approved in February
      2004 the creationof a new IndependentAnti-CorruptionCommission. A committee
      has been named to provide to the President a shortlist of appointees to the
      Commission. The Government has made provision for the Commission's budget
      and intends that it should be operational later this year. The Government has also
      taken stepsto comply withthe HighCourt's directiveonthe separationof executive
      and judiciary, notably with the creation of a new Judicial Services Commission to
      oversee the appointment of judges. It intends to create the new BangladeshJudicial
      Serviceand set up a JudicialPay Commissionby December2004.

4.      Poverty ReductionStrategy

4.1     The Government is preparing a full PovertyReductionStrategy for consideration
by the National Poverty Reduction Council, chaired by the Prime Minister. We aim to
complete this by December 2004. The PRSP will build on the InterimPoverty Reduction
Strategy, publishedin March 2003 and shared with the internationalfinancial institutions.
The PRSP is being directed by a Steering Committee, headed by the PrincipalSecretary
to the Prime Minister, the Poverty Focal Point in the Planning Commission. We created
12 Thematic Groups at the end of 2003, headed by senior officials from the Finance
Ministry and line ministries. We have consulted widely with different sectors of society
acrossthe country sincethe beginningofthis year.

4.2     We have set ourselves ambitious goals for poverty reduction by 2015. In some
cases, these are more demanding than the Millenium Development Goals, reflecting our
view that Bangladesh can and should exceed these. Notably, we aim to halve poverty



                                             5

                                                                   c

from its 2000 level of 50 percent to 25 percent by 2015. This will requirean acceleration
in economic growth close to 7 percent. Increasesin adult literacy and school enrolment,
however, should be within reach ifwe maintainthe rate of improvement achieved during
the 1990s. Reductions in infant and maternal mortality and child malnutrition, as well as
an increase in life expectancy; will all require some increase in our rate of progress
compared with the 1990s. These are substantial challenges and we shall seek the help of
our development partners inmeetingthem.

4.3    The main features of the I-PRSP are (i)accelerating pro-poor growth, (ii)
fostering human development of the poor, (iii)advancing women and removing gender
gaps, (iv) strengthening social protection, (v) supporting local government and
broadeningparticipation,(vi) reducinginequality, and (vii) caring for the environment.

4.4     The I-PRSPidentifiedfour major pillarsto achieve these goals.


0       pillar 1 - Pro-Poor growth - Growth prospects should be improved first through
        maintainingprudent macroeconomic policies, includingraising revenue as a share
        of GDP to 12 percent and improving the quality and effectiveness of public
        spending. The economy should be opened throughtrade liberalization.Reformsof
        banking, state enterprises and energy should be completed. The regulatory
        environment, too, needs to continue to develop. Infrastructure needs to be

        Pillar 2 - Improving governance - The Government recognizes the need to
        improvedandprivateparticipationencouraged.
0
        improve political governance, which has been harmed by confrontational politics
        and frequent hartals. The I-PRSP recommends strengthening the role of
        parliament and its committees. It suggests the devolution of power to effective
        local government institutions. It also urges improvements in law and order,
        together with police reform. It points to the need for better information flows,
        judicial reforms, efforts to tackle corruption and improvements in the

        Pillar 3 - Investing in human development - The I-PRSP recommends increased
        performanceofthe public administration.
 0
        spending on education, health and social protection, to improve the quality of
        education and access to healthcare.
 0      Pillar 4 - Social protection The I-PRSP stresses the need to take account of
                                      -
        gender in framing policies and increase the role of women in development. It
        argues for better safety nets for the poorest and most disadvantagedmembers. It
        recommends improving the access of the poor to assets, such as land. It draws
        attention to the need for improved housing. It calls for environmental
        conservationto be integratedintoBangladesh's development strategy.

 4.5    The I-PRSP set out a challenging agenda, which is commensurate with the
        country's needs. Our subsequent consultations and discussions have reinforced
        many of the messages, notably the need to ensure that the poorest, especially the
        hungry, participate in development. We are also concerned that growth is
        unevenly distributed, and that the poor needto be linkedto the sources ofgrowth.
        Inequality itself may retard growth, especially ifthe human capacity ofthe poor is



                                             6

        not developed. We recognize the need to tackle inequality between genders in
        socialprogress.

5.      PRSPMonitoring

5.1     Realization of our poverty goals and measuring the effectiveness of our policies
will require careful monitoring of both processes and outcomes. We are instituting
innovative tracking of public spending in major areas of education and health. We also
have a wide range of surveys in hand, including a new Household Income and
ExpenditureSurvey, to be completed in 2005. Surveys of the labor force, child nutrition,
demographics and health, maternal health and mortality, as well as service delivery will
all help us to ensure that our policies are achieving the desired results. The PovertyFocal
Point in the General Economics Division of the Planning Commission will monitor the
progress of the PovertyReductionStrategy. We also planto strengthenmore broadly the
activitiesofthe BangladeshBureauof Statistics.

6.      Conclusion

6.1     Bangladesh has made good progress in the past year in implementingthe broad
range of policiesto improvegrowth and reduce poverty- despite domestic pressuresand
the unfavorable impact of high global commodity prices, especially oil. We have
benefited from the support of our development partners, includingthe World Bank. We
have laid out a challenging agenda for the medium-term, and the Government is keenly
aware of the heavy responsibilitythat it bears for pursuingreforms determinedly for the
benefit of all our people. Further adjustment lendingfrom the InternationalDevelopment
Association under Development Support Credit-I1 will play a crucial role. We believe
that this will enhance our ability to meet our poverty goals and encourage the private
sector growth, which is key to creatingemployment andraisingincomes ofthe poor.

On June 20, 2003, the ExecutiveBoard of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultationwith Bangladesh.!
Background
Since the last Article IV consultation, economic performance has improved and
macroeconomic policy implementationhas strengthened, broadly in line with the
recommendationsof the Board. The economy has been in a recovery, led by the
agricultural and industrial sectors and aided by the strength of domestic and
external demand. Real GDP growth is thus projectedto accelerate to 5.2 percent
for FY03from the 4.4 percent growth rate recorded in FY02. At the same time,
inflation remains manageable,although it is on a slight upwardtrend to around 5%
percent, owing to rising food prices which were linked to higher utility tariffs and
energy prices.
The external position has also strengthenedover the past year. Followinga fall in
exports in FY02, due to a sharp decline in ready-madegarments (RMG) prices,
exports have recovered, rising by 6 percent in the ten monthsthrough April 2003.
During the same period, remittancescontinue to be strong, growing at an annual
rate of 24 percent, reflecting in part a further shift in such flows to official channels.
The current account is projectedto remain in a small surplus for FY03.
Internationalreserves have increasedto nearly $2 billion as of midJune, and are
projected to rise further to $2.1 billion by end-June 2003.

                                                                            Page 2 of 10


Prudent macroeconomicpolicies have contributed to these outcomes. In particular,
fiscal policy has been tightened beginningin FY02; revenuewas raised by
1percentage point of GDP, mainly in the nontax area. As a result, the central
government deficit (excludinggrants) fell to 4.7 percent of GDP. At the same time,
the monitoring of fiscal developmentswas strengthened, especially with respectto
Annual Development Plan (ADP) spending.
Moreover, the deficit is on course to fall further in FY03 to 4.2 percent of GDP in
line with the budget as a result of significant revenuemeasures combined with
expenditure discipline. Tax revenue in the first seven months of the year rose by
16.7 percent, comparedto the same period of FY02, suggesting that tax revenue
for the year is on track to improve by 0.6 percentage points of GDP. At the same
time, expenditures in the first seven monthsfell by 0.8 percentage points of GDP,
reflectingrestraintin ADP spending. This result was achieved despite a marked
increase in expenditureto meet reform costs of state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
(0.4 percent of GDP). More recently,the ADP budget has also been revised
downward, to further prune lower priority spending.
Further, the structure of financing for the deficit in FY03 has improved. Domestic
financing is expected to be cut from 2.5 percent of GDP in FY02 to 1.9 percent.
Moreover, based on trends so far, the share of domestic financing through costly
national savings certificates (NSCs) is expected to fall. To reduce future interest
burden, interest rates on NSCswere reduced by 2 percentage points and the four
most costly NSC schemeswere withdrawn in July 2002.
Monetary policy has been restrainedsince early 2002, and treasury bill rates have
been allowed to rise, reflectingmarket conditions. Inthe year to March 2003,
reservemoney is estimated to have grown by 6 percent, as Bangladesh Bank (BB)
sterilized its accumulation of internationalreserveswith auctions of treasury bills.
As a result, short-term treasury bill yields rose from 4 percentto 8 percent over the
period; at the same time, commercial lending rates remained at about 12 percent.
Broad moneygrew by 15 percent in the year to February2003, buoyed by strong
growth in credit to the private sector.

                                                                          Page 3 of 10


Exchange restrictions have recently been eased, and exchange rate management
has been more flexible, helpingto strengthenthe external position. In particular,
the scope of the margin requirements on letters of credit for imports has been
reduced, and limits were lifted in August 2002 on travel, educational and medical
expenses,and on payments for other invisibles. Nonetheless, Bangladesh
continuesto maintain exchange restrictions subject to Fundjurisdiction. The
exchange rate for the taka remainedfixed to the US. dollar from January 2002
until May 31, 2003, when the taka was allowed to float. With the weakening of the
U.S. dollar, during the period January 2002-May 2003, the taka has depreciated by
12 percent in nominal effective terms and by an estimated 8 percent in real
effective terms.
The authorities recently have limited the contracting of new nonconcessional
external debt. During FY03, new loan commitments and guarantees on
nonconcessionalterms are projectedto be at most $150 million, down from an
estimated$350 millionin FY02. Externalpublic debt at end-June 2003 is projected
at $17 billion (33 percent of GDP). Inview of its concessional nature, debt in NPV
terms is about 20 percent of GDP and 101 percent of exports, while the debt
service ratio remains relatively low at 6.5 percent.
Steps have been taken to renew structural reforms.With respectto manufacturing,
the government has initiateda four-year programto phase out SOEsfrom this
sector, startingwith the closure/privatizationof key loss-making units. In addition to
Adamjeejute mills, another 24 out of a total of 150 SOEs have been closed so far
in FY03.To ease this process, a severance scheme has been adoptedto provide
safety netsfor retrenched workers. In the energy sector, the focus so far has been
on tariff and pricingadjustments, to stem financial losses. Since October 2001,
utilitytariffs have been raised by 8 percent, and the prices of a wide range of
energy products have been substantiallyincreased. In addition, Parliamenthas          1

recently passed the Energy Regulatory CommissionAct, creating an independent
regulatorfor the sector.
 Inthe banking sector, the priority has been on improvingthe legalframework and

                                                                              Annex F
                                                                           Page 4 of I O


upgrading prudential standards. The BangladeshBank Order was amended to
providegreater operationalautonomy to BB. The Banks (Nationalization)Act and
the BankingCompanies Act were also amended to strengthen BB's regulatory
powers by bringing nationalizedcommercial banks (NCBs) within its purviewand
to improve capital adequacy and governance in private commercialbanks.
Moreover, a new Money Loans Court lawwas enacted that establishesspecialist
courts to deal with loan defaults and streamlinesthe recovery process.
Trade reformwas given renewed impetus in the FY03 budget,when the top
customs duty ratewas reduced by 5 percentage pointsto 32.5 percent, and the
number of rates reducedto five (including a zero rate). The structure of
supplemental duties was also simplified by reducingthe number of ratesfrom
31 to 5. The effective average tariff rate was thus reducedto 24 percent.
ExecutiveBoardAssessment
Directors commendedthe authorities' prudent macroeconomicmanagementand
renewalof structural reforms,which strengthened economic performancein the
past year. Economicgrowth is buoyant, inflationremains moderate, and
internationalreserves have risen. The major challengefacing Bangladeshnow is
to put the economy on a highergrowth pathwith faster poverty reduction. Directors
notedthat impedimentsto private sector growth, a weak bankingsystem, limited
public resources, and natural disasters have held up progresstoward achieving
this goal.
Directors considered Bangladesh'sNational Poverty ReductionStrategy (the I-
PRSP), to be a coherent and comprehensive policy framework for boosting
economic growth and reducing poverty. They emphasizedthat poverty reduction
will require macroeconomicstability and an improvementin the investment climate.
For this, the authorities will need to accelerate structural reforms, ease bottlenecks
in physical infrastructure,further invest in human capital, and strengthen
governance. Directorsencouragedthe authorities to more sharply prioritize pro-
poor policies and programs in framing the full PRSP, to ensure a full costing of
these programs within a medium-termexpenditure framework, and to broaden

                                                                               Annex F
                                                                            Page 5 of 10


 further the participatory process, particularly to include parliamentarians,to
 enhance politicalsupport for the reform agenda. Furthermore, monitoring
 mechanisms should be established to gauge the progress in reducing poverty and,
 in this context, additional work should be undertakento better define final outcome
 indicators.
 Directorsendorsed the macroeconomicframework and the emphasis of the
 proposed Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-supportedprogramon
 fiscal reforms, restructuringand privatization of the nationalizedcommercial banks
 (NCBs)and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), more liberal exchange and trade
 regimes, and improved economic governance.They stressed that for the structural
 reformsto be successfully implemented,the underlyingeconomic governance
 issues will need to be decisively tackled. Inthis context, improved accountability in
'public resource management,judicial reform, and the proposedestablishmentof
 an anti-corruptioncommission would be especially helpful.
 On fiscal reform, Directorswelcomed the reduction of the fiscal deficit in fiscal year
 2002/03 and the budget framework for fiscal year 2003/04, which is consistent with
 a pro-poorgrowth strategy. Directors noted the low revenue effort, and
 underscoredthe importanceof action to boost revenue, particularlyin view of
 intendedtrade liberalization.They endorsed the extension of the coverage of the
 VAT and income tax and the strengthening of tax administration.On the
 expenditureside, Directorswelcomed the planned shift in budget allocations
 toward financing of structural reforms, poverty reduction and the social sectors
  (especially education),and the critical energy and power sectors. To achieve the
 targeted allocation, it will be important to improve development project selection
  and implementation, as well as transparency and accountability in expenditure
  management, drawingon the recommendationsof the fiscal ROSC.
  Directorsstressedthat continued fiscal reform over the medium term will be vital,
  and should center on a sustained revenue effort and a shift in spending toward
  investmentsin infrastructureand human capital to better support growth and the
  MillenniumDevelopment Goals. However,while they welcomed the increased

                                                                                   Annex F
                                                                               Page 6of I O


budgetaryallocation to education, they stressed that the effectiveness of social
spending is at least as important, and encouraged the authorities to draw upon the
findings and recommendationsof last year's publicexpenditure review in guiding
the projected increase in spending. To support poverty reduction, it will be
importantto promotethe development of the rural sector, including through a
better functioning of land markets and through sound microfinance policies. For
publicdebt sustainability, Directorscalled on the authorities to curtail domestic
financing for the budget, to exercise prudence in externaldebt management,and
to refrainfrom non-concessional borrowing. Moreover, publicdebt management
should be strengthened, starting with an improved debt informationsystem.
Directorswelcomed the recenttightening of monetary policy and the greater
flexibility in interest rate policy, which contributed to the successful float of the
exchange rate. They stressedthat monetary policy would needto remainfirm in
the periodahead in order to contain inflationary pressures, support orderly
conditions in the foreign exchange market, and facilitate a further rebuilding of
international reserves. Over time, the authoritieswould need to address some of
the recommendationsin the FinancialSystem StabilityAssessment (FSSA) report
regarding monetary policy instruments. The completion of the safeguards
assessmentof the central bank was welcomed, and the authorities were urgedto
addressthe criticalweaknesses quickly.
Directorsendorsed the authorities' SOE reform plan for the manufacturing sector,
noting the orderly divestment of key loss-makingunits so far aided by the safety
netsfor retrenchedworkers. They encouraged the authorities to maintain the
momentumof this reform, so as to substantially withdraw SOEs from this sector
within three years as plannedand make roomfor the private sector.
Directorsstressed that the serious problemsof SOEs in the energy sector would
also needto be decisively addressed, in order to containfiscal risks and ease
critical infrastructurebottlenecks.They welcomed recent pricing actions, which
have helped stem the financial lossesof the sector, but stressed that the effect of
price increaseson the poor should be mitigatedthrough a well-targeted social

                                                                             Annex F
                                                                           Page 7of 10


safety net. Directorsencouraged the authoritiesto make further progress, in
consultationwith the World Bank, by moving in a timely way to implementan
automatic pricingframework for energy, starting with adoption in the near term of
an interim pricingformula. An effective regulatory body should also be installed
soon, now that the legalframework is in place. In addition, Directors attached
importanceto resolvingthe inter-enterprisearrears of SOEs in this sector in the
context of an appropriate restructuring,and to defining the next phase of reforms
so as to permit a higher level of investmentin this sector. Plans to improvethe
pricing and regulatoryframework were consideredan importantfirst step, but the
goal should be eventual privatization of the key enterprises.A few Directorsnoted
the delay inthe corporatizationof the Telephone and Telegraph Board, and urged
timely implementationof the process.
Directorswelcomed the recent upgradingof the legalframework for banking
regulation and loan recovery, as well as the strengtheningof BangladeshBank's
operationalautonomy and supervision over the NCBs.They consideredthe
proposedapproach to NCB reform to be a cautious but meaningful start to
addressingthe weaknesses in this area and in the financial sector more generally.
The plannedaudits of these banks should help in defining a resolution strategy for
each bank byApril 2004, drawing also on the findings of the FSSA. Some
Directorsstrongly concurredwith the recommendationsof the FSSAthat all NCBs
should be sold off, and suggested that privatization be included in the resolution
strategies. Directorsemphasizedthe need in the interim to strengthen oversight of
NCBs and bank management, to restrict NCB lending,and to forcefully address
the problems of directed lending and outside interference in the management of
these banks. Directorsalso called on the authorities to strengthen anti-money
launderinglegislationto address terrorism financing issues and clarify the powers
of the financial intelligence unit, and to upgrade capacity for enforcing the
legislation.
Directorswelcomed the recent move to a floating exchange rate regime, which will
offer greater flexibility in macroeconomic policy management, better protect

                                                                             Annex F
                                                                         Page 8 of 10


competitiveness, and enhance Bangladesh's resilienceto shocks. Directors
stressedthat morewill needto be done over the next two years to rationalize
import taxes, reducethe effective rate of protection, and removethe anti-export
bias, especially in order to diversify exports and reduceexternal vulnerability.
Notingthat the authorities have proposedtimetablesfor eliminating the restrictions
with respectto the margin requirementsfor imports and the nonresidenttaka
accounts, Directors approvedthese restrictionson a temporary basis. However,a
few Directorswere concernedthat these timetables had slipped relative to the
previousundertakings.The authoritieswere urgedto set a timetable for eliminating
the remaining restriction on advance payments for imports.
