SPAIN
APPRAISAL OF THE REVISED MODERNIZATION PROGRFAM (1964-1973)
OF THE SPANISH NATIONAL RAILWAY (RENFE)
SUriARY
i.        The Government of Spain has asked the Bank for a loan of US$50
nillion equivalent to help finance the Modernization Program of the Spanish
Railway (RENFE). The loan would be made to RENFE and guaranteed by the
Governi.ent.  The project would consist of two years of the Program, 1967 and
1968, and the proposed loan would finance about one-fifth of the commitments
during this period.
ii.       The 1964-73 Modernization Program is designed to transform RENFE
from an antiquated enterprise operating at a large deficit and providing
inadequate service into an efficient and modern railway system earning a
reasonabLe return on its investment.  The Program includes not only a large
Investment Plan, but also a reorganization of RENFE's management, moderniza-
tion of operations and a reduction in staff, the closing of uneconomic lines
and stations, a freight rate and passenger fare structure more closely re-
lated to costs, improved transport coordination, and many other measures.
iii.      This would be the second Bank loan to RENFE. The first loan,
amounting to US$65 million equivalent, was made in 1964 and helped to finance
RENFE's 196h-65 investments. As part of that loan, agreement was reached
on the detailed measures to be carried out by the Government and RENFE under
the Modernization Program. Considerable progress has been made in its im-
plementation. REINFE's management has been reorganized, much of the over-age
equipment has been replaced, operations and service have been improved, the
labor force has been reduced, and some uneconomic lines and stations have
been abandoned. RENFE's financial situation has not improved as planned,
largely because in a period of inflationary pressures it has been difficult
to offset wage and other cost increases promptly by tariff increases. Tne
Government's efforts towards transport coordination have also lagged, in
part as a result of a change of Government subsequent to the first loan.
The Program has been. revised to take into account these and other develop-
ments. On balance, given the magnitude of the tasks facing RENFE, progress
can be said to be satisfactory.
iv.       The cost of the revised Investment Plan is estimated at Pts. 72
billion (US$1.2 billion equivalent). This is Pts. 10 billion more than the
original Plan, reflecting price increases in Spain and accelerated dieseli-
zation. IIajor items include the renovation of track (Pts. 18 billion.),
diesel locomotives and train sets (Pts. 15 billion), rolling stock (Pts. 8
billion) and electrification (Pts. 8 billion). The Plan is technically
sound, its financing is reasonably assured and RENEE is well able to carry
it out. RENFE is using consultants in its implementation.



- ii -
v.        The Investment Plan has a sound economic justification.   A sig-
nificant part of Spain's traffic can be ca7ried most economically by railway;
this traffic is likely to incr-aase in the next 10 years and, most important,
the Plan will make it possible to ca-rry the traffic at substantially lower
costs and improve the quality of service. The rate of return on the invest-
ment is in the order of 17 per cent, which is satisfactory.
vi.       RENFEts financial position has improved since the Plan began,
thlough not as much as estimated. The net deficit was reduced from Pts. 5.2
bill±on in 1963 to Pts. 4.0 billion in 1964 but it has since then remained
more or less stable,although improving in real terms.   RENFE's first financial
objective under the 1964 loan was to cover its cash expenditures (including
interest) by 1968. The Bank has agreed to defer this objective to 1969, al-
lowing more time for RENFE to apply rate adjustments to offset the large in-
creases in costs in 1966 and 1967. On the other hand, it has been agreed
that, in addition to cash expenditures, depreciation would be covered in 1970
instead of 1971, and that RENFE would earn a return of 4.5 per cent instead
of 3.6 ner cent on its net fixed assets by 1973. These improved financial
objectives for 1970-73 are based on the Government's agreement to give RENFE
greater freedom in promptly adjusting its rates to offset increased costs and
on the reduction of costs from accelerated dieselization and the assumption
of certain pension charges by Government. Realization of these improved
objectives would constitute satisfactory progress towards a sound financial
position. In addition, assets have been revalued, the financial structure
has been reorganized, and modern accounting and costing systems established.
vii.      The proposed Bank loan would finance primarily electric locomotives,
passenger and freight cars, trailers for electric trains, and rails and ties.
All goods financed under the loan would be acquired through international
competitive bidding. In evaluating bids, Spanish manufacturers would be
granted a margin of preference of 15 per cent or prevailing customs duties,
whichever is lower; prices of foreign tenderers include the amount of the
import equalization tax, which imposes on imported goods the same indirect
tax burden as is imposed on similar goods manufactured in Spain.
viii.     The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$50
million equivalent for a term of 15 years, including a h-year period of
grace.



SPAIN
APP_4ISkL OF THE REVISED MODERNIZATION PROGRAM (1964-1973)
OF THE SPANISH NATIONAL RAILWAY (RENFE)
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Spanish National Railway (RENFE) has asked the Bank for a
loan of US$ 50 million to help finance a part of its 1964-1973 Moderniza-
tion Program. The project would consist of two years of the Program, 1967
and 1968, and the Bank loan would finance about one-fifth of the commit-
ments during this period. The loan would be made to RENFE and guaranteed
by the Government.
1.2       The Bank made a first loan of US$ 65 million to RENFE in 1964
to finance about one-third of the commitments during the first two years,
1964 and 1965, of the Modernization Program. The main objective of the
Program is to change RENFE from an antiquated into an efficient and viable
railway, within a coordinated transport system. The principal measures
to attain this objective are the implementation of the Investment Plan and
the Plan of Action (Annex I). Execution of the Program in the first three
years, 1964-1966, has been generally satisfactory, though there have
been some areas where progress has been less than planned.
1.3       RENFE has revised the M4odernization Program in the light of
experience gained so far. The revised Program, which is reviewed in this
report, was appraised by a Bank mission consisting of Messrs. Loven,
McCunniff and Pusar. To implement the Program, RENFE has prepared a
revised Investment Plan, as well as a new Plan of Action (ANNEX II) on
both of which agreement has been reached among the Government, RENFE
and the Bank.
1.4       The Bank has made two other loans to Spain for transportation:
one of US$ 33 million for highways in 1963 (360-SP) and one of US$ 40 millioi!
fo- ports in 1965 (429-SP). Progress on the execution of both projects is
generally satisfactory although disbursements have been slow because of
administrative delays in presenting reimbursement applications to the Bank.
II. TRANSPORT IN SPAIN
A. The Transport Sector
2.1       Spain has an extensive system of land transport, its principal
routes radiating from Madrid to other important cities, with lateral
connections between them and extensive local and branch lines. There are
a large number of ports with important coastal and overseas traffic.
Air transport, especially for passengers, has assumed an increasing role,
favored by fast-growing tourism, slowness of surface transport and long
distances between major cities.



- 2 -
2.2       Facilities for surface transport would be quite adequate if
capacity were the sole criterion. Many of the facilities, howiever, are
antiquated and have gradually deteriorated because of inadequate main-
tenance.  Moreover, redundant and uneconomic railway lines and services
continue to be operated due to lack of effective transport coordination.
2.3       During the last 15 years, and in particular since 1961, the
Spanish economy has grown rapidly. In the last five years GNP has risen
in real terms by about 8% per annum; income per capita is now about $700.
The transport sector has in recent years accounted for 6-7 per cent of
GNP and for 20 per cent of gross fixed investments.
B. Traffic
2.4       Freight traffic in Spain has grown rapidly between 1955 and 1965,
from about 24 to 48 billion ton-kmi, involving an average annual increase of
7.4 per cent (Table 1). The rate of increase since 1960 has been a very
high 11 per cent, substantially greater than the growth of GNP.
2.5       There has, however, been a major shift of traffic from railway
to roads, While railway freight traffic (which is discussed more fully
in Section III-E) was no higher in 1965 than in 1955, highway traffic has
more than tripled in the last decade. As a result, the railway's share
of total traffic has fallen sharply from about one-third to one-sixth while
the highway share has grown from one-quarter to more than one-half. This
development is not unusual and can be expected to continue, though probably
at a reduced rate. Coastal shipping has about doubled during the last
decade and accounts for slightly more than one-third of total traffic.
2.6       The developments in passenger traffic have been similar to those
in freight, except that its growth has been even more dynamic and it
quadrupled between 1955 and 1965 (Table 2)o Railway passenger traffic
remained virtually constant between 1955 and 1962 but due to a sharp spurt
since then - in part due to tourism - is now fifty per cent above the 1955
level.  Nevertheless, RENFE's share of passenger traffic has declined from
about one-half to one-fifth during the last decade and highway transport
accounts for almost all.of the remainder.
C. Transport Coordination
2.7       Spain's transport system, like that of most countries, has
suffered considerably from inadequate coordination of the various transport
modes. As part of the Plan of Action (Annex I), the Government therefore
decided upon a number of measures to improve transport coordination.
Progress on regulatory studies, which were intended to recommend methods
for more effective regulation and policing of highway transport, and on
their implementation, has generally been satisfactory, though there have
been some delays. However, the pricing of all transport services and the
neutrality of all transport taxes haveto be further studied, with a view
to achieving better transport coordination. Outlines for studies on rate



- 3 -
and tax policy, on fuel prices and on road user charges have recently
been prepared by the Ministry of Public Works and steps are now being
taken to carry out these studies within time periods provided for in the
revised Plan of Action (ANNEX II, Sub I). Because some of the aspects
of such studies involve difficult conceptual problems the studies included
in the revised Plan of Action would be made in close and continued con-
sultation with the Bank.
2.8       The delay in carrying out these studies was largely due to the
change in Government in 1965. The new officials were not familiar with
the problems of transport coordination so that the program was delayed and
temporarily downgraded, and study efforts were shifted to urban transport
facilities and to the narrow-gauge railways, the operation of both of
which produces large deficits.
2.9       In addition to the completion of old stuudies, experience showed
that a number of new studies should be undertaken. Agreements on these
studies and on a schedule for carrying them out have been reached with
the Government. The new studies focus on the following major issues:
(a) attaining greater neutrality in government policies toward the various
transport modes;  (b) application of uniform criteria in investment and
other policies; and (c) improvement of traffic statistics and forecasts.
(ANNEX II, Sub I).
III. THE RAILWAY SYSTEM
A. Organization and Management
3.1       RENFE's railway system comprises all 1,668 mm (516") gauge lines
in Spain. This gauge is considerably wider than the standard gauge of
1,435 mm (4'18") in the rest of Western Europe and the United States.
RENFE has operated as a department of the Ministry of Public Works until
1962 when a temporary decree gave RENFE autonomous status and independent
management over which the Government reserved certain powers.
3.2       In conjunction with the first Bank loan, the Government enacted
a statute establishing RENFE as a public corporation to be operated along
commercial lines. The statute provided for a board of directors and
general and zonal management giving RENFE wide authority over day-to-day
management. It reserved to the Government the power to: (a) appoint the
board of directors and its Chairman; (b) establish general policy on
tariffs; (c) approve the annual operating and investment budgets, longer
term investment plans, and proposed borrowings;  and (d) incorporate new
lines into the system and close down existing lines. Government repre-
sentatives attend board meetings, have no vote but have the right to veto
temporarily board decisions which infringe upon existing laws or Govern-
ment policy. The veto is lifted if not confirmed by Government within
30 days.



- 4 -
3.3       The board of directors is responsible to the Govternment for the
general administration of RENFE, and has the following important powers:
a) to establish tariffs within the Government's general tariff
policy;
b) to appoint and remove the General Manager and any RENFE
employee, and to set wages and salaries;
c) to propose to the Government the total or partial closure
of lines and the inclusion of new lines into RENFE's
system; and
d)  to close stations unless the Minister of Public Works
objects on the ground that such action would jeopardize
efficient transportation.
The statute gives the board sufficient authority to direct RENFE as a
cornmercial enterprise.  In practice, however, the Government has inter-
fered on occasion. It has, for example, prevented RENFE from promptly
increasing tariffs to help offset major wage increases resulting from
government action. Measures to avoid this situation in the future are
discussed in paragraph 6.4.
3.4       The General Manager is charged with day-to-day management and
with the execution of board decisions. He is responsible to the board
whose meetings he participates in but without a vote. He is free to
delegate powers to department heads and to managers of the seven zones
into which RENFE is divided.
3.5       The present Chairman and General Manager, both appointed in
1962, are able and energetic. The seni.or staff is well qualified and
recruitment and training programs are proceeding well. RENFE also retains
consultants to help implement the Program, with SOFRERAIL assisting on a
continuous basis.
B. Labor Force and Wages
3.6       RENFE's labor force is larger than needed, and between 1964 and
1966 it was reduced from almost 120,000 to 108,000. While this is an
important achievement it is somewhat below the rate previously envisaged,
and there still is considerable redundancy of labor. RENFE, therefore,
proposes to make further reductions as follows:
End of Year            Employment
(000)
1966                   108
1968                    97
1970                    88
1973                    79



-5-
Of this reduction of 29,000, almost 18,000 can be achieved by normal
attrition. The Government has agreed to RENFE's schedule for the early
retirement of the other Il,000 employees which would entail incentive
bonuses to about 7,000 of these retirees (the other 4,000 being only
temporary workers).  The cost to REfFE of these bonuses (and other rela-
ted expenses) would be about Pts. 1 billion. (ANNEX II, Sub II, 1).
3.7       Because additional reductions in the labor force beyond those
discussed above may well be desirable, RENFE is to review the problem
in the next two years after having gained more experience in modern
operating methods,especially in the maintenance of diesel and electric
locomotives and the operation of group stations for less-than-carload
freight. If the review indicates the desirability of further labor force
reductions, the Government has agreed to enable RENFE to make them.
(ANNEX II, Sub II, 2).
3.8       Average wages per worker increased by 35 per cent between 1963
and 1966; this is actually less than the average increase of 50 per cent
during this period for industrial labor in Spain, but increases granted
by RENFE in 1967 have equalized wages.  Since RENFE's labor force declined
by about 13 per cent, the total wage bill, including pensions, increased
by 22 per cent.  The financial implications of this are discussed in
paragraph 6.6
3.9       The social security benefits received by RENFE's workers,
especally for pensions, are higher than those of workers in other Spanish
industries. Unlike these other industries,,part of whose pension costs are
paid for by the Government, RENFE has been obliged to finance the entire
cost of these benefits. However, the Government has agreed that, begin-
ning in January 1967, RENFE should contribute only the same proportion of
wage costs to the pension fund as do other industries and that the
Goverrunent will finance the excess.
C. Execution of Investment Plan
3.10      Execution of the Investment Plan during its first three years
(1964-66) has been generally satisfactory (Table 3). Expenditures of
Pts. 17.7 billion during this period were about 90 per cent of the fore-
cast (excluding contingencies). Contracts have been placed for two-thirds
of the procurement projected for 1967. Acquisition of some items, such
as diesel and electric locomotives, passenger cars and electric multiple
units, and electrification of lines were accelerated beyond the planned
rate because the passenger traffic increase was faster than anticipated
and REINE was able to put into effect dieselization and electrification
more rapidly than originally planned.
3.11      Disbursement of funds from Loan 387-SP has been slow mainly
because a) the loan became effective about seven months after signing,
b) tender procedures took longer than expected, and c) delivery terms
were long for most of the equipment. The Bank has agreed to postpone
the closing date from June 30, 1967 to December 31, 1968, to enable RENFE



- 6 -
to use most of the Loan funds; but even at this later date, some reten-
tion money included in the Loan amount would not have been paid.
3.12      RENFE operates about 13,400 route-km of line of which about
3,000 km are electrified and 2,000 km have double track (see map).  Of
the 15,400 track-km, about 6,850 km were in bad condition in 1963, but
about 1,750 km were renewed in 1964-66, and an additional 5,100 km are
plaimed for renewval in the remaining Program period. Structures are
gelnerally in good condition but some bridges need strengthening to raise
their load limits; work on this is well in hand. The condition of
buildings is also being improved. Fixed equipment of electrified lines
is well maintained. Signalling and telecommunications are being greatly
improved under the Modernization Program.
3.13      While most of the motive power units are still steam locomotives.
they are being phased out rapidly (Table 4) and now account for only
one-third of the total locomotive mileage.  All of the 1,150 steam loco-
motives that were over 30 years old in 1964 have been scrapped, which is
alhead of schedule, and the number of motive powier units has been reduced
by about 700 to about 3,270. The diesel and electric units are generaJ.ly
of recent date. Mlaintenance of motive power is adequate.
3.14      Most of the passenger and freight cars that were older than
40 years in 1964 have been replaced by new ones. Four hundred new passen-
ger cars, as well as diesel and electric rmultiple units sets, were added
to the fleet, which enabled RENFE to scrap all of the 975 over-age cars.
The number of passenger cars was reduced by about 300 and an additional
350 have been set aside for scrapping. Similarly, the number of freight
cars was redtuced from 63,700 to 54,100 (Table 4) by scrapping approximately
12,700 of the 15,500 over-age cars, while 3,100 new cars were acquired.
The reduction was made possible by improved car utilization and the more
modern fleet has made maintenance easier and improved availability (see
paragraph 3.16).
3.15      Design of one major classification yard has been completed and
earthwork is underway.  The 29 existing yards will be reduced to 14,
including 6 newJ ones. Many of the old repair shops for steam locomotives
and freight cars have been eliminated and replaced by a small number of
modern shops.
D. Operations
3.16      The modernization of rolling stock has sharply reduced the
major problems of train operations arising from the variety and age of
cars. Freight trains are now operated at a uniform speed; car control
has been improved by modernized communications and car utilization has
thus increased; turn-around time has been lowered by 10 per cent and
average load per loaded car increased by 14 per cent. A computer center
in Madrid will begin operations early in 1968; it will, for example,
handle passenger seat reservations for larger stations and keep track of



-7-
all freight cars. This should further improve car utilization and
accelerate freight delivery.
3.17      Train punctuality has remained largely unchanged at delays of
about 5% of scheduled time for passenger trains and of 11% for freight
trains. The delays occur mainly on lines under track renewal; to improve
the situation, RE&FE will concentrate track renewals at fewer places at
a time.
32.8      Nine out of 35 central (group) stations have been remodeled.
By shifting local distribution of parcels to trucks, the need for several
slow-moving and expensive. "pick-up" trains has been eliminated; this is
partly responsible for the better utilization of cars.
3.19      RENFE is also studying the possibility of eliminating other
trains with onlyr a few cars, particularly on branch lines. Several of
these uneconomic trains already have been suppressed, others have been
replaced by fast diesel trainsets. The discontinuance of service on
uneconomic lines and stations is discussed in Section F below.
3.20      Labor productivity has risen from 103,000 traffic units (one
net ton-km is one traffic unit while a passenger-km is one-half a
traffic unit) per employee in 1963 to 132,000 in 1966, or by a satisfac-
tory 28 per cent in the three years. A 125 per cent productivity increase
is RENFEts target for the whole Program period; this is realistic, and
consistent with the planned accelerated reductions in the labor force
discussed above (paragraph 3e6).
E.  Railway Traffic
3.21     Freight Traffic.   PENFE's commercial freight traffic, measured
in ton-kIn, has i-ncreased by about 3 per cent annually since the early
1960's (Table 5). The tonnage carried has been more-or-less stable,
but the average distance of haul has increased from about 240 km to more
than 290 km. Thase developments largely reflect the loss of short-haul
traffic to road competition. RENFE's traffic therefore consists increas-
ingly of long-haul, low-value bulk commodities, for which it is generally
the most suitable carrier.  In 1966, six major commodities (coal, petro-
leum, grain, mineral ores, fertilizers, and iron and steel products)
accounted for slightly more than one-half of commercial traffic (Table 6).
Nevertheless, RENFE still carries a considerable volume of cargo which is
subject to competition.
3.22      RENFE's commercial freight traffic for 1964-66 was below the
previous forecast;  in 1966, for example, it had been estimated at about
9 billion ton-km but reached only 7.9 billion (Table 7). The main reasons
for this include loss of coal traffic at a Laster rate than anticipated
due to its replacement by gas; failure of mineral ore traffic to increase
due to a drop in exports and delays in increasing production; and
virtually no increase in petroleum traffic due to greater pipeline



- 8 -
competition. RENFE believes that these factors are largely temporary,
and it has prepared two new forecasts: one is based on the prospects
for individual commodities (Table 6), the other on general economic con-
siderations, such as national income and past trends (Table 7). RENFE
expects major increases in steel products, fertilizers, minerals and
grains. Especially in the case of grains and fertilizers, RENFE has
been unable to compete with road transport because it lacked the proper
rolling stock, a situation which new procurement is now correcting.
RENFE's two forecasts indicate traffic of 10.9 and 11.3 billion ton-km
in 1973. The Bank has accepted the conservative forecast as more realistic.
It assurnes a growth of 7.5 per cent for 1967, with annual rates graduaLly
declining to 3 per cent after 1970; while the estimated increase in 1967
is higher than the growth in recent years, traffic in the first quarter
of 1967 was about 16 per cent higher than in 1966.
3.23      Passenger Traffic.  RENFE's passenger traffic has been substan-
tially more buoyant than its freight traffic in recent years. While
passenger traffic was more or less constant between 1955 and 1961, the
annual increase since 1961 has averaged more than 10 per cent (Table 8).
A najor reason for this increase is the great improvement in service.
The average distance of travel has been constant at about 70 km.
3.24      Passenger traffic was originally estimated to reach 12 billion
passenger-km by 1973 (Table 9). This has now been increased to 15.3
billion passenger-km because in 1966 the actual traffic had already
reached 12.5 billion passenger-km. This forecast, which involves a
growth of 2.5 per cent annually, takes into account the past trend,
including the relation between growth in GNP and traffic, the increase
in highway competition, as well as the impact of proposed fare increases
and the shift from the three to a two-class system by 1968.
3.25      While the traffic forecasts are important in estimating RENFE's
future financial position, they are less important in evaluating the
Investment Plan. Most of the investments are needed to increase efficiency,
not to increase capacity, and a traffic growJth lower than estimated would
make it possible to accelerate investments to improve productivity in
the early years.
F. Uneconomic Lines and Stations
3.26      As part of the 1964 Loan Agreement, RENFE agreed to study about
2,000 km of low traffic lines by the middle of 1967 with a view to
discontinuing service on those that prove to be uneconomic. RENFE has
made a major effort, but the studies are nevertheless about one year
behind schedule. The reasons for the delay include virtual absence of
cost data by line, large errors in traffic and other statistics, and
the complexity and newness of the study methodology. The methodological
problems have now been resolved and the studies are progressing satisfac-
torily. A new schedule has been agreed to which calls for completing the
studies of the original 2,000 km of lines by the Surarer of 1968, and of an



- 9 -
additional 500 km by the Spring of 1969, such lines to be identified by
t'he end of 1967.
3.27      For study purposes, the lines were subdivided into five groups,
chosen primarily on the basis of their low traffic (ANNEX III). Since
1964, 234 km of uneconomic lines have been closed (except that through
traffic is continuing on a part of one line).  Studies for an additional
463 km of lines have been completed; they indicate that an additional
315 km should be closed completely and 50 km should be closed to freight
traffic but continued for passenger service. These recommendations were sub-
mitted to the Government and are awaiting its approval, which has been
slow in forthcoming.
3.28      RENFE has also initiated a program of discontinuing service on
uneconomic stations or turning regular stations into flag stations.
RU.NFE believes that of its 3,000 stations, one-half deserve careful study
because their closing might result in substantial savings. During 1966,
90 stations were closed or converted to flag stations. An additional 73
stations have been studied and recommended for closing; the Government's
approval is awaited. It is expected that by the end of 1968, 150 addi-
tional stations will be closed. It has been agreed during negotiations that
RE4FE will studyt 250 stations annullay during the next six years.
3.29      It has also been agreed auring negotiations that whenever the
studies indicate thaat service on lines or stations should be partially or
entirely discontinued, RENFE will submit to Government a proposal for
prompt decision on a case-by-case basis. Within six months the Government
l-Jill take appropriate action on any such proposal.
IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN
A. The Investment Plan
4.1       The cost of the 1964-73 Investment Plan, which was originally
estimated at Pts 62 billion, was recently revised by RENFE and reviewed
by the Bank, and is now estimated at Pts 72 billion (US$ 1.2 billion)
(Table 10). About two-thirds of this increase reflects price inflation
in Spain; the balance is accounted for mainly by the decision to elimi-
nate steam traction by 1973, for which RENFE will require more diesel
and electric locomotives and electric multiple units (Table 11). Detailed
engineering surveys have shown that track renewal can be reduced somewhat
but due to increases in prices, total costs of this renewal will rise.
The number of diesel trainsets, and passenger and freight cars has been
reduced since it now appears that they can be used more efficiently than
assumed earlier.
4.2       Annual investments are expected to be at a high level of
Pts 8-9 billion in 1967-72 and then decline sharply to Pts 3.4 billion
in 1973 as the Plan reaches completion; this will no doubt require



- 10 -
further review in a few years. About one-half of the investments would
be for motive power, rolling stock and ancillary workshops and store-
houses; the other half would be for track, structures and other fixed
installations. The main items in the remaining seven years of the Plan
include renewal of 5,100 km of track, or about 40,<0 of RENFE's total;
construction of 6 new classification yards and modernization of 8 secon-
dary ones; remodelling of 26 stations; procurement of 412 diesel locomo-
tives and 86 diesel trainsets, which will permit elimination of all steam
locomotives; acquisition of 56 electric locomotives and 212 electric mul-
tiple units; and the purchase of 125 passenger cars and 7,400 freight cars.
Othler major items include telecommurications, signalling and central
traffic control equipment, and construction of housing and training centers.
4.3       While the Investment Plan is designed primarily to modernize
RENFE, it would also expand its capacity to move the expected increase
in traffic.  The Plan is based on realistic assumptions regarding better
utilization of motive power and rolling stock and improved operating
methods.  It is technically sound.  However, since future traffic may
differ from the forecast and since further experience with the new equip-
ment may also call for changes, the Plan should continue to be reviewed
annually and modified if necessary. Government has approved the revised
Investment Plan, and given assurance that no important changes will be
made in it without the agreement of the Bank. As a condition of effective-
ness of the proposed loan, the Government has agreed to enact legislation,
satisfactory to the Bank, incorporating the revised Investment Plan
(paragraph 7.2).
B. The Project
4.4       The Project would consist of the two years, 1967 and 1968,
of the Modernization Program and the proposed loan would amount to about
one-fifth of the investments during this period. It would finance the
following items:
Estimated Cost
Number                                       (US$ million equivalent)
1,150       Freight Cars and spare parts            14.00
40       Electric Locomotives and spare parts    13.00
75       Trailers for Electric Trains and
spare parts                          6.25
30,000 tons Rail                                      4.25
40       Passenger Cars and spare parts           3.22
Signalling and Interlocking Equipment    2.77
800,000       Ties                                     2.57
1,000       Copper Wire                              1.67
Contingencies                            2.27
Total                                50.00



- 11 -
The allowance of about 5 per cent for contingencies is considered adequate
since unit prices are based on recent contracts. The Closing Date of the
proposed loan would be July 31, 1971.
4.5       All goods financed under the loan would be acquired through
international conmpetitive bidding. In bid evaluat'on, Spanish manufacturers
would be granted a margin of preference of 15 per cent or the applicable
customs duties, whichever is lower; foreign bids would include the amount
of the "Impuesto de Compensacion de Gravamenes Interiores" (ICGI) which
imposes on imported goods the indirect taxes which are levied on the same
goods when manufactured in Spain. Under GATT, a country is allowed to tax
imported goods according to its internal tax system and GATT has accepted
Spain's ICGI on this basis as a tax to equalize competition between domes-
tic and foreign products. It amountc to about 11 - 14 percent of CIF
prices for railway equipment. A similar procedure was followed in the
previous loan to RENFE and in the Spanish highway loan (360-SP) and ports
loan (429-SP). Spanish industry is expected to tender for the above items
and it is, therefore, difficult to estimate the foreign exchange component
of the proposed loan. For the first RENFE loan, this component was ap-
proximately 25 per cent. For the project as a whole, the foreign exchange
component is believed to be greater than the amount of the loan.
4.6       If any savings in expenditures are realized as a result of
favorable prices, these savings in the loan account should be made avail-
able to RENFE for the acquisition of additional equipment and material
since the amount of the proposed loan covers only a small proportion of
REME's requirements in 1967 and 1968.
C. Import Licenses
4.7       Under the Spanish Law for the Protection of National Industry,
Government agencies, including RENFE, are obliged to buy Spanish products
if they are of satisfactory quality, regardless of how much more ex-
pensive they are then similar foreign products. A complicated procedure
is involved for obtaining import licenses, which applies even to imported
goods financed from the Bank loan. RENFE has experienced difficulties
and delays in obtaining such licenses although in the end they have always
been granted. During negotiations for the proposed loan, the Government
has agreed to issue such licenses to RENFE within 30 days of application.



- 12 -
D. Financing the Plan
4.8       The Investment Plan will be financed from three sources:
Government grants, retained earnings and foreign borrowing. Of the total
Plan of Pts 72 billion, Pts 18 billion have been expended in 1964-1966.
Of the remaining Pts 54 billion, Government equity contributions would
provide Pts 23 billion; Pts 21 billion would come from internally-
generated funds (including depreciation); and Pts 10 billion would come
from external borrowing, of which the existing and proposed loans would
provide Pts 5 billion (see paragraphs 6.13 and 6.14).
V. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Introduction
5.1       The essence of the economic justification for RENFE's Invest-
ment Plan is that a significant part of Spain's traffic can be carried
most econornically by railway. RENFE carries a large volume of bulk
commodities moving in carloads or even trainloads for average distances
of 290 km; to carry sucn freight by truck would be considerably more
costly. The Investment Plan will substantially reduce railway operating
costs, improve service and provide additional capacity for increased
traffic. The outlook for future traffic is discussed in paragraphs 3.22
and 3.24.
B. Increased Efficiency
5.2       The most important objective of the Plan is to increase RENFE's
efficiency by replacing obsolete with modern facilities. The progress in
achieving this objective can be measured directly by the decline in
operating costs per traffic unit. The following table shows both the
achievement in 1963-66 as well as the estimated increases in efficiency
until 1973:
1963     1966     1973
Traffic Units (billions)        12.8     14.2     18.9
Operating cost at constant
1966 prices, net of taxes
(Pts billions)                  18.3     16.6     18.2
Operating cost per traffic
unit (Pts)                       1.43     1.17     0.97
Improvement (per cent)            -      18       32
The table indicates that progress during the last three years has averaged
about 6 per cent per annum, which is much better than the estimated



- 13 -
average annual improvement for the entire ten-year Program. When the
reduction in transport costs between 1963 and 1973 (from Pts 1.4 to 0.9
per traffic unit at constant prices) is compared with the investment
costs, and assuming no traffic increase after 1973, the return on the
Investment Plan, assuming an average useful life of 25 years for
investments, would be about 17 per cent.  The benefits of the major
investment items are discussed below.
5.3       Motive Power. The 442 line diesel locomotives, 80 electric
locomotives and 23!5 shunting diesel locomotives in the 10-year Plan will
replace nearly 3,000 over-age steam locomotives and permit complete
dieselization by 1973. The new locomotives will move about two-thirds
of total traffic and will result in savings per gross ton-km of about
Pts 0.12 for passengers and Pts 0.05 for freight; the major savings
include reduced maintenance, fuel and labor costs. Total annual savings
in 1973 would thus amount to Pts 2.6 billion. When these benefits are
compared vwith the investment costs over a life of 15 years for diesels
and 25 for electric locomotives, the rate of return is almost 30 per cent.
This does not allow for qualitative improvements, especially faster service.
5.4       Freight Cars.  The 10,531 freight cars in the program are required
to replace over-age cars. They will handle primarily such traffic as steel
products, grains, oranges, etc., which RENFE would otherwise noQ be able to
transport. The average fully distributed cost of handling this type of
traffic by rail is about Pts 1.4 per ton-km, compared to road costs of
about Pts 2.0. However, since railway service is station-to-station while
road service is door-to-door, about Pts 0.35 must be added to railway
costs to make them comparable to road costs. Nevertheless, the railway
would still have an advantage of Pts 0.25 per ton-km. When this benefit
is measured against the investment costs, assuming a life of 25 years, the
rate of return is 15 per cent. Since the quality of service tends to be
higher by road the rate of return would in practice be somewhat lower.
5.5       Passenger Cars. Most of RENFE's passenger cars prior to the
Modernization Program were inadequate and unsafe. The acquisition of
651 passenger and baggage cars, 293 electric and multiple units and 122
diesel trainsets will rectify this deficiency and also increase capacity
for the growing passenger traffic. RENTE estimates that the average cost
of handling passenger traffic is about Pts 0.56 per passenger-km compared
to Pts 0.60 per passenger-km by road. When this benefit is compared with
the investment costs, assuming a life of 25 years, the rate of return is
14 per cent. This makes no allowance for the additional investments in
roads that would be needed if railway service were abandoned;  these would
be especially heavy for the commuter traffic now carried by RENFE.
5.6       Track Renewal.  The Investment Plan calis foir renewal of 6,830 km
of track at a cost of Pts 17.6 billion; the track is in a very bad condi-
tion and unsafe for normal operations. RENFE est1mite6 that better tracks
will lower train operating costs by, for example, preventing frequent slow
downs and reducing wear and tear on rolling stock. Track nlaintenance and



repair costs would also be reduced. Total benefits would amount to about
Pts 150,000 per km annually, bringing a rate of return of 8 per cent on
the investment over its useful life of 40 years. This rate is satisfac-
tory since it makes no allowance for the fact that the situation would
deteriorate without the investments, nor for certain additional benefits,
such as increased safety and lower breakage.
VI. FINANCIAL SITUATION
A. Tariff Policy
6.1       RENFE's traditional tariff policy paid little attention to
costs and profitability and RENFE has operated at a deficit since its
inception in 1941. Freight rates were based on the value of service
principle as reflected by the value of the commodity and had little
relation to the costs of individual services. With growing competition
by road transportation, this policy became increasingly difficult to
apply and in conjunction with the first Bank loan, a new policy was
introduced providing for tariffs based on costs and for revenues which
wvould cover all operating expenses and a reasonable return on RENFE's
assets; the latter requirement was specifically incorporated in the basic
RENFE Statute.
6.2       RENFE has three types of carload freight rates. About 80 per
cent of the carload traffic moves at special commodity rates, 18 per
cent moves at contract rates and 2 per cent at general rates applicable
to specific classes of freight.  RENIFE is, however, working on a new
general rate structure which would reduce the number of classes and
make them similar to those generally prevailing elsewhere in Western
Europe, take into account the weight of shipments, and generally give
greater emphasis to costs. In line with the agreement under the first
Bank loan, RENFE has established a costing department, developed costing
procedures, and has made numerous adjustments for individual commodities
and contracts bringing rates more closely in line with costs. Agreement
has been reached during negotiations to continue this program. Selec-
tive rate increases have been approximately in compliance with the Plan
of Action and normal commercial rates have been applied to government
traffic as provided for in the Plan.
6.3       REINFE's passenger fares were increased both in 1965 and 1966
and are now Pts 0.98 per passenger-km for first class service, Pts 0.70
for second class and Pts 0.45 for third class. Third class service is
being eliminated. As a result of these measures and certain additional
increases (see paragraph 6.8) the average fare per passenger-km will
have almost doubled between 1964 and 1968 from Pts 0.40 to Pts 0.75,
which will make fares comparable to those generally prevailing in
Western Europe.



- 15 -
6.4       An important problem confronting RENFE has been its inability
to increase tariffs promptly to offset cost increases, especially higher
wages (see paragraph 3.3).  Since 1963, rapid economic growth has been
accompanied by strong inflationary pressures, the cost of living rising
by 30 per cent over the last three years. In the same period average
wages per worker increased by 35 per cent, and since the Government
delayed approving tariff increases, these higher wages became the major
difficulty in improving REaTE's financial condition (see paragraph 3.8).
During negotiations, the Government has agreed in the future to fix
annuaily and in advance the limits within which RENFE may revise its rates
and fares to offset cost increases and achieve the financial objectives of
the Program.
B. Earnings
6.5       The 1964 Loan Agreement provided for specific targets for
improving PME'FEts financial situation: a) in 1968, RENFE's revenues
should be sufficient to meet cash operating expenses and interest;
b) in 1971, they should also cover depreciation; and c) within a few
years after 1973, RENFE should be earning a reasonable return on net
fixed assets, revalued as of January 1, 1964. RENFE has agreed, also,
to revalue its assets from time to time to reflect realistic current
values.
6.6       The actual achievement so far is sumimarized below (in Pts
billions):

1/ Depreciation has been estimated for 1963.
RENFE's financial situation improved substantially in 1964, but progress
was slower in 1965 and 1966. The improvement was much less than
planned for the latter year, revenues having risen about 5 per cent
above estimates wilile operating expenses rose about 10 per cent. The
forecast was based on constant 1964 prices and on the assumption that
RWFE would be penritted to increase its rates and revenues to the extent
necessary to offset higher costs. In spite of the reduction in the



- 16 -
labor force, personnel costs went up by 22 per cent betveen 1963 and
1966 and prices of materials and supplies also rose substantially; but
the higher costs were not promptly or adequately offset by tariff
increases. While the net deficit has remained stable at about Pts 4.0
billion in the last three years, this represents a substantial reduc-
tion in real terms since there was an appreciable price inflation during
this period.
6.7       RENFE?s future earnings as estimated by RENFE and the Bank,
are summarized below (in Pts billion) (for details see Table 12):

* Actual figures.
Earnings under this forecast would continue to improve, after a tempo-
rary setback in 1967 because wage increases in January and March of this
year were not offset by tariff increases until July. The operating ratio
would decline progressively from 119 in 1967 to 99 in 1969 and 85 in 1973.
RENFE would not quite meet the first financial target, previously agreed
for 1968, there being a shortfall of Pts 180 million or less than one per
cent of operating expenses in that year. On the other hand, the other
financial objectives would be met on time or even earlier, with deprecia-
tion being first covered in 1970 instead of 1971. A rate of return on
net fixed assets would be earned first in 1969; the return would improve
progressively to 2.2 per cent in 1970 and 4.6 per cent in 1973; these would
be somewhat higher than planned earlier, reflecting the acceleration of
the Modernization Program and additional tariff increases of 3 per cent,
2 per cent and 1 per cent on July 1, 1968, 1969 and 1970, respectively.
Agreement has been reached on these financial objectives and that all
necessary measures will be taken to achieve them. Additionally, before
the end of 1967, RENFE will review with the Bank firm proposals concerning
the increases in rates and fares for 1968.
6.8      The forecast of earnings is based on a number of important
assumptions:
a) The traffic forecast discussed in paragraphs 3.22 and 3.24;
b) Increases in freight rates amounting, on an annual average
basis, to 3.0 per cent in 1968, an additional 2.5 per cent in 1969, 2.0 per
cent in 1970 and 1 N nAr csent. in nach -,ifhAr.nt,n±. vp.qr tn 1971-



- 17 -
c)  Increases in passenger fares, on an annual average basis,
of 1.5 per cent in 1968, 4.0 per cent in 1969, 3.9 per cent in 1970,
3.4 per cent in 1971 and in 1973.   In addition, elimination of third
class passenger services and shifts to first class service are expected
to increase average passenger revenues by 5.9 per cent in 1968, 4 per
cent in 1969 and about one-half of one per cent in each year 1970 through
1973.
d) RENFE will continue to receive the "Canon de Coincidencia4ll
revenues and pay gas-oil taxes or, alternatively, as agreed by the Govern-
ment, comapensating measures will be taken to offset any loss in net revenues
should the Canon be discontinued and taxes continue; these decisions will
depend on the outcome of studies now underway (see paragraph 2.7).
e) The labor force reduction discussed in paragraph 3.6, and
a Govermnent payment for a certain part of pensions as discussed in
paragraph 3.9.
f) Constant prices for materials and supplies, except for a
slight increase in coal prices in 1968; annual wage increases of 5 per
cent for in-grade promotions, in addition to the increases already granted
in 1967. Increases in tariffs to offset any additional increases in
operating costs (paragraph 6.4).
g) Reduction in total fuel costs by about one-third between
1966 and 1973, primarily because of dieselization.
6.9      Becauise it is difficult to measure the over-all results of
selective tariff increases in terms of revenue increases, RENFE has
agreed during negotiations that adjustments of rates and fares will be
made on a continuing basis in relation to the costs of providing the
various services; that cost studies will be continued for the various
classes of service in order to develop by January 1, 1968 operating
ratios for each principal class of service; that the individual opera-
ting ratios so developed will be used as guidelines for determining the
annual adjustment of individual rates and fares beginning in 1968; and
that these individual operating ratios will be consistent with RENFE
attaining over-all operating ratios of 108 per cent in 1968, 99 per cent
in 1969, 93 per cent in 1970, 89 per cent in 1971, 87 per cent in 1972
and 85 per cent in 1973. This formula will replace the percentage
increases in rates and fares that now appear in the Plan of Action
(ANiNEX I) and will be easier to apply when supported by costing data.
This will have the advantage of giving effect to changes not only in
tariffs, but also in traffic, operating efficiency, prices and the
results of studies concerning the Canon de Coincidencia and gas-oil
taxes.
1   The "Canon de Coincidencia" is a tax on passenger services on
highways paralleling the railways (see AMNEX I Sub. I.1.).

Pts 22.64 billion would be for capital investments, Pts 5.03 billion for
operating deficits (including depreciation), Pts 3.49 billion for debt
service, and the remainder of Pts 1.38 billion for old debts and other
delayed receivables in 1967. Loans would finance Pts 10.10 billion
(abo-t US$ 168 million)  of which the first Bank loan provides about
Pts 2.03 billion and the proposed loan about Pts 3.00 billion.
Additional long-term borrowings would not be needed until after 1968;
RENFE has agreed that it will not undertake such additional borrowing
without prior consultation with the Bank. The Government has agreed
to finance-the Investment Plan, to finance operating deficits (including
depreciation), and to provide funds for debt service to the extent re-
quired; and RFNFEts future earnings position and financial condition
represent reasonable progress in attaining viability.
6.15      RENFE has installed a modern commercial accounting system,
though with some delays. Several qualified accountarts are being
added to the staff and a private independent accounting firm has been



- 20 -
engaged to audit RENFE's accounts annually. Its work has been satis-
factory, although the simultaneous introduction of the new accounting
system and the mechanization of accounting procedures has caused delays
and as a result the audit of the 1966 accounts has not yet been completed.
These accounts have been approved by the Board of RENFE and its manage-
ment has warranted that they correctly set forth RENFE's financial con-
dition as of December 31, 1966, and that there has been no material
adverse change since that date in its financial condition. RENFEs
budget has been revised to conform with the new accounting system, and
the procedures for preparing the budget and controlling expenditures
are satisfactory.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.1      RThNFE's revised Modernization Program, 1964-1973, is designed
to accelerate RETFE's rehabilitation and its progress towards operating
efficiency and financial viability. It is well planned, technically
sound, and the investments yield a satisfactory economic return. RENFE
and the Government, with the assistance of consuluants, are well able
to execute the Program. Considering the major reforms which RENFE is
caryying out, execution of the Program in the first three years, 1964-1966,
has been satisfactory, although there have been areas where progress
was slow.
7.2      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan to RENFE
of US$ 50 million equivalent, for a term of 15 years with a 4-year grace
period. Before the loan becomes effective the Government is to enact
legislation, satisfactory to the Bank, incorporating the revised
Investment Plan.

SPANISH NATIONAL RAILWAY (RENFE)
PROGRESS UNDER ORIGINAL PLAN OF ACTION
The progress made in carrying out the measures in the original
Plan of Action is as follows:
I. TRANSPORT COORDINATION
1. Review tax on highway pqssenger services paralleling the railway
(Canon de Coincidencia), by mid-1966. Little progress has been made on
this study. The tax will be maintained at least until after studies on
tax neutrality are completed by the Spring of 1968. Abolishing the tax
would reduce RENFE's annual revenue by about Pts. 600 million.
2. Study and revise fuel prices with the aim of achieving fiscal
neutrality between different modes of transport, by mid-1966. The basic
data have been collected and it is expected that the Ministry of Public
WIorks will complete its part by August 1967 and the Finance Ministry its
part by the Summer of 1968. (see 12 below).
3. Establish minimum entry conditions for highway transport, by
early 1965. An important first step was a Decree on the Planning of
Overland Transport issued in February 1966. It defined minimum character,
competence and financial qualifications for truckers operating on a
nationnl or regional basis. In May, 1966, implementing regulations were
issued to supplement the Decree. The regulations recognize "grandfather
rights" of the existing truck operators and affect, therefore, only new
operators and the expansion of existing operators. The decree and its
implementation are satisfactory.
h. Establish more effective weight and size limitations by early
1965. Scales to enforce vehicle weight regulations are being set up at
the borders of Spain, and orders have also been placed for scales for
the interior. Plans call for at least two portable scales in each of the
50 provinces by the end of 1967. Enforcement of vehicle weight and
size limitations was made the responsibility of the police. The present
legal penalties are insufficient for effective enforcement and new
legislation is being drafted for enactment in 1967.
5. Place into effect a better system of inspection to assure the
sound mechanical condition of vehicles in 1965. A plan for the systematic
inspection of vehicles has been developed and is being gradually implement-
ed. Land for installing vehicle inspection stations has been acquired
at various locations and tenders have been asked for station machinery
and equipment. It is expected that within two years a sound vehicle-
inspection system will be operational.



ANNEX I
Page 2
6. Require written contracts for all freight services in a pres-
cribed form, by early 1965. A contract format has been prescribed for
all operators dealing with more than one customer and operating on a
national basis. The Government believes that for the time being it would
be impossible to enforce the agreements between shippers and the thousands
of small regional truckers, who usually own only one vehicle, and who
account for 80-90 per cent of the total vehicle fleet. In the longer
run, the Government hopes to encourage their consolidation into
associations which would make it possible to oversee their operations
more effectively.
7. Regulate freight forwarders, by early 1965. Regulations have
been issued requiring freight forwarders to have adequate performance
bonds. The Government believes that the existing numerous private
freight forwarding agencies who so]icit traffic for truckers, shou'd
undertake the responsibility of implementing regulations for trucking
operations, such as overseeing the regularity of service, adequacy of
performance bonds, etc. The Ministry of Public Works is now studying the
activities of these agencies with a view to giving them these additional
responsibilities, and expects that by end-1967 reliable information will
be available to define the future course of action.
8. Regulate adequacy of services which claim to operate regularly,
by early 1965. Adequate regulations have been issued governing the
regularity of trucking services. The effective enforcement of these
regulations is being studied (see paragraph 7).
9. Establish minimum labor conditions, e.g., maximum working hours
and social security payments, by early 1965. The Government's study has
shown that the labor conditions of the lnrger operators are adequate and
do not require special regulation, while the effective regulation of
thousands of small owner-operators is not possible. The Government does,
however, plan legislation in 1967 to prohibit trucking on holidays.
10. Establish minimum insurance requirements, by early 1965.  Adequate
requirements have been established.
11. Establish uniform accounting system for transport enterprises,
by mid-91965. A study of a uniform accounting system for larger trucking
enterprises has been completed and legislation is to be enacted before
the end of 1967.
12. Study rates and tax policy for all modes of transport, by mid 1966.
After considerable delay, the study of rates and fares and of tax policy
is now underway. It reviews taxes especially fuel taxes, insofar as they
affect rates and fares, in order to ensure fiscal neutrality between the
different transport modes. The study will be completed in the Sunmer of
1968.



ANNEX I
Page 3
II. OPERATIONS
1. Reduction in labor force from January 1, 1964 by about 21,000
permanent and 2,500 temporary workers, by the end of 196; and by an
additional 11,000 permanent and 2,000 temporary workers, by the end of
1973. In 1964-66, the labor force was reduced by almost 12,000.  While
this is an important achievement, it is somewhat below the planned rate.
2. Improved recruitment and training of personnel. Well-managed
programs for recruitment of qualified staff and for training of major
categories of personnel have been established.
3.  Consolidation of existing marshalling yards and construction of
6 new ones, phasing out and replpcement of old repair shops for steam
locomotives by a smaller number of modern repair shops, and discontinuance
of service at uneconomic stations.  Construction of one central marshalling
yard is under way; a large number of old repair shops for steam locomotives
and rolling stock have been closed down and replaced by a small number
of diesel repair shops. One central heavy repair shop is under construct-
ion. Ninety uneconomic stations were closed or converted into flag
stations in 1966, 73 have been recommended for closing, on which
Government approval is being awaited, and about 150 more will probably
be closed in 1968.
4. Modernization of pick-up and delivery of less-than carload
traffic by the establishment of central stations, to and from which
parcels will be delivered by trucks. Thirty-five such stations are
planned, of which nine were put in service by the end of 1966; this
is a good performance.
5. Improved safety by stricter regulation and supervision. Progress
is satisfactory.
6. Reduction of three passenger classes to two by 1968. The third-
class was eliminated on h0 trains in 1964-66 and is to be eliminated on
30 additional ones in 1967; these cover about 40 per cent of passenger
train-kilometers. The program has been accelerated and complete elimination
of the third class in 1968 will probably be achieved.
III. RATES AND FARES
1. Revision of rate and fare structure to relpte it more closely
to transport costs; and
2. Establishment of a costing office and a costing system. A
costing section has been established in RENFE's Management Control Depart-
ment. Much of its work so far has been concerned with the determination
of (a) annual average costs of freight and of passenger services; (b) cost
analyses in connection with the closing of uneconomic branch lines; and
(c) specific costs of individual commodity movements. The tariff structure
will be substantially adjusted on the basis of cost studies to be under-
taken in 1967 and completed in 1968.



ANNEX I
Page 4
3.  Increase of less-than-carload rates in stages until 1969 by a
total of 20 per cent. A sample study indicates that substantial increases
have been made an that the 20% increase may have already been achieved.
4.  Application of normal commercial rates to Government traffic
and m.il.  This requirement hAs been carried out.
5. Increase of rates and fares by 1.5 per cent per annum, beginning
in 1965, reflecting improvement in services.  The requirement has been met
with respect to fares and special commodity rates which cover about 80
per cent of freight traffic. General freight rates will be reviewed
upon completion of the cost studies referred to in paragraph 2 above.
6. Adjustment in fares leading to an increase of passenger revenues
by about 12 per cent as part of inauguration of the two class system.
Revenues increased by abo-at 2.5% in 1965 and 8% in 19?66  as a result of
the reduction by third-class service (see paragraph II-6 above) and some
shifts from second to first class. It is anticipated that the required
12% increase in 1968 will be met.
7. Increase of passenger rates by 6.5 per cent in 1970 and 10 per
cent in 1973. This requirement is not yet effective.
8. Compensation by Government to RENFE for loss of revenue on
passenger services provided by the Borrower at less than normal commercial
rates established by the Guarantor. There has been no need for such
compensation.
IV. FINANCES
1. Incorporation, free of any lien, of the Government contributions
(dotaciones) to RENFE made up to the date of the loan agreement into the
equity (pstrimonio) of RENFE. This has been accomplished.
2. All funds to be made available for capital expenditures after
the date of the loan agreement by the Government to RENFE to be made in
the form of an equity contribution (aportacion patrimonial). This has
been accomplished.
3. Settlement of mutual debts between RENFE and the Government up
to December 31, 1964 and incorporation, free of any lien, of the debt
balance, if any, in favor of the Government into an equity contribution
(aportacion patrimonial) of the Government to RENFE's capital, Determina-
tion of mutual debts indicated that the Government owed RENFE Pts. 3.3
billion; this amount has been paid, though with some delay.
4. Revaluation, from time to time, of RENFE's assets to reflect
realistic and economic values. No revaluation has been required since
1964.



ANNEX I
Page 5
5. Establishment of a modern commercial and, to the extent practica-
ble, mechanized accounting system, to reflect the operations and financial
osition of RENFE accurately and to provide RENFE's management with
-2dequnte financial information.  RENFE installed a new commercial
accounting system for 1965 and has improved it substantially since. It
also employes electronic computers for its accounting. Difficulties have
been encountered primarily because of the simultaneous introduction of
the new accounting procedures and the mechanized methods, and an insufficient
number of qualified personnel. Progress was therefore slow in 1964 and
1905 but has accelerated since then. Additional accountants were hired
in early 1967.  Some problems remain, however, particularly in establishing
prope:-ty accounts, depreciation accounts and accounts receivable from
the Government for old debts and current items, such as for transportation
and debt service.

THE REVISED PLAN OF ACTION
I. Transport Coordination
1.        To achieve greater neutrality in fiscal and other Government
policies with respect to their impact on rates and fares of the various
transport modes, study, under terms of reference prepared in consultation
with the Banlc, and prescribe, in the context of the econony as a whole,
appropriate measures for immediate action on the following matters:
(a) Road-user charges and their relation to highway cost, by
Spring 1968;
(b) Fuel prices and their relation to fuel costs, by Spring 1968;
(c) Rate and fare policy for all modes of transportation and their
relation to the cost of providing transport services, by
Summer 1968;
(d) Taxation of transport services (after road-user charges have
been taken into account), covering all taxes, including the
gas oil tax and the tax on highway passenger services (Canon
de Coincidencia), by Summer 1968;
(e) Prices paid by different modes of transport for equipment
purchased in Spain as compared with international prices,
with a view to determine if any one mode of transport is
bearing an inequitable burden, by end 1968.
2.        To achieve more effective transport coordination through the
application of uniform investment policies, study, under terms of reference
prepared in consultation with the Bank, and prescribe appropriate action on
the following:
(a)  Establishment of criteria for investment in transport, by
Spring 1968;
(b) Cost of investment in, and operation of, level crossings as
shared by rail and road, by Spring 1968; and
(c)  Need for pipeline regulation, including adequate user charges,
by mid-1968.
3.        To improve traffic forecasts and investment planning:
(a)  Compile basic road transport statistics for intercity freight
traffic, e.g., by size of enterprise, volume of traffic,
commodity, distance, type of vehicle, origin and destination,
by late 1967;



Annex II
Page 2
(b) Study transport market performance to evaluate why shippers
select a particular transport mode, by Spring 1968;
(c) Study freight traffic flows by mode of transport, by major
routes and by commodities for a selected base year, by end
1968; and
(d) Study combined highway-railway-port facilities, such as use
of containers, pallets, cranes, railroad trailers, piggy-back
operations, by Spring 1968.
4.        To achieve more effective regulation and policing of highway
transport, take the following actions during 1967:
(a) Implement regulations dealing with minimum conditions for
engaging in highway transport;
(b) Enforce weight and size regulations more effectively;
(c) To ensure sound mechanical conditions of vehicles, implement
a system of inspection; and
(d) Establish a uniform accounting system for large transport
enterprises.
II. Labor Force
1.        Progressively achieve a net reduction of RENFE's labor force
of about 9,000 permanent and 2,000 temporary workers between the end of
1966 and the end of 1968; a further net reduction of about 9,000 by the
end of 1970, and an additional net reduction of at least 9,000 by the
end of 1973.
2.        Restudy RENFE's personnel needs by mid-1969. If the study
indicates the desirability of further reductions, the Government to enable
RMINFE to make them.
III. Finances
1.        The Government to take compensating measures to offset any loss
to REIFE if its revenues were reduced by reason of a change in the Canon
de Coincidencia.
2.        The Government to make quarterly payments in advance to RENFE,
as approved semi-annually in the initial and revised budget for each
year, for deficit, debt service and capital investments. Amounts budgeted
for transportation and other services to the Government to be paid to RENFE
in advance every two months, subject to adjustment in subsequent two-month
periods.
