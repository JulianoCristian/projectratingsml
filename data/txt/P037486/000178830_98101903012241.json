This project, amounting to about\n            one-fifth of RENFE's procurement during this period,\n            will be primarily for electric locomotives, passenger and\n            freight cars, and track materials and equipment. The project\n            also includes a revised Plan of Action which incorporates\n            those measures of the original Plan still to be completed,\n            together with additional measures for transport coordination\n            and for improvement of RENFE's operations and finances.\n            The principal changes entail payment in advance by the\n            Government of sums due to RENFE for operating and capital\n            purposes; maintenance of adequate working capital;\n            accelerated reduction of staff; studies of additional\n            light-traffic lines and stations; and a revised and expanded\n            list of studies and measures on transport coordination."}, "docdt": "1967-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
