The changes include: on November\n            30, 2012, the Bank was notified by the client that land\n            acquisition will be required under the project. The project\n            did not foresee any land acquisition at appraisal and\n            therefore did not trigger the involuntary resettlement\n            (OP/BP 4.12) Bank safeguard policy. This restructuring\n            triggers OP/BP 4.12 in order to provide the appropriate\n            instrument to document the impacts to the affected land\n            owner's property and provide adequate compensation,\n            namely a remedial abbreviated resettlement action plan,\n            which was disclosed in-country on July 12, 2013 and\n            submitted to infoshop for public disclosure on July 16,\n            2013. Additionally, a resettlement policy framework was\n            prepared to provide the Project with a framework and the\n            appropriate tools to handle any future unforeseen land\n            acquisition or resettlement. The resettlement policy\n            framework was disclosed in-country on July 12, 2013 and\n            submitted to infoshop for public disclosure on July 16,\n            2013. The project description is revised to reflect the\n            changes and the loan agreement is amended to refer to the\n            land acquisition. The revisions to the project description\n            will enable the implementation of the remedial abbreviated\n            resettlement action plan. Additionally, the project\n            conditions and legal covenants are revised to include social\n            and environmental management covenants designed to ensure\n            the effective implementation of both the remedial\n            abbreviated resettlement action plan and resettlement policy framework."}, "docdt": "2013-08-26T00:00:00Z"}
