A. SUMMARY

In response to the official request from the Government of Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines (GoSVG) dated November 30, 2012, the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Project (Credit No. IDA-4852 VC) (HTERP-
P124939) is restructured to amend the Loan Agreement to trigger the Involuntary
Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) Bank safeguard policy, amend the Project Results Framework
and correct the cumulative targets under an intermediate indicator.



                                             5
B. PROJECT STATUS

The Project was approved by the Board in January 2011, and was declared effective on
May 4, 2011. The Project consists of eight physical works sub-projects and two technical
assistance activities, which are currently under implementation – ranging from 75-90
percent complete. Overall implementation progress has been moderately satisfactory
due to the delay on the implementation of the activities. The Project is very likely to meet
the development objectives and all Project activities are expected to be completed before
the Project closing date (December 31, 2013).

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Results/Indicators
During project preparation, the cumulative target value for intermediate result indicator
two (“Number of hazard maps produced by the government”) was mistakenly inverted.
The following table describes the proposed changes:

                                                             Cumulative Target Values
                                                              YR1     YR2       YR3
Intermediate Result Indicator Two: Number of Current           2        1        1
hazard maps produced by the government.      Proposed Change   1        1        2

Safeguards
On November 30, 2012, the Bank was notified by the client that land acquisition would
be required under the Project. The Project did not foresee any land acquisition at
appraisal and therefore did not trigger the Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) Bank
safeguard policy. This restructuring triggers OP/BP 4.12 in order to provide the
appropriate instrument to document the impacts to the affected land owner’s property and
provide adequate compensation – namely a Remedial Abbreviated Resettlement Action
Plan, which was disclosed in-country on July 12, 2013 and submitted to InfoShop for
public disclosure on July 16, 2013. Additionally, a Resettlement Policy Framework was
prepared to provide the Project with a framework and the appropriate tools to handle any
future unforeseen land acquisition or resettlement. The Resettlement Policy Framework
was disclosed in-country on July 12, 2013 and submitted to InfoShop for public
disclosure on July 16, 2013. The Project description is revised to reflect the changes and
the Loan Agreement is amended to refer to the land acquisition. The revisions to the
Project description will enable the implementation of the Remedial Abbreviated
Resettlement Action Plan. Additionally, the Project Conditions and Legal Covenants are
revised to include social and environmental management covenants designed to ensure
the effective implementation of both the Remedial Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan
and Resettlement Policy Framework.
