                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved by the Board in January 2011, and became effective on May 4, 2011. The project is set to close on December 31, 2013. The project consists of 7 physical
                         works sub-projects (30 meters of road re-alignment/river defense/slope stabilization sub-project, 3 school rehabilitation sub-projects, and 3 community center rehabilitation sub-
                         projects), and 2 technical assistance sub-projects for a total of US$5 million (100% IDA financed). The project Mid Term Review was held January 22-23, 2013, which concluded that
                         there are no anticipated impediments towards achieving the project's development objectives and all project activities are scheduled to be completed before the project closing date.

                         Currently, all 7 physical works sub-projects were under contract, 6 of which are under construction and range from 30% to 90% complete. The only pending contract is for a
                         consultancy to Establish Hazard and Risk Modeling Database, which is expected to be signed by the end of April 2013.

                         A precise estimate of the final uncommitted balance will be available by the end of April 2013 when the final technical assistance sub-project contract is signed.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As identified in the previous ISR sequence (Sequence #4), the Bank was notified of an unanticipated encroachment at the Hopewell-Teviot sub-project site - resulting from a road re-
                         alignment due to a change in the design of the retaining wall being constructed adjacent to the road. Following this notification, the Bank requested the client to: (i) stabilize the
                         construction site to mitigate any potential hazards; (ii) suspend the contract and demobilize construction activities until an adequate design was produced for the retaining wall; (iii)

                         produce a Remedial Resettlement Action (RAP) Plan documenting the referenced encroachment and compensation package agreed to by the affected parties; and (iv) produce a
                         Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). In parallel, the Bank team would initiate the required level 1 restructuring in order to trigger the Bank's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (Op/BP
                         4.12). During the Mid-Term Review, it was agreed that the revised design (single wall design) approved by the client during construction would be replaced by the original retaining
                         wall design (double wall design) the Bank had given its no objection to during the procurement process. The Bank team also confirmed the construction site had been stabilized
                         following a site visit conducted during the Mid-Term Review. Subsequently, the Bank received the original (slightly modified double wall) design as well as the time table for the
                         completion of the sub-project on February 26, 2013. It is anticipated that the Remedial RAP and the accompanying RPF will be sent to the Bank by mid-March 2013.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
