                         The project became effective on May 4, 2011, and is due to close on December 31, 2013. The project consists of 7 physical works sub-projects (30 meters of road re-alignment/river
                         defense/slope stabilization sub-project, 3 school rehabilitation sub-projects, and 3 community center rehabilitation sub-projects), and 2 technical assistance activities for a total of US
                         $5 million (100% IDA financed). The project Mid Term Review was held on January 22-23, 2013, which concluded that there are no anticipated impediments towards fully achieving
                         the project's development objectives and all project activities are scheduled to be completed before the project closing date.
