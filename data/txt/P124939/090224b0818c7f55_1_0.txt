                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         For the Hopewell Road sub-project, additional technical studies need to be conducted to conclude the final designs for the ongoing works, because of unforeseen soil conditions. To
                         prevent potential damage to private property in the vicinity of the construction site, the Bank has requested (i) to stabilize the construction site to mitigate any potential hazards; (ii) to
                         suspend the contract and demobilize construction activities, until an adequate design is produced for the slope stabilization. The government will submit an achievable timetable for
                         the completion of the required stabilization works as well as studies required to produce the new designs of the referenced slope stabilization intervention.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
