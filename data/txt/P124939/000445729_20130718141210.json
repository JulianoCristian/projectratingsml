category b project indicating that\n            works under the project are largely rehabilitation and\n            retrofitting of selected infrastructure and impacts will be\n            generally associated with the actual construction phase of\n            the works activities. During the evaluation at the\n            preparatory phase, the project was assessed as not having\n            triggered any social safeguards but as a category b project\n            the necessary general Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)\n            was undertaken. This included a partial assessment of social\n            impacts and recommendations where necessary. The triggering\n            of the policy in turn requires the development of a\n            Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and a Resettlement\n            Action Plan (RAP). Given that land has already been\n            acquired, what is being developed here is a remedial\n            abbreviated Plan. This remedial abbreviated RAP is\n            accompanied by a RPF which is being simultaneously\n            disclosed. Specifically the objective of this remedial\n            abbreviated RAP is to: document the nature and extent of\n            land acquisition; value affected assets; identify affected\n            persons; document the entire process to date and how it\n            meets the requirements; highlight gaps in the process and\n            identify next steps to fulfill the requirements; and\n            consultation with and compensation of affected parties."}, "docdt": "2013-05-23T00:00:00Z"}
