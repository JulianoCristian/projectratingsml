The project is designed to\n            increase capacity, reduce congestion, and improve efficiency\n            in the transport network; and improve the planning,\n            programming, finance and management of the urban transport\n            system in Shanghai.  The project will represent the first\n            stage of a long-term program intended to upgrade and develop\n            the urban transport infrastructure in order to meet the\n            demands generated by modernization of the local economy.\n            Project elements consist of contruction of a 5.5 kilometer\n            viaduct with surface road improvements; traffic management\n            and safety including a 1.1 kilometers of busway and 19\n            kilometers of nonmotor vehicle roads; and technical\n            assistance to strengthen the municipality's\n            capabilities for planning and implementing urban\n            transportation measures, effecting improvements in traffic\n            and safety, and public transport management."}, "docdt": "1991-08-12T00:00:00Z"}
