                         this loan focuses on two broad policy areas: (i) efficiency and quality of public expenditure, and (ii) improved competitiveness.

                         implemented with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). Given the continued uncertainty that surrounds the global economic outlook in the wake of financial crisis of 2008-2009, the
                         authorities have made a strategic choice of maintaining an undisbursed amount as a contingent line of credit while drawing on the traditional DPLs for immediate budget support. In
                         keeping with that strategy the authorities requested a three-year extension of the closing date for this loan, to August 5, 2014, which was granted by the Bank. In April 2014, they
                         drew on $150million of the DDO. The second DDO in these series is due to close on January 16, 2015.
