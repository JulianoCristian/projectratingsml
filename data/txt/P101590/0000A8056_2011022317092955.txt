                         The reforms supported by this programmatic series of loans continue to be implemented. As this loan was the only one in the series with a Deferred Drawdown Option, and given the
                         continued uncertainty that surrounds the global economic outlook in the wake of financial crisis of 2008-2009, the authorities have made a strategic choice of maintaining an
                         undisbursed amount as a contingent line of credit while drawing on the traditional DPLs for immediate budget support.
