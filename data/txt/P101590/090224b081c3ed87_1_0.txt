                         implemented with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). Given the continued uncertainty that surrounds the global economic outlook in the wake of financial crisis of 2008-2009, the
                         authorities have made a strategic choice of maintaining an undisbursed amount as a contingent line of credit while drawing on the traditional DPLs for immediate budget support. In
                         keeping with that strategy the authorities requested a three-year extension of the closing date for this loan, to August 5, 2014, which was granted by the Bank. The second DDO in
                         the series has closing date of January 16, 2015.
