    will attempt to improve the planning, management and\n            delivery of the national teacher training programs and\n            reduce the costs of the teaching force. The development of\n            high quality cost effective teacher training programs is\n            expected to have a significant impact on the quality of\n            education. To achieve these objectives the proposed project\n            hopes to: 1) improve the administration and planning\n            capabilities of the Directorate of Teacher Training through\n            the training of directorate staff and the introduction of an\n            appropriate information system; 2) improve the quality,\n            efficiency and cost effectiveness of the primary teacher\n            training system through training of administrative and\n            teaching staff and by establishing a trainer training\n            program for primary teachers.  The project further aims to\n            (3) increase the supply of qualified Yemeni primary teachers\n            by establishing five new primary teacher training institutes\n            (PTTIs) and relocating and expanding one PTTI; and, 4)\n            assist the Faculty of Education (FOE), Sanaa University,\n            train its education faculty and improve its teaching\n            facilities, and develop a long-term strategy for secondary\n            school teacher training."}, "docdt": "1987-03-31T00:00:00Z"}
