The\n            project evaluated in this ICR had two major objectives: (a)\n            improve the planning, management, and delivery of national\n            teacher training programs; and (b) reduce the cost of the\n            teaching force by replacing expatriate teachers with\n            qualified Yemeni teachers. Bank's performance was\n            satisfactory. Borrower's performance was satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (a) emphasis on\n            policy change and institutional   development can have a\n            major impact on sector performance, especially if pursued\n            consistently in a series of operations; and (b) in an\n            inflationary environment,the implementation of civil works\n            will inevitably run into problems if the contractors are not\n            protected from the impact of excessive price increases\n            through price escalation clauses."}, "docdt": "1996-01-31T00:00:00Z"}
