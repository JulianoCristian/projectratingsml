the d   elng civi wr that ewued hed badc the developaent of an educated
pEpion and of a t      iy  qalified labor force. Since the 1962
revoluion, the Yen Arab        c (YAR) has achied far-reaching
i    in its soc    i    se and the iiaterial welfare of its
citizes. me goW nIMt wbich cam  ito pwer at that t-im suceeded in
s si  the fim -of a uodern state within a                   oingly    rt
tim. Sc  has been achievd: fcr exmple, a central anistion has been
establi:hed, a immI but rapidly grawing modern secr of the econy c   into
eistence, and imny inrastrucue pmojects have been cawpleted. Betwn 1970
and 1985,      liin the hu   recurces sector war eqally
JDpssive. D        that period, the education system expnded rapidly frnm a
very ama' baoe. f' uple, in 1971, 125,000 children wer enrolled in
PrIauy adhool.s, rePsIentlng 12% of the   ool-age p atin; by 1985, this
figure bad risen to 780,000 rpusentinq 5S% of the sool-age population. A
diversified secxia ry school syatm is now in eistence and a University has
beon esblishe  at San'a. lb. rapid pace of eqxpansin, the growing dands
for edfation frun a rapidly   reasing   aticn, and, as a result, the
increasing diversity arid        of th ed          system have presene
the Gwnuu with iderb  hle.
1.02    Sinoa 1974, genment             plas  ha  focwsed on the creation
Of infatture, the d         Int of agrilture, and the pvision of
essential social sericmes, particularly ection.  During 1975-1978, there
was rapid emic grcawth, fueled by vraittances frit.  migrant workers and
through grwts and trafer of papmnts fr  n            and friendly states,
notably Saudi Arabia. By the late 19705, bowever, a notable d eration in
econaic grcmth set in uainly because of a deline in both the inflow of
Wras  rwittas and foreign assitace. At the sam time, in 1983 and
1984, the e       slowed down csieay and the Gaernw;t's budgetary
situati  detated. Oil ad gas were dis             in the eas    part of the
cauntr in 1984 awd    oable    r    are large erug to justify exot of
cnre oil, starting posly in 1988. Ihe 2iird Five-Year Deoelpent Plan
(1987-91),  nz  in   ation, will focA a cn increased producticn in the
agriculture, irial and oil and gas sectors, and in pat ar, will
antlz  to attach priority to ha resorce development and to the expamion
of an ird iger tacher training system.

1.03    The extraordinaxy grwth of school       ets since the begining of
the 1970s has placed a major strain on th edcatitn sm and tbe goWernnt
budget. In the past five years, in partir, enroiit in primary
educaticn increased frc 414,000 in 1980/81 to 781,000 in 1984/85, and txose in
seocnlary educaticn frcam 35,000 to 96,500 (Tables 1.1 and 1.2). One reet of
this rapid growth has been a deerioration in the teacher/poil ratio fru  1:42
in 1980/81 to 1:51 in 1984/85, and clas sizes in sc schwols are very large.
Ansothger          of the rapid enrolAent epanion has been the reed for a
high prop       (86%) of expatriate teadhs in both pimry a. sec oary
schos. T illustrate the effect of foreign teaces cn the eduction budget,
the salary bill of the foreign teaches in 1984 was YR 616 millon (US$115
millicn equvalent), or 64% of the M.E budet, mxh of which was in foreign
eae. Administive res            ibilitie  for teache trainig a    ared.
The Ministry of Education (ME) is re ible for privy and seomxary
educatimn, incluaxL.g primry teacher        whereas the training of geieal
seociary school teacher is the re nility of Sana'a Univerity's Paculty
of ducation (NE). Major             on the teacher training programa in
Yemm are that ther is no provision to prepare teadher trainers and that in-
service traini   for eisting Yemi teachirg staff is limited.

rapid grXth of enro       in priy  cls bet             1980/81 and 1984/85,
particularly amng girls. In spite of social custm swhich tend to restrict
girls' participation in education, attitudes are slowly changing and their
nwbers grw by about 27% anually frum 1980/81 to 1984/85. It is now
gverMueant policy to provide schooling equally for boys and girls, and mixed
classe  in privary schools are c=mn. However, the system has low internal
efficiency:  ry 30% of the primary schools provide less than six
grades of eion as a result of    plete  cools and lack of teaders
traiedn iultiade teaching. In additicn, the ladk of Yami teadhe
remlts in high teacepil ratios.

1.15    R                    To alleviate the shortage of Yemeni teadhers
(Table 1.5), the Germmwet has adepted several policies to ecrrage Yemenis
to enter the teadhing profession and to remin in it. HEtever, attrition is
currently a high 10% given the atractivenes of otber careers. A Teacder law,
vhich became effective in September 1981, substantially ifproved the conditions
of servioe for teachers. Oh Taw: (a) grants an incentive allxane of 20% of
basic Slary to teachers, in ad3ition to otr occpation and specializ
allowances generally ganted to wgverrnot ealoyess; (b) creates tht position
of senior teache with mors pay; (c) gives liberal --portunities to teachers
for further sbtdy throuhin-service training and study tours abroa.; and (d)
prvides salary           at the petion of training courses. In additicn,
the Mm provides traines of teacher training prorm with fr  board, lodging
and living all    .  As a relt of better targeted recruit nt, special
incentives and izprov  terms of service, teaching has beczmu a mvere attractive
career ption aun teaher trainng program aore popla  amng y=g

students to the teacher training progra m: the 1985/86 eTnroll  in PITIs

graduates n education; they wild train as a group through ca.eully designrd
fellowhip programs overeas and in adition wold receive on-the-jcb training

teacher training program for senior staff of the SP   (54 man ) and
training of librarians arxn tec ici  (24 an     ) to provide support to
the trainer-trainig program.  Tis TR program would be a         viee     packge
focusing on count_ rt develomant where experts would design, prepare,
suervise and fo1ll- the fel         training in a coord    way. Details
of the technical a i         prgram are shan  in Annex 3.
2.13    Curricula for the PTTls need to be revised to i,erove skills of
teachers to enable them to adapt to the  ational realities of primary
eduaticn in the YAR (para. 1.17). The prped pject wuld therefore
iqiove local capability for dvelcping curricula and evaluating training
through the provision of specilist services and fellowship training, as an
integral part of the tralxpr trainig prgram.

the ctury with                        savngs (para. 3.08). Witht the
project there would still be at least 1,000 foreign primary teadhers. Teacher
remrut projections are based n the realistic              that through the
year 2000: (a) dic and enro                patter    r prir   col children

(c) teacher/student ratios would remin constant at today's 1:51; (d) dropout
and repetition rates in teacher training wwld be an attale 5% for each
grades and (e) anmual attrition rates of teadhers would remain uncanged at the
high urrent rate of 10%.

th existing PE  in Sana'a.
2.16    Lcaticns for the four props  new PITIs for males at Al Mahsan, Al
Beida, Rada and Al Mahweet wae selected cn tbe basis of: (a) the population
size of the catclmant area of each institutio   (b) the local support for the
proposed program; and (c) the adequacy of c idates for enrollzent in the PITI
programs. TIhe rITs for male students would include boarding for 50% of the
enrollment to facilitate the training of students frcs distant areas. The
propose PrI at Sana'a would replace the existing PM, whose premises would
be conerted for POE use. The enlarged and relocated PMI  at Sana'a would have
boarding facilities assigned to accept trainees from nural areas. Me PITIs
for male students would include boarding for 50% of the enrolLment to
facilitate the training of studets frcm distant areas. Provisions of
furniture and equipment would include books and sirple teaching aids.
2.17    Womens ParticiDLtm, Teaching is increasingly accptable as a
carest for wcaen, and although there is resistance to female boarding in
official institutions, boardirg with families is a socially acale
alterntive. The inclusion of one PM  for wuzen is onsidered the maxim
feasible epansion at the present time because of the limited nmber of
awilable trainees. 1Iamar was dhosen as the locaticn for t:he PI for female
students becaue, as the capital of the r    go te, and having a large
ptzlation, there would be an adeajmte number of families to an te female
students from neighboring areas.
