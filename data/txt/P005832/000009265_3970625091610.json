        efficiency.  This strategy focuses on the control of\n            education expenditures, more efficient use of education\n            resources, improvement of the quality of education, and\n            strengthening of vocational training.  To that end, the\n            project aims to (a) promote institutional development; (b)\n            to improve the quality of primary and lower secondary\n            education; and (c) to meet some of the country's human\n            resource needs.  In order to accomplish the above, the\n            project consists of:  (a) institutional development\n            including strengthening of planning and management; (b)\n            quality improvement in upgrading of the skills of about 2000\n            primary and 350 lower secondary teachers; and (c) manpower\n            development with establishment of a National Center for\n            Technical Education and Vocational Training at Ouani.  This\n            latter component will train skilled workers for industry,\n            and establishment of a new business school at Moroni to\n            train office clerks, accountants and secretaries."}, "docdt": "1986-12-31T00:00:00Z"}
