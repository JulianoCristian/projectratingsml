Fund (SDF) in\n            articulating and financing the training needs of\n            enterprises. The project has three components. The first\n            component will strengthen sector capacity for planning,\n            monitoring and evaluation, information management and\n            project management. The second component will promote\n            employer participation through pilot activities in: (i) the\n            design and delivery of new technician-level pre-service\n            programs, (ii) design and delivery of in-service training,\n            and (iii) the development of instructors' occupational\n            skills. The third component will support the reform of the\n            SDF under revised legislation and help build its technical\n            and organizational capacity."}, "docdt": "2007-02-28T00:00:00Z"}
