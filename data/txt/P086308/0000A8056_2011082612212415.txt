                         The project development objective is to provide the public training system with improved mechanisms for responsiveness to employment needs, and to
                         enhance the capacity and effectiveness of the Skills Development Fund in articulating and financing the training needs of enterprises.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is not disbursing and project restructuring has been discussed since December 2010. In addition, the Skills Development Fund decided to withdraw from the project and
                         to use its own resources instead. This change and the social and political unrest prevailing in Yemen since March 2011 have resulted in additional delays in project implementation
                         (particularly in advertising for the second and largest component given the anticipation of low to no response) and in the finalization of the project restructuring. In this context, it is
                         unlikely that the project would be able to achieve its Development Objectives within the project time frame.
