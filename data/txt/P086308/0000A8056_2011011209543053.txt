                         Implementation Status Overview
                         There is a consensus that supporting the TEVT sector in Yemen is critical and should be maintained as it continues to be a high priority for the government based on the linkage
                         between training and employment. Though effectiveness was delayed, mainly due to the time taken to execute the Subsidiary Agreement between the Government of Yemen and the
                         Skills Development Fund (SDF), the revised SDF Law is now considered to be one of the most progressive skills development fund laws in the MENA region. On the other hand, the
                         request for proposals for implementing the project's second Component related to the design and delivery of programs in a selection of TVET institutes, the project's largest
                         component, produced no results as none of the short-listed firms submitted proposals by the October 25, 2010 deadline, citing mainly external factors to the Project. Since July

                         2010, SDF has initiated a number of small-scale demand-driven training programs in close collaboration with chambers, NGOs, non-contributors, and smaller firms. However, the
                         overall progress remains slow and there is an urgent need for the SDF to embark on a speedier transition plan to truly benefit from the progressive aspects and opportunities

                         Recognizing the impact of the delay in implementation, together with changes in the internal and external environment, Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training
                         (MTEVT), Skills Development Fund (SDF) and the Bank team agreed that the Project needs to be restructured to reduce its scope and simplify the implementation arrangements.

                         Since the changes are aligned with the original design, the Project will proceed with the proposed implementation approach, while both the GOY and the Bank continue processing
                         the restructuring and the partial credit cancellation to be completed by February 2011.
