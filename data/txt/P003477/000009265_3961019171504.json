2) to expand vocational and\n            technical education; and 3) to improve and restructure\n            higher education. In most project entities implementation\n            progressed satisfactorily without substantial guidance from\n            the center, and overall, the objectives of the project were\n            achieved. The Chinese team was effective in the design and\n            preparation of the project and in many areas of\n            implementation including procurement. Project management\n            unfortunately has not been strong, particularly with regard\n            to technical assistance. Preparation and appraisal of the\n            project went smoothly and swiftly owing to good leadership\n            and a team of qualified experts. The project was a very\n            ambitious one and in overall terms its outcome can be rated\n            as satisfactory. The main lessons learned from the project\n            are: (a) for a first project in textbook production, fewer\n            components and particularly subcomponents would have\n            simplified the implementation process; (b) book pricing\n            issues, despite much attention paid at appraisal, have still\n            to be resolved; (c) periodic updating of books and didactic\n            materials for PEP is important for the continuing\n            introduction of new curricula and effective textbook\n            preparation; (d) the concept of continuing training is of\n            vital importance to the sustainability of project entities\n            in the fields of financial management, production and\n            maintenance etc.; e) strong central leadership and good\n            communication networks are of great importance in\n            implementing a project with wide provincial and entity dispersion."}, "docdt": "1995-12-20T00:00:00Z"}
