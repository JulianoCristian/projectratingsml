MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESiDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 41.8 MILLION
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 41.8 million
(US$57.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
project would be on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and would
help finance a textbook development project.
2.        Background.  In 1985, the Government of China announced the
bDecision on Reform of the Education Structure, which emphasized the
importance of education as the key to national development and established
three basic policies: to universalize basic education (nine years); to
expand vocational and technical education; and to improve and restructure
higher education. These policies have implications for the textbook
subsector through both quality improvement and enrollment expansion. At
present, China's textbook production and distribution system delivers 2.6
billion textbooks to over 200 million students each year. Although the
number is generally adequate, Chinese educators recognize deficiencies in
textbook content, production quality and diversity. To address these
problems, the Government has designed a textbook upgrading program with
specific targets to improve the educational effectiveness and quality of
textbooks at all levels of schooling, to increase the variety of published
textbooks and to improve the efficiency of textbook manufacture.
3.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Bank education operations in
China concentrated initially on alleviating urgent manpower shortages
through expansion and improvements in higher and technical education. More
recently, the Bank and the Government agreed to a broader strategy to
support the three major aims of the education reform. Upgrading textbooks
is an important aspect of the overall reform. The proposed project was
identified based on the findings and recommendations of a sector study.
Sector work and project preparation have provided the opportunity for
dialogue between the Government and the Association, which has led to the
adoption of a slower and more realistic pace of implementing the program
for new texts, more flexible pricing arrangements, diversified distribution
channels for higher education texts and targeted subsidies to poor families
for textbook purchase rather than generalized support to publishers. The
project would complement the Second University Project (Credit 1551-CHA)
which addresses curriculum reform and the Teacher Training Project (Credit
1908-CHA) which improves training of lower secondary teachers.
4.        Project Objectives.  The project would improve textbooks at
primary, secondary and tertiary levels. Specifically, it would: (a)
assist in updating the content and pedagogy of the new 1990s set of primary
and secondary textbooks; (b) support the development of audiovisual aids
and expane the library collection and facilities used for research and
manuscri   development; (c) introduce modern technology for preparing and
editing manuscripts, typesetting, printing and binding; (d) support a



- 2 -
coordinated program of equipment purchase for textbook manufacture in order
to develop maximum compatibility between various production processes and
an appropriate level of standardization; (e) improve publishing and
production management, upgrade technical skills of publishers and workers;
and (f) improve book distribuition mechanisms.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project would have five
components. The first component would provide equipment and reference
books to assist departments under the State Education Commission (SEdC) to
(1) develop a modern teaching program; (2) increase their capacity to
produce audiovisual materials; (3) augment the library collection; (4)
computerize manuscript preparation; and (5) facilitate book distribution
and to monitor inventories and sales. The second component would assist
the Higher Education Publishing House (HEPH) in building and equipping a
printing factory in Tianjin. It would also provide equipment for the
People's Education Press (PEP) factory and the Beijing Printing Institute.
The third component would provide equipment and civil works for printing
factories in 22 provinces. The fourth component would provide equipment
and civil works for 21 university publishing houses and printing factories.
Over 1,000 pieces of typesetting, plate making, printing, binding. and
auxiliary and related equipment would be procured for this purpose. The
fifth component would provide training and technical assistance in support
of the first four components. The coordinated training program would
comprise (1) overseas study tours and fellowships: (2) visits to China by
foreign experts; (3) training courses in China dasigned and conducted by
foreign experts; (4) training courses designed and conducted by local
experts; (5) attendance of project personnel at existing courses and
training programs in publishing and printing; and (6) training provided by
equipment manufacturers. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts autd methods of procurememt and of
disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7633-CHA dated February 24,
1989 will be distributed separately.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has already completed the
following actions: (a) submitted to IDA a report on the Liternal appraisals
of subprojects conducted by SEdC; and (b) discussed with IDA the format of
the Project Implementation Agreement (PIA) to be reached between SEdC and
participating provincial authorities. Signing of PIAs -ould be a condition
of credit effectiveness. In addition, the Government has agreed to
undertake the following actions: (a) submit to IDA for its review a plan
for inservice training of primary and secondary school teachers in the use
of the new textbooks by July 1, 1990; (b) carry out training in accordance
with a program reviewed annually with the Association; (c) make the
proceeds of the Credit available to the beneficiaries on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA; (d) establish a framework for flexible
textbook pricing in accordance with principles acceptable to IDA; (e)
maintain a Project Steering Committee to monitor project implementation;
(f) establish and maintain implementation offices in universities and



provincial bureaus to manage day-to-day activities; (g) monitor progress of
the proposed project using an agreed set of performance indicators and
provide annual reports from 1990 on; and (h) furnish annual audit reports
within eight months of the end of the fiscal year.
7.        Benefits.  The principal benefits of the proposed project would
be improved textbooks with respect to educational effectiveness, content,
variety and physical quality. By 1995, the content of all primary and
secondary textbooks would be revised and printed on improved paper.
Textbooks for grades 1 to 3 would be in color. These changes would improve
pedagogic effectiveness and reinforce curricular changes being undertaken
by the Government. By 1992. 502 of textbooks for higher education would be
published, as compared to 20? now; many of the remaining books, which are
now reproduced by mimeographing, would be printed by offset, and new
distribution mechanisms would be in place, thereby bringing to larger
numbers of university students up-to-date information packaged in more
durable and readable books. Training and technical assistance would also
aid the development of the publishing and printintg institutions. By
providing modern equipment to supplement existing facilities, the project
would improve the efficiency of textbook manufacture and expand the overall
capacity of the printing industry in China to meet the accelerating demand
for printed reading matter throughout the society.
8.        Risks.  The major risk is that full advantage will not be taken
of the improved equipment and processes because of failure to adopt andlor
implement a satisfactory training and technical assistance program. This
risk would be mitigated through contracting management of the program to an
experienced agency acceptable to the Association.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

/a As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
