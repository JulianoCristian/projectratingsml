Lessons\n            drawn from the project follow. 1) In the absence of strong\n            governance, and consensus, the design, and sequencing of\n            policy conditions needs particular attention, which together\n            with realistic reform targets, would allow for the\n            implementation of even an ambitious program, as in this\n            case, whose public finance reform encompassed a very large\n            work program. 2) The participatory approach not only helped\n            in achieving consensus across governments, and among\n            Government's own entities, but fostered ownership\n            through working groups arrangements as part of the project\n            process, and facilitated reform in state financing, budget,\n            and debt management. 3) The absence of an accompanying\n            technical assistance project, could have precluded progress\n            on institutional building for policy reform, but\n            availability of donor financing, and the design of the\n            public finance reform program as two sequential operations,\n            with supportive grants, provided the required technical\n            assistance continuity to move forward. 4) The fragmented\n            governance, and extremely weak institutional capacity,\n            particular of a country emerging from conflict, benefited\n            from the broadly focused, and intensive supervision, and\n            monitoring, but particularly targeted on\n            institution/capacity building."}, "docdt": "2000-06-30T00:00:00Z"}
