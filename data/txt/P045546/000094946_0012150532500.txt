3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background - Motivation for original obiectives. The Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement of 1995,
which ended the devastating civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), set out an institutional framework
for rebuilding the entire country on the basis a new state consisting of two Entities, the Federation (of
Bosniacs and Croats) and Republika Srpska.
The State governnent has a relatively restricted role, with responsibility for monetary management
(organized as a currency board in its first six years), customs and trade policies, international financial
relations (including servicing of international debts and debt management) and coordination in
telecommunication and transport. Unless mandated otherwise by the State Parliament, the State does not
have the capacity to tax or collect customs duties on its own. The budgetary needs of the State are to be
met in the proportions of two thirds by the Federation and one third by Republika Srpska. The Entity
governments have exclusive responsibility in their respective territories over defense, internal affairs
(including police), enviromnental policies, economic and social sector policies (such as agriculture,
industry, and health), refugees and displaced persons, reconstruction programs and justice, tax, and
customs administration. To carry out these responsibilities, each Entity retains ownership of the taxes
collected in its territory. Nonetheless, the two Entities have different fiscal structures. The Federation has
a three-tier fiscal system: the Federation government, cantons, and municipalities, with major
responsibilities resting with the cantons. Republika Srpska has a two-tier structure: the Republika Srpska
government and municipalities, with very limited local fiscal authority.
By 1998, only modest progress had been made in establishing this new governance structure at the
State and the Entity levels. In the Federation, the customs and the payments systems were reintegrated and
the formation of a unified tax administration was initiated. Some progress had also been achieved in
unifying tax policies, and in establishing canton-level fiscal administration. Nonetheless, separate policies
and practices persisted within the fiscal structure of the Federation. With the embargo for donor assistance
to Republika Srpska continuing until the implementation of peace accords, the fiscal system of Republika
Srpska had remained broadly along the lines of the former SFRY system and, therefore, needed to be
strengthened and reformed. At the State level, the legislative framework for establishing Dayton-mandated
institutions was adopted only in mid-1997. Due to the difficult political circumstances, however, initiation
of its implementation had been further delayed. In the absence of country-wide institutions and policies, the
Entities had minimal coordination in key areas of economic management.
The pivotal task in 1998 was to create the institutional and policy foundations for fiscal management
in order to prepare BiH for sustainable recovery and growth as well as return to creditworthiness, thereby
demonstrating the advantages of rebuilding BiH as a multiethnic state. It was apparent that, to achieve this,
urgent reforms would be necessary. These included the introduction of sound, comprehensive and
consistent State and Entity budgets; the establishment of clear arrangements for financing State
expenditures; the clarification of responsibilities for foreign borrowing and servicing of external
obligations; the clear assignment of revenue and expenditure responsibilities within the Entities; the reform
and harmonization of tax policies; and the development of a fiscally viable social safety net system, starting
with the pension administration. The Public Finance Structural Adjustment Credit (PFSAC) was targeted
to support these urgent reforms and, hence, initiate the process towards building a sustainable framework
for fiscal management.
The PFSAC was approved by the Board in June 1998. The PFSAC was closely co-ordinated with
IMF support and with other Bank lending. It followed an initial US$130 million Emergency Recovery
- 2 -



Project (ERP; including US$30 million IDA Credit, US$15 million IDA grant, about US$65 million
co-financing from other donors, US$19 million of direct donor assistance, and US$1.5 million of bilateral
donor assistance), eleven IDA financed emergency operations (US$127.6 million) supporting rehabilitation
and re-construction of infrastructure and provision of essential community-based and social services, four
other IDA investment operations (US$92 million) and the first fiscal and balance-of-payments support
operation--a US$90 million Transition Assistance Credit (TAC).
The ERP both financed critical imports, credit lines and social expenditures, and supported the
creation of key government institutions, including the State Central Bank, the State Ministry of Trade and
Economic Relations, the Banking Supervision Agency, the Federation Customs and Tax Administration,
the Federation Debt Monitoring Unit and cantonal budget offices. The TAC had as its objective the
post-war economic integration and institution building of the State and Federation Governments.
Performance objectives for the TAC included integrating the Federation's public finances (divided between
the Bosnian and the Croat majority areas) focusing on the Federation Payments System and the Federation
Customs Administration; establishing the Federation Tax Administration; and adopting the Federation
Banking Agency Law to improve the flow of capital between Bosnian and Croat majority areas of the
Federation. It was approved and disbursed in FY97. The Republika Srpska received its first fiscal and
balance-of-payments assistance through an adjustment component of the Second Transport Project (FY98)
which included modest performance targets for budget and trade reform.
Original Proiect Obiectives. The PFSAC was the first real adjustment operation designed to
support the BiH's program of stabilization and structural reform. The program was also supported by
successive IMF programs under the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA).
The primary objective of the PFSAC was to support the transition from reconstruction to the
restoration of sustained growth. It would do so by facilitating the functioning of BiH as a unified state, and
by instituting systems and policies that are critical both for post-war economic reintegration and sound
fiscal management. The main policy areas supported by the PFSAC included: (i) ensuring financing of the
State through the preparation and adoption of consistent 1998 budgets of the State and Entity Governments
and through the development and implementation of a transfer mechanism that would provide a regular and
predictable flow of funds to the State Budget for meeting its obligations; (ii) the creation of policy and
institutional foundations for sound extemal debt management at the State and Entity levels as well as an
extemal debt servicing mechanism through the State; (iii) administrative reforms to improve efficiency and
transparency of government budgetary operations at both the State and Entity levels; (iv) initiation of
reform and harmonization of tax policies and administration within BiH; and (v) initiation of reform in the
pension system.
In addition, the project supported progress in a series of critical reforms including the development
of a sustainable inter-governmental fiscal structure across BiH; an integrated approach to public resource
management and strategic public resource allocation; and, institutional and regulatory frameworks for
improving transparency and accountability of government finance, with a focus on establishing treasury
and extemal audit functions. The PFSAC was designed to set out a framework for both timely
implementation of priority reforms mentioned in above paragraph and the development of reform proposal
for those critical reforms mentioned in this paragraph. These reforms were not only critical for the
credibility and, hence, the sustainability of both the donor assistance and overall structural reform process
but also to prepare BiH for increasingly relying on its own resources and institutions in designing and
implementing policies required for long-term development. Subsequent to the successful completion of
PFSAC in December 1998, the Board approved the PFSAC II in June 1999. The PFSAC II aimed at
sustaining and deepening the PFSAC reforms and is currently assisting Bosnian authorities in undertaking
- 3 -



wide ranging public finance reforms.
The project objectives were clearly articulated and highly relevant to BiH's postwar policy reformn
and institutional development priorities. The goals and objectives of the PFSAC were also fully consistent
with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY98-99. The CAS was based on substantial analytical
economic work by the Bank which included an Economic Report (May 1997)--providing a framework for
macroeconomic and structural reforms needed in the near-term for facilitating sustainable long-term
economic growth--and a Public Expenditure Review (October 1997)--providing recommendations for
improving efficiency and viability of public expenditure planning, programming and management. The
CAS airned at assisting BiH in moving from immediate postwar reconstruction toward sustainable recovery
and growth and in preparing for the time when donor assistance is gradually scaled back. The key elements
of this strategy were: (i) strengthening the policy and institutional framework for macroeconomic
management, particularly fiscal management; (ii) initiating structural reforms for the transition to a market
economy, particularly in the areas of privatization and banking sector; and (iii) carrying forward physical
reconstruction of the country.
The Bank envisaged supporting CAS objectives through several IDA-financed projects including
three adjustment operations--the PFSAC (FY98), the PFSAC II (FY99) and an Enterprise and Bank
Privatization Structural Adjustment Credit (EBPSAC; FY99)--and eleven other projects--collectively,
aimed at both continued rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure, housing, agriculture and
community-based services, and supporting demobilization, refugee return, reintegration, and local and
community development, while at the same time deepening the sustainability of the reconstruction effort by
pursuing progress in financial sustainability. The strategy is being implemented with the PFSAC already
completed, and the PFSAC II and the EBPSAC currently under implementation in close co-ordination with
the IMF's SBA and other bank lending. The reconstruction effort--supported by US$5.1 billion donor
assistance under Priority Reconstruction and Recovery Program (1996-99)--produced remarkable
achievements by returning most services to their prewar levels in just four years while task of addressing
the remaining physical impact of the war in selected sectors is likely to take many more years.
The CAS recognized that there were inherent risks of operating in the BiH environment with
extremely low tolerance for cooperation among the three ethnic groups. Placed in this context, the
objectives of the PFSAC were realistic and important not only for achieving the CAS objectives but also
for demonstrating the commitment of Bosnians to building a multiethnic, stable state by harmonizing key
economic policies, agreeing on important policy matters, and establishing and further integrating key
government policies and institutions--for example, the establishment of a State finance mechanism was a
particularly critical objective for demonstrating such commitment. At the time of project preparation,
proposals to provide the State with a more stable revenue source (such as a percentage of tax revenues of
the Entities) were subjected to significant political debate within the country. In the face of authorities'
reluctance for strong cooperation between the three governments and rigidities in their interpretation of the
Dayton-mandated revenue sharing arrangements, a second best alternative, i.e. creation of a revenue
transfer mechanism, was adopted with an agreement to design an enhanced financing mechanism for the
longer term.  Considering the beneficial outcomes of this approach, this flexibility and realism in the
design of the State finance mechanism was worthwhile.
The project was demanding both for the Borrower (the State), for the Sub-borrowers (the Entities)
and for the Bank Staff in that a number of important institutional reforms and policy measures (including
several pieces of legislation) had to be completed in a short time frame. This was considered in the design
of the policy components and timetable for core actions as well as technical assistance programs in order to
facilitate achievement of project objectives. Overall, the program was adequately prepared and could be
-4 -



readily monitored.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable.
3.3 Original Components:
The design of the policy components was appropriate to achieving the project objectives, reflecting
satisfactory quality at entry. The core policy measures that were required for tranche disbursements were
clear, realistic, and linked to well-sequenced monitorable performance indicators. For each core measure,
the design and development of the appropriate policy, legislation or institutional mechanism was made a
condition of first tranche disbursement; their formal adoption into legislation or the implementation was
made a condition of the second tranche disbursement. More specifically, the core individual components
were designed as follows:
(i) Ensuring the Financing of the State to Meet its Mandated Obligations: the preparation of
mutually consistent 1998 State and Entity Budgets as well as agreement on mechanism for regular transfer
of funds from the Entity budgets to the State budget was a condition of the first tranche disbursement
(FTD); their adoption and implementation was condition of second tranche disbursement (STD);
(ii) Establishing a Viable Debt Management Structure: operationalisation of transparent State and
Entity External Debt Service mechanisms were a condition of FTD; whereas adoption and implementation
of Entity Debt Legislation were conditions of STD;
(iii) Reforming and Harmonizing Tax Policies and Coordinating Tax Collection: preparation of
amendments to the Republika Srpska's Sales and Excise Tax Legislation was a condition of FTD; adoption
into law of these amendments as well as implementation of amendments to the Federation Wage Tax
legislation (previously legislated) were conditions of STD;
(iv) Integrated and Viable Pension Policy: submission of a new, unified Federation Pension
Legislation to Federation Parliament was a condition of FTD; passage of this law by the Federation
Parliament was condition of STD; and
(v) Reforming the Budgetary Management System: enacting a revised Federation Organic Budget
Law and drafting a new Organic Budget Law for Republika Srpska was a condition of STD.
Several other critical reforms (noted in section 3. I)--including under the intergovernmentalfinance
reformcomponent--of which preparation required time and implementation needed to be build on the
achievements under the PFSAC, were also included as main elements of the PFSAC program and
assurances for their timely preparation received through the Letter of Development Policy.
3.4 Revised Components:
Not applicable.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Performance rating for quality at entry is, overall, assessed as satisfactory. This rating was based
on consistency of project objectives with the govemment priorities as well as the CAS--evaluated as highly
satisfactory--clarity and realism of development objectives--evaluated as satisfactory--strength of
borrowers ownership--evaluated as satisfactory--and appropriateness and realism of project
conditionality--evaluated as satisfactory. The project was prepared in close cooperation with the State and
the Entity governments. The concept built on previously undertaken economic sector work and a detailed
assessment of institutional capacity and needs.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The PFSAC's outcome is assessed as satisfactory. Overall, the project met most of its key
objectives and substantially achieved its development impact. Macroeconomic performance was sound.
Despite difficult circumstances under which the project was implemented, the components largely achieved
their goals. The exception was harmonization of a point of tax collection for high tariff goods--an element
of the tax reform and harmonization component--policies about which subjected to several changes after the
completion of the project. Furthermore, the PFSAC marked both the beginnings of policy dialogue between
the State and the Entities as well as between the Entities themselves, and coordinated-implementation of
policy reforms by the State and the Entity governments. These achievements enabled the authorities to
deepen and extend the PFSAC reforms under each component through the follow-up operation, PFSAC II,
which, when completed, will have achieved most aspects of medium term goals set-out in the PFSAC. As
such, sustainability of the PFSAC's development results, including its tax reform and harmonization goal,
has been greatly enhanced.
All but two of the many PFSAC objectives--which were incorporated into legal covenants in the
Development Credit Agreement--were achieved at the time of the approval of the second tranche release.
These objectives which were partially met by Republika Srpska, concerned the enaction of an external debt
legislation--aimed at strengthening the legal framework for establishment of a sound country-wide debt
management system--and amendments to the sales and excise tax legislation--aimed at enhancing tax
collection in Republika Srpska while harmonizing tax regimes between the Entities. To meet these
requirements, the external debt legislation and amendments to the sales and excise tax legislation, consistent
with the PFSAC objectives, had been approved by the Republika Srpska Government and submitted to the
Parliament in August and November 1998, respectively. However, the nation-wide elections that took
place on September 12-13, 1998 had delayed parliamentary consideration of these two pieces of legislation,
the timing of which was to be deternined by the speed of govermnent formation in Republika Srpska.
Despite the delay in the adoption of the legislative framework, however, significant progress had
already been achieved towards establishing a sound system of external debt management in Republika
Srpska. This was made possible by implementing the key principles of the debt legislation even before the
legislation became effective. Likewise, preparatory work had been initiated to implement amendments to
the sales and excise tax legislation as of January 1, 1999. On the basis of this progress, overall good
performance in the implementation of the PFSAC program, and the strategy to introduce a longer-term
fundamental reforms through the follow-up operation, a partial waiver was granted on December 14, 1998
for these two conditions. Subsequently, during the second half of December 1998, the Republika Srpska
Parliament enacted these two pieces of legislation and, hence, implemented all of the second tranche
conditions at about the same time of the actual release of the second tranche. Nevertheless, effective
implementation of the amendments to the sales and excise tax legislation was delayed and eventually put
aside. Deeper harmonization reforms are now being implemented under the PFSAC II, although, as noted
below, the pace of implementation continues to be slow.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The ICR assigns satisfactory ratings to each of the relevant outputs by Policy
Components--Macro-policies, Sector Policies, Institutional Development, Social and Public Sector
Management (presented in Annex 5.)--based on the following evaluation of macroeconomic performance
and achievements of goals under project components:

Macroeconomic Performance.  There has been a marked improvement in progress toward
structural policy reforms since 1998; sound macro management has continued. The reform program has
been supported by the international financial institutions (such as World Bank, IMF, EBRD) as well as
many other donors. The most successful achievement over the last two years has been full establishment of
BiH's Central Bank and the launching of its currency--the Konvertible Marka (KM), pegged to the
Deutsche Mark. The KM is now well established and has gained credibility throughout the country. Other
achievements include the adoption of a liberal countrywide customs tariff regime, the elimination of
barriers to the internal movement of people and goods and substantially increased inter-Entity trade. There
has been progress on pension and health system reform. On the monetary side, stringent implementation of
the currency board rules has been continued. On the fiscal side, discipline has been maintained--the 1999
budget deficit for the Federation was held to about 1.3 percent of GDP, and to 3.5 percent in Republika
Srpska (both financed by donors)--and credible efforts are underway to improve expenditure management.
Nonetheless, while improvements in revenue collection have continued, tax policy reform and
harmonization between the Entities have been slow. Debt rescheduling agreements in the last two years
have brought about a significant reduction in external debt, making for relatively comfortable debt ratios.
Total debt now reaches 66 percent of GDP, and debt service is 7 percent of exports. Debt management has
also improved over the last two years, with technical assistance from the World Bank and other donors.
Both aid flows and macroeconomic stability have, together, continued to generate strong growth.
Though down from the very high postwar levels, GDP is estimated to have grown by 10 percent in 1999
while inflation remained low. This reflects the strong recovery of economic activity in the second half of
1999, following the adverse economic impact of the Kosovo conflict during the first half of the year
(disruption of trade, the cost of additional refugees). Overall, economic recovery is led by SMEs in the
services and light industry sectors, which are likely to be leaders of growth in the medium term. In tandem
with good macro performance, major progress in reconstruction has been made over the last two years.
Implementation of the 1996-1999 Priority Reconstruction and Recovery Program has successfully rebuilt
the bulk of war-damaged economic and social infrastructure and restarted economic growth. By the end of
2000, it is anticipated that road, telecom, power, water and education services, will be at or near prewar
availability levels.
Nevertheless, despite the rapid economic recovery, reflecting the extremely depressed level of
post-war economic activity, GDP is still only at about 40 percent of its prewar level; living standards for
many Bosnian families remain low. Measured unemployment, which fell sharply during the initial years of
economic recovery, appears to have stagnated at around 35 percent--high even by the standards of
transition economies. Economic recovery has been achieved largely on the strength of substantial financial
and technical assistance from the international conununity. Despite improvement over 1996-97, progress
in implementing the structural reforms needed to consolidate these achievements and to move towards
sustainable growth has thus far been slow. Slow progress was most prominent in the areas of privatization
and private sector development, which largely explains high unemployment. The Entities are now taking
steps to accelerate privatization, to improve the enabling environment for business and for the reform of
labor markets.
Ensuring Financing oJ the State to Meet its Mandated Obligations. This component achieved its
critical objective of providing stable financing for the State administration in 1998 and beyond to fulfill its
responsibilities mandated by the Dayton Accords. To achieve this, the State and Entity govermments
committed themselves to taking concrete actions in three areas: (i) preparation and implementation of
mutually consistent budgets for the State and the Entities; (ii) institutionalization of a mechanism for a
regular transfer of funds from the Entities to the State; and (iii) because much of the State's budgetary
- 7 -



obligations relate to servicing BiH's external debt, the development of an institutional capacity for debt
management to underpin the process of budget management. These commitments have been fulfilled as
described below.
The 1998 budgets set the stage for the formulation and implementation of mutually consistent
budgets across all three Governments by including: agreement on the structure, size, staffing, and functions
of each organ of the State government; agreement on a formula for financing the administrative cost of the
State, and agreement on the principle of financing debt service by the two Entities based on the final
beneficiary rule. Clear financing arrangements have been set up between the Entity and the State
governments by the institution of the transfer mechanism which is being operated through two State
accounts opened in the new Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH)--one a general budgetary
account, and the other a dedicated debt service account, with a sub-account for each Entity. To ensure
transparency and effectiveness, the State and the Central Bank have concluded an Agent Agreement
specifying operating procedures for these accounts. Entities deposit their monthly contributions --
equivalent to even monthly payments of the annual budgeted contribution by the Entities to the State
administrative budget and debt service obligations of the Entities--into these accounts providing funding for
the State to undertake its administrative functions and meet external obligations. In order to provide the
State with timely transfers, the Entities have authorized their Payments Bureau, through a standing
instruction, for transfers to the State during a certain interval every month.
While there have been occasional problems with the timeliness of the flow of funds from the Entity
budgets to the State budget, compared to the previous ad-hoc arrangements, the new transfers mechanism
has provided the State administration with a regular and dependable stream of resources. This has
eliminated the practice of systemic wage arrears and substantial delays in debt service payments, and
enhanced the co-ordination between the State and the Entities in budget execution. The operation of the
mechanism is being evaluated, with a focus to improve timeliness of transfers, under the ongoing work
towards the establishment of the State and the Entity treasury systems. The treasury system, when
established, will overtake authority for effecting budgetary transfers and spending from the Payment
Bureaus, and hence will substantially improve budget control and cash management capacity at all levels of
govemment.
Establishing a Viable Debt Management Structure. The objectives of this component were to
clarify the responsibilities for foreign borrowing between the State and the two Entities and to ensure the
regularity and transparency of external debt servicing through efficient legal and institutional arrangements.
The first step towards defining the responsibilities of State and Entity institutions in extemal debt
management and the co-ordination mechanisms between them was taken in June 1997 with the adoption of
the State Law on Extemal Debt. To facilitate the implementation of the State Debt Law, the State and the
Entity Governments committed themselves to complement the key principles of the law--particularly those
principals referring to specification of debt management mechanism and the procedures for revenue
transfers from the Entities to the State for the purpose of external debt service--by the preparation and
implementation of the Entity Debt Laws and the following regulations specified in the LDP: (i) the Statutes
of the State Office of External Debt Management (OEDM) and the Entities' Debt Management Units
(DMU) that would detail their functions and work processes; (ii) the Information Sharing Protocol between
the three debt agencies and the CBBH, that would clarify the co-ordination, information-sharing and
decision-making procedures; and (iii) the Agency Agreement between the State OEDM and its agent bank
(CBBH), that would establish clear operating procedures for the State debt servicing account. In addition,
to ensure the quality of information used for sovereign decision-making and to build trust between the
parties, a unified public debt database (the Debt Ledger of BiH) was to be created; minimum
disclosure/debt reporting standards were to be agreed upon between the State OEDM, the Entities' DMUs,
- 8 -



and other relevant agencies.
The State and the Entities achieved excellent results in creating the above outlined legal, regulatory
and institutional structure for debt management. The Entity Laws on Extemal Debt, consistent with the
State Law on External Debt, were prepared and adopted by the respective Parliaments of the Entities in
1998. Moreover, even before the finalization of the debt legislation, the underlying revenue transfer
mechanism and regulatory framework for debt service payments were set up by the State and the Entities.
The two most important building blocks of the new system are a dedicated State Debt Servicing Account
(DSA) with clear operating principles and the conclusion of an Agent Agreement between the State and the
Central Bank to ensure the efficiency and the transparency in debt servicing procedures. These two
elements of the new system have been instrumental in assuring a reliable flow of funds to the State for
timely execution of debt service payments since 1998, which, in turn, is essential for enhancing the
normalization of BiH's relations with the external creditors.
There was also a rapid progress on the institutional front. The State and both Entities' debt
management units were established, their functions were defined, and the relations between the State and
the Entity units have been substantially strengthened. The newly established debt management units hired
staff and provided basic training in two specialized courses delivered jointly by the World Bank and the US
Treasury in April-June 1998. The State and the Entities' Governments concluded a comprehensive
agreement specifying the procedures for information sharing and policy coordination, which was a key step
in instituting a regular exchange of detailed information between the three debt management agencies.
Finally, and most importantly, an External Debt Database has been established in the State Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Relations. Detailed data for all performing external loans, including both
succession debt and new borrowing of BiH, have been entered into this database. This has already
substantially improved the consistency and quality of external debt data. In time, this database will become
the core of a comprehensive computerized debt information network that is being developed by the debt
management units, and will serve as the main tool for debt monitoring and reporting. The State and Entity
governments have committed themselves under the PFSAC II programn, to support continued improvements
to the institutional setup and to strengthen both borrowing policies and policy coordination, including the
development of a policy framework for sub-Entity borrowing.
Reforming and Harmonizing Tax Policies and Coordinating Tax Collection. Coordination of tax
policies and tax administration between the two Entities is critical in avoiding harmful tax competition and
tax evasion. Harnonization of tax bases, tax rates, and collection points is one means of limiting tax
competition and encouraging free trade of goods between the Entities. The Entity Governments agreed to
initiate this process by harmonizing the point of collection of sales taxes on excisable goods at the
import/wholesale point, along with continued reform of tax structures, particularly wage and trade taxes,
which were characterized by high and distortionary rates and numerous, arbitrary tax exemptions eroding
the tax base. Amendments to the Republika Srpska sales and excise tax law, moving the collection of sales
taxes on excisable commodities from the retail to the wholesale level, were adopted by the Republika
Srpska Parliament at the end of June 1998. However, the amendments introduced other additional changes
to the legislation, which fell short of meeting the harmonization criteria and resulted in inefficiencies in the
implementation. The Republika Srpska Government suspended the implementation of the amendments
during August-October 1998, and revised them in November 1998 to address the above mentioned
problems, which were subsequently adopted by the Parliament in December 1998.
The revised amendments were, while enhancing revenue collection in Republika Srpska, facilitating
coordination with the Federation--collecting the taxes at wholesale level. Hence, they constituted a
significant step towards eliminating tax evasion and avoidance and encouraging the free flow of goods
-9-



between the Entities. Nevertheless, effective implementation of the amendments was delayed and,
eventually, put aside in Republika Srpska.  While not fully successful in achieving its goal of
harmonization of the point of collection of sales taxes on the excisable commodities, this component has
been instrumental in fostering the dialogue on tax policy harmonization between the Entities, including
through establishment of a joint Working Group of Entity tax experts. This has helped in initiating the
technical work towards formulating reform strategies in three other critical areas as envisaged under the
LDP: (i) reform and harmonization of excise and sales tax rates and exemption policies to improve
efficiency of tax system and to avoid harmful tax competition; (ii) destination-oriented attribution of tax
revenues in inter-Entity trade to prevent double taxation or tax avoidance; and (iii) introduction of
administrative cooperation between the Entities' revenue collection agencies to collect tax liabilities from
taxpayers operating in multiple jurisdictions. These measures are now among the tax reform priorities of
the Entity governments under the PFSAC II program. Accordingly, the Entities are putting greater effort to
broaden the process of harmonization of the Entity tax systems and to establish an administrative
coordination between the Entity tax administrations.
Amendments to the Federation wage tax law, broadening the wage tax base to include certain
benefits such as per diems and food and commuting allowances, enacted by the Federation Parliament in
October 1997 and subsequently put into effect. The amendments aimed at capturing a greater part of
employee compensation in the tax base by closing legal loopholes used to shift compensation to nonwage
benefits. Further progress has been made by both Entities in simplifying sales, wage and profit tax
structures and reducing tax rates to levels not only more in line with the international standards but also
conducive to growth and private sector expansion. The Entities also began implementing the State-set
common customs and trade policy. As a result, tariff rates were simplified and unified, with an average
effective rate of about 8 percent applying across the country for most imports.
Reforming Intergovernmental Financial Arrangement. Because of the Federation's more
complicated structure, issues in intergovernmental finance remain relatively more significant in the
Federation than in Republika Srpska. While the basic framework in revenue and expenditure assignments,
as laid out in the new Constitution, was in place in the Federation by 1998, a series of issues remained to
be addressed for enhancing the public sector's operational efficiency. The objective of this component was
to review these issues with the Government, while continuing to jointly evaluate the emerging
intergovernmental financial structure and develop a reform program to be implemented under the PFSAC
II. The key issues at the time included: (i) clarifying intergovernmental expenditure responsibility,
particularly, in education, health, defense and social welfare; (ii) developing a mechanism to reconsider
revenue assignments every several years, with a view to ensuring that revenues of cantons, particularly
those cantons facing higher burdens in rebuilding public infrastructure and in providing services for the
returning refugees, is consistent with their expenditure responsibility; and (iii) improving the allocation of
revenues across the Federation. In Republika Srpska, greater attention was needed to be given to maintain
an efficient intergovernmental system, which requires a careful analysis of the emerging decentralization
strategy.
While progress in taking initial steps to address these issues was modest, progress in developing a
concrete set of measures to address particularly items (i) and (ii) above under both PFSAC II and other
social sector projects has been good--e.g. major reforms are being implemented under PFSAC II to develop
efficient mechanisms for delivering and financing health services. A clearer strategy has been formulated
and legislated by the Entities to determine financing and govemance arrangements for the social welfare
expenditures to be strengthened under the Bank's forthcoming Social Sector Structural Adjustment Credit
(SOSAC). Regarding item (ii) above, at present, except for a very minimal ad-hoc Federation pool, there is
no mechanism to improve revenue availability for needy cantons. External financing continues to be the
- 10 -



main source for rehabilitating public infrastructure and providing services for the returning refugees.
Although, ongoing reforms will need to be expanded to formulate a more clear strategy in this area, dealing
with equity considerations remains difficult due to low political tolerance for cross-subsidies.
Initiating Pension Reform. The immediate challenges in this area were to achieve fiscal
sustainability, to better target the most vulnerable pensioners, and to initiate cooperation in pension policies
and administration both within and between the Entities. With a more pressing need to rapidly address
these issues, the Federation initiated a pension reform by adopting a new pension legislation at the end of
July 1998. The new legislation included several pension reform measures aimed at strengthening financial
viability of the pension system and, hence, the fiscal sustainability in the Federation. The two most
important measures to this effect were: (i) the new policy of limiting the legal entitlement of pension
benefits to what is actually paid, thus eliminating continued systemic accumulation of pension arrears
caused by implementation of the pre-war benefit formula; and (ii) the new indexation method linking the
pension adjustments more closely to the availability of the regular pension resources. The Federation also
adopted a strategy for viable settlement of accumulated pension arrears through the privatization process.
In addition, the legislation reduced future new pensions and restricted eligibility in the medium term
through the following provisions on the assessment base and retirement age: (i) an increase in the
retirement age to 65 by the year 2003; (ii) an increase in the minimum service period required to retire from
15 to 20 years; (iii) an increase in the number of consecutive years used as the assessment base for pension
calculations from 10 to 15 years; (iv) a tightening of eligibility rules related to survivors; and (v) a
tightening of the rules regarding partial disability claims.
There were also measures in the new legislation to strengthen institutional structure and to initiate
integration of the existing two pension funds to operate under one Federation-wide system. The two most
important such measures were the creation of a Federation-wide framework for social policy by bringing
the two Federation funds to operate under one Federation-wide law, and a Federation Pension Agency with
a mandate to begin the process of re-integration of the pension system. To this effect, the new legislation
called for a separate follow-up legislation, determining the new organizational structure. Finally, progress
has been made in improving the targeting of pensions through flattening the benefit payments by increasing
the minimum pension, while reducing the ceiling on maximum pension. As a result, the pension payment
ratio between the highest and the lowest has been reduced from 8:1 to 5:1. While achieving its objectives
under this component, the Federation as well as Republika Srpska needed to introduce additional measures
to improve the finances and the administration of their pension systems, particularly by further
strengthening their pension indexation schemes to prevent unfunded pension adjustments and by aligning
benefit levels with the realities of future revenues and demographics. Both Entity Governments have
formulated these reforms and initiated their implementation under the PFSAC II.
Reforming the Budgetary Management System. This component achieved highly positive results.
During 1998, both Entities made significant progress in establishing the legal basis for the budget process
and in strengthening basic budget procedures arid organizational structures. The Federation adopted, in
April 1998, a new Law on the "Principles of Budget". By September 1998, Republika Srpska drafted a
similar law, which it subsequently adopted. This new Law was codifying set of budget reforms agreed
under the PFSAC, including the following measures: specification of the responsibilities of the central and
local governments and the extra-budgetary funds (EBF) in budget planning, enactment, execution and
reporting; appropriate articulation of revenues and expenditures and the establishment of reserve ceilings;
an adequate budget calendar; and provisions to govern domestic and external local government borrowing.
In addition, the coverage and comprehensiveness of the budgets were extended by including external cash
grants, general budgetary borrowing and related expenditures into the budget. Necessary provisions were
included in the new budget laws, thereby gradually extending this system to incorporate capital budgets,
- 11 -



including externally financed projects. Significant progress has been made towards introducing new and
improved budget classification systems which create uniform standards across central and local
governments and initiate comprehensive expenditure reporting.
The new Law also sets important principles for the adoption of accounting, auditing and treasury
systems. In line with these principles, the Entities have made significant progress in improving accounting
systems. This has included adoption of a regulatory framework for commitments reporting which
constitutes an essential step towards achieving financial control. The preparatory work has been initiated
for establishing an external audit function and Supreme Audit Institutions in BiH, which are critical to
promote transparency and accountability in public sector performance. Furthermore, an agreement has
been reached to establish treasury systems as part of the overall payment system reform. Finally, new
procurement regulations have been adopted to establish a system that promotes open competition and
transparency. The authorities have now been continuing with the reform of the budgetary processes and
institutions in wide ranging areas under the PFSAC II and achieving credible results. A notable aspect of
this deepened reform program is its focus on development of a comprehensive, medium-term budget
strategy, consistent with government's macroeconomic and sectoral policies and integrating capital and
recurrent budgets. This task also involves measures to strengthen institutional capacity and to establish a
cooperative approach for budget planing.

Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The PFSAC provided substantial support to the authorities in their effort to strengthen institutional
capacity for managing public finances, particularly in institutionalizing budget and debt management
reforms and in introducing an external audit function. The technical assistance was channeled primarily
through the US$700,000 PHRD grant provided by the Government of Japan (TF02960) to assist in the
preparation of the PFSAC. Technical assistance (i) helped in formulation and subsequent establishment of
the state finance mechanism; (ii) improved knowledge in budget processes, procedures and organizational
structure, in aid management, in planing and monitoring, and in accounting and treasury systems; (iii)
prepared the ground for the introduction of the external audit function in BiH, including initial steps
towards the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks through a participatory approach whereby
both central and local government authorities contributed to the design of the framework; (iv) facilitated
continued dialogue with the authorities, in particular with the local govermnents in the Federation, towards
preparation of reforms to further improve revenue allocation and service delivery; and (v) provided
extensive support in establishment of legal, regulatory, and organizational frameworks for debt
management, as well as in debt recording, monitoring and information sharing systems and analytical
capacities.
Intensive training was also provided, jointly with the U.S. Treasury, to a large number of
participants both in legal, accounting and macro-economic aspects of external borrowing and debt servicing
as well as in new budget classification and accounting principles. The cross-institution building support to
key government institutions--for repairs, office equipment (including to the external debt units), creating a
unified interethnic wage structure, and technical assistance--provided by the Bank and the other donors
under the ERP contributed to the effectiveness of the above stated technical assistance and advisory
programs in establishing public finance management and policy formulation capacity.
- 12 -



The Bank staff provided invaluable technical support for institutional development, both by
intensive interaction with BiH's authorities across the entire range of the involved institutions--State,
Entities and local governments--and by also "leveraging" limited IDA resources across the two public
finance structural operations, PFSAC and PFSAC II. This also helped in appropriately sequencing reforms
critical to facilitating the establishment of the new governance structure in the areas of tax,
intergovernmental finance, budget, debt and pension systems.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Progress under the PFSAC program was generally satisfactory. The consistency of the PFSAC as
a framework for policy and institutional reform, and the stability in the composition of the PFSAC team,
were helpful to the authorities in furthering reform efforts. As noted earlier, the partial waiver of the two
conditions sought from the Board were partly caused by (i) delays, in general, in the preparatory work in
Republika Srpska which, following the election of a new, moderate government in January 1998, was going
through a process of relocating key institutions and reorganizing its governance structure with a limited and
newly appointed core staff, particularly in the Ministry of Finance; and (ii) the process of formation of the
new Parliament and political complications in Republika Srpska in the aftermath of the nationwide
elections in September 1998. Significant progress towards effective implementation of these two conditions
by December 1998, were demonstrating the government's commitmnent to the implementation of the agreed
reforms. Soon after its formation, the Republika Srpska Parliament enacted the necessary pieces of
legislation, hence enabling Republika Srpska to implement all the second tranche conditions at about the
same time with the actual release of the second tranche. Nevertheless, effective implementation of the
amendments to the sales and excise tax legislation was delayed and eventually put aside, the avoidance of
which was clearly at the government's discretion.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Delays in the PFSAC were also caused by prolonged discussions within the three governments
concerning the implementation of the state financing mechanism, as well as concerning tax harmonization
and reform in Republika Srpska and pension reform in the Federation. These discussions primarily
reflected the difficulties of achieving cooperation and coordination between the major ethnic groups in an
ethnically charged country with weak and very fragmented governance. Commitment of the ethnic groups
to particular and often incompatible policies was another factor, which was underestimated at the time the
Credit was prepared.
The State Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations and the Entity Ministries of Finance
took a strong leadership role in implementing and administering the project, often with few dedicated and
technically competent staff. Their work was significantly bolstered by intensive project supervision and by
well-targeted and effective technical assistance, including that from other key donors. Cooperation between
these three institutions, not only initiated, but also strengthened markedly during the project
implementation, particularly in budget and debt management.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Not applicable.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The total cost of the project was US$ 85.7 million equivalent, of which US$ 63.4 million (SDR
46.2 million) was the IDA credit and US$ 22.3 million was co-financing from the Government of
- 13 -



Netherlands.
The PFSAC was approved by the Board on June 4, 1998. The original schedule in the President's
Report for Board presentation, effectiveness and first tranche disbursement was May 1998. Board
presentation was delayed in order to allow for fulfillment of pre-conditions for Board Presentation of the
IMF Standby Arrangement, which had been originally scheduled for May 20, 1998 but was delayed to June
2, 1998 due to outstanding steps towards establishment of the new Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Prior to the release of the first tranche, an IDA supervision mission visited Bosnia
Herzegovina (June 1998), and verified the authorities' compliance with the specific first tranche actions.
The credit was declared effective on July 13, 1998, and the first tranche of US$ 32.4 million equivalent
(SDR 24.2 million) was released on July 22, 1998. The second tranche of US$ 31 million eqivalent (SDR
22 million) was released on December 15, 1998. The anticipated date for the second tranche disbursement
was August 1998, however, some of the conditions were satisfactorily met by Republika Srpska only by
December 1998. The loan was closed on June 30 1999, as originally scheduled.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability is judged highly likely. The policy and institutional measures implemented both
provided a basic framework for establishing a credible and sustainable fiscal management and strengthened
the capacity of key institutions to carry forward more complicated reform programs. Building on their
achievements, authorities have already broadened and deepened public finance reforms in all of the key
components of the PFSAC under the PFSAC II and achieved significant further progress to date.
Cooperation between the three groups and two Entities has improved markedly when compared with the
outset of the PFSAC period. While this has strengthened the sustainability of reforms aimed at institutional
re-integration and policy harmonization, the parties still often pursue separate agendas rather than working
toward consensus needed to implement policy reform. As a result, the pace of reform progress continues to
be slow in areas where decision making requires co-ordination and consensus. Nonetheless, authorities
recognize the importance of strong and accountable institutions and good governance to sustained success
in other reform areas, and for gradual integration with European institutions; they remain committed to
continue working with the Bank and other donors to deepen reform efforts.
The PFSAC Program's likely sustainability is also reinforced by the ongoing IMF Stand-by
Arrangement which continues to monitor, support and expand critical PFSAC reforms, notably the
implementation of the state financing mechanism, tax harmonization and reform and pension reform.
Furthermore, planned future adjustment operations envisaged in the new CAS--dated April, 2000--both to
build a framework for more equitable and fiscally viable social protection system (SOSAC; FY01) and to
further strengthen institutions and govemance (PFSAC III; FY02) will reinforce the sustainability of the
initial reforms under the PFSAC program.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Not applicable.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.] Lending:
The IDA's performance on project preparation and identification was satisfactory. The design of
the project--based on an extensive analytical work (notably, under the 1997 CEM and PER) undertaken by
a core-team including the IDA team--was highly relevant to the circumstances of the country and objectives
- 14 -



of the CAS, and formulated in a highly collaborative process with the State and the Entity governments.
Achievement of consensus was difficult because of mistrust among ethnic groups leading to resistance to
economic integration, particularly through the effective establishment and operation of common institutions
and policies. In this environment, the IDA team prepared and appraised the PFSAC relatively rapidly
(about six months from preparation to Board presentation), effectively coordinated other key donors
supporting reforms included under the PFSAC, and substantially achieved the project goals. When
obstacles were encountered, e.g. in formulation of state finance mechanism, they were dealt with in a
collaborative manner. The Credit was only approved when a credible progress in core institutional and
policy reforms was achieved. This conservatism allowed the IDA to provide the BiH with quick disbursing
funds while reducing the risks in prolonged non-imnplementation of agreed measures.
As noted earlier, overall, project preparation was thorough, and the measures and activities
identified and tranching and trigger provisions employed were realistic. The program design attempted to
take both the weak administrative and institutional capacity and complexity of reforms into account by
attempting to appropriately phasing the program across two consecutive public finance operations and
several tranches. Since the government was reluctant to borrow for technical assistance, the IDA team
aimed at providing maximum technical assistance possible by leveraging preparation-oriented grant funds
across these two operations and by closely coordinating with other donors and bank teams to help
authorities achieve project objectives. There was high staff continuity during project preparation, all the
main mission members participated in all preparation and in the appraisal missions. As noted in above
paragraph, there was also continuity and consistency between the previous economic work done and the
project preparation team. The high level of continuity ensured a good working relationship with the
government counterparts and in the substance of advice and strategic approach.
7.2 Supervision:
IDA's supervision was satisfactory and PFSAC was supervised at close intervals, with four
supervision missions in the 5 months between Board presentation and second tranche. The IDA effectively
and closely monitored implementation of the policy measures specified in the project. Consistency of the
IDA team, as noted earlier, contributed to effectiveness. Project implementation progress was adequately
reported and widely distributed; and problems in implementation were identified and addressed
pro-actively. Working relations with the Government were very good. The supervision missions provided
detailed and systematic feedback to the authorities on program implementation, and made suggestions how
to address problems. IDA's technical work--e.g. in budget, debt, audit, tax policy and pension--was highly
valued by the authorities and was an important contribution to the new govemance process. The project
team effectively monitored the implementation of the policy measures, interacted very closely with other
donors working on related topics.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall, IDA's performance was satisfactory for all stages of project development and supervision.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during preparation was satisfactory. The Borrower was very much
irvolved in project preparation, actively provided comments and perspectives from the State and the Entity
government levels, including through a working group with members from different government agencies
and levels of government. The Borrower also made significant progress towards completion of key
legislative and institutional measures and took important policy actions prior to Board presentation.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
- 15-



The ability of the officials of the State and the Entity Governments to effect wide-ranging policy
and institutional reforns--despite limited institutional capacity--within a short period was commendable.
Authorities also performed well in the macroeconomic area, adhering to currency board rules and
maintaining fiscal discipline. While it was sometimes difficult to achieve consensus in preparation and
proper implementation of mutually consistent budgets and the State finance mechanism, the authorities
succeeded not only in operationalizing the mechanism itself but also in creating a State budget, a new
budget department under the State Ministry of Civil Affairs and Communication, and a whole new State
and Entity debt management structure, with a clear and transparent co-ordination arrangements, which was
necessary for the sustainability of the mechanism. In addition, starting with the 1998 budgets, the State
and the Entities expanded budget plans and the execution reports to include external budgetary financing
and the related expenditures, which improved transparency and accountability in the administration of the
project. This initial improvement is being deepened through subsequent budgetary reforms as described
earlier. The authorities also performed well in developing co-ordination arrangements to implement the
reform agenda (e.g. joint working groups for conceptual and analytical work in budget, debt, tax and audit
reforms).
While the envisaged PFSAC program was overall implemented on time and in substance,
reluctance from the Republika Srpska Government to continue with implementation of tax harmonization
and reform measures somewhat affected the sustainability of this component, despite agreements to deepen
reforms under the follow-up operation, PFSAC II. The PFSAC II project team tried to explain that
envisaged reforms are crucial to improve revenue-raising capacity and minimize tax avoidance in
inter-Entity trade but there was little responsiveness until recently. The government now seems to have
realized the importance of these reforms and is willing to taking measures to address these issues.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Not applicable.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
PFSAC was a difficult project to implement because, for the first time in BiH, three governments
and different governmental entities were responsible for implementing a comprehensive reform program in
a coordinated and harmonized manner. Given the unique circumstances in the country; and when judged
against the requirements of putting in place and implementing a highly demanding macroeconomic
stabilization and structural reform program--including the PFSAC reforms--simultaneously with a large
reconstruction program--involving co-ordination with many donors--the overall performance of the
authorities was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
In an environment where governance is weak and consensus is difficult to achieve, policy
conditions must be well-designed and sequenced. Such conditions, with realistic reform targets, allow for
the implementation of even an ambitious program, as in the case of BiH'ls public finance reform comprising
a very large work program.
A participative approach can help in achieving consensus, in case of BiH, both across
governments and among Government's own bodies. It also helps in fostering ownership and enhances
likely future sustainability of achievements. Working group arrangements formed as part of the PFSAC
process greatly facilitated reform, particularly in the areas of state financing, budget and debt management
(including for debt rescheduling) and tax harmonization, although further action is needed in the latter.
Reforms in these areas involved major changes in existing policies and systems, either inherited from SFRY
- 16-



or established during the war, and their harmonized implementation across governments.
Adequate and well-designed technical assistance is essential to ensuring progress on institution
building elements of policy reform. In the absence of accompanying technical assistance credit for the
PFSAC (reflecting the authorities choices in borrowing from IDA at that time), the Bank staff and the
authorities have leveraged IDA funds with the available donor assistance for achieving the institution
building objectives of the PFSAC. Design of the public finance reform program as two sequential
operations, with PHRD grants supporting the preparation of each operation and an additional Trust Fund--
financed by a grant from the Government of the Netherlands--providing continuity in technical assistance
for key institution building elements of the second operation, have been instrumental in initiating and
moving forward needed reformns in all of the key program elements.
Intensive project supervision and monitoring is essentialfor effective execution ofprojects with a
broad focus and target on institution/capacity building. Intensive supervision constitutes an added
guarantee of sound implementation. The PFSAC benefited from 20 staff weeks of supervision in a short
time frame (about five months between the Board presentation and the release of the second and final
tranche), and intensive monitoring activities in each project component-- generally over and above the usual
Bank norms. This reflected not only need for an intensive assistance to help government--with a very weak
institutional capacity and fragmented governance--implement wide-ranging policy measures, but also
efforts needed to facilitate reform dialogue in a country emerging from conflict among three major ethnic
groups. Considering the many beneficial outcomes of this project, this supervision and monitoring intensity
was worthwhile.
Close and continuous donor co-ordination during implementation is crucial to the success of
other donor's technical assistance and IDA's development objectives. Examples of this in the PFSAC
includes close co-ordination of technical assistance and advice with the US Treasury and the IMF in
budgetary and debt reforms, and with the IMF and the Customs and Fiscal Assistance Office of the EC in
tax and customs policy harmonization and reform. Overall support from donor community for the PFSAC
program through annual donor conferences was also crucial to the timely initiation and implementation of
the project.
Public sector reform is a delicate process, which requires a clear vision, clear planing and a
schedule for implementation over a number of years. Given its very fragmented governance structure in
BiH, it not only requires strong leadership from the top at each level of government--as it is a reform that
concern every ministry and agency in each government--but also a well co-ordinated approach across
governments in order to establish consistent policies and systems--as governments often are reluctant to
accept changes in their structure or the way in which they operate, and lack a wide-enough scope of
authority over all the entities involved in program operations. Given BiH's unique structure, continuity in
the core team and consistent efforts are especially critical to unlock policy action on though policy reforms.

Working group arrangements formed as part of PFSAC process greatly facilitated reform,
particularly in the areas of State financing, budget, debt management and tax harmonization. Technical
assistance and donor co-ordination is essential to ensuring progress on institutional building elements of
policy reforms. Overall support from donor community for the PFSAC program through bi-annual donor

We recognize the importance of strong and accountable institutions and good governance to

IDA's technical work contribution ( in budget, tax and pension policy, debt, audit etc. ) to the new

(b) Cofinanciers:
Government of Netherlands reviewed the draft ICR and provided following comments:
"The Government of Netherlands agrees with the analysis of achievements of the PFSAC as
mentioned in the ICR. Achievements in the field of macroeconomic stabilization, debt management and
fiscal discipline were satisfactory. However, with better cooperation from the Borrower, more could have
been achieved in broadening the government revenue base, making not only more government investment
possible in reconstruction but also in social services, including support to returning minorities. Ongoing
and future adjustment operations in BiH will have to focus more strongly on these equity issues."
