           container handling facilities at Port Moresby, with the\n            objective of avoiding ship waiting time, reducing ship\n            turnaround time and significantly reducing cargo handling\n            costs, thereby enabling Port Moresby to realize fully the\n            greater efficiency of container shipping. Major components\n            include land reclamation of 1.6 ha, a 125 m berth, an\n            extension of the present container freight station, and\n            improvements to the port access road. Also included in the\n            project area 30 m coastal berth at Samarai, located on a\n            small island off the coast of Southern Papua, and consulting\n            services for project design and implementation, and for\n            training Papua New Guinea Harbours Board staff. There are no\n            special risks associated with the project. A 25% increase in\n            capital costs would reduce the rate of return from 14% to 10%."}, "docdt": "1978-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
