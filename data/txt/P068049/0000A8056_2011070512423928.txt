                         The four original components are ready for the final acceptance procedure, which is planned to be completed in first half of 2011. The Guangrun component moves forward smoothly
                         after Guodian (one of the five big power generation companies) became the major shareholder of the project company in May 2010. Up until the end of April 2011, 98 percent of the

                         total investment funding was materialized. The construction of the Zhamushui reservoir and power house is under way and it is expected that the construction will be completed by
                         September 2011. According to the company's plan, the commissioning will start between October and December 2011. Therefore the project as a whole is very likely to meet its
                         development objectives.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         For solving the funding issue and speeding up the implementation, the Bank loan was hundred percent disbursed in 2009. But for enhancing the safeguards implementation, a
                         second closing date extension was approved by the Bank. The task team will keep a close eye on the implementation of the remaining pieces of the project construction of
                         Zhamushui to make sure all the safeguards policies will be complied.
