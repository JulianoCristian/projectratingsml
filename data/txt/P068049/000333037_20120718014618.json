development outcome\n            was negligible to low, the Bank performance was\n            satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was moderately\n            satisfactory. Some lessons learned included: small to medium\n            hydropower projects located in poor counties can be designed\n            as holistic county development projects. Strong support from\n            government (local and provincial) to the project, and full\n            commitment to the implementation arrangements agreed with\n            the Bank at appraisal. An assessment of the implementing\n            agency's capacity on these three points at the\n            appraisal stage is crucial. Financial capacity and interest\n            in the project alone are not sufficient. If a new component\n            is to be carried out by an implementing agency with weak\n            technical and managerial capacity, a Technical Assistance\n            (TA) program should be included to address these weaknesses.\n            Sufficient geological investigations should be carried out\n            during the preparation stage not only at the location of the\n            dam, but also at the site of the reservoir."}, "docdt": "2012-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
