                         Guangrun is one of the five subprojects of the Hubei Hydro Power Development Project in Poor Areas. It is also a carbon financed project and
                         the Bank is the trustee for the purchase of the ER credits. The IBRD loan (P068049) was closed by the end of 2011. The ICR for the IBRD loan
                         was completed in June 2012 and ICR was rated moderately satisfactory by IEG.
                         The carbon finance part of the subproject (P094795) is still on-going. Guangrun subproject is encountering delays due to the leakage problem on
                         the steep slope and the bed of Hongwawu and the poor geological condition in the dam abutment of Zhamushui. By end of March 2014, the
                         treatment of leakage in Hongwawu in the lower end was completed and the construction of the Zhamushui dam was completed ( the remaining
                         work, installation of the arch gate for flood discharging, will be done in late 2014).

                         The first monitoring period was from July 2009 to Dec 2010. 10,603 tons of CO2e was issued for this period. The first ER payment was

                         delivered, USD 6715.1, after deduction of the concerned fee. The second verification is under way, which covers the monitoring period, Jan. 1,
                         2011 to March 31, 2104.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The construction was completed for Zhamushui (except the installation of the arch gate for flood discharging) and the treatment of the leakage in
                         Hongwawu in lower end was also completed. The commissioning of the two components was conducted in the early 2014. By end of March
                         2014, 63297.9 MWh electricity has been generated from the project. The project company should speed up the implementation to complete the
                         project construction by end of 2015.
