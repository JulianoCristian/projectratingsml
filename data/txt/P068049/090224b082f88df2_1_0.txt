Implementation Status and Key Decisions
The Construction of the Zhamushui dam (with the exception of the installation of the arch gate for flood discharging) and the treatment of
the leakage in the lower end of Hongwawu reservoir was completed in September 2013. The commissioning of both dams was conducted in early
2014, two years delay than originally planned. But the treatment of the leakage in upper end of Hongwawu has not been done yet. This
significantly influenced the electricity generation ouput from Hongwawu.The Trustee and project entity have thus agreed to further adjust the
original ER targets to 157,745 tons of CO2e. The target was firstly reduced from 485,000 tons of CO2e to 249,590 tons of CO2e through ERPA
amendment (signed on November 15, 2012).
