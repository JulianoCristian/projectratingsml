Implementation Status and Key Decisions
Most of the construction of the Zhamushui dam (with the exception of the installation of the arch gate for flood discharging) was completed in
September 2013. The treatment of the Hongwawu leakage in the lower end was also completed by September 2013. Both were delayed by 20
months . The commissioning for Zhamushui and Hongwawu (recommissioning after leakage treatment)was conducted in early 2014, which is a
delay of more than 20 months than originally planned. The Trustee and PE are negotiating and adjusting the original ER targets from 450,000 ton
CO2e to 250,000 ton CO2e.
