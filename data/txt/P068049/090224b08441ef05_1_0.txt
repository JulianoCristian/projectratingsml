Implementation Status and Key Decisions

  The Construction of the Zhamushui dam and Hongwawu reservoir was completed and commissioned in early 2014, two years delay than originally
  planned. But soon after the commissioning, leakage was found in the bed and right bank of Hongwawu. The treatment of Hongwawu leakage in
  the bed and lower end of the right bank was completed in September 2013. But the treatment of the leakage in upper end of Hongwawu has not
  been done yet because of shortage of investment capital. In additional, the construction of diversion channels (Qilibian and Dongpiaohe), and the
  enhancement of the right abutment and the installation of the arch gate for flood discharging in Zhamushui (inter related) have not completed yet.
  This significantly influenced the electricity generation ouput from Hongwawu.
  The Electricity Generation in 2015 totals 36,218 MWh, presenting a 22% drop from the electricity generation from the previous year, and less than
  40 percent of the expected in the feasibility study (92.7GWh). The decrease was mainly caused by a significant reduction of the water availability
  due to less precipitation. Taking the current status of the project, the Trustee and the PE have already adjusted the original ER targets to 157,745
  tons CO2e (ERPA amendment signed on June 9, 2015. The target was firstly reduced from 485,000 tons of CO2e to 249,590 tons of

 CO2e through ERPA amendment (signed on November 15, 2012)). The last verification will cover the monitoring period of March 1, 2014 – June
 30, 2016. The site visit is schedule in late July/early August.
 The first monitoring period was from July 2009 to Dec 2010. 10,603 tons of CO2e was issued for this period. The first ER payment was delivered,
 USD 6715.1, after deduction of the concerned fee. The second issuance was completed on February 27, 2015 by EB, which covers the monitoring
 period, Jan. 1, 2011 to March 31, 2104, with total of 42,384 tons of CO2e claimed. The second ER payment will be delivered in late June 2015.
 The third verification is planned to be done in July/August, 2016. When finishing the payment based on the third verification, ERPA is expected
 to be closed in late 2016.
