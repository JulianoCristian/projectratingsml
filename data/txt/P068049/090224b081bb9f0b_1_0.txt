                         The project has three objectives: (a) facilitate economic growth in Hubei by expanding electric power generation capacity in an economically and environmentally
                         sustainable manner; (b) enhance the efficiency of the electricity sector in Hubei by commercializing county generation companies; and (c) contribute to poverty
                         alleviation efforts in poor communities in Hubei.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Guangrun is one of the five subprojects of the Hubei Hydro Power Development Project in Poor Areas. It is also a carbon financed project and the Bank is the trustee for the
                         purchase of the ER credits. The IBRD loan (P068049) was closed by the end of 2011. The ICR for the IBRD loan was completed in June 2012. The carbon finance part of the
                         project (P094795) is still on-going. Guangrun subproject is encountering delays due to the remaining work to be carried out in fixing the leakage problem on the steep slope and the

                         a whole is likely to achieve its development objectives by the project closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         For enhancing the safeguards compliance, the task team will continue to supervise the implementation of the project to make sure the Bank's safeguards policies are properly
                         complied with in the construction of the remaining part of the project. The construction of the project was delayed because of the unexpected complex situation of leakage in
                         Hongwawu and poor geological condition on the dam abutment of Zhamushui. According to the company's plan the construction is expected to be completed in May 2013 and then

                         start the commissioning for Zhamushui and complete the treatment of the leakage in Hongwawu around the same time.
