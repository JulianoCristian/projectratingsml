                         The project has three objectives: (a) facilitate economic growth in Hubei by expanding electric power generation capacity in an economically and environmentally
                         sustainable manner; (b) enhance the efficiency of the electricity sector in Hubei by commercializing county generation companies; and (c) contribute to poverty
                         alleviation efforts in poor communities in Hubei.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Guangrun i s one of the five components of the Hubei Hydro Power Development Project in Poor Areas. Because Guangrun component is using the left over of the Bank loan, the
                         closing date was extended from December 30, 2008 to June 30, 2010; While for supervising the construction of the dam and solving the counterpart financing issue, the loan closing
                         date was extended for the second time from June 30, 2010 to December 30, 2011. By the closing date of the loan, the construction of Guangrun component still did not complete

                         because leakage were found in both Hongwawu and Zhamushui, and the poor geological condition on the left dam abutment was found in Zhamushui . It took some time for Guodian,
                         the new project entity which took over the ownership of the project company in June of 2010, to fix those issues. According to company's plan, the impoundments will be done in May
                         2012 and then the commissioning of the power generation facilities. In this sense the project as a whole is very likely to meet its development objectives and rated satisfactory but the
                         implementation progress will be rated moderately unsatisfactory, because of the significant delay of construction. This is a blended operation of IBRD loan and Carbon finance for the
                         Guangrun component, therefore the ISR of the loan operation P068049 fully complies with the carbon finance project (p094795).
