          SECONDARY EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN NO. 4767-TU)
                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
Turkey’s Secondary Education Project (SEP), financed by an IBRD loan in the amount of
Euro 80 million, supports improvements of conditions for student learning in secondary
education and in schools in sub-provinces with low enrollment rates. It comprises the
following components:

Component 1: Secondary Education Reform (Euro 47.02 million). This component
supports: (i) Implementation of new general education and vocational education
curriculum programs to provide students with core skills to compete in the knowledge
economy; and (ii) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) training and
Career Guidance and Counseling.

Component 2: Quality Assessment (Euro 2.39 million). This component supports: (i)
Student Assessment and Evaluation, aimed at improving the quality and outcomes of
secondary education by developing systems to collect and disseminate information on
student learning and outcomes, and on the performance of the education system staff and
institutions; and (ii) Improving the performance and outcomes, educational achievement,
and quality in education of secondary schools staff, parents, and students through school
development activities.

Component 3: School Grants (Euro 27 million). This component supports: (i)
Vocational training competitive grants designed to improve the skills and qualifications
of vocational teachers and the quality of vocational training institutions; (ii) A School
Development Program (SDP) to provide grants to schools in sub-provinces with low
enrollment rates and in areas likely to have been more adversely affected by the global
economic crisis. The SDP was added under Component 3 as part of the March 2010
project restructuring (see Section B). An amount of Euro 24 million was allocated for
this new activity to cover 2,710 schools in 46 sub-provinces.

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Euro 3.59 million).
This component supports: (i) Project administration and coordination; and (ii) Regular
monitoring of the project, evaluation of project sub-components, and evaluation of the
overall impact of the project.

The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to seek approval by the Country Director for
the reallocation of funds among the existing activities under the SEP, as detailed in
Section C, Tables 1 and 2, and as summarized below:

Funds totaling Euro 9.232 million have become available for reallocation under the
project from:


                                           4
           a. A contract cancellation of Euro 7.053 million from sub-component 1.2
              (Information and Communications Technology); and

           b. Cost savings of Euro 2.179 million from sub-components 1.1 (Curricula Reform),
              1.3 (Career Guidance and Counseling), 3.1 (Training for Foreign Language)1, 3.2
              (Vocational Training Initiatives) and 4.2 (Monitoring and Evaluation), determined
              primarily by lower than initially estimated costs of ongoing or completed
              activities.

The freed-up funds of Euro 9.232 million are proposed to be used for additional
allocations to the following activities:

      i.      An additional allocation in the amount of Euro 2.045 million to Component 2
              to support the strengthening of Quality Assessment: This reallocation would
              scale-up existing activities under the Student Assessment sub-component by
              scaling up the training of staff for carrying out assessments and evaluations. The
              School Improvement sub-component will also be scaled up by expanding training
              of education staff, including teachers, school principals, school administrators,
              and education mangers, in preparing school development plans, and developing
              core pedagogical competencies.

    ii.       An additional allocation in the amount of Euro 6.77 million to sub-
              component 3.3 to support the expansion of the SDP: Activities under the SDP
              have progressed well, resulting in a significant increase in disbursement of loan
              proceeds (see Section B). As a result, the Borrower has made a request to scale
              up the Program to include an additional 809 schools in 10 new sub-provinces.

    iii.      An additional allocation in the amount of Euro 0.417 million to sub-
              component 4.1 to provide additional support for project implementation, as
              809 additional schools are proposed to benefit from the SDP.

No changes to the Project other than the above reallocations are proposed at this time.



PROJECT STATUS
SEP was approved in March 2005, and became effective in May 2006. The Project had a
slow start and underwent two Level I restructurings, in February 2008 and March
2010respectively, which resulted in the modification of its development objectives as
well as some of its components.

Project implementation and overall performance have markedly improved since the
second half of 2010, and this is reflected in accelerated disbursements, which increased
from Euro 18.9 million (24 percent of loan proceeds) in November, 2010 to Euro 33
million (41 percent of loan proceeds) as of June, 2011.

Key achievements and outputs under the Project are summarized below:

   ƒ   The SDP is under implementation in all sub-provinces. As of end-April, 2011,
       Euro 11.8 million were contracted under the SDP sub-component. Of these, Euro
       4.5 million were disbursed;
   ƒ   The curricula revisions for 65 programs for General Secondary Education were
       completed – initial target was 64 programs;
   ƒ   1,160 modules for vocational education were completed – initial target was 1,000
       modules;
   ƒ   The national Career Information System (CIS) has been active since April 2010.
       The system is well functioning, integrated and easily accessible to all internet
       users. The CIS is part of a broader, integrated approach towards career guidance
       and counseling, which involves several Turkish institutions, such as ISKUR and
       SPO. The site (http://mbs.meb.gov.tr) has 50,000 registered users and an
       estimated significantly larger number of non registered users;
   ƒ   Pilot tests in 210 general secondary and 90 vocational schools by 118,617
       students were completed as part of the Student Success Assessment Examination
       (OBBS). Nine research studies have been carried out to analyze the data
       collected;
   ƒ   School Development Management Teams were formed in all secondary education
       schools, and over 2,500 primary schools. 15,000 educational staff were trained in
       school plan preparation;
   ƒ   Vocational Training Initiatives (VTIs) in all 46 targeted vocational schools were
       successfully completed, including teacher training, school grants, and
       implementation of new technology-based training methods. Initial results from
       site visits show that schools are satisfied with the VTIs and school grants;
   ƒ   The Beneficiary Assessment for curricula reform is at the assessment stage and is
       expected to be completed by November, 2011. The Beneficiary Assessment for
       the SDP is expected to start in September, 2011 and is expected to be completed
       by December, 2011.

Based on accelerated implementation and overall progress towards key development
indicators, the Bank recently upgraded progress towards SEP’s development objective to
Moderately Satisfactory. Implementation Progress also continues to be assessed as
Moderately Satisfactory as key activities continue to advance. With continued concerted
efforts to ensure that ongoing activities progress on a timely schedule, the Project is
likely to achieve most of its objectives.

The annual Project financial statements are audited by the Treasury Controllers in
accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) based on the terms of
reference agreed with the Bank. There are no overdue audit reports for the Project, and no
outstanding issues from the Project’s previous audits.
