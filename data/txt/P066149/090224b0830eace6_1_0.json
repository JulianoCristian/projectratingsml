In the past decade, Turkey has\n            made great progress in getting its children enrolled in\n            primary school. But now the quality of that education is\n            coming under scrutiny. Research showed that Turkish\n            teenagers were behind their counterparts in other comparable\n            countries. The quality of education is uneven across Turkey.\n            City schools tend to be stronger. More affluent children\n            tend to go to better schools and perform better once there.\n            Of all the countries in the Europe and Central Asia region,\n            only Tajikistan's population ranks education as a\n            higher priority than do Turks. With support from the World\n            Bank, Turkey was tackling education policy. One priority was\n            better training and better pay for teachers. Another was a\n            focus on early childhood education. Yet another was\n            curriculum reform. Some educators see Turkish students on\n            the world's stage, and want to prepare them to take\n            their place in a global market."}, "docdt": "2012-02-10T09:37:01Z"}
