                     RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
The purpose of this Restructuring Paper is to seek approval by the Country Director for
the extension of the closing date for the Turkey’s Secondary Education Project (SEP),
from December 31, 2011 to April 30, 2012, and the reallocation of Euro 1.35 million
out of a total loan of Euro 80 million funds among the existing categories under the
project.

SEP, financed by an IBRD loan in the amount of Euro 80 million, supports improvements
of conditions for student learning in secondary education and in schools in sub-provinces
with low enrollment rates. It comprises the following components:

Component 1: Secondary Education Reform (Euro 38.39 million). This component
supports: (i) Implementation of new general education and vocational education
curriculum programs to provide students with core skills to compete in the knowledge
economy; and (ii) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) training and
Career Guidance and Counseling.

Component 2: Quality Assessment (Euro 4.26 million). This component supports: (i)
Student Assessment and Evaluation, aimed at improving the quality and outcomes of
secondary education by developing systems to collect and disseminate information on
student learning and outcomes, and on the performance of the education system staff and
institutions; and (ii) Improving the performance and outcomes, educational achievement,
and quality in education of secondary schools staff, parents, and students through school
development activities.

Component 3: School Grants (Euro 33.52 million). This component supports: (i)
Vocational training competitive grants designed to improve the skills and qualifications
of vocational teachers and the quality of vocational training institutions; (ii) A School
Development Program (SDP) to provide grants to schools in sub-provinces with low
enrollment rates and in areas likely to have been more adversely affected by the global
economic crisis.

Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Euro 3.82 million).
This component supports: (i) Project administration and coordination; and (ii) Regular
monitoring of the project, evaluation of project sub-components, and evaluation of the
overall impact of the project.


PROJECT STATUS

                                           4
SEP was approved in March 2005, and became effective in May 2006. The Project had a
slow start and underwent two Level I restructurings, in February 2008 and March 2010
respectively, which resulted in the modification of its development objectives as well as
some of its components. A Level II restructuring of the project was approved in June,
2011 and was used to expand SDP coverage.

Project implementation and overall performance have markedly improved since 2010,
and this is reflected in accelerated disbursements, which increased from Euro 18.9
million (24 percent of loan proceeds) in November, 2010 to Euro 49.7 million (62 percent
of loan proceeds) as of December 1, 2011. Given the positive progress and in order to
fully achieve the project development objective of improving secondary education
learning conditions, and allow for the greater coverage of the highly successful SDP
component, the Government of Turkey has sent a formal request for extending the project
end date to April 30, 2012.

Key achievements and outputs under the Project are summarized below:

       The SDP is under implementation in all sub-provinces. As of end-April, 2011,
       Euro 11.8 million were contracted under the SDP sub-component. Of these, Euro
       4.5 million were disbursed;
       The curricula revisions for 65 programs for General Secondary Education were
       completed – initial target was 64 programs;
       1,160 modules for vocational education were completed – initial target was 1,000
       modules;
       The national Career Information System (CIS) has been active since April 2010.
       The system is well functioning, integrated and easily accessible to all internet
       users. The CIS is part of a broader, integrated approach towards career guidance
       and counseling, which involves several Turkish institutions, such as ISKUR and
       Ministry of Development. The site (http://mbs.meb.gov.tr) has 1,213,463
       registered users and an estimated significantly larger number of non registered
       users;
       School Development Management Teams were formed in all secondary education
       schools, and over 2,500 primary schools. 15,000 educational staff were trained in
       school plan preparation; and
       Vocational Training Initiatives (VTIs) in all 46 targeted vocational schools were
       successfully completed, including teacher training, school grants, and
       implementation of new technology-based training methods. Initial results from
       site visits show that schools are satisfied with the VTIs and school grants.

Progress towards SEP’s development objective continues to be assessed as Moderately
Satisfactory. Implementation progress has been slow since August 2011; the key reason
behind such delays is the deep and ongoing restructuring of Ministry of National
Education (MONE), and a pre-occupation with the recovery efforts in the earthquake-
affected Van province. The team expects implementation progress to improve over the
next few weeks as changes to project related staff in MONE have been finalized by the
end of November, 2011, and the bulk of activities for early response to the earthquake in
VAN are over. With continued concerted efforts to ensure that ongoing activities

                                           5
progress on a timely schedule, the Project is likely to achieve most of its objectives if an
extension is granted.

The annual Project financial statements are audited by the Treasury Controllers in
accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) based on the terms of
reference agreed with the Bank. There are no overdue audit reports for the Project, and no
outstanding issues from the Project’s previous audits.




PROPOSED CHANGES
Extension of the Project Closing Date:

The Government seeks an extension of the closing date of the project from December 31,
2011 to April 30, 2012 in order to:

       a. Complete Activities in the School Development Program (SDP): An extension
          of the Project end date is necessary to allow schools to complete all activities
          under the SDP program and fully utilize their grants.

       b. Complete Activities related to Secondary Education Reform: An extension
          will allow MONE to complete activities under Secondary Education Reform, in
          particular by taking delivery of goods and equipment needed for training
          associated with extensive curricula reform under the project.

Reallocation of Project Funds to SDP:

SDP has shown rapid success and the Government wants to reallocate Euro 1.385
million, to expand SDP to four additional sub-provinces. The details are summarized
below and included in Table 1:

Funds totaling Euro 1.385 million have become available for reallocation under the
project from:

       a. A reduction and reorganization of activities under Training and In-service
          Training Category resulting in savings of Euro 1.25 million; and

       b. Cost savings of Euro 0.135 million under Incremental Operating Cost category.

The freed-up funds of Euro 1.385 million are proposed to be used for additional
allocations to the following activities:

  i.      An additional allocation in the amount of Euro 1.35 million to support the
          expansion of the SDP: Activities under the SDP have progressed well, resulting
          in a significant increase in disbursement of loan proceeds. As a result, the
          Borrower has made a request to further expand the Program to include an

                                              6
       additional 170 schools in four new sub-provinces. These new sub-provinces are
       located in provinces which are already implementing SDP grants in neighboring
       sub-provinces, and this is likely to ensure speedy implementation.

 ii.   An additional allocation in the amount of Euro 0.035 million to Consultant
       Services category to provide additional support for project implementation.
