substantial, the Bank performance was unsatisfactory, and\n            the Borrower performance was moderately unsatisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: ownership of the implementing\n            agency remains the single most important factor in\n            determining the success of a project. Clearance and support\n            from central Government agencies are a necessary but not\n            sufficient condition for success. Better understanding and\n            increased awareness of the political economy surrounding a\n            specific program or operation is likely to positively affect\n            its ultimate outcome. From a Government perspective, carving\n            out a relevant role for the Bank in a sophisticated country\n            needs careful discussion of where the Bank's\n            value-added is, and how it can be maximized. Remaining\n            engaged in non-performing operations should be carefully\n            evaluated against longer-term implications. Incentives and\n            information dissemination are needed to spread the benefits\n            of school projects beyond the individual institution."}, "docdt": "2012-12-21T00:00:00Z"}
