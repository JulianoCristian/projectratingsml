MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:       Project Completion Report on Philippines
Provincial Ports Proiect (Loan 2823-PH)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Philippines: Provincial Ports project
(Loan 2823-PH, approved in FY87) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office with Part II
contributed by the Borrower. The Loan for US$32 million equivalent was closed on June 14, 1994,
twelve months after the original schedule. Final disbursement took place in May 1994; a balance of
about US$1.9 million was canceled.
The loan was the fourth to assist the port system of the Philippines. Project design included
follow up on institutional components initiated under the earlier (FY81) Third Ports project. Physical
objectives were to expand and improve port capacity, through (i) rehabilitation and construction of
facilities; and (ii) feasibility and detailed engineering studies for future projects. Institutional project
objectives were to strengthen the institutional setup for the management of secondary ports, through (i)
technical assistance for training and for developing a Management Information System (MIS), and (ii)
studies, especially to prepare cost-based tariffs.
The main physical component-expansion of six provincial ports and rehabilitation of fifteen
others-was successfully completed after delays. The pre-investment feasibility and engineering studies
were also completed. The institutional component was, however, not implemented. The Borrower
stopped work early on the MIS system; money already spent under an earlier project was wasted. No
training took place either because Government prohibited overseas training or because the port authority
showed no interest for on-site training. The port tariff study, whose need had been identified under an
earlier project, did not result in changes in tariff structure. The major recommendations for improving
fire fighting arrangements were shelved for future consideration.
The PCR covers all key areas but lacks detailed economic and financial data to support its
analysis. It estimates the economic rate of return of the project at 32 percent, higher than at appraisal,
in part because the growth rate of traffic was more than double the appraisal estimate. Overall, the
finances of the Philippines Port Authority are sound. Port charges, however, appear to be biased to the
benefit of slhips rather than of cargo; the issue is being pursued in the proposed Maritime Improvement
project as a follow up on the port tariff study under the Provincial Ports project. Because of the failure
of institutional development on1 a fourth project in the same sector, the Operations Evaluation Department
rates the outcome as marginally satisfactory, sustainability as likely, and the institutional development as
negligible.
No audit is planned.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Provincial Ports Project in the Republic
of the Philippines, for which IBRD Loan 2823-PH in the amount of US$32 million was approved on
26 May 1987, signed on 30 June 1987 and became effective on 12 November 1987. The loan was
closed on 31 December 1993, after being granted an extension of 12 months. The total amount
disbursed was $30,065,959.84, the final disbursement was made on 10 May 1994 and the balance of
$1,934,040.16 was cancelled on the same date. The account was closed on 14 June 1994, when final
recoveries of the Special Account were made.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country Department
1 of the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAlIN) (Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III),
and by the Project Management Office (PMO) of the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) (Part II), and
is based, inter alia, on the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's (IBRD) Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR); the Loan Agreement (LA); the Project Agreement (PA); supervision reports;
PPA's own records, project completion report and monthly progress reports; correspondence between
IBRD, the Borrower and PPA; and internal IBRD memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
The Provincial Ports Project was designed to strengthen the institutional setup for the
management of secondary and tertiary ports in the Philippines and help expand and improve port
capacity by:
(a)   expansion of facilities at six ports and rehabilitation/maintenance work at six others,
with further provision for rehabilitation at ten additional ports to be identified; and
(b)   technical assistance in project implementation, financial management, training and
studies needed for further development of the port system in the country.
To accomplish these objectives the project would:
(a)   expand facilities at six selected development ports;
(b)   rehabilitate/maintain existing facilities at six selected rehabilitation ports, and ten
additional ports to be identified and selected according to criteria reviewed and
approved by the Bank;
(c)   procure equipment for communications, water supply and sewerage, management
information systems (MIS) and fire fighting;
(d)   provide technical assistance to PPA for design and construction supervision, MIS,
feasibility studies for future port projects, special studies and training; and
(e)   provide training of personnel in port planning, design, management and operations.
Implementation Experience
The Provincial Ports Project was appraised in August/September 1986 and negotiations were
held in April 1987. The Loan was approved on 26 May 1987, signed on 30 June 1987 and became
effective on 12 November 1987. The IBRD Loan (Ln 2823-PH) for the project amounted to US$32.0
million. The loan closed on 31 December 1993 after having been extended for one year. The loan
account closed on 14 June 1994, $30,065,959.84 having been disbursed. The balance of
$1,934,040.16 was cancelled on 10 May 1994, when the final disbursement was made.
The project made a good start, because the first twelve works contracts had been identified and
designed during the implementation of the Third Ports Project (Ln. 1855-PH). Eleven of these twelve
contracts started in late September or early October 1987. Many of them, however, were extensively
delayed for various reasons and though eight of them had been completed by mid-1990, the last one
was not completed until early 1993.



PCR - Evaluation Summary                     iV                   Provincial Ports Project - Ln. 2823-PH
During the project nine further ports were identified as requiring urgent rehabilitation and
work on these started in early 1990. One port was deleted because of damage incurred by a major
earthquake and the remaining eight were finally completed at the end of 1993, when the loan closed.
Technical assistance and consulting services included studies on implementing the MIS, port
tariff rationalisation, fire fighting needs, watersupply, communications and port operations, feasibility
studies to select the additional port works to be included, detailed design of works to be carried out
under the proposed Maritime Improvement Project and training of staff as well as assistance for
design and construction supervision for port works.
Project Results
The main component of this project, the civil works, was successfully completed after some
delays and after the loan closing date had been extended by one year. The results have been beneficial
to the inter-island and international freight and passenger traffic through the provision of improved
facilities for handling both cargo and passengers. Because of the reduction in value of the Peso in
relation to the US Dollar during the period of the project, more work was carried out for about the
same US Dollar cost as that forecast at appraisal.
The post-project Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the project is estimated to be 32% as
compared to the SAR's ERR of 27%. Cargo throughput at most of the twelve original ports has
greatly exceeded the appraisal forecast, costs have not increased and therefore the project returns are
very satisfactory.
On the other hand, the technical assistance achieved only moderate success. The MIS study
was stopped by COA part way through on the grounds that the COA system will be more useful, the
tariff study has in part been acted upon, the fire fighting study recommendations have largely not been
implemented, the communications and port operations studies were cancelled and the training, in
addition to being curtailed by the government's ban on overseas travel for study, was not carried
through with any energy or conviction.
Sustainability
It is expected that the economic benefits generated by the project works will be sustained in
view of the higher than forecast traffic levels.
In order to bring itself up to date technologically, PPA must be allowed to implement a
meaningful MIS improvement related to its port operations.
The main risk to the sustainability of the project benefits is that inadequate provisions are made
for routine and periodic maintenance in future years or that the economy falls again into recession and
traffic levels fall appreciably. The risk of inadequate maintenance has been addressed, at least in part,
by PPA, which has instituted a more rigourous system of inspection and maintenance. It is expected
that the forthcoming Maritime Improvement Project would also address some of the more serious
maintenance problems at major ports.

Findings and Lessons Learned
This was overall a reasonably successful project, much of the credit for which must go to the
coordination achieved between the Bank staff and PPA and to the technical assistance consultants who
helped PPA supervise the civil works.
The main lessons that should be learned by the Bank and the Borrower are: (a) more rigourous
prequalification of contractors must be carried out in the future, especially in relation to their financial
resources and capability for completing the works successfully; (b) the training programme must be
planned to ensure that its content is appropriate and that it is implemented in a timely manner; (c)
better continuity of Bank supervision should be provided; and (d) improvement and augmentation of
PPA's maintenance resources, planning and operations would reduce the need to periodically
rehabilitate port facilities.

2. Background
2.01  At the time of appraisal the Philippines transport system was composed of over 161,000 km of
roads. 131 national ports, 265 private ports and about 400 loading points as well as railways and
airports. The system was, and still is, predominately bimodal, with road and sea transport generally
complementing rather than competing with each other. Road transport handled 90% of the country's
passenger movement and 65 % of freight movement, while sea transport handled 7% of passengers and
35% of freight.
2.02  Together with much of the country's infrastructure, the condition of many port facilities was
not good. During the economic and financial difficulties of the early 1980s, insufficient funds were
released by the Government for maintenance expenditures, which resulted in deterioration of port
infrastructure and equipment. Problems included insufficient dredging, dilapidated piers, badly
maintained access roads and lack of lighting and communication systems. Considering the importance
of infrastructure maintenance for efficient port operations, it was important to ensure that the
Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) would have the necessary budget to carry out the required
maintenance works to arrest further deterioration of port infrastructure.
2.03  Among the Bank's principal objectives in transport sector lending in the Philippines has been
to improve the infrastructure of the country and to assist in strengthening the respective institutions.
Commencing with the first port loan in 1961, the Bank has had a long association with the Philippines
ports subsector and was instrumental in the creation of PPA in 1974. Three completed port projects
had financed the expansion and improvement of PPA's major ports, so the next step was to improve
secondary and tertiary ports in the provinces. This was in line with the Government's and the Bank's
strategy for alleviating the conditions in some of the more underdeveloped areas of the country.
Therefore. during the Third Ports Project (Loan 1855-PH), a feasibility study was conducted to select

provincial ports which needed to be developed to cater for increasing traffic ("development ports")
and others which needed some repair and upgrading ("rehabilitation ports").
3. Project Objectives and Description
3.01   Project Objectives.  The project was designed to strengthen the institutional setup for the
management of secondary and tertiary ports in the Philippines and help expand and improve port
capacity by:
(a)    expansion of facilities at six ports and rehabilitation/maintenance work at six others,
with further provision for rehabilitation at ten additional ports to be identified; and
(b)   technical assistance in project implementation, financial management, training and
studies needed for further development of the port system in the country.
3.02  Project Description. The project would:
(a)    expand facilities at six selected development ports;
(b)   rehabilitate/maintain existing facilities at six selected rehabilitation ports, and ten
additional ports to be identified and selected according to criteria reviewed and
approved by the Bank;
(c)    procure equipment for communications, water supply and sewerage, management
information systems (MIS) and fire fighting;
(d)    provide technical assistance to PPA  for design and construction supervision, MIS,
feasibility studies for future port projects, special studies and training; and
(e)    provide training of personnel in port planning, design, management and operations.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01   This project was the fourth port project to be financed by the Bank in the Philippines and the
main components were identified by a feasibility study carried out during the implementation of the
Third Ports Project. Of the sixteen ports studied, six development ports and six rehabilitation ports
were selected as having the highest priority based on the identification of cargo and passenger traffic
growth patterns and shortfalls between existing berth capacities and the facilities expected to be
required by 1990. The ports selected as development ports were Calapan, San Jose, Tagbilaran,
Nasipit, Surigao and Pulupandan. The rehabilitation ports selected were Bauan, Cagayan de Oro, Sta.
Cruz, Legaspi, Tabaco and Pulauan. These twelve ports provided a good geographical spread,
covering southern Luzon and adjacent islands, the Visayas and Mindanao. Also, under the Third Ports
Project, these ports were studied further and final designs and tender drawings prepared. Ten further
ports were to be identified for rehabilitation/maintenance during this project after consultation with the
Bank. This would enable the project to respond in a flexible way to additional rehabilitation
/maintenance needs.
4.02  The project had a substantial Technical Assistance component built into it, aimed at
strengthening the capabilities of PPA. This comprised the finalisation of the Management Information
System (MIS) started under the Third Ports Project, feasibility studies for future port projects and
special studies on improving communications, port operations, fire fighting, water supply and MIS
equipment, as well as design and construction supervision of civil works and a programme of training
in port planning, design, management, operations and finance.

4.03  Primary responsibility for implementation was to be vested in PPA acting through a central
Project Management Office (PMO) and smaller PMOs set up at the affected ports. Foreign technical
assistance experts and local consultants were employed to carry out the design, supervision and
studies, while the fire fighting study was carried out by the Manila Fire Department and the training
programme by the PPA Training Centre. Foreign consulting firms carried out the MIS and Tariff
Studies.
4.04 The loan for the project was approved in the sum of US$32.0 million, which was to finance
73% of the total project costs, excluding taxes and duties, which translated into 67% of the civil
works costs and 100% of the foreign expenditures for goods and 100% of the costs of consultant
services and training. The civil works and technical assistance components were expected to be
completed by the end of 1991 and the loan was scheduled to close at the end of 1992. The timing of
the project was suitable because of the seriously deteriorated state of many of the ports, the urgent
necessity to rehabilitate them, and the budget constraints that prevented PPA from carrying out the
works with its own funds.
5. Project Lnplementation
5.01  Apart from one contract, that for Cagayan de Oro, which started 18 months after the others,
the civil works contracts prepared under the Third Ports Project and detailed in the SAR all started
promptly in late September or early October 1987. Many of the contracts ran into trouble early on in
the contract period for a variety of reasons which included a lack of financial resources on the part of
the contractor, bad weather, additional works, delays in the delivery of government supplied
materials, unexpected geology, port congestion, shortage of cement and a deteriorating security and
economic situation. All the contracts overran their original contract periods and in all cases the PMO
granted appropriate contract extensions, the length of which depended on the particular circumstances
affecting the contractor. Two contracts, Palupandan and Tagbilaran, were terminated because the
contractors showed no signs of being able to complete them, and the works were completed
respectively by force account and by another contractor after a further round of bidding. In the end,
all the contracts were completed and, in several cases, more work was done than was originally
planned.
5.02  After the project started, consultants carried out a study to identify ten other priority provincial
ports, as called for in the SAR, and, in the event, nine were selected, Tabaco, Tacloban, Pasacao,
Calbayog, Ozamiz, Dumaguete, Ormoc, Masbate and San Fernando. After the completion of detailed
design, the contracts were let and the first started in January 1990, with the final one starting in June
1992. San Fernando was cancelled because the devastating earthquake that struck the area in July
1990 severely damaged the port structures and reconstruction was the only alternative. PPA decided to
undertake the necessary repairs and improvements using its own funds. Like the first contracts, these
eight also went somewhat slowly for many of the same reasons as before, and PPA granted time
extensions on all of them. All were successfully completed by the end of the project on 31 December
1993, after the loan closing date had been extended for one year.
5.03  While the civil works were in progress, the technical assistance and training components were
also being carried out, at least in part. The MIS study had entered into Phase II when it was stopped
by the Commission on Audit (COA) because they claimed that it conflicted with a government-wide
study that they were carrying out for integrating all government MIS systems. The study was later
abandoned, although PPA did implement some of the recommendations in respect of manual operation



PCR - Part 1                                4                   Provincial Ports Project - Ln. 2823-PH
of the system. The Fire-fighting and Tariff Rationalisation Studies were completed, but the Water
Supply, Communications and Port Operations Studies were cancelled as they were either considered
to be unnecessary or because approval for them could not be obtained from government. Training did
not proceed as planned because the govemrnment imposed a ban on overseas training, so only some of
the training that could be done domestically was carried out and even that was not entirely
satisfactory.
6. Project Results
6.01  The main component of this project, the civil works, was successfully completed after
considerable delays and after the loan closing date had been extended by one year. The results have
been beneficial to the inter-island and international freight and passenger traffic through the provision
of improved facilities for handling both cargo and passengers. Workmanship was generally adequate
and, because of the reduction in value of the Peso in relation to the US Dollar during the period of the
project, more work was carried out for about the same US Dollar cost as that forecast at appraisal.
6.02 Generally, the rate of increase of cargo throughput at the twelve original ports has been double
the rate assumed in the appraisal forecast. As costs have not increased, project benefits have been
taken to be a very conservative 10% over the appraisal estimates. The post-project Economic Rate of
Return (ERR) comes out to be a very satisfactory 32%, even though the build up of benefits was
slower than forecast because of delays in completing the port works.
6.03 The results of the MIS Study were disappointing. While the study was competently carried out
and the recommendations of the first phase were sound, the decision by COA to stop any further work
and the implementation of the recommendations was a retrograde step as the study had little in
common with the one being carried out by COA. The benefits of an improved MIS are now being
withheld from PPA.
6.04 Similarly, the training component was not very successful, partly because of the government
ban on overseas travel for study purposes, but also because of a lack of conviction by PPA that the
planned training was appropriate and necessary, which translated itself into disinterest and inaction.
As a result, only a limited amount of domestic training was carried out.
6.05 The Fire Fighting Study was successfully completed, but the major recommendations were, in
PPA' s opinion, too expensive to be implemented at this time and were shelved for consideration in the
future. Some minor improvements to the fire fighting systems were, however, carried out.
6.06 The Port Tariff Study was successfully completed, but its recommendations were not readily
acceptable to PPA. After consulting with the Bank, some action on adjusting tariffs was taken.
6.07 The study and detailed engineering carried out in respect to a follow up project provided a
sound basis for the preparation of the Maritime Improvement Project now being prepared.
6.08 Financially, PPA has succeeded in remaining profitable despite a revaluation of its assets to a
more realistic level and the resultant increase in depreciation to be taken into account.



PCR - Part I                                 5                  Provincial Ports Project - Ln. 2823-PH
7. Project Sustainability
7.01  It is expected that the economic benefits generated by the project will be sustained over the life
of the port rehabilitation works provided traffic volume continues at or above the present level.
7.02 In order to bring itself up to date technologically, PPA must be allowed to implement a
meaningful MIS improvement related to its commercial port operations.
7.03  The main risk to the sustainability of the project benefits is that inadequate provisions are made
for routine and periodic maintenance in future years or that the economy falls again into recession and
traffic levels fall appreciably. The risk of inadequate maintenance has been addressed, at least in part,
by PPA, which has instituted a more rigourous system of inspection and maintenance. It is expected
that the proposed Maritime Improvement Project would also address some of the more serious
maintenance problems at major ports.
8. Bank Performance
8.01  The project was well prepared and regularly supervised. The scope of the project was
appropriate and addressed several components that needed urgent attention, notably the deterioration
of port facilities and the improvement of the management information flow and in the level of training
of staff.
8.02 Surprisingly, despite the upheavals of successive reorganizations within the Bank, some
continuity of staff was achieved on the financial side, but, on the other hand, there was an undesirably
rapid turnover of port engineers, 5 different ones being involved with the project over its lifetime.
The success of the project can be attributed more to the good working relationship between the Bank
and PPA than to the continuty of staff provided by the Bank, which was particularly poor on the
technical side.
8.03 The main lessons that should be learned by the Bank are:
(a)   more rigourous prequalification of contractors must be carried out in the future,
especially in relation to their financial resources and capability for completing the
works successfully;
(b)   the Bank should formulate stronger measures for ensuring that useful, acceptable and
needed training components are built into the project the project and that they are
executed in a timely manner; and
(c)   constant reorganisations create havoc with the efficient supervision of projects and run
counter to the Bank's avowed intent of serving its Borrowers better; greater efforts
should be made to maintain good continuity in supervision staff.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01 The Borrower, as represented by PPA, the executing agency, generally performed very well
during the preparation and implementation of the project. However the implementation of the training
programme, despite constant urging by the Bank, was left until too late in the project period and, as a
result, not very much was achieved.
9.02 The main lessons to be learned by the Borrower, in addition to Para 8.03(a) above, are:

(a)   the training programme must be properly planned to include only that training which is
needed and wanted and it should then be energetically implemented at the planned time
and not left until the last moment;
(b)   more resources devoted to maintenance and improved implementation of maintenance
planning and operations would reduce the need for periodically rehabilitating
deteriorated port facilities.
10. Project Relationship
10.01 Relations between the Bank and PPA were good during the project, and despite the Bank
maintaining a relatively poor level of continuity in its project supervision staff, it was possible to
develop a close working relationship with PPA's project staff.
11. Consulting Services, Contractors and Suppliers
11.01 Foreign consultants were employed to carry out:
(a)   the supervision of construction of the works and subsequently the detailed design of the
additional port works by providing technical assistance experts to work with a local
consultant and advise the PMO;
(b)   the detailed design, cost estimates, drawings and tender documents for the initial stages
of the Maritime Improvement Project;
(c)   the MIS Study; and
(d)   the Port Tariff Rationalisation Study.
All carried out their responsibilities satisfactorily.
11.02 The Fire Fighting Study was satisfactorily carried out by the Manila Fire Department.
11.03 The civil works contracts were carried out by a large number of foreign and domestic
contractors. Most performed adequately, though many were hampered by inadequate financial
resources. Two contractors failed to complete their contracts and were terminated.
11.04 Equipment was procured from a number of suppliers. All performed satisfactorily.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.01 The SAR provided a useful framework for all parties during project implementation.
12.02 The Loan Agreement was well prepared and served its purpose adequately. All covenants were
appropriate.
12.03 Information for the PCR was provided by PPA and Bank staff, together with project
documentation, Bank files and supervision reports.

6.     Project Results
A.  Economic Impact
Overall appraisal estimate of ERR for the project        = 27%
Overall post-project evaluation of ERR for the project   =  32%
The Appraisal Report estimated the ERR to be 27% for the entire project, based on an annual growth in cargo
traffic which averaged out at about 5% per year. Port cargo traffic figures collected during the currency of the
project have shown an average rise of about 11.5% per year, with some ports showing losses and others
marking up big gains. Despite this large increase in traffic, ship waiting time has not increased and service
times have been cut. Because of the increased number of ports rehabilitated under the project, recurrent
maintenance costs have been doubled. The benefits accruing to the project have been increased by a very
conservative 10% over the estimated benefits, levelling off after the year 2002, when it is considered that the
present facilities will be fully utilised. Based on these conservative assumptions, the ERR is calculated to be a
very satisfactory 32%.

B.  Financial Impact
The estimated consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 shows that PPA has been able to maintain a
solid financial position. For the year ended on December 31, 1993, the debt to equity ratio was 26/74 and the
current ratio was 1.5:1. These results compare favorably to the results reported for the year ended in 1987 where
the debt to equity ratio was 40/60 and the liquidity, as measured by the current ratio was 5:1.
In 1991, PPA revalued all of its fixed assets to reflect their estimated replacement cost. This revaluation
increased the total fixed assets by 60%. In addition, in 1990 PPA adopted a policy to reflect the foreign
denominated debt at current exchange rates which resulted in a 30% increase in the level of long term debt.
During the six years ended in 1993, PPA's debt repayments exceeded its new borrowings by P166 million.
However, during this time, the value of the Peso declined sharply resulting in a revaluation of the foreign debt
and an increase in the level of total long term debt by P1,302 million.
Over the six years ended in 1993, operating revenue increased by 100% or 12.2% annually. The largest growth
was recorded in the privatized container facility where the revenue grew from P120 million in 1988 to P436
million in 1993. Operating expenses grew more rapidly during this period at 115% or 13.6% annually due
primarily to large (22%) increases in personal services, administrative costs (14%), and depreciation on
operating fixed assets (10%). The result was that the operating ratio declined from 55% in 1987 to 59% in 1993.
The ratio was below the agreed upon level of 65% in each of the years except 1991 when the ratio was 69%.
During this period, PPA had no tariff increases, so all of the increase in operating revenue was from increases in
traffic levels. However, with the operating fixed assets being revalued effective in 1991, and no tariff increases,
the return on net fixed assets in operation (ROA) declined from 8% in 1987, to 11.7% in 1990, to 6.4% in 1991,
and 4.6% in 1993. With a tariff increase in 1994, the ROA should increase in 1994.
Cash generated from operations was also satisfactory over the period with the requirement for PPA to finance at
least 30% of its capital spending from internally generated sources being met in each of the six years.
