PHILIPPINE
PROVINCIAL PORTS PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transport System
1.1       The Philippines transport system is composed of about 740 km of
railways over 161,000 km of roads, 131 national ports, 265 private ports, and
some 400 loading :oints aid 219 airports, of which 82 are national and 137
private. The system is predominantly bimodal, with road and sea transport
gene-ally complementing rather than competing with each other. Road transport
handles 90% of the country's passenger movement and 65% of freight movement,
while sea transport handles 7% of passengers and 35% of freight. Railways and
air transport handle only relatively small volumes of passenger and .reight
traffic. Due to the development patterns of towns along road corridors and
the Government's policy of extending the feeder roads to the hinterlands, road
transport is likely to continue as the dominant mode of transport in the fore-
seenble future.
1.2       During the 1970s, the transport sector grew at about 9% p.a., faster
thar. the GDP growth of about 6%. During the economic recession from 1980-84,
the sector's contribution to the economy declined to about 5%, as both it and
the GDP experienced a decline. Despite this, Government transport outlays
have remained at a level of about P 4.0 billion p.a. Between 1977 and 1981,
total outlays amounted to P 18 billion. The National Transportation Planning
Project (NTFP) estimated the 5-year (1983-87) capital investment needs to be
P 23.82 billion, principally in highways. A recently updated (October 1986)
Public Investment Program (PIP) proposed P 65.7 billion for 1986-92 for infra-
structure investment which aims at supporting the economic recovery program
and agro-industrial development. The highway subsector usually gets the
biggest share or about 80%, followed by the ports subsector with 14%.
B. Transport Planning
1.3       The Department of Transport and Communications (DOTC) is responsible
for transport policy, regulation and administration. However, planning for
the transport sector is the joint responsibility of DOTC, for all modes other
than highways, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), for
national and barangay roads, and the Department of Local Government (DLG), for
provincial, city and municipal roads. DPWH is also responEible for construc-
tion and maintenance of roads and bridges in the country. The National
Economic and, Development Authority (NEDA) plays a coordinating role in the
planning process through the National Transportation Planning Project (NTPP)
group which has representatives from NEDA, DOTC, DPWH, the Philippine National
Railways (PNR), the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) and the Maritime Industry
Authority (MARINA).



- 2 -
1.4       NTPP prepares five-year transport programs listing priority projects
by mode and their investment requirements. It submits each program to the
National Investment Committee for consideration and inclusion in the Public
Investment Program (PIP). The transpart program is updated semiannually to
accommodate the interim changes.
C. Transport Issues in the Maritime Subsector
1.5       Some of the issues facing the maritime subsector are as follows:
(a) regulatory policies on route licensing;
(b)  the age of liner ships and a poor safety record;
(c) customs involvement in domestic trade; and
(d) infrastructure maintenance.
1.6       Regulatory policies for domestic liner ships relate to route
franchising and tariffs. However, the policies appear to be only partially
enforced. A recent NTPP study on shipping regulation has pointed out the
inefficiencies of the regulatory system, which has resulted in high tariffs
and restriction of market entry for small shipping companies. The study
recommends economic deregulation in the shipping industry. MARINA, the agency
in charge of shipping regulation, has lately allowed the shipping lines to
determine themselves which line would operate which route and then formally
approved the agreed arrangements. The Bank supports steps towards economic
deregulation of shipping. The Government should, however, retain the power to
monitor and regulate shipping saiety and to intervene to prevent predatory
competition. A transport sector review by the Bank during 1987 will address
these matters further.
1.7       The average age of vessels belonging to the top ten domestic
shipping companies is between 20 and 25 years. Although the Philippine Coast
Guard (PCG) is responsible for the registration and inspection of ships,
safety standards are not strictly enforced, resulting in a high incidence of
accidents and casualties. The GovernmenL is aware of this problem and
considers the rejuvenation of the inter-island fleet as one of the priorities
in the maritime industry. MARINA is attempting to find appropriate financing
channels to attract shipowners to finance their ship improvements. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government would, by June 30,
1988, develop, and thereafter implement, a plan of action to improve safety of
operations in domestic shipping
1.8       Customs clearance procedures for international trade are complicated
and time consuming. Furthermore, for domestic trade, it appears that the
Bureau of Customs is unnecessarily involved in ships' clearance which disrupts
cargo handling operations. During negotiations, agreement wa3 reached that
the Government would, by June 30, 1988, complete a review of the role of the
Bureau of Customs in domestic shipping arnd cargo clearances and based on the
results of such review produce a plan of action satisfactory to the Bank to
facilitate domestic shipping and cargo clearances.



- 3 -
1.9       The present condition of many port facilities is not good.  During
the economic and financial difficulties in the early 1980s, insufficient funds
ware released by the Government for maintenance expenditures, which has
resulted in deterior&tion of port infrastructure and equipment. Problems
include insufficient dredging, dilapidated piers, badly maintained access
roads, and lack of lighting and communication systems. Considering the
importance of infrastructure niaintenance fot efficient port operation, it is
important to insure tha.t PPA will have the necessary budget to carry out the
required maintenance works to arrest further deterioration of port infra-
structure (para. 2.4).
D. Bank Involvement in the Sector and the Subsector
1.10      One of the Bank's principal objectives in transport sector lending
in the Philippines has been, and continues to be, to improve the infra-
structure of the country. The Bank has also assisted in strengthening the
institutions dealing with the sector, especially in establishing an appro-
priate framework for planning and policy development. As a result, an
important component in several recent loans has been technical assistance for
national transport planning. Continued assistance in attaining these
objectives is needed in the context of the country's constrained economic
conditions. The Bank also expects to continue assisting the Government in
formulating sector priorities and investment programs in the context of
reviewing the Public Investment Program.
1.11      The Bank Group has assisted the transport sector since 1961,
starting with the First Port Loan (290-PH), which amounted to US$8.5 million
and financed procurement of dredging equipment. Since then, additional
projects including two ports, one shipping, five highways and two rural roads
improvement projects, have been processed. The total lending for highways and
rural roals projects has been US$517 million and for ports and shipping
projects US$101.6 million, of which US$81.6 million has financed port
infrastructure improvements under three completed ports projects.
1.12      The Bank has thus had a long association with the Philippine ports
subsector and was instrumental in the creation of PPA. It is important that
the Bank maintain this close collaboration with PPA now that the organization
has completed work in the major ports and is moving to improve secondary and
tertiary ports in the provinces. This is in line with the new Government's
and the Bank's focus on alleviating the conditions in some of the more
underdeveloped areas of the country.
1.13      The three completed ports projects have financed, among other
things, dredging equipment, assistance in the expansion of two imiportant ports
in Mindanao and the construction of container handling facilities in the ports
of Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, Iloilo and Zamboanga. The First Shipping Project was
intended to help modernize the old inter-island fleet and to improve its
safety standards, and increase its efficiency. However, the objectives were
achieved only partially. The project changed from financing mostly secondhanl
ships for established companies to construction of new ships for recently
created companies. The safety standards of the existing fleet were thus not



- 4 -
improved and the introduction of new ships resulted in some idle capacity in
the fleet. There was also a problem with the Development Bank of the
Philippines as financial intermediary. The Project Performance Audit Report
(PPAR No. 4910, January 1984) of the nroject commented that a thorough review
should have been carried out at the time ot appraisal to find an alternative
financial intermediary. This could have kept project implementation closer to
the original objectives.
1.14      The Project Performance Audkt Report (PPAR No. 5698, June 7, 1985)
for the Second Ports Project observed that facilities at some project ports
were underutilized. For instance, PPA storage facilities were not used in
some ports because of high storage charges and because the major shipping
companies had their own storage areas and sheds on or adjacent to the ports.
The audit commented th'at, in light of private competition, PPA should reduce
storage charges and have more modest storage facilities. The Third Ports
Project (Loan 1855-PH) was completed satisfactorily in late 1986. The
propoqed port project includes expansion of six ports and lhabilitation/
maintenance of 16 other ports. The technical assistance component would
further strengthen PPA's institutional capability in both the financial and
technical areas. Because of the importance of shipping to an archipelago
country like the Philippines, it ib also important that the Bank assist with
improvement/development of the maritime sector. The project would provide a
vehicle to reduce barriers to domestic trade in the form of unnecessary
customs procedures and to improve safety of ships in inter-island traffic.
II. THE PHILIPPINE PORTS AUTHORITY
A. Organization
2.1       PPA is a corporate body created by presidential decree in 1974.  An
amending decree in 1975 widened PPA's powers and functions, which include the
authority to develop, maintain, operate, supervise and regulate services and
facilities of national ports in the Philippines. The Minister of Transport
and Communication is the Chairman. PPA, iccording to its charter, is empow-
ered inter alia to fix rates and charges, determine terms and conditions of
service for its employees that are broadly consistent with civil service rules
and regulations, adopt recurrent income and expenditure budgets and capital
expenditure budgets, invest surplus funds in government securities, and borrow
money after consultation with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and
with the approval of the President. Dues, defined in the enaoling decree as
including harbor fees, tonnage and wharfage dues, berthing charges, port dues,
and any other dues or fees imposed by virtue of existing law or the decree,
are increased or decreased by the President, on PPA's recommendation, to
reflect the costs of providing the services.
2.2       PPA is a decentralized organization divided into a headquarters or a
central office and nineteen Port Management Units (PMUs). The PMUs serve as
the operating divisions of PPA. Each of the PMUs is located at a major
national port and each exercises control over the neighboring minor national
ports. in total, there are 131 ports within PPA. The 265 private ports are



- e -
specialized cargo handling facilities owned by large enterprises such as oil
and mining companies.
2.3        In November 1977, Presidential Decree No. 1234 (PD 1234) resulted in
fundamental changes to PPA's financial autonomy by requiring PPA to: (i) remit
all revenues to the national treasury for crediting to a Special Account in
the Government's general fund; (ii) obtain, in advance, quarterly budget
allotment authorization from the Government's Budget Commission to enable PPA
funds to be released by the national treasury to meet recurrent and capital
expenditures; and (iii) maintain financial records in accordance with
Government budget-accounting rules. The application of these regulations has
frequently resulted in the Budget Commission reducing PPA's spending powers
below the levels approved by PPA's own board. For the first few years, the
application of this decree caused few serious problems for PPA. However, when
the Philippines began to encounter economic and financial difficulties in the
early 1980s, the Government started to release less funds than was required
for operations and the capital investment program. Since cuts in the
operating budget primarily affect maintenance, port infrastructure and
equipment began to deteriorate dnd the harbors and approach channels silted-up
to the point where rehabilitation and dredging work is now required. Also,
since 1982 no new releases have been made for investment projects, including
foreign-assisted ones. This has led to temporary stoppage on all projects
except the Bank financed Third Ports Project, for which local counterpart
funds were available from prior years savings. PPA was also able to gain some
relief from these budgetary constraints by using releases for capital projects
issued before 1982 and from savings realized under those projects. They were
also able to make use of funds which they had accrued prior to December 31,
1977. However, all of these savings were exhausted in early 1985 and, as a
result, many local contractors were not paid until the budget was finally
approved in November 1985. The Budget Commission did not reduce PPA's 1986
capital-expenditure budget and has released funds for capital expenditures
throughout the year despite the fact that the budget has not been formally
approved.
2.4       On April 13, 1987, an executive order (EO 159) was signed which
exempts PPA from PD 1234 and allows it to operate as an independent corpora-
tion which not only has control over its operations but over its financial
resources as well. The exemption from PD 1234 allows PPA to make the
expenditures necessary to properly maintain its infrastructure and equipment
and to make those capital investments deemed essential by its board of
directors. During negotiations, PPA agreed to furnish the Bank by February 1
each year a draft of PPA's annual expenditure plan for comment, and to furnish
by August 1 each year the final plan to the Bank.

2.5        PPA's board of directors is composed of seven directors, five of
whom are cabinet ministers.  The private sector is represented by one direc-
tor, appointed by the President.  PPA's general manager is ex-officio 'ice
chairman of the board of directors. The general manager exercises day-to-day
control over the organization. Chart 1 presents PPA's organization. The
general manager is assisted by assistant general managers for operations; fi-



- 6 -
nance, legal and administration; and p1anning and engineering. He is also
supported by 19 managers of the PMUs, a permanent staff of approximately 1,960
and a staff of 674 casual employees. PPA'S management has done a commendable
job of operating the country's national port system during a period of very
poor economic conditions and has developed PPA into a basically efficient
organization.
2.6       As a result o; a hiring f.eeze that was in effect from 1983 to 1985
the number of permanent employees declined by 165 or 8% from 1982 levels. The
freeze not only prevented the hiring of new people but also prevented the
internal promotion n'eded to fill vacancies created by departing employees.
Consequently, many PPA officials perform duties at one level but receive the
compensation for a lower one. in addition, there are many casual
(nonpermanent, full-time) employees performing the duties that should be done
by permanent staff. PPA recognized these problems and, starting in 1986, has
been attempting to correct the staffing inequities by formally confirming the
staff in the positions in which they are actually working.
2.7       The Port Personnel Training Center (PPTC) was established in 1975
and is performiing adequately. The school has geared its programs towards pro-
fessionalizing the port labor force in order to improve cargo handling
services. PPTC has provided training courses in the areas of Port Operations,
Equipment, Maintenance and Operations, Port Equipment Maintenance and
Management Training (for supervisors, checkers, and dockworkers). PPTC is
been providing about 100 courses a year with 15-20 participants per cour '
since it started.
2.8       One of the services PPTC currently provides is accrediting port
equipment operators to insure that only qualified and accredited equipment
operators are allowed to operate within the port area. For this purpose, all
existing equipment operators are subject to the test and accreditation program
and only those who pass them are authorized to operate cargo handling equip-
ment. PPTC courses are accredited with the Asian Institute for Distance
Education (AIDE), thereby contributing to the professionalization of the port
industry. Furthermore, AIDF, in coordination with PPA, is offering a
baccaleaurate degree/associate degree in port administration. PPA iaas also
trained various local and foreign participants from Kenya, India, and Malaysia
in the management of container terminal operations under a WNDP/UNCTAD
project.
C. Operation and Maintenance
2.9       PPA is directly responsible for operating the national ports and
oversees the planning, development and operation of all other ports in the
Philippines. PPA operates its 131 national ports through 19 Port Management
Units (PMU) consisting of 23 base ports. Each of these base ports operates
.everal subports. Each of the PMUs are primarily landlords responsible for
the construction and mp"ntenance of the port infrastructure and for dredging
the approach channels. Loading/unloading of ships are handled by stevedoring
companies while the storage of goods is handled by storage companies
(arrastre). Both the stevedoring and arrastre companies for each port are



- 7 -
chosen by bidding and a two year contract is then signed between the companies
and PPA. The stevedoring and arrastre companies are responsible for providing
the necessary cargo handling equipment and its maintenance. The only
exceptions are the container terminals where PPA has purchased the heavy
equipment such as quay cranes and transtainers and leased it to the
stevedoring and arrastre companies.
2.10       Passenger and cargo traffic flows are often mingled at the berths
which lead to less than the desirable levels of efficiency and safety.
Separation of the passenger traffic from cargo traffic can be accomplished by
reorganization of the land area behind the berths. During negotiations,
agreement was reached that PPA would establish procedures, by June 30, 1988,
to separate passenger and cargo traffic in order to improve port safety and
efficiency. At the same time the role of PPA in port operations should be
reviewed and in particular the current revenue collecting procedures which
rely mainly on reports from the stevedoring and arrastre companies without
adequate means of checking by PPA. During negotiations, agreement was reached
that PPA would develop a plan, by December 31, 1987, which will address PPA's
role in port operations and review the current revenue collecting procedures.
2.11      Maintenance of civil works is carried out by PPA through maintenance
contractors, but only when PPA has the budget for it. The PMUs are respon-
sible for reporting the need for maintenance of civil works and other infra-
structure such as water supply, power supply, sewerage, et'-. PPA prepares the
designs and requests for the budget to carry out the requi.ed work. Lately,
budget allocations have been constrained and maintenance has had to be
deferred to a certain extent. The proposed project addresses the most
urgently required maintenance needs in the ports.  The stevedoring and
arrastre companies are responsible for maintaining their own equipment.
However, since their contracts are short (only two years at a time) little new
equipment is provided because the revenues in this short time would not be
enough to pay for the equipment and there is no guarantee that the company
will be hired again. PPA plans to increase the contract time to five years in
order to address this problem. During rnegotiations, agreement was reached
that PPA would prepare an inventory of additional rehabilitation/maintenance
needs by December 31, 1987, submit an action plan for such work satisfactory
to the Bank, by June 30, 1988 and report on the maintenance activities of the
previous year by March 31, 1989 and each March 31 thereafter.
D. Traffic
2.12       In 1981, the Philippines' ports handled a total of 67.8 million tons
of cargo, 50% domestic and 50% foreign (Table 1). The traffic increased to
72.1 million tons in 1982 but declincd until 1986 when a slight growth of 1.3%
was projected.
2.13      The overall traffic downtrend in the past five years (1981-85) has
been a reflection of a deprcssed economy during this period. Based on the
recovery program planned for the next five years, the economy is expected to
grow at an annual rate of 5%. PPA conservatively projects overall port
traffic to grow from 62.9 nmillion tons in 1986 to 73 million tons in 1990, or
an average annual rate of 4%.



2.14      About 40% of the cargo traffic in 1985 was handled by PPA ports, up
from 37% in 1981. The balance of the traffic was handled by private ports.
Of the total traffic handled by PPA ports, about 75% was domestic and 25%
foreign. For private ports, 60% was foreign with 40% domestic (Table 1).
2.15      Containerized cargo grew modestly between 1981 and 1983 at PPA
ports. Growth declined in 1984 as did other cargo movements, but was up again
in 1985 at 7.49 million tons. Private ports started to handle containerized
cargo in 1984 with 72,000 tons and increased to 292,000 tons in 1985.
2.16      The passenger traffic, shown in Table 1, exhibited a pattern more or
less similar to the growth trend of the economy and of the cargo traffic, i.e.
a slight increase of about three million passengers from 1981 to 1983, then
declining to 16.7 million in 1985, just above the 1981 level of 16.2 million
passengers.
E. Systems
Management Information System
2.17      PPA's present Management Information System (MIS) is primarily a
manual system that provides a very limited amount of statistical and cost
related data. As part of the Third Ports Project, a MIS was designed for PPA
but it was never implemented because of a national directive in 1983 to limit
expenditures. The system was designed to be computerized and consisted of the
following components: vessel monitoring system, cargo monitoring system, port
statistics module and a billing and collection system. As part of the
proposed project, technical assistance will be provided to complete the imple-
mentation of the above system. The system design will need to be modified to
reflect new technology in computer hardware and to enable PPA to implement the
system in modules.
Accounting Systems
2.18      PPA's financial organization is divided into two primary divisions--
treasury and controllership. The financial systems utilized by both divisions
are generally good. Despite the fact that the systems are basically manual,
the quality and timeliness of the information provided to management are
acceptable. The treasury division maintains a centralized cash collection
system with collections deposited daily into a centralized account. Funds in
excess of current needs are invested in Government securities before being
transferred to PPA's special account at the national treasury. The treasury
division is also responsible for asset management, which includes establishing
proper levels of property insurance and maintaining the manual fixed asset
inventory system. PPA's financial reporting and cost accounting systems were
devised and introduced in 1978 as part of the Second Ports Project. Financial
statements are prepared manually by the PMUs and sent to the headquarters for
consolidation. Actual vs plan financial statements are then presented to PPA
management by the 20th of the oollowing month. PPA is planning to computerize
the financial reporting system using local consultants and internally
generated funds. The costing system is very limited and provides relatively



- 9 -
little detailed cost information. The proposed project would provide for
technical assistance to develop and implement, by June 1989, a new cost
accounting system that will be compatible with the computerized cargo and
vessel monitoring, port statistics, and billing and collection systems
developed in 1983 as part of the Third Ports Project. The development and
implementation of these systems will provide PPA with a comprehensive and
flexible management information system.
F. Budget, Accounting and Auditing
2.19      PPA prepares detailed annual operating and investment budgets in
commercial format which are approved by the board. In addition, since
January 1, 1978, PPA has prepared cash budgets in conformity with Government
budgetary regulations. Quarterly cash budgets are required in order to obtain
Budget Commission sanction before PPA funds will be released from the special
account with the national treasury.
2.20      PPA's governing decree provides for an annual audit of the
authority's accounts by the Government's Commission on Audit. The Commission
has promptly and satisfactorily audited these accounts since PPA's creation.
PPA will provide the Bank with certified financial statements and the report
and other material issued by the auditor within six months after the end of
eaLcI fiscal year.
2.21      PPA operates an internal control department, the head of which
reports directly to the general manager. This department not only reviews
financial procedures but also PPA's operations and provides valuable
information for the general manager's decision-making.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.1       The proposed project was identified during preparation of the
Philippines Third Ports Project (Loan 1855-PH). A component of that project
was a feasibility study, carried out by consultants for PPA, for 16 secondary
ports in Southern Luzon and adjacent islands, and the Visayas and Mindanao.
These ports were selected as priorities from a long list of ports suggested by
NTPP. It was determined that several of them, called "development ports,"
would require some expansion to be able to meet the expected volume and
composition of trade while others, called "rehabilitation ports,"' could be
upgraded without major expenditures. Of the 16 ports studied, 6 development
ports and 6 rehabilitation ports have been selected for the proposed project
as having the highest priority. The selection was based primarily on the
identification of cargo and passenger traffic growth patterns and shortfalls
between existing berth capacities and the facilities expected to be required
by 1990. The development ports are: Calapan, San Jose, Tagbilaran, Nasipit,
Surigao and Pulupandan. The rehabilitation ports are: Bauan, Cagayan de Oro,
Sta. Cruz, Legaspi, Tabaco, and Pulauan. As part of the Third Ports Project,
these selected ports were studied further and final designs and tender



- 10 -
documents prepared. The continued priority of these ports has been recon-
firmed. In addition, ten ports to be identified for rehabilitation/
maintenance will be included in the project after consultation with the
Bank. This will enable the project to respond in a flexible way to additional
rehabilitation/maintenance needs.
B. Objectives
3.2       The objective of the proposed project is to strengthen the port
institution in the Philippines and expand the capacity of the port system by
(a) improvements to the six development ports and the six rehabilitation
ports, as recommended by the port feasibility studies, and the rehabilitation
of ten additional ports to be selected later; and (b) technical assistance for
project implementation, financial management, training and studies needed for
further development of the port system in the country.
C. Project Description
3.3       The main project elements are:
(a) Development Ports
Expansion of facilities at the six developmint ports, Calapan, San
Jose, Tagbilaran, Nasipit, Surigao and Pulupandan as given in Annex 1.
(b) Rehabilitation Ports
Rehabilitation/maintenance of existing facilities at the ports of
Bauan, Cagayan de Oro, Sta. Cruz, Legaspi, Tabaco and Pulauan, as
given in Annex 1. Ten more ports would be prepared under the
project for financing from the proposed loan. These additional
ports would be selected according to criteria reviewed and approved
by the Bank.
(c) Equipment
Procurement of equipment for communications, water supply and
sewerage, firefighting and MIS.
(d) Technical Assistance to PPA
Provision of technical assistance to PPA for construction
supervision, MIS, feasibilizy studies for future port projects,
special studies, and train.ng (Annex 2).
(e) Training of Personnel Working in Ports
Provision of training of personnel in port planning, design,
management, operations, and finar-ce. Three to six week workshops/
seminars will be prepared by expatriate consultants to train staff
in port engineering, port intermodal transport and port operations
and management (Annex 2).

D. Cost Estimates
3.4       The total cost of the project is estimated at P 933 million (US$46.6
million equivalent) with a direct and indirect foreign exchange component of
P 530 million (US$26.5 million). Project cost estimates are given in Table
2. The project costs are summarized as follows:

Notes:    (1)  Exchange rate: P 20 = 1 US$.
(2)  Technicai assistance is excluded from the calculation of price
contingencies.
(3)  Identifiable taxes and duties are about P 56.8 million
(US$2.84 million).
3.5       Cost estimates for civil works are based on bid prices received and
unit prices for civil works currently prevailing in the Philippines and
abroad. Estimates are in March 31, 1987 prices and include provision for both
physical and price contingencies. Physical contingencies have been included
at 12% across the board. Price contingencies for local costs have been
included at 5.5% for 1987 and 5.0% per year for 1988 through 1995. Foreign
costs assume an increase of 3.0% for 1987, 1.0% per year for 1988 through 1990
and 3.5% per year for 1991 and thereafter. Technical assistance is expected
to involve 240 man-months of expatriate expertise including some 150 man-
months needed for construction supervision.

E. Financing Plan
3.6       Financing of the proposed project will be as follows:
Source of finance                   Local                  Foreign            Total
-------------- (US$ million) ---------------
IBRD Loan                             5.48                 26.52              32.00
PPA                                  14.64                   -                 14.64
Total                          20.12                 26.52               46.64
The Bank loan will be made to the Government and will be used to finance 73%
of the total project costs, excluding taxes and duties. This is justified
based on the social/regional impact of the project, which would reduce
regional disparities, stimulate production in underdeveloped areas, increase
employment opportunities and provide better access to surrounding markets.
PAA will finance the remainder of the costs. The Government will on-lend the
loan proceeds to PPA on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan under a
subsidiary loan agreement which would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
PPA will bear the foreign ex.change risk and the commitment charges. The
subsidiary loan agreement will allow PPA, as the implementing agency, to
withdraw the required loan funds directly.  There would also be a project
agreement between PPA and the Bank.
F. Project Implementation and Procurement
3.7       Detailed engineering and bid documents for the six developmcnt ports
and six rehabilitation ports have been completed and bids have bIen
received. It was agreed during appraisal that PPA would carry out the project
works since PPA's involvement in the Third Ports Project has demonstratLd its
ability to do so. During negotiations, agreement was reached that a project
executive committee shall be maintained to oversee the implementation of the
project. The project director will be assisted by consultants financed under
the technical aasistance category of the proposed loan to supervise project
implementation. These consultants will be appointed by July 1, 1987 in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that PPA would develop details of the proposed training with regards
to subjects, staff, timing and type of training by September 30, 1987.
Agreement was also reached that PPA would select ten additional rehabilitation
ports according co selection criteria satisfactory to the Bank.
3.8       The project civil works are expected to be executed under a single
contract for each port. Procurement will be carried out according to the
following table:

/a   Figures in parenthesis represent amounts to be financed through the
proposed loan, inclusive of contingencies.
Civil works contracts will be awarded under international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with Bank Guidelines except for contracts estimated to
cost less than US$3.0 million, which will be awarded in accordance with local
competitive bidding procedures (LCB) which are acceptable to the Bank. Inter-
national contractors are allowed to participate in all LCB for Bank-financed
projects. The main packages ranging from US$1.4 million to US$6.0 million are
for the six development ports of Calapan, San Jose, Tagbilaran, Nasipit,
Surigao and Pulupandan. Sixteen more packages will be for the rehabilitation
ports ranging from US$0.3 million to US$1.3 million. The last package will be
for import of steel sheet piles, steel piles and fenders for all the ports
(US$3.0 million). Equipment will be procured through ICB. Qualifying domestic
suppliers of goods will receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the
CIF price or the import duty, whichever is lower. All civil works contracts
esr;mated to cost over US$1.5 million (representing about 90% of total
contract volume), as well as all equipment contracts will be subject to the
Bank's prior review of procurement documentation and proposed contract
awards. The works are expected to be completed by December 1991 (Annex 3).
Expatriate consultants will be appointed in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines to assist PPA in carrying out the various studies and project
supervision.



- 14 -
G. Disbursement
3.9       The loan proceeds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) Civil works: 67% of the total expenditures;
(b) Goods: 100% of the CIF cost of all goods procured directly from
abroad, 65% of the actual cost of imported goods procured locally,
and 100% of the ex-factory cost of goods manufactured locally; and
(c) Technical assistan:e and training: 100% of total expenditures for
consulting and techiical assistance services and training.
To facilitate disbursements, a special account may be established with an
initial deposit of up to US$2.5 million, equivaLent to about three months of
expected expenditures. Disbursements for contracts costing less than
US$200,000 equivalent each would be made on the basis of statements of
expenditure (SOEs). Documents supporting the SOEs would not be submitted to
the Bank but would be kept by PPA and made available for review by the Bank'.3
supervision missions. Disbursements by the Bank are expected to be completed
by December 31, 1992. The ebtimated schedule of quarterly disbursements
(Table 3) is based on the assumption that the proposed loan would become
effective by July 1987. Although the average implementation period for ports
project in East Asia and Pacific is about 8-9 years according to actual dis-
bursement profiles, the proposed project is most likely to be completed in a
shorter period based on experience from the Third Ports Project in the
Philippines and also due to the advanced preparation and simpler nature of the
proposed project works.
H. Environmental Aspects
3.10      The project will not affect the existing ecology of the ports since
it involves modest expansion or rehabilitation of already existing
facilities. The designs incorporate safeguards appropriate in minimizing
pollution. Dredged material will be dumped in deep sea areas where it will
not affect fish life, coral reef or any other part of the environment.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Traffic Analysis
4.1       Traffic at the twelve already selected ports included in the project
is shown in Table 4. Until the economic recession started in late 1983,
traffic at all ports showed a steady increase averaging 6.5% annually during
the preceding five year period. By 1985, however, traffic had dropped, on
average, to the 1981 level, with the ports of San Jose, Surigao and Tabaco
posting the greatest losses. The ports of Nasipit, Calapan and Legaspi have
been relatively unaffected by the recession. The principal commodities
handled have been palay, rice, copra, sugar, banana and calamansi. An
increasing share of the traffic is handled in 10 foot domestic containers.
Passenger traffic at all ports is heavy.



- 15 -
4.2       The traffic forecasts developed by the consultants are based on
straight line regression analysis with modifications for planned economic
developments in the hinterlands of the ports. Traffic at the project ports is
expected to grow at an average rate of 6.7% annually up to 1990. After that,
it has been assumed that traffic would grow at the average overall rate of 4%
for all of PPA's ports.
B. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.3       The principal benefits of the port investments are increased port
capacity, which would result in avoided lighterage operations, avoided inland
highway diversion and avoided congestion, reducing ship waiting time.
Depending on the specific situation at each port, one or more of these
benefits have been considered in the economic evaluation. The estimated
benefits for the project ports is summarized in Table 5.
4.4       The principal beneficiaries will be the people living in the econo-
mically deprived hinterlands of the project ports. The gradual introduction
of ro-ro services, made possible by the proposed project, will enable
increased transport of perishable farm products to existing and new markets.
Improved port facilities shoul  also make the hinterlands more attractive
locations for industry, stimulating employment. However, these and other
development benefits are difficult to estimate and have not been taken into
account in the economic evaluation. The economic returns are thus on the
conservative side.
C. Economic Evaluation
4.5       The feasibility studies carried out in 1984 by the consultants
indicated high economic returns for the proposed port investments and were the
basis for proceeding with the detailed engineering. However, because of the
recent economic recession it was considered necessary to update the economic
evaluation to consider the impact of the decline in traffic on the economic
benefits. The recalculated benefits coupled with the bid prices received for
the port investments yield economic returns ranging from 17% to 86% for the
project ports. Comparing the total project costs with the quantifiable
benefits of the development ports yields an average economic return for the
entire project of 27%.
D. Sensitivity Analysis
4.6       The economic return of the project is most sensitive to changes in
the actual traffic volumes and project costs. A standard sensitivity analysis
has therefore been carried out with the following result:

Pulupandan             62               53                  58                50
San Jose               31               25                  28                23
Calapan                 17              14                  16                 13

4.7       As can be seen when benefits are reduced by 20% and costs are
increased by 10% simultaneously, only one port drops below the 15% cut-off
rate normally used for transport projects in the Philippines. However, the
port maintains an economic return above the 12% opportunity cost of capital.
The overall project maintains a healthy economic return of at least 21% under
these adverse assumptions. t. one-year delay in project completion time does
not materially affect the economic return of the project.
E. Project Risks
4.8       The project poses no particular risk other than unrealized traffic
expectations. It is hoped, however, that the long awaited economic recovery
of the Philippines will soon begin. When this happens, the project will help
the selected ports to cater to the accompanying de'velopment requirements for
increased port capacity.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Introduction
5.1       Since its creation in 1974, PPA has reported a positive operating
income every year, and the organization is currently financially stable. How-
ever, PPA is confronted with some serious financial issues resvlting from the
poor economic conditions in the Philippines. The first relates to the limita-
tions placed on PPA by the Government through PD 1234 (para. 2.3). These
limitations have resulted in reduced expenditures for dredging and repair and
maintenance of the port facilities. As a result, PPA is now confronted with
deteriorated facilities and equipment in need of repair. The second issue
relates to PPA's foreign denominated debt which has not been restated to
reflect the increase caused by the 150% devaluation of the peso since 1980
(para. 5.8).



- 17 -
5.2       The project ports are all relatively small provincial ports which
provided approximately 1% of PPA's total revenue in 1985. Due to the small
size of these ports, the financial evaluation relates to the entire organiza-
tion and not to the specific ports included in this project.
B. Past Financial Performance
5.3       For the six years ending in 1985, PPA's operating results have been
good even though, during these years, the country has seen the consumer price
index increase by 154% and the peso devalued, relative to the US dollar, by a
comparable amount. At the same time, the number of ships that called at the
ports has declined at an annual rate of 3.0% and the total cargo tonnage
through the ports has declined at an annual rate of 3.3%. Despite these
developments, the working and operating ratios improved dramatically and the
liquidity remained strong.
5.4       PPA was able to achieve a 22.4% annual revenue groeth rate over the
neriod despite a decline in shipping and cargo volume. One factor contribut-
ing to this increase was a revision to the billing and collection system used
in the ports. The new system revised the source documents so that the repor-
ted revenue was based on the actual cargo and not on the information provided
by the cargo handlers and ship operators. It is estimated that an additional
P 200 million was billed from 1981 to i983 as a result of this revised
system. The other major factor was that PPA was able to introduce six tariff
increases from 1983 through 1986. These increases enabled PPA to keep pace
with the large inflationary cost increases occurring at the time (para. 5.11).
The following variance analysis indicates the impact on total re'enue of
volume, and price and/or cargo mix changes from 1980 to 1985:
Decreases in revenue due to change
in volume                                             P <31,120,000>
Increases in revenue due to change
in price and/or cargo mix                             P 420,080,000
Net increase in opcrating cevenue                  P 388,960,000
5.5       Another reason for PPA's good financial performance is that the
working expenses were controlled during the period, to an annual growth rate
below that of inflation. As a result, the working ratio improved from 45.1%
in 1980 to 32.6% in 1985. During this period, management was able to offset
relatively large increases in expenses for dredging, administration and
general by restricting the annual increase in wages to only 6.7%. In addi-
tion, the growth in working expenses was held down because the amount spent on
regular repairs and maintenance was restricted as a result of the controls
placed on PPA by the Government through PD 1234.
5.6       As a result of the above factors, PPA's operating ratio improved
from 65.3% in 1980 to 47.0% in 19o5. The table below summarizes PPA's
operating results which are presented in more detail in Table 6.

C. Present Financial Position
5.7       PPA's balance sheet has remained strong despite the high rates of
inflation during 1984 and 1985 and, as a result of the restrictions on capital
spending, PPA has accumulated a large portfolio of short-term investments. As
of December 31, 1985, the total cash and short-term investments were approxi-
mately P 960 million, up from 1983 and 1984 levels. These funds are being
held by PPA to finance future capital investments. The result, however, is to
produce a hihly liquid organization, which at the end of 1985 had an acid
test ratio - and a current ratio of 2.1:1 and 2.3:1 respectively.
1/   A measure of short-term liquidity (current assets excluding inventories
divided by current liabilities).



- 19 -
5.8        Between 1980 and 1985, PPA's capital structure changed dramatically
from 1980, when 93% of the capital was in the form of equity, to 1985 when
equity represented only 67% of capital. During this time, PPA's long-term
debt-to-equity ratio increased from approximately 0.1:1 in 1980 to 0.5:1 in
1985. The resulting capital structure fc. PPA is still acceptable, but the
concern is that approximately 95% of the long-term debt outstanding at the end
of 1985 is denominated in foreign currency. When that debt is adjusted for
the 150% devaluation cf the peso that has occurred from 1980 to 1985, the
total long-term debt will increase by approximately 60% end the long-term debt
to equity ratio will increase to 0.5:1. PPA is aware of this problem and has
revalued its debt portfolio based on the current peso exchange rate for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 1986. PPA will continue to review the
carrying value of its foreign debt and make further adjustments to the value
when necessary.
5.9        The Philippines has experienced annual inflation rates of 50.0% and
23.1% during 1984 and 1985, respectively, and a cumulative inflation of
approximately 154% between 1980 and 1985. This has had two major effects on
PPA. Fi-st, since PPA's monetary liabilities have generally exceeded its
monetary assets, this inflation has resulted in a purchasing power gain of
approximately P 109 million. Second, the current value of PPA's fixed 3ssets
has increased. The revaluation of these assets will cause PPA's operating
ratio in future years to be above its historical levels. PPA has revalued its
assets based on their replacement cost for the fiscal year ending December 31.
1986. During negotiations, agreement was reached that PPA will continue to
revalue its fixed assets at their estimated replacement cost every five
years. The next revaluation shoull be completed by December 31, 1991.
D. Cost Recovery and Profitability
5.10      When PPA's current tariff structure was developed, an attempt was
made to base the tariffs on the actual cost to perform the service. Since
that time, the ports have undergone a significant number of changes in terms
of the facilities available, the amount and type of traflic, and the rates
charged. At this time, there is little, if any, relationship between the
tariffs charged for a particular service anc the cost to provide it. Develop-
ment of the cost accounting system (para. 2.18) will enable PPA to restructure
its tariffs to one that is cost bL3ed.
5.11       Despite the fact that PPA's tariff structure is not based on cost,
PPA's strong financial performance during a time of rapid inflation and
declining economic activity demonstrates its ability to recover its operating
and non-operating expenses. However, throughout the seven years ended in 1986
the average real tariff rates charged declined by 22% because PPA did not
increase its rates in either 1981 or 1982. (See Annex 4 for a more detailed
analysis). Regular tariff increases combined with a continued attempt to
control operating expenses should ensure PPA's continued profitability.

E. Future Financial Performance
5.12      Set forth below is a forecast of the operations of PPA for the years
1986 to 1992. The detailed financial statements are presented in Tables 6, 7
and 8. The assumptions used to develop the financial projections are detailed
in Annex 5.

Tb   Operating expenses expresse. as a percentage of operating r venue.
Tc   Fixed assets in operation.
5J13      The operating results for 1986 are based on unaudited actual data.
The forecast assumes that revenue will increase at an annual rate of 6% due to
increased traffic through the ports and further improvements in the billing
and collection systems used by each of the ports. Management is also
forecasting a 30% tariff increase in both 1988 and 1989. Although smaller
regular tariff increases would be easier for the port users to accept,
management does not believe that the poor economic conditions in the
Philippines would permit any tariff increase to be implemented before 1988.
Throughout the forecast period, operating revenues are projected to grow at an
annual rate of abcut 13.5% Although this growth rate appeats to be
optimistic, it is less than the growth rate of 22.4% realized from 1980 to
1985 and it is consistent with the projected overall growth in the economy.
During negotiations, agreement was reached that for the fiscal years beginning
after December 31, 1987, PPA will maintain its operating expenses below 65% of
operating revenues. On average, this operating ratio should provide PPA with
sufficient cash to service all of its obligations, and would provide the
Government and the Bank with a means to ensure that PPA is not only profitable
but also a low cost supplier of port services.



- 21 -
5.14      PPA's operating expenses are projected to grow at about a 16.5%
annual rate during the forecast period. Since this growth rate exceeds the
13.5% annual growth rate for operating revenues, there will be a deterioration
in the operating and working ratios. However, a large percentage of these
cost increases are forecast to take effect in 1987 when PPA expects to
increase expenditures on maintenance and dredging by about 80%. It is esti-
mated that this level of expernditure would arrest further deterioration in the
fixed assets, harbors and channeis. Besides inflation, cost increases reflect
an increase in employee benefits and a doubling of the dredging expenses to
take care of work postponed due to budgetary limitations imposed in prior
years by the Government. After 1987, the annual growth rate in operating
expenses is only 11% and. the operating and working ratios improve dramatically
from the levels established in 1987.
5.15      As a result of the Government's budgetary restrictions, PPA, in 1985
and 1986, has been able to accumulate a large cash balance to fund future
capital itavestments. PPA plans to utilize most of this excess cash during the
forecast period by financing approximately 36% of its capital investments from
operations. During negotiations, agreement was reached that PPA should
finan.ee at least 30% oi all capital investments from internally generated
funds for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1987. The forecast of
cash available for capital investment assumes that all debt service obliga-
tions are adjusted to reflect peso devaluations as each loan is disbursed.
Despite the large reduction in cash and securities, PPA's balance sheet
remains strong and its ability to generate cash from operations is good.
F. Sensitivity
5.16            The financial forecast is most likely to be affected by changes
in the ports' operating revenue due to changes in the tariff structure,
changes in the volume of traffic and/or changes in the operating expenses due
to inflatiorn. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the forecast for tihese
factors. The analysis indicates that a 1% change in operating expenses, with
no corresponding change in operating revenues, would result in approximately a
2% change in net income and a 0.5% change in the operating ratio. Similarly,
a 1% change in operating revenue, with no corresponding change in operating
expenses, would result in approximately a 4% change in net income and a 0.5%
change in the operating ratio. Therefore, if a 1% reduction in operating
revenues was combined with a 1% increase in operating expenses, PPA's net
income would be reduced by approximately 6% and its operating ratio increased
by approximately 1%. Changes in PPA's net cash flow would roughly correspond
to the changes in the level of net income.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.1       During negotiations, the following agreements were reached with PPA
and the Government:
(a) the Government will, by June 30, 1988, develop, and thereafter
implement, a plan of action to improze safety of operations in
domestic shipping (para. 1.7);



- 22 -
(b) the Government will by June 30, 1988, complete a review of the role
of the Bureau of Customs in domestic shipping an* cargo clearances
and based on the results of such review produce a plan of action
satisfactory to the Bank to facilitate domestic shipping and cargo
clearances (para. 1.8);
(c) PPA will furnish the Bank by February 1 each year with a draft of
PPA's annual expenditure plan for comment and furnish by August 1
each year, the final plan to the Bank (para. 2.4);
(d) PPA will establish procedures to separate passenger and cargo
traffic flows in ports by June 30, 1988 (para. 2.10);
(e) PPA will develop a plan to address PPA's role in port operations and
review current revenue collecting procedures by December 31, 1987
(para. 2.10);
(f) PPA will prepare an inventory of additional rehabilitation/
maintenance needs by December 31, 1987, submit an action plan for
such work to the Bank by June 30, 1988 and report on the maintenance
activities, of the previous year by March 31, 1989, and each
-,March 31, thereafter (para. 2.11);
(g)  PPA will maintain a project executive committee, to oversee
implementation of the project (para. 3.7);
(h) PPA will develop details of proposed training with regards to
subjects, staff, timing and type of training by September 30, 1987
(para. 3.7).
(i) PPA will select ten additional ports to be chosen for minor
rehabilitation in accordance with established selection criteria
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 3.7);
(j) PPA will continue to revalue its fixed assets at their estimated
replacement cost every five years starting December 31, 1991
(para. 5.9);
(k) PPA will maintain its operating expenses below 65% of its operating
revenues for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1987 (para.
5.13);
(1) PPA will finance at least 30% of its capital investments from its
internally generated funds for fiscal years beginning after
December 31, 1987 (para. 5.15);
6.2       As a condition for loan effectiveness, the Government and PPA would
enter into a subsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 3.6).



- 23 -
6.3       On the basis of these agreements and conditions, the project is
suitable for a Bank Loan of US$32 million equivalent (representing about 73%
of the total project cost, excluding taxes and duties) for a period of 20
years, including a five year grace period. The Borrower would be the Republic
of the Philippines.

/a   Assumptions:  Board date fourth quarter of FY87; proposed closing date:
December 31, 1992. Disbursements do not follow the profile for East Asia
but are expected to be quicker based on experience under the Third Ports
Project and due to the advanced preparation and small size of the port
contracts.

PROVINCIAL PORTS PROJECT
Description of the Project Ports
1.   Calapan
A. Existing Facilities
The port facilities consist of one wharf with a 104.5 m long main
berth and a 30.5 m long secondary berth; both berths have 4dm depth alongside,
with part of the main berty having a 7 m depth.  The 2,112 m  concrete deck
area is supported on 0.4 m concrete piles. The wharf is linked to the shore
by a concrete paved roadway about 90 m long. Water is supplied by the local
utility company with very low pressure at the site. Potable water is stored
at night in drums when water pressure is high enough. There is an existing
water tank with a capacity of about 4,000 liters. It is not presently in
use. Drainage does not seem to be a problem, but the discharge is made at the
wharf area. Power supply is presently adequate.
B. Proposed Imgrovements (Map IBRD 20190)
(i) Rehabilitation of the existing wharf;
(ii) Provision of 5 m deep dredged basin and a ro-ro ramp to serve
the Batangas-Calapan ferries, together with a 36.5 m long
berthing pier, complete with quay infrastructure, which would
also permit safe access by passengers;
(iii) Reclamation behind bunded sea walls to provide an extended
ro-ro vehicle parking area;
(iv) Conversion of the existing 48 m x 12 m transit shed to a
combined passenger and administrative building; and
(v) Paving, utilities and miscellaneous port improvements.
2.   San Jose
A. Existing Facilities
The port facilities consist of one finger pier 42 m long and 15 m
wide of reinforced concrete supported by 0.4 m concrete piles, with 4 m depth
alongside. Water supply is adequate, but no drainage system is available.
Power supply is adequate.

Page 2
B. Proposed Improvements (Map IBRD 20190)
(i)  Rehabilitation of the existing pier prior to redevelopment to
enable the port to continue to operate during construction;
(ii)  Construction of a new L shaped finger pier with a stem 45 m x
lc m and a jetty head 30 m square complete with quay infra-
structure;
(iii)  Dredging to provide a design depth of 5 m for the eastern
berth, which would be 75 m long, and for the northern berth
which would be 30 m long. The dredged depth on the western
side would be 2 m, as this berthing would not be used for cargo
handling but for small boat mooring. A 60 m long marginal
wharf is also to be included between the existing facility and
the new pier having an alongside depth of 5 m.  A ro-ro ramp is
to be provided at the junction of the new marginal wharf and
the pier;
(iv)  Construction of one transit shed 50 m x 20 m behind the
marginal wharf and an open storage area tn the west measuring
43 m x 75 m; and
(v)  Access roads and miscellaneous port improvements.
3. Tagbilaran
A. Existing Facilities
The port facilities consist of a 405 m long causeway joining the
shore facilities ':o an L-shaped jetty 137 m and 130 m long with depths
alongside varying between 10 m and 4 m, respectively.  Widths of the jetties
vary from 40 m to 11.8 m, respectively. Water supply is not adequate and
there is no drainage system, but power supply is adequate.
B. Proposed Improvements (Map IBRD 20191)
(i)  Reclamation behind rock bunds of an ar.A of up to 1.7 hectares
(ha);
(ii)  Construction of a new, suspended reinforced concrete slab,
marginal wharf on the edge of the reclamation measuring 180 m x
16.8 m, complete with quay infrastructure;
(iii) Demolition, by stages, of the existing L shaped pier;
(iv)  Dredging of the sea bed to provide an alongside depth of 8 m;
and
(v)  Paving, road inccess, utilities and miscellaneous port improve-
ments.

4. Nasipit
A.  Existing Facilities
The port facilities consist of a concrete-paved, rock-fill causeway
108 m long, connecting a narrow unpaved axccess road to an 84 m long, 12 m wide
jetty on reinforced concrete piles. The depth alongside the jetty is 7 m.
Water is supplied from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. only, but is adequate, drainage
facilities and power supply are adequate.
B.  Proposed Improvements (Map IBRD 20192)
(i)  Demolition of the existing wharf, phased to minimize disruption
to port operations during redevelopment;
(ii)  Dredging to a depth of 13 m to enable rockfill bunds to be
constructed for land reclamation of 3.43 ha;
(iii) Construction, along the longer side of the reclamation, of a
225 m x 20 m suspended reinforced concrete slab structure,
complete with quay infrastructure, having a depth alongside of
7 m but designed for a future dredged depth of 10m.  On the
seaward end of the reclamation and at right angles to the
longer wharf, construct a 75 m x 20 m quay of similar
construction but incorporating a ro-ro ramp at the shore end;
(iv)  Construction of a 66 m x 20 m multi-use building incorporating
a 1,080 sq m single-story cargo handling area and a 1,560 sq m
two-story area with facilities for passengers on the ground
floor and administration on the upper floor; and
(v) Paving, access roads and miscellaneous port improvements.
5. Surigao
A. Existing Facilities
The waterfront structures were severely damaged by a typhoon in
September 1984 and have been only partially repaired. Port facilities consist
of an old marginal wharf 118 m long, 11 m wide reinforced concrete pile type
with 5 m depth alongside. The old wharf is partially damaged and is generally
in a deteriorated condition. Water supply is adequate except in the drought
season. Drainage and power supply are adequate.
B. Proposed Improvements (Map IBRD 20192)
(i)  Construction of a 136 m long steel sheet piled marginal wharf
complete with quay infrastructure to replace damaged wharfage.
The quay will be in two sections, one 76 m long to the north to
marry with the existing wharf, and the southern to marry with
the "old marginal wharf";

Page 4
(ii)  Demolition of the superstructure of the existing grade transi-
tion ramp at the mouth end of the marginal wharf to maintain
level grade between it and the new wharf;
(iii) Extension of the proposed northern berth sheet piling behind
the existing northern wharf to enable the damaged back up area
to be reinstated;
(iv) Construction of a two-story reinforced concrete multi-purpose
building measuring 30 m x 20 m for passenger and administrative
uses;
(v) Construction of a 400 sq m cargo shed/container freight
station; and
(vi) Paving, access roads and miscellaneous port improvements.
6. Pulupandan
A. Existing Facilities
The porc facilities consist of a 250 m long trestle joining to a 242
m long, 21.75 m wide jetty which extends to another narrower jetty 178.6 m
long and 12 m wide with an angle of 1600 between the two jetties. All
structures are of reinforced concrete pile type with a reinforced concrete
deck. The water depth alongside the jetties changes due to heavy siltation
and is maintained to a minimum of 4.5 m by dredging. Water, power supply and
drainage facilities need to be improved.
B. Proposed Improvements (Map IBRD 20192)
(i) Demolition of the existing breakwater which is causing exces-
sive sedime'Lt.ion at the jetty;
(ii) Shore protection for the exposed area after demolishing the
breakwater; and
(iii) Paving, access roads, utilities, etc. and miscellaneous port
improvements.
7. Rehabilitation Ports (Map IBRD 20189)
Ports classified for needing rehabilitation are Bauan, Cagayan de
Oro, Sta. Cruz, Legaspi, Tabaco, and Pulauan. Port facilities consist of: a
finger pier 82 r 9 m on piles at Bauan; a marginal wharf 866 m x 23 m on piles
at Cagayan de Oro; a finger pier 15 x 8.5 m on piles at Sta Cruz; an L shaped
wharf 228 m x 12 m and 99 m x 15 m on piles at Legaspi; a marginal wharf 301 m
x 11.3 m on piles at Tabco; and a pier 99 m on piles at Pulauan. Minor
repairs are needed at all these ports and will be included in the proposed
project. Minor repairs will also be carried out at an additional ten ports
still to be identified under the project.

Assumptions Made in Preparing Financial Forecasts
A.   General
(a) Projections are in current prices.
(b) Inflation is assumed to be 5% throughout the forecast period.
B.   Income Statement
(a) 1986 results are unaudited actual data.
(b) 1987 results are based on individual projections from each of the
PHUs.
(c) 1988 to 1992 assumes a 6% growth rate in operating revenue due to
increased volume and improved billing systems.
(d) Tariff increases are projected for all ship and cargo charges,
except arrastre, of 30% in 1988 and 1989.
(e) Fund management income assumes a 2.5% interest rate on the opening
balance of cash and securities.
(f) Personnel services expense grows at 10% per year from 1988 to 1992.
(g) Administration and general increases at 5% per year plus projected
increases in taxes and insurance.
(h) Depreciation expense is about 2.5% of the gross fixed assets in
operation.
(i) Interest expense for commercial debt is projected at 12% and at 8%
for the proposed project loan. Interest on the project loan is
capitalized from 1987 to 1990.
C.   Balance Sheet
(a) Accounts receivable is 8% of operating revenue.
(b) Other current assets grow at 10% annually.
(c) Fixed assets have been revalued as of December 31, 1987, to reflect
their estimated replacement cost.
(d) Long term debt was revalued in 1986 to reflect the decline in the
value of the peso from the level in effect when the loans became
effective.

(e) Capital investment is based on PPA's capital budget--one-third of
the capital investment goes directly to fixed asaets in operation
and two-thirds of it goes to work in process.
(f) Accounts payable grow at 10% annually.
D.   Source and Application of Funds Statement
Debt service obligations reflect the devaluation of the peso from
date of each loan's effectiveness.
