MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
FIJI FOR A ROAD UPGRADING PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Fiji for US$23.4 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a term of
15 years, including three years grace, at the standard variable rate, and
would help finance upgrading and rehabilitation of priority road segments
under the current Ninth Development Plan (1986-90).
2.       Background.  Fiji's road network of about 4,650 km. of which only 680
km are paved to bituminous standards, have generally kept up with increasing
traffic levels on roads near major towns and on the main routes. Traffic
levels, estimated at over 1,000 vehicles per day, are however much lower in
rural areas. Since Independence in 1970, under three successive development
plans, the Government's twin objectives of improving access between commercial
centers and developing areas and of opening up new areas with the greatest
agric-ultural potential, have largely been achieved. However, the conditions
of most gravel roads are poor and in the implementation of the road
development program the following technical and institutional shortcomings
have surfaced: inadequate design and construction standards, inefficient
construction methods and bupervision, weak planning and monitoring of
maintenance, and, last but not least, irefficient maintenance operations.
These shortcomings are mostly related to the shortage of experienced staff in
the Public Works Department (PWD) in the Ministry of Communications, Transport
and Works (MCTW) and inadequate institutional arrangements. To alleviate
these shortcomings PWD has employed expatriate technical staff and undertaken
training programs for local staff with considerable success.
3.       Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project would support the
Government's --ad sector strategy which focuses on the upgrading and rehabili-
tation of prio.ity road segments and selective construction of rural roads in
areas with the greatest development potential. Specifically, the proposed
project would: (a) finance upgrading, rehabilitation of exis_ing roads and
limited construction of new roads as indicated in para. 5 below;
(b) strengthen PWD's institutional capacity in road sector management,
especially, in regard to road maintenance and project implementation; and
(c) improve cost effectiveness in engineering design, construction standards
and methods. The project would thus generate savings in transport costs
through reduction in vehicle operating cost and road maintenance costs.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project is part of a larger
project appraised by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with IBRD staff
participating in the ADB appraisal mission. The ADB and the Fiji Government
could not agree on ADB's variable interest rate spread (as opposed to the
IBRD's fixed spread). Consequently, the Fiji Government declined the ADB's
financing offer and requested IBRD financing for a project with reduced scope;
this is the proposed project now being submitted to the Executive Directors
for approval. The ADB Appraisal Report, which is being used with the
permission of ADB, is being distributed separately with a covering note
explaining the changes from the original project. The estimated cost of the
proposed project would be US$38.0 million compared to US$44.2 million for the
original project.



- 2 -
5.       The project would consist of the tollowing components: (a) road
upgrading of three sections of main roads (40.6 km) and seven sections of
secondary roads (66.4 km) which are narrow gravel roads in badly deteriorating
conditions and carrying considerable traffic. These roads would be upgraded
to bituminous paved two-lane standard on properly engineered alignments with
adequate drainage; (b) road construction equipment required to help PWD
upgrade road sections to be carried out by force account; (c) consultancy
services to assist PWD revise the detailed engineering for the :oad works to
be carried out by contract, undertake construction supervision of these works,
and prepare the detailed engineering for two major bridges in need of
reconstruction. This component also includes technical assistance services to
assist PWD to implement and monitor the force account road works, and
strengthen its organization for planning, programming, implementing and cost
monitoring of road maintenance operations.
6.       The proposed Bank loan of US$23.4 million equivalent would finance
68% of total project costs, net of taxes, or lOOS of the foreign exchange
requirements of the project. A breakdown of the proposed project cost and of
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement Schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key proiect processing events and the status of
Bank group operations in Fiji are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
7.       An important feature of this project is the proposed combination of
contracting through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank Guidelines for Procurement and the utilization of force account in imple-
menting project road works. Contracting is desirable for part of the works
because of the prevailing competitive ma-ket in the industry and the reason-
able size of the contract which would attract interest from international
contractors. The force account is justified for other parts because of the
small size of likely contracts and the dispersed nature of the works. The PWD
has a proven record of undertaking road works with its own work force to
acceptable standards, as concluded in the Project Completion Report (No. 5739,
dated June 28, 1985), for the Cyclone Reconstruction Project (Loan 1921-FIJ).
A cost comparison of road works by contract and by force account, which will
be studied under the project, would provide PWD management with valuable
information in regard to relative cost effectiveness.
8.       In addition to the consultancy and technical assistance services
financed under the project, the Government will undertake studies on road user
charges and on the domestic construction industry with funds out of its own
resources, or alternatively, through grant financing. The Bank will assist
the Government to review the terms of reference for these studies.
9.       Rationale For Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would enable
PWD to complete the first phase of a much deferred and critically needed reha-
bilitation and upgrading program during a period of tight budgetary con-
straints. It would also focus the attention of policy makers on key issues in
the management of the road subsector: cost effectiveness in road maintenance,
relative cost effectiveness of works by force account and by contract, and the
adequacy of construction standards and methods. Moreover, the proposed
project would strengthen PWD's transport development and road maintenance
planning and monitoring capabilities.



10.      Agreed Actions.  It was agreed during negotiations that (a) retroac-
tive financing proposed to expedite the start of works would not exceed the
equivalent of US$1.0 million for eligible expenditures, namely, equipment and
consultant services; (b) the Government would recruit three road maintenance
engineers (consultants) to improve road maintenance practices, programs and
operations; and (c) the Government would, by December 31, 1990, complete a
comparative study, in accordarce with terms of reference satisfactory to the
Bank, of the cost effectiveness of road construction by force account and by
contract. The engineers referred to in para (b) are now being recruited.
11.      Justification.  The proposed project would help implement a key
element of the current Ninth Development Plan (1986-90). In addition,
improved roatl maintenance, timely rehabilitation and upgrading of existing
roads would prevent further deterioration of the road assets and would, by
postponing much higher investments in new roads and reducing road maintenance
costs, result in substantial long-term savings. Vehicle operating cost
savings would accrue mainly to road users in the form of reduced passenger
fares and freight charges. Major savings would be realized in commercial
vehicles, most of which are light trucks owned mainly by small-scale operators
who provide vital short-haul ,ssenger and freight services linking rural
communities with market centers. Sectoral benefits would include reduced
transportation costs for small-scale agricultural enterprises and improved
road access to tourist facilities. The proposed project is estimated to have
an eco.iomic rate of return of 21Z.
12.       isk.  The major risk associated with the project is possible delay
in the implementation of the road works. To minimize this risk and to ensure
that the civil works are undertaken in a cost-effective manner, consultants
would be prov4ded under the project to assist PWD in project implementation.
13.      Environmental Impact.  The project is not expected to cause any sig-
nificant adverse impact on the environment. The road upgrading will generally
follow the existing alignments. Raising embankments and constructing adequate
drainage would alleviate problems associated with periodic flooding.
14.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
