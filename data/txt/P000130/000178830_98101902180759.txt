INTERNATIONAL DEVELOFPMDT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECCHKEATDN OF THE PRESIDENT TO Tm   E
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA FOR A ROAD PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republia of Botswana for the equivalent of US
$ 2 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a road project to be
jointly financed with Sweden.
PART I - THE ECONOM¢
2.        An economic report on Botawana (AE-4a) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on October 31, 1969 and an updating memorandum
(AE-18) on June 16, 1971. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex 1.
3.        Botswana is a landlocked country in Southern Africa bordering
on the Republic of South Africa to the south and east, South-West Africa
to the west, Southern Rhodesia to the north-east and Zambia to the north,
with an area of about 600,000 km2 (the size of France). The Kalahari -
part useless desert and part savannah - covers much of the center and
south-west of the country. The Okavengo/Chobe river basin, which
occupies most of the north-west country, is mainly a region of tsetse-fly
infested swamps. Most of the population is concentrated in the eastern
part of the country where the Limpopo river system and more favorable
rainfall give rise to important agricultural activity and where deposits
of minerals in exploitable quantities have been discovered.
4.        The population of Botswana - estimated at 670,000 - is growing
at about 3 percent a year and is expected to continue to increase at a
high rate for the next two decades in spite of the family planning pro-
gram which is being introduced. The redaction in births resulting from
the family planning effort is expected at first to be counter-balanced
by a decrease in infant mortality which ia being brought about by
better child care and increased use of immunization against childhood
diseases.
5.        The per capita GNP is estimated at about $100. However, as
income distribution is somewhat skewed in favor of townspeople, the
level of GNP per capita does not fully reflect the poverty in the rural
area. The average rural per capita income is about $45. Here again
the wealth is unevenly distributed and the median rural income is well
below this level. In fact, about 30 percent of rural households have
no cattle and consequently no income except for subsistence from small
plots of arable land. Livestock doainates Botswana's economy, contribu-
ting about 80 percent of total export earnings in 1969. Other agri-
cultural production is not sufficient for domestic consumption and
Botswana is therefore a net importer of basic foods. It is estimated
that the economy is growing at about 3-5 percent a year.



-2-
6.        Employment opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled
workers are scarce; nevertheless, the unemployment figures are
relatively low as they do not reflect the substantial seasonal or
disguised unemployment that exists. One indication of unutilized labor
is the number of Batswana working in the Republic of South Africa, at
present numbering more than 400,000. About 91% of the total resident
labor force is engaged in agriculture. Employment outside agriculture
numbers about 20,000 out of an estimated labor force of about 220,000.
Although the development of mining activities in Botawana will increase
government revonues substantially, it will provide employment for only
a small number of people.(about 5.,000).
7.        The government has.prepared a National Development Plan for'
1970-75.   Its main objective is to stimulate development in the rural
areas by promoting the development of livestock and food crop
production in addition to providing basic social services including
education, health and water supply. In launching an agricultural
development program the government hopes to reduce the disparity not
only between rural and urban incomes, but also between the few wealthy
cattle owners and the rural population at large. The Plan is also
intended to tackle two of the most important constraints on Botswana's
development - the scarcity of experienced manpower and the need to
improve the basic infrastructure of the economy.
The scarcity of educated and skilled manpower is a major
constraint to development in Botswana. At present Botswana nationals
fill only 25% of those civil service positions requiring at least five
years of secondary education and TIhss than 10% of those requiring
higher qualifications. The government is attempting to tackle the
problem by a three-fold increase in secondary school enrollment between
1969 and 1975 and by expanding vocational training.
9.        The relative lack of basic infrastructure in Botswana is par-
ticularly apparent in transport. The scattered population and the large
size of the country, mean high transport costs which hamper development.
Moreover, again because of long distances, the investment cost of
improving the transport systam is high, Which is a particularly difficult
problem in a country as short of financial resources as Botswana.
10.       Botswana's shortage of financial resources is its greatest
obstacle to more rapid development - mora constraining even than the
scarcity of experienced people. Traditional agriculture has been unable
-co provide the government with sufficient tax base to finance even the
most rudimentary services. The recurrent budget has therefore been sub-
sidized through grants-in-aid from the United Kingdom. Since 1967, the.



U.K. has financed nearly 40 percent of the central government's recurrent
expenditures and has provided grants and loans for most of Botswana's
public investments. There has, recently, been a significant improvement
in the government's budgetary position as a consequence of the revision
in the Castoms Union Agreement among Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and
South Africa, which has substantially increased the share of the three
developing countries in the customs revenues accruing to the common
customs pool. The government hopes to be able to balance its recurrent
budget without external budgetary support from 1972/73 onwards. Capital
for financing public development expenditures, however, is not available
within Botswana. The capacity of the economy to generate savings will
remain severely limited until. the new mining developments start contri-
buting to the domestic incomEl. Until then development projects will have
to depend almost entirely on external support. For the same reasons
coupled with the dependence on capital imports giving rise to heavy debt
servicing obligations, the major portion of capital for development
projects should be on concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING
11.       Botswana has received three IDA credits and one Bank loan for
the provision of basic infrastructure. One of the credits was for roads
and one for water supply. The third credit and a large Bank loan were
for infrastructure needed for a large mining development. The 1964
credit of US$ 3.6 million was for upgrading the two major roads in
Botswana, one from Francistown to Maun and parts of the North-South
road connecting Gaborone and Francistown. In 1971 IDA made a US$ 3 mil-
lion credit for the construction of water supply systems to serve
Lobatse and Gaborone, the two principal towns in Botswana. To assist
Botswana in establishing a mining industry, IDA provided a US$ 2.5 mil-
lion credit in 1970 for the engineering and design of basic infrastructure
works for a mining project at Shashe and in 1971 the Bank made a US$ 32
million loan to finance parts of this infrastructure. A statement of
IDA credits and Bank loans is attached (Annex II). IFC has made no
investments in Botswana.
12.       The execution of development projects in Botswana has in
general been satisfactory. The water supply and Shashe infrastructure
projects have, however, been delayed for reasons beyond the control of
the government. In the Water Supply project some contracts have already
been let, but the general increase in construction costs in Southern
Africa is expected to have an impact on the remaining contracts and
overall project cost may increase by about 20 percent. If the bids con-
firm the higher estimates, the government, being extremely short of
funds, would either have to reduce the project, or seek additional funds
from external sources. The project will be closely supervised.



13.       The Bank loan for the Shashe project was signed in June 1971
and was expected to become effective by December 31. However, after
the loan for the infrastructure was signed the sponsors of the mining
project nade modifications in the mining plan and the financial plan
for the mining project. These changes, together with delays in
ccmpleting the sales arrangements have not delayed physical work on the
project but have necessitated a postponement in making the loan effect-
ive. It is now expacted that all outstanding matters will have been
settled and the loan declared effective by mid February. A memorandum
on developments sirea the signing will be given to the Executive
Directors shortly.
14.       The Bank is continuing to assist Botswana to prepare suitable
projects. The emphasis will contiune to be on transportation which is
essential for the development of agriculture and mining. Projects are
being prepared in agricultuare as well, and daring the next few months,
I expect to submit to the Executive Directors an IDLA credit for a
livestock development project.
PART III - THE TRA1SPORT SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
The Transport Sector
t 5,,     Efficient transportation is a prerequisite for an increase in
econoicuo activity in Botswana.  let, because of the physical features of
the country and the distribution of population, transportation facilities
are costly. In some cases, the traditional criteria of savings to road
users mya not yield high enough returns to justify investments, although
tnese may be justified on the basis of generation of new economic
activity.
16.       The transport sector in Botswana is not highly developed (see
map attached). The one railway, operated by Rhodesia Railways, extends
through the length (635 kn) of the eastern part of Botswana. The rail-
way has been the main mode of transport for import and export as well as
passengers in Botswana, but its services, which are designed primarily
for heavy freight traffic between Southern Rhodesia and South Africa,
are not iell. suited to mnuch of the freight moving within Botswana. Because
of the large distances between centers of population, the poor conditions
of roads and the limited internal services provided by the railroad, the
government's development, strategy emphasizes the need for air connections
particularly to the more remote areas, but management problems and limited
traffic have led the one domestic airline into financial difficulties.
The only international scheduled service operated at present is by
Zambian Airways between Lusakal, Francistown  and Gaborone,
and by Soutb African RAirvays between Johatnesburg, Gaborone and
Franc istown.
17.       The road system is the most developed mode within the transport
sector connecting the.western and northern parts of the country to the



main financial and administrative centers, Gaborone and Lobatse, in the
south-east. When Botswana became independent in 1966 there were only
about 430 km of roads providing all-weather service in the country, out
of a total road network of 7800 km. However, with financial assistance
from the Association Botswana has extended its all-weather road system
to about 800 km. The main route is the North-South road (670 km) run-
ning the length of the eastern part of the country from the Southern
Rhodesian border to 30uth Africa. The Gaborone-Lobatse section is poor
while the condition of the rest of this road is patchy and driving
becomes difficult during the rainy season. The other major road from
Francistown to Maun in the west, which was improved out of the proceeds
of the firat IDA credit, is in fairly good condition. No good road
connection exists between the important cattle producing area of Ghanzi
in the west and Lobatse where the abattoir is located. The route for
much of its distance is only a sandy track.
18.       In the past transport planning has been hampered by insuffi-
cient data about modes of transport, operating conditiona and the econvmr
as a whole. The government is now developing a data base for a long
term transport strategy intended to coordinate investment within the
transport sector, and also to permit a proper balance between invest-
ment in transport and other sectors of the economy. Increased economic
activity has led to heavier traffic on the road system and with
additional mining developments taking place, weight controls are needed.
The government has recognized the need to control both light and heavy
vehicle traffic and has therefore submitted a Transportation Bill to
the Parliament, which when enacted will enable the government to impose
speed and weight limits and introduce annual vehicle inspection.
19.       Botswana is actively seeking bilateral and multilateral
assistance for the improvement of the road system. The government has
recently negotiated financing from the United States for the design of
the road from Nata to the Zambian border, and finance from tle United
Kingdom for the improvement to gravel standards of a 144 km section of
the North-South road north of Gaborone. The government has also
requested further assistance from IDA to continue improvement of the road
network.
The Project
20.       A raport entitled "Appraisal of the Second Road Project in
Botswana" (No. PTR-95 dated September 30, 1971) is being distributed
separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
The proposed projeot is the priority road project under the National
Development Plan. It comprises:
(a) the reconstruction and paving of approximately 80 km
of the North-South road from Pioneer Gate through
Lobatse and Gaborone (the capital) to the Botswana
Agricultural College near Selebi 9 km north of
Gaborone;



- 6 -
(b) consulting services for the detailed engineering
and supervision of construction of the above work;
and
(c) technical assiatance to strengthen the staffing of
the Roads Branch of the Public Works Department of
the Ministry of Works and Communications.
The total estimated cost of the project is $ 6.20 million. The foreign
exchange component is $ 5.15 million.
21.       The Ministry of Works and Communications would execute the
project with assistance from consultants. Construction would be
carried out under a single contract let through international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with IDA's procurement guidelines. There
is no domestic constrmction indastry capable of executing large road
contracts, although smaller works (up to R 159,000) are carried out by
the Highway Construction Unit in the Ministry of Works and Communications.
22.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$ 6.20 million
equivalent, of which the foreign exchange component is US$ 5.15 million.
Botswana's contribution to these costs would be US$ 200,000, to finance
the local cost of technical assistance and 2 percent of construction
costs. When negotiations were concluded at the beginning of December,
it was intended that the balance of US$ 6 million equivalent would be
provided under joint financing arrangements by the proposed IDA credit
of US$ 2 million and the Swedish credit of S.Kr. 20.5 million, then
equivalent to US$ 4 million. Following the subsequent realignment of
currencies, the Rand equivalent of the Swedish credit has increased by
about 12.5 percent and that of the proposed IDA credit by about 5 percent.
However, it is not considered appropriate to reduce the amount of either
credit since the indirect effects of the currency changes could lead to
an increase in the cost of the project in excess of the 17 percent
provision for price contingencies in the appraisal estimates. Sweden
and IDA would jointly disburse in the proportion of two to one amounts
to cover about 97 percent of the cost of the project, including about
$ 850,000 equivalent for local expenditure financing. The reasons for
providing externally almost the entire financing requirements of develop-
ment projects have been given in paragraph 10 above. The proposed IDA
credit will include retroactive financing for detailed engineering of
the project from October 1970, estimated to be $ 220,000.
23.       The project would serve an area of about 40,000 sq. km., which
has about 37 percent of the country's population. The moat important
economic activity in this area is based on livestock, including the
abattoir in Lobatse which is the largest commercial operation in the
country. Sorghum, maize and millet are prodaced in this area for local
consumption. The proposed road project would also benefit, but less
directly, the area served by the rest of the North-South road where
mining, in addition to agriculture, is an important activity. The.
internal economic rate of return of the project is 19 percent, with the



-7-
benefits derived primarily from savings to road users and reduced costs
of maintaining the road. The road to be reconstructed does not lend
itself to labor intensive methods since there is not much earth moving
involved. Nevertheless, the project is expected to provide jobs for
about 100-150 workers.
24.       An acute staffing problem has recently developed in the Roads
Branch of the Public Works Departmient of the Ministry of Works and
Communications. The Roads Branch was previously staffed by
expatriates, but low government salary scales have made it difficult
to retain or attract suitably qualified staff. The project therefore
includes some technical assistance in the form of paying part of the
salary of three highway engineers for a period of four years. These
experts would strengthen the Roads Branch for the next few years and
train Botswana nationals in carrying out highway construction and
maintenance. The government is considering approaching UN-OPAS or
bilateral sources for assistance in this category, and if it is
successful, the $ 60,000 allocated for technical assistance in the
credit would be reallocated.
25.       Routine maintenance of the roads is carried out by workers
employed by the Ministry of Works and Communications. Although road
maintenance has been carried out to modest standards on largely un-
engineered roads with inadequate drainage, it is generally adequate
considering the financial constraints of the country. Recently, however,
road maintenance has suffered from lack of engineering and supporting
staff. The technical assistance to be provided under the proposed
project is expected to remedy this. The government's planned expendi-
tures for road maintenance and works are considered adequate.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
26.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Botswana and the Association, the draft Joint Financing Agreement between
the Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Association, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
27.       The Credit documents generally follow the form used in other
credits where there is a co-lender with the Association. The terms and
conditions of Sweden's participation follows the general principles in
the letter agreement between the Bank, IDA and the Kingdom of 9weden,
dated June 3, 1969. The draft Joint Financing Agreement provides for
concurrent but separate disbursements by the Association and the Kingdom
of Sweden in a ratio of one to two. A default under the Swedish credit
agreement would be an event of default under the draft Development
Credit Agreement; conversely, a default under the latter agreement would
be an event of default under the former.



- 8 -
28.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOM?MENDTION
29.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
