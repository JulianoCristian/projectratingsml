adjustment of the economy supported by four single-tranche\n            balance of payments support loans. This loan tracks reform\n            in the financial and corporate sectors, seeks to strengthen\n            the competitive foundations of the economy, and supports the\n            Government's proposed fiscal stimulus, especially\n            programs that shore up social protection. In the short-term,\n            the fiscal stimulus will strengthen aggregate demand,\n            provide employment opportunities and substantially bolster\n            social protection. The medium term benefits include the\n            consolidation of the structural reform program that began\n            with the Finance Companies Restructuring Loan and deepened\n            with the first Economic and Financial Adjustment Loan. The\n            loan program will strengthen the legal, institutional, and\n            incentive framework for decision-making by financial\n            institutions and corporates. The greatest risk lies in the\n            potential to misread the current strengthening of the stock\n            market and the exchange rate as signs of enduring recovery.\n            The slowdown in China's exports and its implications\n            for the country's currency policy entails another set\n            of risks. However, recent economic developments suggest that\n            the risks mentioned above are small."}, "docdt": "1999-03-25T00:00:00Z"}
