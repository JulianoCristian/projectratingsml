The following lessons learned derived from\n            interviews with Bank staff, government counterparts, and\n            other stakeholders. 1) It has become clear in countries in\n            financial crisis that a high priority is to pursue\n            legislation that enhances loan collectability. 2) Reform\n            programs should not exceed over tax implementation capacity.\n            3) Achieving legal reform within the framework of emergency\n            lending operations requires two elements: a) dealing with\n            the immediate problems through emergency decrees and b)\n            concretely reforming the legal framework and implementation\n            capacity so that the future need for emergency decrees is\n            reduced. 4) Broader participation in drafting reforms might\n            slow implementation in the short-run, but pays off in the\n            long-run. 5) Bank participation in the legal reform should\n            be broader. 6) Technical assistance, especially grant-funded\n            assistance, is an extremely useful catalyst to implement\n            reform program components. 7) Gaps in the reform program,\n            such as between EFAL II and the planned EFAL III, can have\n            costs. 8) Restructuring is an iterative process. 9) Although\n            poverty estimates were lower than expected, targeting\n            remained an important feature of the fiscal stimulus. 10) In\n            an institution with limited capacity for poverty targeting,\n            the simplest program, that is decentralized, may be the best."}, "docdt": "2000-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
