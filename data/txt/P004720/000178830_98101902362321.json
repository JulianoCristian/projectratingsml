the\n            need for creating additional port capacity in the Bangkok\n            and Eastern Seaboard area to service Thailand's growing\n            foreign trade. Specifically, the project aims at raising the\n            operational efficiency of PAT's Klong Toei facilities\n            at Bangkok Port and at converting the ex-naval port of\n            Sattahip for commercial use to handle the diverted traffic\n            in excess of the capacity of the Klong Toei facilities. The\n            physical improvements included in the project consist of:\n            civil works at Klong Toei and Sattahip; mechanical equipment\n            for both ports; floating equipment for Sattahip; and\n            construction of container freight stations and bonded\n            warehouses including procurement of mechanical equipment at\n            Bang Su. The measures to improve operational efficiency at\n            Klong Toei will consist of: reallocation of berths between\n            conventional cargo and container ships; and streamlining\n            cargo handling and container yard operating procedures. In\n            addition the project will provide for technical assistance,\n            training and financial studies to help improve PAT's\n            organizational efficiency; and a study for the future\n            development of ports on the Eastern Seaboard."}, "docdt": "1980-10-31T00:00:00Z"}
