Dear Mr. Sorokin:
We refer to the Loan Agreement (Export Development Project) dated May 15, 1997,

Guarantee Agreement between Ukraine (the Guarantor) and the Bank.  We also refer to your 
request contained in your letter dated May 11, 2001 to extend the Closing Date of the Loan, and 
the understanding reached between the Borrower and the Bank as recorded in the Aide-Memoire 
of the Bank dated February 12, 2002, to introduce certain modifications to the Loan Agreement so 
as to permit the full and most productive utilization of the proceeds of the Loan.
We are pleased to inform you that the Bank, after due consideration, has acceded to the

same Beneficiary Enterprise); provided, however that the foregoing amount will be subject 
to review and change from time to time as determined by the Bank and that the limit of 
said exposure will be reviewed and established by the Bank for every year on the basis of 
an exchange of views of the Project.”
(b)
In paragraph 2 (c), the cut-off date is modified to read “December 31, 2002”.
