years in Ukraine when the\n            country was newly independent. Managing independence and\n            balancing national identity with the relationship with\n            Russia and other competing issues made it difficult for the\n            Government to focus entirely on the implementation. The\n            experience of the EDAL showed that in transition economies\n            the results from policy reforms are far enhanced if they are\n            accompanied by technical assistance (TA). The TA is\n            instrumental in training key players in how to operate in\n            the new environment. The TA component also allowed for low\n            cost experimentation, particularly with sensitive issues\n            like enterprise bankruptcy. In the TA component the\n            Government official who had championed the first and second\n            EDAL loans was removed from his position as head of the\n            State Property Fund. This created a situation in which there\n            was no accountability for the program. The Government\n            recommended that future projects involve a detailed action\n            plan agreed between the Bank and the relevant implementing\n            state agencies on the steps to be taken for the actual\n            implementation of the agreed reforms. Far greater\n            involvement from the Bank's Resident Office would have\n            been most helpful particularly in the early stages of the\n            project. The Government noted it was important to develop a\n            joint strategy for reform and building consensus with all\n            key players."}, "docdt": "2000-06-28T00:00:00Z"}
