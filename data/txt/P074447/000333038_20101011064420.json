The\n            restructuring is in response to the request from the\n            Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The\n            restructuring is intended to achieve the following: (a) to\n            ensure the efficient utilization of resources by\n            re-allocating undisbursed funds under National Project\n            Coordination Unit (NPCU) to states, where resources are\n            needed under the various expenditure categories; and (b) to\n            simplify and build in some flexibility in the disbursement\n            arrangement by pooling all undisbursed funds under a single\n            disbursement category in each state."}, "docdt": "2010-10-07T00:00:00Z"}
