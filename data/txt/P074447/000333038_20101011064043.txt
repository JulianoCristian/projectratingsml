                      RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
1. The restructuring proposal is in response to the request from the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria. The restructuring is intended to achieve the following: (a)
to ensure the efficient utilization of resources by re-allocating undisbursed funds under
NPCU to states, where resources are needed under the various expenditure categories;
and (b) to simplify and build in some flexibility in the disbursement arrangement by
pooling all undisbursed funds under a single disbursement category in each state.

PROJECT STATUS
2. The project was approved by the Board on June 28, 2005, with a total IDA
commitment of SDR 12 million (US$18.1 million) and became effective on October 13,
2005, with a closing date of March 31, 2011. As at September 30, 2010, the project has
disbursed a total of SDR8.29million or 69.07% of the SDR12 million credit and has no
project specific risk flag. In the last Implementation Status and Results (ISR) report
submitted in June 2010, the overall Implementation Progress (IP) was rated Satisfactory
(S), while the likelihood of the project achieving its Development Objective (DO) was
also rated Satisfactory (S).

3. The project has made good progress in the implementation of all key components of
the project in the three participating states. All the three states involved in the project
have adopted a multi-year perspective in planning and budgeting and new charts of
accounts/budget classifications. The states now have the capacity to produce their
monthly financial statements within 21 days after the end of the month and annual
Auditor-General's Reports are submitted to the State Houses of Assemble within 6
months from the end of the accounting year. For the Human Resource Management
component, 2 out of the 3 states have reduced the risk of ghost workers by carrying out
staff audit exercises to clean up the nominal and pay rolls. Under the Budget and
Treasury Management Information System (BATMIS) component, installation and
implementation have advanced in Cross River State while Bauchi and Kaduna States are
expected to sign contracts for the system by the end of September 2010. Based on
current agreements with states and speed of implementation all states would be able to
implement the core modules of BATMIS before the project closes in March 2011.
Overall, the Development Objectives (DO) of the project remains achievable.


PROPOSED CHANGES
4. Re-allocate the sum of SDR 160,000 from the NPCU to the State: The project will
re-allocate the sum of SDR 160,000 from the undisbursed funds of the NPCU to the

                                             4
states which have run out of operating cost and are also low on other categories. This
amount would be split equally among the three states.

5. Pool the disbursement categories in each state: The project will also pool all
undisbursed funds under a single disbursement category in each state in order to provide
flexibility for states to address most urgent and priority needs. This will help achieve
smoother and more seamless disbursement of credit proceeds.


D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY
None of the proposed changes will have a major effect on the original economic,
financial, technical, or social aspects of the project as appraised; nor will they raise the
environmental category of the project or trigger new safeguard policies. A re-appraisal
will therefore not be needed. Finally, the proposed changes will involve no exceptions to
Bank policies
