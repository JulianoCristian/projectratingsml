satisfactory; risk to development outcome was\n            moderate; Bank performance was satisfactory and borrower\n            performance was moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned includes: support from key stakeholders needs to be\n            nurtured during project design and supervision. Capacity\n            building should be undertaken during the design phase, in\n            the period between design and effectiveness, and throughout\n            project implementation. There may have been room for greater\n            synergies and improved efficiency if some project activities\n            had been implemented in collaboration across the three\n            participating states. Intensive supervision supported by\n            adequate additional supervision budgets can turn around a\n            project. A focused piecemeal approach to human resource\n            management is likely to be more successful than broad-based\n            and ambitious reforms. Intensive project implementation\n            facilitation and capacity building are needed if the World\n            Bank is to assist in the modernization of the judiciary in\n            Nigeria. Political economy considerations have to be\n            understood and taken into account when designing and\n            implementing integrated financial management information systems."}, "docdt": "2012-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
