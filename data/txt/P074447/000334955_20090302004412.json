Some of the negative\n            impacts of the project are: disposal of construction and\n            demolition waste on roadsides, noise pollution nearby\n            schools and colleges, air pollution, deterioration of soil\n            characteristic due to increased erosion, water pollution,\n            impacts on vegetations, wildlife impacted through direct\n            loss, loss of movement corridors, and indirectly through\n            introduction of noise and pollutants, risk of road accident\n            during constructions, and solid/hazardous wastes management.\n            Mitigation measures of the project are: 1) regular\n            collection and evacuation of work site refuse towards\n            authorized dumps; 2) involvement of the Local Government\n            Authorities and Communities in the election of discharge\n            sites; 3) installation of sound insulation; 4) introduction\n            of dust reduction measures in construction sites; 5)\n            appropriate containment measures for all operational areas\n            and proper disposal of used lubricants; 6) soil erosion\n            control measures (e.g. reforestation, reseeding of grasses,\n            land preparation, terracing etc); 7) forests and cultural\n            heritage sites protection enforced; 8) preservation,\n            restoration, and enhancement of existing wetland; 9)\n            sensitive and critical habitats avoided; and 10) farmland\n            and grazing areas should be relocated to other areas, if\n            possible avoid farmlands and grazing areas."}, "docdt": "2008-11-01T00:00:00Z"}
