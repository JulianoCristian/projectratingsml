                                    Restructuring Paper

1. This Restructuring Paper seeks your approval for the extension of the closing date of
   the Nigeria State Governance and Capacity Building Project, Credit No. 40840
   (P074447) from March 31, 2011 to December 31, 2011. If this request for extension
   is granted, it will be the second extension of the project and amount to a cumulative
   extension of 21 months. The first extension was approved in October 2009 for a
   period of 12 months, from March 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011. The proposed
   extension is necessary to enable Kaduna and Bauchi States to complete the
   implementation of Budget and Treasury Management Information System (BATMIS)
   contracts signed in October and December 2010 respectively. The Borrower has
   already put in place an action plan to complete the project within the proposed time
   frame.

2. The project was approved by the Board on June 28, 2005, with a total IDA
   commitment of SDR 12 million (US$18.1 million) and became effective on October
   13, 2005, with a closing date of March 31, 2011. As at January 26, 2011, the project
   has disbursed a total of SDR8.71million or 72.54% of the SDR 12 million credit and
   has no project specific risk flag. In the last Implementation Status and Results (ISR)
   report submitted in June 2010, the project was rated Satisfactory (S) both in terms of
   Implementation Progress (IP) and the likelihood of the project achieving its
   Development Objective (DO).

3. There has been significant progress in the implementation of key components of the
   progress. In the area of financial reporting, all the three states involved in the project
   met their targets of submitting their annual financial statements together with the
   Auditor-General's Reports to the State Houses of Assemble within 6 months from the
   end of the accounting year, down from an average of two years at the inception of the
   project. In the area of budget reforms, based on agreed outcomes, all three states have
   adopted multi-year perspective in fiscal planning and budgeting. Under the BATMIS
   component, user acceptance tests were successfully executed in Cross River State in
   November 2010 and the system became operational in January 2011. Overall, the
   Development Objectives (DO) of the project remains achievable.

4. The implementing entities are compliant with the Bank's financial management requirements;
   and there are no overdue audit reports and interim financial reports from these entities.
