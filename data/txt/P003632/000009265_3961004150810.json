More specifically, it\n            addresses identified needs that emerged from the\n            Environmental Strategy Paper and its review with the\n            Government. Those needs are: (a) to improve coordination of\n            environmental monitoring and ecological research; (b) to\n            promote cleaner industrial production, pollution prevention\n            and waste minimization technologies; (c) to enhance economic\n            policy instruments for pollution control, especially the\n            pollution levy system; and (d) to strengthen the Chinese\n            system of environmental assessments (EA). Another objective\n            is to improve interagency and interministerial coordination\n            for improved environmental management. The project consists\n            of three main components: (i) CAS ecological research and\n            monitoring which began in 1989 to design a Chinese Ecosystem\n            Research Network (CERN) to strengthen long-term ecological\n            research in China and to generate scientifically-valid\n            ecological information that could be used for sustainable\n            natural resource management and agricultural development;\n            (ii) NEPA technical assistance program provides technical\n            assistance; and (iii) environmental impact assessment system."}, "docdt": "1993-05-26T00:00:00Z"}
