The reasons for success in technical\n            assistance (TA) and capacity building projects outline five\n            factors, namely, overall country policy and institutional\n            capability, country income level, strong borrower ownership\n            and implementing agencies managerial capacity, use of local\n            consultants, and, intensive Bank supervision, all of which\n            contributed to the success of the Project. Yet, regardless\n            of success, several lessons suggest the following.\n            Methodologies for project design, performance monitoring and\n            evaluation, suggest that even newer mechanisms for project\n            management are of limited and variable operational utility,\n            unless a careful, selective approach is taken in designing\n            them, and using them with common sense, as part of a shared\n            effort at performance improvement over the long term, where\n            indicators can make an important contribution to project\n            effectiveness, and capacity development. Centralized\n            procurement of scientific equipment seems to have been a\n            problem, however, a decentralized approach might have been\n            better, particularly given the large number of institutions\n            involved, and a larger allowance provided for procurement on\n            the basis of shopping. Notwithstanding, the success of the\n            Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) component emphasizes the\n            value of designing such projects in an integrated way, to\n            address all elements of the research agenda: upgrading\n            facilities, procuring scientific equipment, computers and\n            software, and, training personnel, with an emphasis on\n            overseas training and increasing international cooperative research."}, "docdt": "2003-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
