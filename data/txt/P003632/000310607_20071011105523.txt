 About this Report

        The Independent Evaluatron Group assesses the programs and actrvrtres of the World Bank for two purposes
 first, to ensure the rntegrity of the Bank's self-evaluatron process and to verlfy that the Bank's work IS producing the
 expected results, and second, to help develop improved drrectrons, pol~c~es,and procedures through the
 d~ssemrnatronof lessons drawn from experience As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
 the Bank's lending operations through field work Inselectrng operatrons for assessment, preference        IS glven to those
 that are rnnovative, large, or complex, those that are relevant to upcomlng studres or country evaluations. those for
 whrch Execut~veDirectors or Bank management have requested assessments, and those that are hkely to generate
 important lessons

        To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project flles and other
 documents. rnterv~ewoperational staff vis~tthe borrow~ngcountry to discuss the operation w~ththe government,
 and other in-country stakeholders, and rnterview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
 rn local offrces as approprtate

        Each PPAR IS subject to Internal IEGWB peer revlew, Panel review, and management approval Once cleared
 internally, the PPAR IS commented on by the respons~bleBank department IEGWB incorporates the comments as
 relevant The completed PPAR IS the^ sent to the borrower for review the borrowers' comments are attached to
 the document that is sent to the Bank"s Board of Executive Drrectors After an assessment report has been sent to

 About the IEGWB Rating System

        IEGWB's use of multiple evaluatron methods offers both rrgor and a necessary level of flexrbrltty to adapt to
 lendrng instrument, prolect desrgn, or sectoral approach IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basrc method to
 arrrve at therr project ratrngs Following   ISthe defrn~tlonand rating scale used for each evaluatron cr~terion
 (addrtronal rnformatron IS ava~lableon the IEGWB website http //worldbank orglreg)

Preface


        TINSis the Project Perf'os~nanceAssessn~entRepoi-t (PPAR)prepared by IEG for
the China: Environmental Technical Assistance Project (IDA Credit -25220). The credit
was approved on June 22, 1993 for an amount of US$50.0 million equihalent. The
Chinese Government was to provide an additional USS26.0 million equivalent. The
borrower was the Chinese Government, and the implementing agencies were the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CASc). The date of credit effectiveness was November 11. 1993, and the credit was
closed on December 30, 2002, four years after the originally scheduled date of December
31. 1998, with IsTS$48.9million of the funds disbursed.

        The project \\;as chosen for assessment to sene as a key input, anlong other
country case studies, for the Environmental Effectiveness Evaluation Study for the World
Bank Group being carried out b j IEG. Also. it was the only Bank credit focusing
exclusively on institutional development for environn~entalmanagement in China, and
only one of a few such projects funded by the Bank worldwide.

        IEG prepared t h ~report based on an examination of the relevant Memorandum &
                           s
Recommendation of the President, Implementation Completion Report (ICR), legal
asreements, project files and archives, as well as other relevant reports. memoranda. and
working papers. Discussions were also held with a number of existing and former Bank

Bank in 1993.ETAP &-asthe only IDA credit focusing exclusively on institutional
development for entironmental management in China. and only one of a feh such projects
funded by the Bank worldwide. The project focuses on one of the main pillars of the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategies for China during 1990-2006. namely, the strengthen~ngof
environmental management. The actual project cost was US$67.30 million compared to the
appraisal estimate of USS76 million. The project was completed in 2002 instead of 1998 as
planned, following an extension of four years after the Bank agreed to the request of the
Governinent of China to restructure the project in response its a new initiative on a large-scale
regional development program for the "Great Opening Up of the West"

         ETAP sought to strengthen the capacities and programs of tM-o iilstitutions of national
importance for environmental management in China, namely: (i) the State Environmental
Protection Agency (SEPA); and (ii) the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASc). The five
specific objectives of the project were:

    (a) improve coordiilation of environmental monitorin and ecological research:
    (b) promote cleaner industrial production. pollution prevention and waste
         minimization technologies:
    (c) enhance economic policv instruments for pollution control. especially the
         pollution levy system;
    (d) strengthen the Chinese system of environmental assessments (EA); and
    (e) strengthen inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination for improved
         environmental management.

         The Outcome of the project is rated Satisfactory. All the objectives were
substantially achieved except the last objective relating to inter-agency and inter-m~nisterial
coordination which was modestly achieved. ETAP improved coordination between SEPA
and CASc, helped link 95 databases and 18websites, and established the Chinese
Biodiversity Information System (CBIS). The project helped introduce several pieces of new
legislation, guidelines, institutions and policies through its subprojects, including the
adoption of the State Cleaner Production Act promoting national and local cleaner production
centers, and phasing out lead in gasoline, The national pollution levy structure was revised.
Study tours provided senior researchers as well as younger scientists with valuable exposure
to iilternational experience in environmental management and environmental assessment, and
helped establish important contacts with professional counterparts that yielded further
training opportunities+Attempts to improve inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination
met with mixed success.

         The Ministry of Finance practice (which is also prevalent in other TA projects in
China) of passing on Bank and IDA funds as loails (rather than grants) to "knowledge
institutions" encouraged them to place emphasis on revenue-earning activities, irrespective of
their contribution to knowledge management. On another count, computer equipment that

SEPA and CASc showed generally strong and consistent commitment and participation right
from the project preparation stage. GOC; SEPA and ('ASc have made budgetary arrangements to
ensure the sustainability of the institutions and processes developed by the project.

         rhe Bank's Performance is rated Higlaly Satisfactory. Project preparation was
conducted by the same team that produced the first China Environment Strategy Paper
(1992), thus giving ETAP strong analytical underpinnings. While resources above the
nonn were committed to project supervision, a high level continuity was achieved
thro~lghextended association of the same task managers and principal consultants.
Discussions with CASc and SEPA suggest that the Bank added value through its ability
to: (i) facilitate access to international experience and expertise in various aspects of
environmental management; (ii) promote improvements in project design and appraisal
procedures; (1i1)facilitate the consultation and participation of various stakeholders; and
(iv) foresee issues and broker an agenda for addressing these problems.

         The Borro\\ er's Performance is also rated Highly Satisfactory. GOC. as well as
SEPA and CASc, participated actively in the project design and preparation stage,
demonstrated flexibility throughout implementation, showed openness to new ideas, and
niade satisfactory budgetary provisions for sustaiiling the galns from the project.

         Important lessons from the project are:


    In large TA projects, a programmatic approach may be preferred, with general
    agreement on overall objectives and a first year work-plan followed by iterative
    developmeiit of subsequent stages based on experience and changlng circumstances.
    Active involvement of functional or line departments can greatly raise the quality of
    outputs and development impacts of TA subprojects.
    In designing environmental capacity-building projects, the strengthening of sub-
    national environmental institutions-which        often exercise enforcement authority--is
    equally if not more important than that of the apex environmental ayency.
    Passing-on IDA credits as a loan rather than as a grant to non-revenue-generating
    entitles creates distortions in priorities and work programs, as these entities shlft their
    focus to seeking payments for sen.ices rather than conducting independent research.
    data-moiiitoring and information dissemination.

worsening environment problems. where the Bank can potentially pla:; a useful role in

1. Background and C'ontext


Environmental Issues in China

1.I     With a population of 1.3billion. China--the world's fourth largest economy and
the third largest trading nation--has succeeded in reducing poverty by almost one-third
bet\+een 2001 and 2004. Even so, China remains a developing country. with GDP per
capita about $1,740 and more than 135 million people living on less than $1 a day. With
sound macroeconomic management, China can potentially maintain a growth rate of
9.0% through 2006-10, and beyond. But it also faces daunting challenges in nlaintaining
such rapid growth: addressing the resultii~ginequalities in income and opportunity; and
managing the resource demands and environmental consequences of growth.

1.2     China faces serious environmental problems on many fronts, including air and
water pollution (especiallyin urban areas), land degradation, loss of biodiversity. and
unsustainable use of i~aturalresources. Record rates of economic growth, urban~zation
and industrialization in recent years have generated environmental impacts and
accelerated many advcrse trends Plausible estimates of environmental costs made dunng
the late 1990s and early 2000s, vary from 3 percent to 15 percent of China's GDP.
Because of China's s i ~ esome of the effects. such as greenhouse gas emissions. are also
                              ,
worldwide.

1.3     From the 1990s, the Government of China (GoC') has paid increased attention to
the environment, spurred by widely publicized international reports, and by negative
environmental events in China. For instance, widespread illness In 1904 among users of
thc Huai River in China's industrial Northern Plain was a turning point, resulting in the
closure of over 75,000 small, but highly polluting town and village enterprises (TVE)
nationwide. Floods in 1997 and 1998 prompted the introduction of a logging ban In
sensitive areas. GoC has taken several measures over the years, including more open
environmental reporting, price incentives, and new laws and regulations to address
environmental problems. In 2005, a cross-border environmental crisis was created by a
chemical pollution spill in Northeast China which Russia's Amur river from China's
Songhua River. Leaders regularly address environmental issues in major speeches and
China has adopted "sustainable development7'as a guiding pnnciple for its 1lth Five-
Year Plan (2006-2010). As a result of these policy shifts, China has had some successes
in reversing or containing some forms of environmental degradation. though serious
problems remain and f~~turetrends are uncertain

The World Bank's Environmental Assistance

1.5       Whlle this PPAR focuses on one (and the Bank's only) environmental institutions
capacity-building project in China, it is important to appreciate the full extent and overall
scorecard for the Bank's assistance for the environnient in China. Thrs capac~ty-building
project has played a critical role given the vast scope of the Bank's environnient lending
in China. There continues to be a significant need to strengthen environmental
institutions in China, particularly at the provincial level. given the Bank's emphasis on
infrastructure lending to provinces. the strong incidence of environniental issues across
the infrastructure sub-sectors. the susceptibility of the Bank's portfolio to Category A
environmental assessments. the need to reform incentive systems to enhance compliailcc,
and the worsening overall environmental conditions as China's rapid growth overtakes
gains froin past and ongoing efforts at environmental management. (These points are
discussed below and in Section 5). To cite a specific example, a recent PPAR~prepared
in conjunction with IEG's Environniental Effectiveness Evaluation Study found that the
institutional capacity of Zhejiang's EPB was far lower than the potentlal capacity
measured by its financial resources and staffing. The PPAR also notes the prevailing
incentive for EPBs to continue to extract payments (informal or explicit fines) from
transgressors rather than close down or fix pollutlilg enterprises. At the same lime, it niust
be kept in mind that the scale of interventions required to address capacity-building of
environmental institutions in China         IS daunting and complex, given the country's s17e.
and the large number of EPBs. Generally speaking. the Bank's efforts need to be seen in
this perspective, and leveraged for maximum impact.

During FYI 990-2006, the Bank approved 198 projects for China, of which 118 pro-jects
contained environmental components4.Of the 118 projects, 70 were closed (completed)
as of December 2006, while the remaining 48 were active. The largcst number of these
projects with environment components lies in the Bank's rural development sector
lending program, followed by the water, energy, transport, and urban sectors. and finally
by the urban environnlent sector. The low number of projects (5) exclusively in the
"Environment" category is due to the Bank's strategy of mainstreaming environmental

1.7      The strengthening of environmental institutions has been a major area of
tlzematic emphasis, although the Bank has financed only one capacity-building project.
Across the distribution of different environmental objectives among environment
projects, institutional and capacity building objectives (93) occurred most frequently,
followed by pollution management including health issues (591, water resources
management (271, poverty-environment linkages (281, land and forestry (251, climate
change (37).and biodiversity issues (3).

I .8    Projects with environmental conzporzentsperform relatively better than other
projects. Based on the portfolio reviewrthat was carried out for the China Environment
Country Case Study under the World Bank Group Environmental Effectiveness
Evaluation Studv, the percentage of projects in China with acceptable levels of
performance in terms of Outcoinc and Sustai~~abilitywas significantly higher for projects
with enviro~imentcomponents compared to "Other" projects, but sigificantly lower for

2. Project Objectives and Design


Objectives

2.1      fhe project sought to strengthen the capacitres and selected policics and progranls
of two rnstitutions of national importance          10 China's environment through technical
assistance (TA), namely:      (1)the Kational Erlvironmental Protection Agency or NEPA,
later upgraded to State Environmental Protection '4gency or SEPA"); and (ii) the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASc). Specifically, the project supported the following
objectives:

        (a) improve coordination of environmental monitoring and ecological research;
        (b) promote cleaner industrial production, pollution prevention and waste
        minimization technologies;
        (c) enhance economic policy instn~illeiltsfor pollution control, especially thc
        pollution levy system:
        (d) strengthen the Chinese system of environmental assessments (EA); and
        (e) strengthen interagency and inter-ministerial coordiilation for improved
        environmental management.




 SEPA nas set LIP as a ministry at the end of March 1998 when the Kational Envliollmental Protection
,Agency (NEPA) mas ~~pgradedfiom a sub-ministry to a min~rtryand re-named

Components

2.2     At appraisal. the project cons~stedof threemain  co~~~ponents:

(a) CASc ecological research and monitoring (uhich begail in 1'189) to design a Chinese
Ecosystem Research Ketuork (CERN) to strengthen long-term ecological research in
China and to generate scientifically valid ecological information that could be used for
sustainable natural resource management and agricultural development;
(b) NEPA (later upgraded to SEPA) technical assistance program; and
(c) environmental impact assessment system.

2.3     The revised project components--after expansion of project scope in 1998--are
stated in the ICR as follows:

CASc Component (US$33.20 million, actual cost). The objective of this component was
to improve the knowledge and understanding of China's biological resources and
ecological environment by upgrading long-term research, ~nlproving data collection and
management systems for monitoring environmental changes, and linking research results
to the policy-making process. This objective was to have been achieved through
investments in two programs being implemented by the Academy:

        Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN)
        Biodiversity Research and lnformation Management (BRIM)


SEPA Component (USX34.10 million, actual cost). The SEPA component comprised a
large number of sub-projects within five main categories of work:
(a) Institutional Management and Capacity Building
(b) Environmental Monitoring and Information Systems
(c) Cleaner Industrial Production and Pollution Prevention
(d) Environment and Ecological Studies
(e) Environmental Impact Assessment Systems

2.4     In response to the Government's request to expand ETAP's objectives to support
its "Great Opening up of the MTest" regional development program, the Bank agreed in
1998 to restructure ETAP in order to strengthen the administrative, management and
environmental monitoring capacity of research institutes and monitoring networks
located in the central and western regions of China. Accordingly, the closing date was
extended from December 31. 1998, as originally appraised. to September 30. 2002 (later
extended to December 31. 2002 to complete equipment delivery), No cost reallocations
were involved for this purpose.

Quality At Entry

2.5     ETAP's design and preparation is rated satisfactory. The project benefited greatly
from the fact that the Bank team had also been previously involved with preparing the
China Environmental Strategy Paper and had established a good relationship and
dialogue with SEPA and CASc. Through bilateral trust funds, the Bank arranged
analytical support from a wide range of international consultants. By the time of project

appro! al, the detailed tenlls of refercl~et.,norh plans and hudgets for almost all oi the
sub-projects ncru :~lreadyin place I'l~cWanh also urganl:~cdworkshops on R;inl*

Board approval. 1.e.. almost 3 years fro111identiticatio~ito Board presentation. 111part, thls
is due to the one year that it took to map out the various subprojects under each of the
project components.

Implementation Experience

COSTS

2.6     The actual project cost was US$67.30 million as against the appraisal estimate of
C'SS76 million. After the project's scope was expanded in 1'398,the closing date of the
IDA credit was extended to December 2002, four years after the original closing date of
1998. GOC expenditures were US$18.40 million against US$26 inillion at appraisal.

2.7     111June, 2003, the IDA Board agreed to reallocate approximately SDR0.8 millioil
(US$1.01 million) of undisbursed funds from the project to permit an emergency
response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) public health emergency in
China. This activity was under implementation in 2006, and is not covered by this report.



3.5       Tn addition to ~~orkshopss n procurement and tiisbursenlent at project entr),
additional workshops were held during implen~entation.An international consultant on
the procurement of information systems was cominissioned to provide a training
workshop for CASc and SEPA staff. But these two agencies, the Bank team, and the
consultant as well all found themselves constrained by the prevailing Bank procurement
procedures. Meanwhile, the Rank's Reijing office was stepping up its assistance in these
two areas as local Rank staff numbers increased. However. the timely provision of
feedback to CASc and SEPA when they submitted terms of reference and subsequent
draft and final reports for cornment remained a frequent problem, since the Bank staff
with the requisite expertise m-ereeither unavailable or considered such reviews a lower
priority in their respective work programs.

2.9     In terms of the overall project experience, both the CASc and SEPA counterparts
were particularly critical of Bank procurement procedures, which they felt were too time-
consuming. For instance, computer equipment that was ordered under the project was
out-dated by the time Bank's procurement procedures had been complied 1%-ith.In
general, the Bank's procurement procedures may be too slow and complex for the
requirements of scientific institutions, pointing to the need for greater flexibilit) and
decentralization in such cases

2.10    One of the ET-4P's key objectives is precisely to improve ecological data
collection, strengthen systems for monitoring environmental changes, and link results to
policy-making. Consequently, the design, implementation and utilization of the M & E
system for the project is discussed under Section 3 on "Results".

3. Results (by Objective)


3.1      The ETAP's overall objectives of strengthening CASc and SEPA were
substanfiallj~achieved. Thc projcct was well integrated into the core operations of both
CASc and SEPA, and was an integral part of larger and substantive development
programs to which the government was consistently committed, The CASc and SEPA
components supported five major objectives, for which the specific achievements are
assessed below.

Objective (a): Intprove coordination of envirorimental nionitoring and ecological research
Szibstaritially Achieved.


3.2      This objective was sought to be achieljed by investing in BRIM and CERN
programs that were being implemented by CASc. BRIM'S goal was to enhance the
ability of CASc to generate, manage and disseminate information on biodiversity
conservation and sustainable management of biological resources. CERN intended to
upgrade the long-term research capability of CASc, and ETAP was designed to support
the first five years of a 25-year development program for this purpose. Policy studies and
training programs exceeded expectations in building awareness and capacity for research
(through the Chinese Research Academy of bnvironmental Sciences or CRAES) and
rcgulation (SEPA).

3.3     BRIM. The BRIM progranl enhanced the research capacity of the participating
institutes for carrying out biodiversity-related research, linked biodiversity information
kept at various CASc institutes. populari~edbiodiversity concepts, and provided relevant
information to government policy makers, while attracting international funding for
research. Specific achieve~nentsincluded the p~lblicationof 1,800 scientific papers. and
the establishment of the Chinese Biodiversity Informatiol~System (CBIS) with 95 linked
databases and 18 websites. These achievements appear financially sustainable due to
committed funding from CASc and other sources.

3.3      CERN. The scope, capacity and quality of CERN's research activities expanded
opportunities for Chinese officials for research and training oversas; helped d iersifj
                                                                                      ~
sources of funding; and improved capacity to influence government policy. These
outcomes appear financially sustainable due to expanding access to CASc and non-CASc
funding. However, sustainability of the CERN information system under this
subcomponent appears less likely unless current problems in design and implementation--
top-down planning and excessive centralization--are addressed. CERN needs to
strengthen its management arrangements and rationalbe parallel operational and advlsory
f~lnctionsbeing performed by other parts of the bureaucracy.

3.5     Environmental Information Centers (EICs). EICs were created in all provincial
EPBs. The upgrading of China's Global Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS) led
to it being rated as among the best in the world by the mid-1990s. The subcomponent for
strengthening the reliability of environmental monitoring and measurement of standards
succeeded in developing and testing standardized reference materials for environmental

3.6     Component in support of the "Great Opening- Up of the West". This additional
                                                                 -,


component was reported as having beell ~mplemeilledwell. _Moslof the residual funds
were used to purchase advanced equipment for automated real-time air and water quality
inonitoriilg stations in 20 cities of 12 western provinces, anrl to strengthen lake water
quality monitoring system relating to nine major lakes in Yunnan province.

Objective (b): Promote cleaner industrialproduction, pollutio~zprevention and waste
minimization technologies        -  Substantially -4chieved.


3.7     The State Clean Production Act and Clean Production (C'P) Centers, 'This Act
was introduced with inputs from ETAP. Specific achievements included the
establishment of 54 CP centers nationwide, production and sale of 10,000 copies of
guidelines on CP, training of about 1,000persons including 20 CP auditors who form the
core expertise in the now independently funded National Cleaner Production Center. Of
the 29 firms that undertook pilot CP audits, 17 continued to realize economic and
environmental benefits from follow-up changes in their production processes. However.
five pilot CP industrial investments were unable to achieve overall viability. The study on
reducing pollution fi-om town and village enterprises did not break much new ground in
its recommendations. A report on C:P for the chemical industry produced by the
Environmental Protection Research Institute was not followed up due to reorganization
involving the Minlstry of Chemical lndustry and limited involvement of SEPA.

3.8     Pollution Control in the Transport Sector. The motor vehicle pollution coiltrol
study raised awareness and capacity for research and policy-making in this area. though it
was difficult to assess the impacts of vehicle testing and data collection. Folloning the
study, there was a national phase-out of leaded gasoline. Euro17vehicle emissions
standards were introduced in the country in 1999, and Beijing in particular was poised to
move to Euro 3 standards. The study focusing on development policy for ecological
agriculture was of low utility due to methodological and administrative issues as uell as
limited involvement of SEPA.

Objective (c): Enhance eco~tomicpolicy instrume~ttsfir pollution control, especially
the pollutio~tlevy system         Substantially Achieved.
                                -




3.9      ETAP helped to enhance economic policy instruments for pollution control,
especially the pollution levy system. A pollution levy study by C U E S paved the way for
subsequent national law and regulcitions on the subject, consistent with GOC's overall
financial and fiscal reform program of the late 1990s. The issue of pollution control
instruments and the need to reform the system of incentives are discussed in detail in
Section 5 on "Conclusions and Lessons Learned".

approval. Training on EA appears to have been partially successful in terms of numbers
trained and quality of training, though feedback from Bank staff suggests that costs per
trainee seemed higher than for comparable training. Training has resulted in more
effective use of human resources in SEPA and the EPBs. At project closing, however. a
cutback in the number of officials in SEPA's personnel department, which was part of a
larger administrative action, may have reduced the impact of the training, As a result of
ETAP, CASc scientists were able to participate in national and international projects.
Younger scientists grew into new and more senior roles, and were promoted to leadership
positions in CASc and other institutes.

3.11   Attempts to improve inter-agency and ~nter-ministerialcoordination for better
environmental management met with mixed success. The BRIM program did succeed in
prov~dingrelevant information to government policy makers, while attracting
lntenlational funding for research. But despite substantial achievenients relating to
publication of scientiiic papers, and the establishment of the CBTS, d~rectlinks to policy-
making bodies were not fully developed.

4. Ratings


Outcome

4.1    Based on the ratings for relevance, efficacy, and efficiency discussed immediately
below, the outcome of the E'I'AP is rated satisfactory, The project objectives were
achieved with a mix of satisfactory and highly satisfactory ratings, with some
shortcomings of varying magnitude, The human resource development aspects of the
project have been particularly successful in introducing new environmental management
approaches, facilitating the exchange of international learning experiences, and adapting
that knowledge to Chinese conditions. Moreover, several new pieces of environmental
policies, legislation, guidelines, and institutions resulted from the subprojects, including
the State Clean Production Act, national or local CP centers, revisioris in China's
pollution levy structure, and the phase-out of lead in gasoline.

prime mover in the environmental policy arena. SEPA is involved, but from the side. It
generates a lot of studies and TA, and monitors a lot of data, but decisions are made at a
higher level and SEPA is "carried along" whether it is proactive or not. Inter-m~nistenal
coordination (vertical and horizontal) can still be much improved. SEPAjust established
SEPA-managed regional offices, which is a step in the right direction.



4.2      The rele~ance of the ETAP is high. The project's capacity-building activities
targeted the two institutions with the most important mandates and sets of responsibilities
for environmental management in China. Moreover, its well chosen objectives focused
on addressing the key weaknesses in environmental management in China at the time of
preparation and appraisal. which were to: (i) strengthen the Chinese EA system; (ii)
enhance the effectiveness of pollution management instruments: (iii) prevent pollution
and minimi7e waste in the first place; (iv) coordinate among the various agencies and
ministries that were (or should be) involved in environmental management: and (v)
monitor ecological information in order to link research results to policy-making and
improve natural resource management

4.3      The strengthening of environmental management is one of the main pillars in all
of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategies for China during 1990-2006 In the Bank's
strategy documents, the need for strong environmental institutions has accompanied other
key themes of market-based growth, poverty reduction, infrastructure development and
rural development. There have been some shifts in emphases across the three CASs, as
-mound   conditions and priorities have changed over the years. The 1995 Country
Assistance Strategy focused specifically on China's regulatory framework for the
environment, and the capacity of the then- NEPA to implement the National
Environmental Action Plan. The 1997 Country Assistance Strategy addressed the
application of instruments for improved environmental management. In its sector work,
the project's objectives also had high relevance. In the Air, Land and Water document
(ALW, 2001). it was reco-gnized that:

         China's environmental agenda was becoming too complex for SEPA alone. and
         ulould require more cross-ministry and agency coordination and involvement:
         Systemic iiscal and budgetary problems result in lack of sufficient resources for
         environmental institutions; and
         GoC should go beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach and diversify its
         environmental tools to better fit the variety of environmental problems being
         experienced in different parts of the country.

4.4      The project closed in 2002 but its capacity-building objectives remain as. if not
more, relevant today. The 2003 Country Assistance Strategy addressed more broadly the
strengthening and effectiveness of environmental institutions. This set the stage for
addressing priorities identified in the 2006 Country Partnership Strategy, including the

         biodiversity protection, as well as addressing biodiversity loss and grassland
         desertification, particularly in poor and vulnerable areas.



4.5      The efficacy of ETAP is rated high. As discussed on the foregoing Section 3 on
""Results",the project's objectives w-ereachieved albeit with soine shortcomings:

         The capacity-building interventions had relatively less impact on SEPA itself
         'The MOF's policy of passing the Bank and IDA funds to the EPS as loans rather
         than grants undermined the incentive for better performance.
         Computer equipment that \+-asordered under the project was out of date by the
         time the Bank's procurement procedures \\rere complied with. In general. the
         Bank's procurement procedures may be too slow and complex for the
         requirements of scientific institutions, pointing to the need for greater flex~bil~ty
          and decentrali~ationin such cases.
          Some pilot CP industrial investments were not viable. The study on reducing
         pollution from small enterprises produced recommendations that were already
          known. Follow-up \+-asweak in some activities, e.g.. the sub-reports produced for
         the national ecological monitoring network. The study on ecological agriculture
         had little support from SEPA and ran into procedural issues.

EFFICIENCY

4.6      As a technical assistance project, an economic internal rate of return is not
applicable and was not calculated, hence ETAP's efficiency is izot rated. Soine cost-
effectiveness measures, however, can be cited. The cost of each trainee for
Environmental Assessments appeared high compared to similar training in other
countries.


Risk to Development Outcome

4.7      The risk to ETAP's development outcome is rated low. The BRIM program for
biodiversity-related research and the CBIS appear financially sustainable due to
committed funding from CASc and other sources. C'Ekl's research activities also appear
to be financially sustainable due to expanding access to CASc and non-CASc funding.

4.8     As a further evidence of sustainability. the CERN component of ETAP has spun
off the Chinese National Ecosystem Obsenation and Research Network (CNEORS). It
has 55 stations (of which 33 were the original CERN stations) and a synthesis center. It
is funded and operated by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), to which
CASc provides regular advice on environ~nentalmatters. MOST is a younger institution
than CASc, and many of MOST ministers came from CASc. Other CNEORN partners
include the State Forestry Administration, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry
of Education.

Bank Performance

4.9     The Bank's performance was highly safisfacfory The Bank helped CASc and
SEPA establish rigorous progress reporting procedures. The Bank supemision teams
visited the field at regular six-month intervals and had the right mix of technical and
other skills. Unlike many Bank projects that IEG has evaluated, continuity was good:
there Lvere only two Task Managers over the nine-year implenientation period. and t~ o
consultants remained engaged from preparation to closure. The Bank missions benefited
from a smooth and effectike working relationship with both CASc and SEPA. The project
iiles and IEG intervieus reveal a consistent and excellent level of cooperation anlong the
project implementation units and the participating institutions. This helped resolve
implementation problems in a frank and constructive manner. Cost effectiveness-wise,
ETAP7ssupervision was highly staff-intensive and exceeded the Bank's norms. On the
other hand, the high quality of the Bank's supen~isionperformance was endorsed by
CASc and SEPA at the ICR workshop.

4.10    One issue is the Bank's reluctance to reallocate savings. which may have
impacted on project perforn~ance.Project records show that the Bank's management
often rejected borrower requests to reallocate savings, despite the flexibility of project
team members. Even small reallocation requests Lvere turned down. According to field
interviews. as a result of this rigidity, from one-fourth to one-third of SEPA's activities
under the project did not reach satisfactory lekels of perforn~ance.

4.11    The performance of the Borrower and the implementing agencies is rated highly
safisfacfory.During implementation, MOF and other parts of the Government gave broad
support to SEPA and CASc, including budget allocations and endorsements of
environmental policy. These laid the basis for the satisfactory outcomes of project
activities and minimized risks to development outcome. From senior management to
working levels alike, CASc and SEPA demonstrated considerable capacity and strong
commitment to implement and learn from the project. CASc and SEPA were able to
resolve the initial problems associated with trying to prepare a large number of
subprojects and coordinating many participating institutions. The upper management

4.12    There were three shortcomings. First, the quality of supervision by the functional
departments and divisions in SEPA was uneven, particularly with respect to reviewing
the progress and quality of interim outputs arid the quality of final outputs. The more
involved the responsible SEPA department is, the greater the success and results of the
subproject. Second, with respect to the CASc component, the decisions related to
equipment and information system design could have been more decentralized, and a
better assessment of needs assessments could have been done at the research institute
level or at the site during the design phase. Third, MOF's on-lending policy for the IDA
proceeds that were passed on to SEPA resulted in multiple problems, as discussed
separately below.



4.13    The Chinese Governnlent's on-lending policy for TA funds had distortionary
effects on the project. The Bank was aware that the Ministry of Finance w-ould on-lend
to SEPA its portion of the IDA credit in the form of a low-~nterestloan. Howe-cer, the
Rank was not infornied until after project approval that. in turn, SEPA would on-lend
most of the funds to the participating institutions such as the provincial-level
Er~vironmentalProtection Bureaus (EPBs), despite the fact that ETAP's products cannot
be expected to generate revenues. This lack of inforniation prevented the Bank from
discussing the shortconlings of this arrangement w-ithSEPA and the Ministry of Finance
(MOF). This was an important disadvantage for the project, since the Bank had already
learned from experiences under earlier TA projects that this on-lending approach had
multiple distorting effects on (i) the selection of project participants and (ii) the mix of
training versus equipment procurement. This issue, which w-asnot unique to ETAP but
was (and remains) generic to the China lending program, has been the subject of
discussion w-iththe MOF for many years. The MOF is cognizant of the problem but
remains convinced that the drive for high levels of financial accountability offsets the
negative effects of the on-lending policy.



5. Conclusions and Lessons


5.1     For projects of the scope and size such as E T M , longer implcn~entatior?periods
should be provided upfront, to allow a more logical relationship between
TrainingiTechnical Assistailce (T/TA) and procurement. A desirable sequence in this
regard would be: TITA, review of institute programs, identification of equipment needs,
and procurement of equipment. Also, the subprojects with the highest quality outputs and
development impacts were most often those in which the functional or line departments
of SEPA were actively involved and in w-hichthe training components were the most

    development of subsequent stages based on experience and changing circumstances.


    Active involvement of functional or line departments can greatly raise the quality of
    outputs and development impacts of TA subprojects.


    In designing environmental capacity-building projects, the strengthening of sub-
    national environmental institutions----whichoften exercise enfbrcement authority--1s
    equally if not more important than that of the apex environmental agency.


    Passing-on IDA credits as a loan (rather than as a grant) to essentially non-revenue-
    generating entities creates distortions in their priorities and work programs. as these
    entities shift their focus more towards revenue-generating activities that may not
    always address fhe core knowledge management tasks of conducting independent
    research. data-monitoring and information dissemination.

The following section assesses--based on ETAP's experience--the broader issues and
challenges facing the Government in terms of further strengthening environmental
institutions in China, and the prospects for partnership with the Bank in this area.


CHAI.I,F~GFSTHF SUBNATIONAL
                 4T                        I,FVEI

5.2     Structurally, SEPA's ability to implement comprehensive national environnient
policies has been limited by the high degree of administrative decentralization, local
prioritization of investment and employment, vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalance,
and absence of clear accountability for environmental conditions. Grass-roots
implementation of environmental policies is the responsibility of over 100,000 employees
of provincial and local Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPB), who are nominally
under SEPA supervision but whose salaries are paid by the local administrations, creating
a potential conflict of loyalties. Local governments are usually more concerned with
economic growth and emplo~mentthan they are with adhering to national environmental
mandates. It is important to note that the legal system for compliance and enforcement is
used sparingly, although it is slowly increasing. with actions brought by the victims af
pollution receiving press attention.

5.3     Policj*implemeittatioit relies on sub-national iizstitutions. Relative ta the
Bank's counterparts in the major infrastnlcture sectors (e.g., energy. transport, and water
resources), SEPA lacks the financial resources that could attract greater cooperation from

heavily on the conln~itnlealtof local officials and leaders. such as governors and mayors.
though public opinion is becoming an increasingly inlportant factor

5.4     But institutional weaknesses at the level of the EPBs constitute a major
constraint in effective supervision and monitoring of contpliance with environntental
regulations. As mentioned above, while EPBs are nomillally under SEPA supervision.
they are paid by the local administrations, creating the potential for a conflict of EPB
loyalties between the national and local levels, and possible leniency in imposing
pollution levies on local polluters. For instance, the pollution levy collected in 2006 for
all polIuting substances was $1.2 billion, even though the expected collections from SO2
emissions alone should have exceed this amount. Wastewater is another example of
institutional weakness. The State Council and the National De~elopmentand Reform
Council (NDRC) have mandated that end-users should pay for sewage treatment, while
leaving it to the localJmunicipa1governments to decide on the criteria and level of tariffs.
The localimunicipal governments have been setting tariffs based on "affordability" rather
than full cost recovery, thus raising major issues about the financial viability of these
sewage treatment utilities.

5.5     Technical capacity and resources made available to EPBs, particularly at the
lower levels such as counties and townships, need to be significantly increased. At the
same time, more effoi-t is required to c1:isilj hori~on~aland tertical relationships of
autliority and responsibilities at all levels national, provinciali'municipal; and for
                                             -

improving pro~isionsfor performance audits and public reporting. EPBs need to
maintain their focus on pollution management and control, while being selective in
identifying their role in expanding into green or eco-environmental agenda.



5.6     An effective system of incentives for environmental management is still lack~ng,
and requires Golrenlment commitment and further TA to firmly put it in place,
particularly at the sub-national level.

5.7     SEPA 's resources are inadequate contpared to the task of addressing China's
environmental challenges. SEPA has the environment mandate, supported by a good
legal frameurork and comprehensive policies, but few resources. As the lead
environmental agency, SEPA has broad responsibilities for policy formulation, but only
has a small staff of about 220 professionals. SEPA's authority is derir-ed frorn tl-re
support of the apex State Council, but policy implementation depends hea\rily on the
commitment of mayors and local government leaders to environmental management, and
increasingly, public opinion.

5.8      It should be highlighted. however, that one of the strongest elements of SEPA's
environmental strategy has been its work on promoting public participation, public
dissemination of environmental information, and environmental education at all levels.
This work now needs to extend beyond wealthier urban areas in the east.

many EPRs bang captlve lo local governments. and -- wilt1 many sewage and wastewater
treatment facilities linked tojowi~edby local governments              - so that EPB's become
resigned toward keeping the status quo. The end result is that poor environmental quality
persists. The central government needs to play a stronger and more direct role in using
fiscal (taxation) policy in a balanced manner, to supplement the large amounts of
investments being made in pollution management.



5.10     Although effective in promoting stewardship of the environment, the Bank in
n~ovingforward may not be sufficiently strategic, particularly with respect to (i) scaling-
up the successes achieved at the municipal and individual project levels; (ii) addressing
critical but relatively new areas for the Bank such as hazardous wastes including
intermediate e-wastes, treatment of highly contaminated sludge. and clean-up of
contaminated water bodies, and (iii) improving portfolio quality and performance by
adopting Integrated River Basin Management approaches.

5.11     Two importantfuture rolesfor the Bank consist of strengthelzirzg tlte EPBs arzd
helping improve the incentive framew~orkfor pollutiorz marzagentent. There seems to be
a continuing role for the Bank in strengthening monitoring and enforcement at the
provincial level, and a strong desire for a second technical assistance project targeted to
provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus. The incentive system for pollution control
(specifically the pollution levy system that has been in place for about 20 years) was
criticized as ineffective, and there also appears to be an important role for the Bank in
analytical work and institutional-strengthening related to broader environmental fiscal
reforms. such as the "greening of the tax ~tnicture'.~'.

5.12     In particular, Integrated River Basin Managentent (IRBM) arzd biodiversity
conservation appear to be "missed opportunities" for the Bank. River Basins are being
"managed" with little or no regard for economic principles. Water quality is a particularly
difficult problem to tackle, as there are virtually no basin-wide institutions to manage
water allocation or quality. IRBM requires greater COC commitment and willingness to
address institutional weaknesses and strong political economies at the sub-national level.
In addition to IRBM. other serious deficiencies remain in key areas requiring
environmental stewardship. such as biodiversity conservation. The Bank-GEF support for
biodiversity protection is more repetitive than innovative.

5.13     Much work remains to integrate envirorzmental concerns into tlze China
country strategy and macroeconomic dialogue, and to link then1 more logically with
lending assistance. Bank environment policy and country strategies have addressed a

Environmental linkages identified in ESWiAAA appear to have been only exploited on
an ad-hoc basis. However, the defcrcto approach did produce many positive results and
responded to client needs, as discussed below.

DEFINING BANK'SCONTRIBUTION
            THE

5.14    When there is a convergence of interests. the Bank and China have productive
working relationships, but Bank-China environmental objectives do not always coincide.
as illustrated by ETAP's experience. ETAP was the only Rank-financed project in China
that directly sought to strengthen stewardship across all aspects of the environment. The
Bank-SEPA relationship demonstrated a more general theme. i.e.. when there is a
confluence of interests, the Bank and China can have cooperative and productive working
relationships. extending to upstream policy work. In the 10-year course of ETAP, ancl
more generally its environment-related work with China. the Rank placed its technical
and policy support to SEPA at the core of its strategy. The Rank initially graduated from
monitoring safeguards and reviewing EIAs, to a much wider role of championing
environmental stem-ardship. Subsequently it expanded its efforts to the mainstreanling of
environmental issues in sector projects. The small size of SEPA (220 professional staff)
in relation to the big sector ministries and to the Bank's equally small environment sector
units made close cooperation feasible. Upstreanl environniental policy dialogue between
SEPA and EASES was not always the result of management oversight or d~rectionfrom
the Bank. as inany initiatives were originated by the Chinese counterparts.

5.15    IEG mission discussions with CASc and SEPA suggest that the Rank's value-
added consists of the following specific contributions:


    a   The Rank provides access to global experience and expertise. especially those
        related to good environmental management practices.
    a   The Bank's project design and appraisal procedures are rigorous and able to show
        the project's tnie worth in comparison with other alternatives.
    a   'The Bank is able to solicit different views from various project stakeholders.
    a   The Bank can anticipate environmental issues bl. drawing upon its expertise and
        cross-country experience, and has the credibility and convening power to broker
        ail agenda for addressing these problems.

However, the Bank is seen by its clients as relatively inflexible and procedures-oriented.
It needs to learn how to listen more, particularly to sophisticated Borrowers that have

5.17    Promot~ngenvironmental slewardship at the sectoral and sub-national levels
remains an important challenge. Although cooperation with SEPA was good, the Bank's
objectives and prescriptions for China's environment did not necessarily coincide with
the priorities of sector-level ministries and provincial governments. Consequently,
ownership was mixed at sectoral and sub-national levels despite strong expressions of
environmental commitment at the national level. An appropriate policy for the Bank is to
play an honest broker role by working with different ministries and agencies that have
sectoral expertise to manage particular environmental responsibilities, while identifying
and proposing means of addressing conflicts of interest particularly at the Ievel of
provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus (EPBs). In its lending operations, the Bank
should intensify efforts to address the fundamental contradiction of strengthening SEPA
nrhile leaving the EPBs to have little ot no incenti\-e.penalties. or gei~uinecommitment to
address environmental issues. This issue of the relative roles and incenti~es between
SEPA and the provinc~alEPBs is discussed in more detail in the section on
--EnvironmentalGovernance'" in the Chma-Environment Country C ase Study, uhich        I San
