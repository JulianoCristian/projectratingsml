                         The Grenada OECS Education Development Project was restructured following Hurricane Ivan. The original project development objective was changed. The
                         new objectives are to: (i) increase equitable access to secondary education, including replacing and rehabilitating secondary schools damaged by the passage
                         of Hurricane Ivan on September 7, 2004; (ii) improve the quality and efficiency of Secondary Education, and (iii) strengthen the institutional capacity of the
                         education sector.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?
