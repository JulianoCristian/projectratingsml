As a\n            result, these indicators could not adequately measure the\n            achievements or progress made. The planned evaluation of the\n            counseling program as well as other training activities\n            could not take place due to shortage of resources. The\n            project used online learning courses to train teachers and\n            guidance counselors. This training afforded teachers an\n            opportunity to immediately put into practice the concepts\n            they learned and therefore could easily relate to school\n            realities.
