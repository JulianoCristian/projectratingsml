            ProposedAmendment to the Loan 7187-GRD and Credit 3809-GRD
                           Followingthe passageof Hurricane Ivan


1.   Grenada's OECS Education Development Project, supported by Loan and Credit
     Agreements, dated October 1, 2003 for a total amount o f US$8 million equivalent (US$4
     million IBRDand SDR2.9 millionIDA), aims to: (a) increase equitable accessto secondary
     education; (b) improve quality and efficiency o f secondary education; and (c) strengthen
     the institutional capacity o f the educational sector.

2.   On September 7,2004, the eye-wall of Hurricane Ivan, a Category 3 hurricane, passedover
     Grenada leaving a trail o f destruction: more than 80 percent o f the building structures on
     the island have sustained some form o f damage, including 90 percent o f the housing stock.
     The damage caused to schools was only second to the damage in the housing sector. A
     preliminary assessment of the education sector dated September 21, 2004 concluded that
     out o f the 58 primary public schools, 25 suffered major structural damage or destruction.
     The remaining 33 suffered relatively lesser damages such as windows, doors and
     furnishings destroyed, roof partially or completely destroyed, and roof structure damage.
     O fthe 19 secondary schools, 14 sufferedmajor damages and only 5 escapedwith minimum
     damage. Currently, the majority o f the schools remain closed and the students unable to
     attend classes.

3 . A conservativeballpark figure ofthe damage estimates that a total of US$33 million will be
    required to rebuild the schools. It i s estimated that US$20 million i s needed for the
    rehabilitation and repair o f primary schools and US$10.1 million for secondary schools,
    including civil works and furnishings. Another US$2.9 million will be required for the
    purchase o f textbooks.          The restoration of labs and technical centers will cost
    approximately another US$4 million. A second estimate, producedby Grenada's Ministry
    o f Finance, putsthe damage closer to US$80 million.

4.  As part of their reconstruction effort and the urgency inresuming classes, the Government
    o f Grenada has requested that US$5.3 million equivalent within the US$11.3 millionOECS
    Education Development Project, identified during the emergency mission following
    Hurricane Ivan, be directed towards the reconstruction, rehabilitation, furnishing, and

    would be financed under a proposed new loadcredit (Grenada Hurricane Ivan - Emergency
    equipping o f secondary schools. The reconstruction and rehabilitation o f primary schools

    Recovery Project) as well as by other donors. Given the new priorities resulting from
    Hurricane Ivan, Grenada's Ministry of Education identified several activities previously
    planned under the project which are no longer a priority, thus freeing up resources to be
    reallocatedto the new needs.

5.  In order to accommodate the Government of Greneda's request for the reallocation, it is
    necessary to amend: (a) the development objective and Part A o f the Project o f the Loan
    Agreement, to reflect the change in rationale for the component, which i s to rebuild and
    rehabilitate secondary schools damaged by the Hurricane Ivan; (b) Schedule 1 o f the Loan
    Agreement to reflect the change in all the disbursement categories to 100% as per the
    Grenada's financing parameters recently approved; and (c) Schedule 4 o f the Loan
    Agreement to establish more flexible procurement arrangements for the aforementioned
    reconstruction, rehabilitation, furnishing and equippingo f secondary schools.

   The request to reallocate these savings toward the new emergency is expected to assist the
   Government o f Grenada in resuming classes as quickly as possible, while ensuring student
   safety due to proper building standards for secondary schools. Meanwhile, discussions are
   currently ongoing with the Government regarding a new operation to be financed through
   the Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project contingency fund, which
   would allocate approximately US$5 million to the reconstruction o f primary schools.
   International donors have also met and are identifying other areas o f financing for the
   education sector.
