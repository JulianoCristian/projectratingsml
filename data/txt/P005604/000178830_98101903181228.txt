INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO Tl{E REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $4.8 million to
the Republic of Tunisia.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's second operation
in the field of population and the first one to be financed by IDA.
3.        The Government first raised the possibility of Bank Group assist-
ance for its family planning program in December 1968. These exploratory
discussions were continued during the visit of an economic mission to
Tunisia in March 1969 and, following a Government request, a project iden-
tification and preparation mission visited the country in November 1969.
The project was appraised in May/June 1970.
4.        Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in Washington from
February 4 to 12, 1971. The Tunisian delegation was headed by Mr. Ahmed
Balma, Chef du Cabinet of the Minister of Public Health, and included Mrs.
Tewhida Ben Cheikh (M.D.), and Mr. Aberrahman Mezlini, Director and Admin-
istrator, respectively, of the Directorate of Family Planning and Maternal
and Child Welfare at the Ministry of Public Health, Mr. Chelbi, from the
Ministry of Planning, Mr. Abdellatif Khemakhem, Director General of the
National Institute of Productivity, and Mr. Ahmed Badra, from the Tunisian
Embassy in Washington.
5.        Following is a summary statement of loans and credits to Tunisia
as of February 28, 1971:

6.        Implementation of the Second Education Project (Credit No. 94)
has been satisfactory, but disbursements have somewhat lagged behind sched-
ule. Savings of about $1.5 million were achieved in construction and pro-
curement. As an interim measure, the closing date (December 31, 1970) has
been postponed by four months to permit the submission and processing of
pending withdrawal requests and to examine a Government request for utili-
zation of the savings. I will in due course present to the Executive Directors
recommendations regarding the utilization of these funds and a further post-
ponement of the closing date.
* Not yet effective

7.        The Executive Directors approved amendments to Loan No. 484 and
Credit No. 99 (Cooperative Farm Project) in November 1970, but the changes
are not yet effective.   It is expected that the amendments will become
effective by March 31, 1971.
8.        As a result of flood damages in the fall of 1969 and the necessity
of giving priority to the repair of these damages, the Railroad Project (Loan
No. 606 and Credit No. 150) is about one year behind schedule. The railroad
company (SNCFT) has made efforts to reduce this delay, and substantial pro-
curement contracts have been recently signed or are about to be signed. A
matter of concern is the weak financial position of SNCFT, due principally
to loss of traffic because of the flood damages, delays in repairing these
damages and non-payment of freight charges by the railroad company's largest
client, a phosphate mining company, which lis itl financial difficulties.
However, the Government is acting to restore the financial position of both
SNCFT and the phosphate company. A Bank staff member is currently reviewing
the position in Tunisia.
9.        Initial delays in the preparation of bidding documents and in the
letting of contracts account for slow disbursements under the Second Port
Project (Loan No. 573). A number of important contracts have now been
awarded and a normal rate of disbursement can be expected henceforth.
10.       Disbursements under the First Water Supply Project (Loan No. 581)
are now reaching a satisfactory level. Implementation of the three Loans
to Societe Nationale d'Investissement (Nos. 449, 512 and 648) is proceeding
satisfactorily.
11.       In 1962, IFC invested $3.5 million ($2 million as a loan and $1.5
million as equity investment) in NPK-Engrais, a phosphate fertilizer company.
In 1966, IFC made an investment of D 300,000 (about $571,500) in the share
capital of Societe Nationale d'Investissemiient (SNI), which in 1970 was in-
creased by $630,000 allowing IFC to maintain its 20 percent participation
when SNI doubled its share capital. In 1969, IFC made an investment of
$9.9 million ($8 million as a loan and $1.9 million in share capital) in
COFITOUR, a tourism development and holding company.
12.       The Bank and IDA are presently considering projects in the fields
of highway construction, agricultural credit, fisheries and tourism infra-
structure as well as a fourth loan to Societe Nationale d'Investissement.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
Borrower:                 Republic of Tunisia
Amount:                   $4.8 million equivalent in various currencies.
Purpose:                  To assist in expanding and improving Tunisia's
national famnily planning program through the
construction of maternity hospitals and mater-
nal and child health centers and the provision
of consulting services.



- 4 -
Amortization:             In 50 years including a 10-year period of grace,
through semi-annual installments of 1/2 of 1 per-
cent fronl May 15, 1981 through November 15, 1990
and of 1-1/2 percent from May 15, 1991 through
November 15, 2020.
Service Charge:           3/4 of 1 percent per annum on the principal amount
of the credit witlhdrawn.
PART III - THE PROJECT
13.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Population Project,
Tunisia" (PP-4a) is attached.
14.       Tunisia's annual rate of population growth has risen to 2.8 per-
cent in recent years. This high rate of dermographic growth is impeding eco-
nomic progress, aggravates the unemployment problem and has serious social
consequences. Against this background, an experimental family planning
program launched by the Government in 1964 was expanded into a national
program in 1966.
15.       After six years of existence, Tunisia's family planning program
leaves much room for improvement. Despite a generally favorable climate
for family planning ideas, strong political support and adequate budgetary
resources, the program reaches only 2.5 percent of women in the fertile age
group each year and the 1969 number of 21,300 new acceptors compares with
28,000 in Jamaica and 35,000 in Singapore for the same year, countries with
somewhat less than one-half of Tunisia's population. The weak performance
is not a result of inadequate demand for family planning services, but is
rather attributable to shortcomings and constraints on the supply side,
particularly with regard to organization and staffing patterns, administra-
tive procedures and overcrowding of the urban maternity hospitals.
16.       The project is designed to enhance the effectiveness and increase
the capacity of the program through the provision of technical assistance,
the construction of four maternity hospitals, two rural maternity centers
and 29 maternal and child health centers and the extension of a Paramedical
School in Tunis, including a postgraduate section.
17.       A particularly important objective of the project's technical as-
sistance component is to strengthen the management and improve the organi--
zation of the family planning services with the help of management consul--
tants. They will design and assist in implementing a system which would
ensure an optimum use of the resources at the disposal of the program.
Their terms of reference have been agreed upon during negotiations and
their appointment would be a condition of effectiveness.



- 5 -
18.       With regard to the physical facilities, it may be noted that the
cost of the maternity hospitals included in the project is almost twice
that of the maternal and child health centers. At the same time, 85-90
percent of the 55,000 new acceptors expected yearly from the project will
be attributable to the 29 centers, and only 10-15 percent to the hospitals.
It may thus seem that the cost-effectiveness of the centers by far exceeds
that of the hospitals. Such a comparison is not appropriate, however. The
two components are indivisible and cannot be regarded as independent al-
ternatives since the maternity hospitals are indispensable for providing
the requisite supporting gynecological services to the centers, in addition
to supplying in-service training opportunities for family planning personnel.
19.       The figure of 55,000 new acceptors expected to result from the
project every year has been calculated on the basis of very conservative
assumptions, and does not take into account the impact of the project on
the efficiency of the whole family planning program through the implemen-
tation of the recommendations of the management study and the reorganization
of the Directorate of Family Planning and Maternal and Child Welfare; al-
though this impact is not quantifiable, it is expected to be substantial.
20.       Agreement was reached during negotiations on the functions and
responsibilities as well as the organization and management of the Direc-
torate of Family Planning and Maternal and Child Welfare at the Ministry of
Public Health, which at the present time is the entity to implement the
project. The Government is in the process of establishing an autonomous
Institute of Family Planning with a view to endowing the family planning
services with greater administrative flexibility and financial autonomy.
When created, the Institute would take over the functions and responsibil-
ities of the Family Planning Directorate, including implementation of the
proposed project. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Institute would be established along lines which would ensure the efficient
implementation of the project and of the whole family planning program.
21.       The cost of the project is estimated at approximately $7.7 million
and, with the possible exception with regard to management consulting ser-
vices noted in the following paragraph, the proposed credit of $4.8 million
would cover the project's estimated foreign exchange component.
22.       Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture will be let on
the basis of international competitive bidding. Bids would be invited in
packages likely to encourage both international and local contractors. A
preference of 15 percent (or the existing import duties, if lower) is pro-
posed for evaluating bids from local manufacturers of furniture and equip-
ment. The Government has proposed that the Tunisian National Institute of
Productivity, in association with an experienced foreign firm, be assigned
a significant role in the management consulting services (see para. 17).
Provided that a satisfactory proposal is submitted by the Borrower on this
basis, it is proposed to finance 80 percent of the services of not only



- 6 -
foreign management consultants, but also of the Institute. Such an arrange-
ment would encourage and contribute to the development of domestic manage-
ment consultant capability. The amount of local currency financing involved
is not likely to exceed $100,000.
23.       As explained in the appraisal report (para. 3.14, Annexes 4.3-4.5),
Tunisia's family planning program is receiving substantial support under bi-
lateral aid programs. This assistance, which at present amounts to about 75
percent of the recurrent cost of the whole program, is mainly provided in
the fonn of expatriate staff, equipmnent and supplies.  While supplementing
scarce local personnel and adding substantially to the program's material
resources, the bilateral assistance has probably had a limited impact at
the level of policy formulation and central administration of the family
planning services.  Through improving the overall performance of the program,
the proposed project would help to enhance the effectiveness of bilateral
aid.  Improved management procedures, in particular, are likely to make
possible a more efficient utilization of foreign assistance.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the
Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
25.       The following provisions of the draft Credit Agreement are of
particular interest:
(a)  Section 3.04 and Schedule 4 defining the organization,
functions and responsibilities of the family planning
services and requiring the Borrower to provide sufficient
resources for the effective implementation of the national
family and population planning programs;
(b)  Section 3.06 and Schedule 5 setting forth a number of
administrative arrangements designed to overcome existing
shortcomings in the family planning program;
(c)  Section 7.02 specifying as an event of prematuring the
Credit any suspension, abrogation or amendment of the
organization, functions and responsibilities of the
Family Planning Directorate which, in the opinion of the
Association, would impair the ability of the Borrower to
carry out the Program. The purpose of this section is to
make sure that the Institute of Family Planning as successor
to the Department of Family Planning is established along
lines that will not adversely affect the project.

PART V - THE ECONOMY
26.       The latest economic report on Tunisia dated May 4, 1970 (EMA-22a)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 5, 1970, and an updating
memorandum was issued on March 3, 1971. An economic mission is presently
in the country. A basic data sheet is annexed.
27.       Tunisia's economic development during 1970 has, on the whole, been
less favorable than had been forecast. GDP at constant prices, which at
the beginning of 1970 was expected to rise by 7.7 percent, grew by not more
than 4.5 percent. Agricultural production actually declined as a good grain
harvest was more than offset by poor olive and vegetable crops, and a fall
in livestock production. Output in most other sectors also fell short of
expectations partly because of disruptions caused by the disastrous floods
in September/October 1969. Domestic demand, on the other hand, continued
to rise strongly with public expenditures leading the way. Investment out-
lays increased by 12 percent while consumption expanded by 6 percent. The
combination of low production and buoyant demand put pressure on prices and
led to an 8 percent increase in imports. As exports grew only slowly, the
current account deficit in the balance of payments rose by $24 million to
an estimated $128 million. But the deficit was more than covered by in-
creased foreign aid, and reserves continued to rise moderately.
28.       Tunisia's economic development over the last few years had been
affected by unfavorable weather conditions, severe marketing constraints
especially for exports, and a number of organizational difficulties which
resulted in slow production growth, deteriorating public savings, increasing
inflationary pressures, and a high external debt burden. These factors have
contributed to recent political changes and led to a serious search for a
more successful set of economic policies. These efforts culminated in a new
economic strategy, presented by the Prime Minister last November, which
aims at accelerating the growth of production and exports by reducing direct
government interference in economic decisions, encouraging private initia-
tive and entrepreneurship, and relying more extensively on market forces
as guide for investment and production. More specifically, the Government
has stated its intention to give priority to increasing agricultural output,
and to the promotion of labor intensive small and medium scale industrial
enterprises. Productivity and export orientation will be the principal
criteria for investment allocation. Workers' emigration will be encouraged
as an outlet for surplus labor, while efforts to control the increase in
population will be intensified.
29.       The new budget for 1971 reflects already to some extent the changes
in overall policy. It offers incentives for private investors and reduces
the amount of public capital expenditure. Government investments will focus
on the completion of ongoing projects and on complementary works to raise the
productivity of existing facilities. The expansion of current spending will
be more limited and selective than in previous years. Moreover, a major over-
haul of the tax structure has been started with the objective of removing
existing production and export disincentives.



- 8 -
30.       Stimulated by the new budget, private investment is expected to
rise during 1971, particularly in the agricultural sector. Agricultural
production is likely to recover somewhat, especially since favorable weather
conditions are likely to produce a good olive crop. Industrial output is
expected to continue its moderate rise, concentrated mainly in food proces-
sing and textiles. Crude oil production is unlikely to grow, but consider-
able gains may be expected from tourism. Overall production could be 6-8
percent higher than in 1970. This together with rising imports and the
fiscal restraint should reduce the inflationary pressure.
31.       However, much remains to be done to carry out the structural re-
forms envisaged by the Government. Institutional changes will have to be
made and the responsibilities of government agencies, banks, and enterprises
need to be newly defined in order to establish an efficient market economy.
Adequate export incentives will have to be given and a more liberal exchange
system is required. In addition, there is urgent need for a reappraisal of
sectoral policies. The Fourth Plan (1973-76) which will soon be prepared,
could play a leading role in the implementation of the necessary economic
reforms.
32.       Tunisia's external debt burden is high.   In 1970, about 22 percent
of gross foreign exchange earnings had to be spent on servicing external
debt obligations, most of it for public and publicly-guaranteed debt. The
structure of external debt, however, has been improved in recent years by
reducing the amount of new short and medium-term borrowing. Nevertheless,
payments on present debts will remain large in coming years, and while there
is scope for some additional borrowing on conventional terms, Tunisia will
continue to depend to a large extent on the availability of aid on lenient
terms.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
