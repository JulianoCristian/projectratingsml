The Requesters claim they have\n            and will suffer harm because Bank Management has violated\n            policies and procedures in the preparation of Phase 1A of\n            the project for which financing was approved in 1991, and\n            the then proposed Phase 1B of the Lesotho Highlands Water\n            Project, (together referred to as LHWP). The Requesters ask\n            for an investigation into their claims in order to resolve\n            the current and potential problems of water consumers in\n            poor communities of Gauteng. They believe their access to\n            water, or continued access to water, has been adversely\n            affected by the debt incurred to construct Phase 1A, and may\n            be further adversely affected by premature debt incurred for\n            Phase 1B. It should be noted that those suffering or fearing\n            harm are not against Phase 1B- just its timing. The\n            Requesters' concerns about the conditions on the ground\n            are valid but there does not appear to be a connection\n            between these conditions and any observance or not by the\n            Bank of its own policies and procedures. Rather, they appear\n            to be a part of the enormous legacy and odious burden of\n            apartheid. In this context, the Panel recommends that the\n            Executive Directors do not authorize an investigation into\n            this Request for Inspection."}, "docdt": "1998-08-18T00:00:00Z"}
