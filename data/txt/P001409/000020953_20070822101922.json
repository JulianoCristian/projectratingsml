Lesotho were as follows: outcomes were\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was low or\n            negligible, the Bank performance was satisfactory, and the\n            Borrower performance was moderately satisfactory. Some\n            lessons learned included: 1) Environmental issues need to be\n            integrated into the design of large water storage and\n            transfer projects and considered within an integrated\n            basin-wide management framework (beyond the specific basin\n            or sub-basin in which the project is situated) that\n            explicitly considers the cumulatively impacts of all\n            developments and not only the specific project under\n            consideration; 2) Monitoring and evaluation of large,\n            complex projects needs to ensure that data is collected\n            consistently, reported in a timely manner and integrating\n            into the decision process; 3) Economic analyses integrating\n            full cost (and benefit) accounting that addresses\n            environmental, capital and operating costs along with the\n            broader cost/benefits associated with avoided costs\n            strengthen the project design and decision process; 4)\n            Independent opinion through the establishment of Panels of\n            Experts provides an impartial mechanism facilitating expert\n            input to implementation, particularly important in joint\n            international projects, and contributes to capacity building\n            and the transfer of knowledge; 5) Engineering lessons\n            derived from the construction of Mohale Dam have already\n            been applied to the design and construction of subsequent\n            concrete faced rock-filled dams globally, including the 198m\n            high K\u00e1rahnj\u00fakar dam in Iceland. Lessons include concrete\n            slab and joint design, quarrying techniques, rock-fill\n            layering, construction sequencing and materials testing,\n            both in-situ and in the laboratory; 6) Joint development of\n            international water resources can leverage potential\n            benefits in excess of individual approaches as well as\n            contributing to socio-political co-operation; and 7)\n            Combating corruption requires Government commitment,\n            political will and persistence."}, "docdt": "2007-06-14T00:00:00Z"}
