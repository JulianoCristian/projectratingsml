      IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.

About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes: first, to
ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the expected results,
and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the dissemination of lessons drawn from
experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of the Banks lending operations through field
work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are
relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested
assessments; and those that are likely to generate important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other
in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as relevant.
The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to the document that is
sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the
public.

About the IEGWB Rating System
      IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to lending
instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project
ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional information is available on
the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
      Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes relevance of
objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with
the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate
goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers,
Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives.
Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account
their relative importance. Efficiency is the extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher
than the opportunity cost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is
not applied to adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
      Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High, Significant,
Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
      Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the operation and
supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements
for regular operation of supported activities after loadcredit closing, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The
rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision. Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfadory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency or
agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and implementing
agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report of two projects in the Kingdom of Lesotho:
the Lesotho Highlands Water Project-Phase 1B (LHWP- 1B) and the Community Development
Support Project (CDSP).

The LHWP-1B was approved on June 4, 1998 financed by an IBRD Loan (Loan 4339) of $45.0
million. There were three part cancellations of the Loan, amounting to $22 million overall. The
Bank loan contributed to a planned combined lending package to the project of $858 million
from a consortium of financiers. The project was closed on December 3 1,2006, two years
behind schedule. At closure $21.7 million of the Bank loan had been disbursed and total lending
from the consortium was $620 million. The CDSP was approved on December 20,1999 financed
by an IDA Credit (Credit 3308) of $4.7 million. At closure as scheduled on September 30,2003,
$2.5 million equivalent had been disbursed. An amount of $1.8 million was cancelled in June
2003.

This report presents findings based on review of the projects' implementation completion
reports, appraisal reports, legal documents, sector reports, and other relevant material. An IEG
mission to Lesotho in April 2009 visited project sites and held discussions with government
officials and agencies, project directors and staff, beneficiaries and resettled communities,
NGOs, and key development agencies. For purposes of evaluating water sharing arrangements
between Lesotho and South Africa, representatives from user and financing agencies in South
Africa were also consulted.

The projects were chosen for evaluation together for two reasons. First, while very different in
nature - major infrastructure under LHWP- 1B compared with community driven development of
small village investments under CDSP -they were closely linked by the Government of Lesotho
and the World Bank in a complementary development package. LHWP- 1B's role was to create
the infrastructure required to impound and convey water to South Africa in exchange for royalty
payments. CDSP's intended role was to reformulate the Lesotho highlands revenue fund to
increase its effectiveness for poverty alleviation using participatory development processes.
Between them, the projects were to generate and use revenues to tackle Lesotho's most critical
need - poverty alleviation. How these aspirations worked out provides a rich source of lessons
for future development in Lesotho and elsewhere.

Second, the evaluation provides case study material for an ongoing IEG review of the Bank's
experience with environmental and social safeguards. The projects triggered a diverse group of
such safeguards, from environmental and social issues to international waters, dam safety,
natural habitats and other matters. Experience varied from good to problematic, generating a
variety of lessons for future handling of safeguards.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the report were sent to the Kingdom of Lesotho
for review but no comments were received.

Summary

The Lesotho Highlands Water Project-Phase 1B (LHWP- 1B) and the Community Development
Support Project (CDSP) were structurally very different, the former involving major
infrastructure investments and the latter small community investments. Yet they were linked to a
common cause - the generation of revenues (royalties) from water sales to South Africa under
LHWP-1B and the allocation of those royalties under CDSP to the poor through a social fund
using community development processes. This combined contribution was seen by the
Government of Lesotho and the World Bank as a partnership at the heart of Lesotho's
development strategy, which was and remains strongly focused on poverty alleviation. Average
per capita income is low ($1030 in 2008). Moreover, Lesotho's income distribution is one of the
most unequal in Africa, with some 60 percent of the population classified as poor.

The Lesotho Hiahlands Water Proiect-Phase 1B was a second investment phase of a large and
still ongoing water development program to capture and transport surplus water from Lesotho to
South Africa. The LHWP-1B's objectives were: (i) "to put in place the physical and managerial
capacity for Lesotho to transform its principal natural resource of abundance - water - into
export revenues that can be applied to poverty reduction and economic stability while: (a)
protecting the environment and mitigating any adverse social and environmental impacts; and (b)
maximizing the local development spin-offs of the project in Lesotho; and (ii) to assist South
Africa in developing its lowest cost alternatives for supply of water to the Gauteng Region." The
project's primary activity was construction of a large dam and conveyance tunnels. Supporting
this was institutional capacity building, a resettlement program for 4 18 families affected by the
project, and environmental mitigation actions. These investments were to establish the
infrastructure that would earn royalties to finance poverty reduction. Total project costs at
completion were $629 million, of which the Bank financed $29.7 million (including residual
amounts of $8.0 million from the loan provided for the previous project, LHWP-Phase 1A).

LHWP- 1B had a moderately satisfactory outcome overall. The project's objectives were
substantially relevant, given that additional revenues for poverty reduction were a clear need.
The project's design was also relevant. Providing the physical and managerial infrastructure for
water exports would provide royalties that could be used for poverty alleviation. Continuing to
use the existing institutional base backed by a proven and well functioning water treaty between
the two countries also made sense. The most successful project component was the construction
of the water infrastructure (73 percent of actual project costs). This was completed to good
standards and ahead of schedule, and water deliveries and royalty earnings met their targets. But
there were shortfalls in training for staff in Lesotho's implementing agency and in the
resettlement program. Most fundamentally, while LHWP- 1B generated revenues that could have
been used for poverty alleviation, CDSP's fund failed to use those royalties for this purpose.

The project's economic rate of return as estimated at project completion (about 12 percent) was
based on lower effective demand for water from South Africa than initially expected,
compounded by the global economic downturn. However, in the longer term, demand for water
will be spurred by demographic and economic growth and can be expected to increase
significantly. The risk that the project's development outcome will not be maintained is
                                                 X



moderate, as both governments want the treaty and water transfer program to work and can be
expected to take measures as needed to ensure continued good operations.

Monitoring and evaluation is assessed as modest overall. Management information to follow the
progress of the project was well collected and used. Monitoring of environmental impacts was
also good, but socio-economic monitoring and evaluation was weak. Data that were collected
attracted little interest from the agencies' operational staff, and there was no follow-up to the
findings.

The Bank's performance was moderately satisfactory. Quality varied. The design and
supervision of capacity building and resettlement were weak, a critical gap in attention to
poverty concerns, while the Bank's performance was strong in the provision of water
infrastructure and as an informal coordinator and motivator of a large consortium of
development agencies and private investors. The Bank's inter-agency and inter-country
facilitation role and its technical assistance have been the most important qualities it brought to
the project, out of all proportion to the Bank's small (5 percent) share of total project costs. The
borrower's performance was moderately satisfactory: management of the construction program
was outstanding, yet there were weaknesses with resettlement and capacity building and, as with
the Bank, there was little attention to how royalty funds were used.

 The Community Development Support Project was a Learning and Innovation Loan of $4.7
 million with a planned government contribution of $5.7 million. The project was designed to
 pilot community-driven development approaches for financing village infrastructure targeted on
 poorer communities. CDSP's objectives were: "(i) to test a demand-driven and participatory
 approach through a multi-sectoral special fund and draw lessons as to whether it is an
 appropriate mechanism to support community development in Lesotho; and (ii) to test various
 mechanisms and tools to monitor poverty trends in Lesotho and to coordinate national poverty
 monitoring and analysis activities." The first objective was to be funded by the royalties from
 LHWP-1B. To do this, an existing social fund was restructured. The restructured fund -the
 Lesotho Fund for Community Development (LFCD) -was to have a Board of Directors to be
 chosen from government civil servants and beneficiaries, and a management unit with the
 technical units and specialists needed. An operational manual produced during project
 preparation was to guide the community driven, pro-poor and transparent participatory
 processes used in selecting and guiding implementation of small social infrastructure sub-
 projects (such as a village water scheme, training center, and footbridge). These would be chosen
`by the communities who would contribute a share of investment costs. To achieve the second
 objective, a program for testing and coordinating new ways of monitoring poverty would be
 implemented under the Bureau of Statistics.

From Government letters, workshops and actions such as the establishment of the LFCD before
Board approval of CDSP, there appeared to be good government commitment to the
participatory community-driven approach. However, this was not to be the case in practice.
Almost immediately, the project went seriously off track due to the influence of political vested
interests. The LFCD's Board became dominated by ministers rather than technocrats and
stakeholders, thus introducing a strong political element. The operational manual and community
driven development approaches were abandoned. Key operational divisions in the fund's
management unit were not established. There was no monitoring and evaluation, despite this
being an essential part of a Learning and Innovation project. Parliamentarians were given license
                                                xi


to select projects to fit their own constituency interests and royalties were used to finance
politically chosen and non-participatory investments. Thus, the original purpose of the project
was lost.

CDSP's outcome was Unsatisfactory. The highly unsatisfactory performance of the project's
community development program was partly compensated by satisfactory performance of the
national poverty monitoring component. The community-driven development program was
relevant in its objectives, but its design failed to identify the risk of political capture despite
similar prior experience with LFCD's precursor fund. The objective to test community-driven
approaches was not achieved, as the project was overwhelmed by a supply-side approach without
documentation, workshops, and other learning processes.

Risk to development outcome is significant because, although national poverty monitoring is
continuing and is supported by Government (only a moderate risk), the community-driven
development program supporting the project's primary objective failed, manifesting its high risk.
Monitoring and evaluation, a particularly important need with a Learning and Innovation Loan,
was negligible for community development as no evaluation program was prepared, an M&E
unit was not established and no data were collected on the performance of the sub-projects. The
Bank's performance was highly unsatisfactory, as it failed to address the political capture
problem until it was too late. The borrower's performance was also highly unsatisfactory, as it
did not prevent the political dominance of the project and it obstructed adequate staffing and
functioning of the LFCD's management unit.

The program as a whole. The two projects formed a necessary partnership: CDSP relied on
LHWP-1B royalties and LHWP-1B needed CDSP to use the royalties for poverty alleviation.
The partnership was only mechanical, however: funds were provided by LHWP- 1B, but there
was no organizational linkage between the two projects and the leverage of the much larger
LHWP- 1B was not applied when special interests corrupted the social fund. A practical,
mutually supporting approach would have been better. For instance, the LHWP- 1B royalties
channeled to the social fund could have been conditional on the acceptability of community
development processes used by CDSP; the projects could have had joint monitoring
arrangements; impacts on poverty alleviation could have been included in the monitorable
indicators; and the projects could have been supervised jointly, with poverty alleviation as an
emphasis.

This assessment also illustrates that infrastructure projects require more than "hardware."
LHWP- 1B's construction program and closely linked activities such as management of water
between Lesotho and South Africa were satisfactory. But "software" activities such as
resettlement and capacity building were less well done, pulling down the project's ratings. Thus,
from a broader perspective than provided in LHWP-1B's objectives (which were restricted to
providing funds that "can" be used for poverty alleviation), a successful construction program
did not lead to a successful development program. Finally, this review reveals several pointers
for the handling of safeguards, which are included in the lessons outlined below.
                                                xii

Principal Lessons:

       A successful construction program does not necessarily mean a successful development
       program. Attention is needed to the full objectives of aproject, including "software" as
       well as "hardware. LHWP- 1B's successful water infrastructure program will be a main
                           "

       pillar in Lesotho's development program for decades to come. But the royalties did not
       go to poverty reduction, the project's most fundamental objective. Also, while LHWP-1B
       was strong in all aspects related directly to construction (engineering, physical works and
       water delivery), it performed weakly in software aspects (capacity building, training and
       resettlement).

       Lesotho and South Africa's "Good Practice" Water Treaty has features that may be
       relevant elsewhere. The following features have contributed to success: (i) clarity and
       detail in the treaty document, including procedures for adjusting to changing
       circumstances; (ii) appropriate institutions - a bridging institution has worked well in
       coordinating actions between the two countries; (iii) focused objectives; and (iv)
       independent dispute resolution mechanisms within the institutions themselves. The
       Bank's 20-year engagement providing technical and policy support, and as a motivator
       for the financial involvement of other lenders, also contributed to the treaty's success.

       Safeguards implementation should not be given second-tier priority, but should receive
       the same attention as the main project components. Successful implementation of a
       safeguard program requires the same design and supervision qualities as other project
       components. Compliance with a safeguard requires a range of skills and resources very
       familiar to Bank project operations in general: a good action plan; readiness for
       implementation; good supervision, including relevant specialist skills; highlighting the
       safeguard's importance in dialogue with Government; building implementation capacity;
       and monitoring. Implementation of the safeguard actions should have no less priority
       than other key project components. There is likely to be a cost, however, since such
       quality actions would tend to increase staff resource needs and would require additional
       Bank budget.

    1. The Water and Rural Sectors in Lesotho's Economy
Poverty and economic growth in Lesotho
1.1     Natural Resources. Development in the Kingdom of Lesotho must contend with the
country's small size, limited resources, rugged terrain, and poverty. Lesotho's population is
about 2.2 million, and land area is some 30,000 km2. About 70 percent of the population is
rural, and one-third lives in the mountains. Two-thirds of the country is mountainous and the
remaining land is often degraded due to overuse. Cultivable land is scarce, occupying only 10
percent of the country's land area, and farms tend to be small. Rangelands in the hills are also
degraded due to overgrazing. Population pressure on the land is thus high and is exacerbated
by population growth estimated at nearly 1 percent per annum, a significant growth rate
given Lesotho's constraining land resources. However, the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS
(one quarter of the adult population are infected) has introduced a new dynamic.'

 1.2    Sources of economic growth. Agriculture is the source of most employment in
Lesotho, but has low productivity, and land constraints limit the sector's growth. Lesotho
produces only 30 percent of its food consumption. Efforts to diversify agriculture were made
in the 1990s and 2000s, but with limited success, although some high-value commercial
production and processing is taking place. Garment production has grown during the past
decade, and this and other industries may be key to future economic growth and employment.
The main job opportunities, however, have been from working in the mines in the Republic
of South Africa. A significant proportion of Lesotho's male population is employed in the
mines, and remittances back to families from the workers represent about 20 percent of
Lesotho's gross national income. There are other income connections between the two
countries, since South Africa encircles Lesotho, and commercial and cultural interactions are
inevitably close. These connections make Lesotho vulnerable to changing economic
conditions such as the present global recession and its effect on reducing demand for
commodities, as downturns reduce job opportunities in the mines and the amount of
remittances.

1.3     Poverty and economic growth. At the time when the assessed projects were prepared,
(the late 1990s), Lesotho's GDP growth rate was low, averaging less than two percent per
annum.2 Performance improved slightly in the early 2000s when GDP growth averaged
slightly over 3 percent per annum, nudged up by an expanding manufacturing sector,



   A devastating accompaniment to working on the mines has been the spread of HIV/AIDS. The all-male labor
camps attracted prostitution and widespread transmission of the virus. HIV/AIDS was then transmitted to the
wives of the miners on their return home. HIV/AIDS is a major epidemic in Lesotho. According to the 2006
CAS, some 24 percent of the adult population has HIVIAIDS, making Lesotho the country with the highest
prevalence of HIV/AIDS amongst all IDA countries. Also, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is higher among
women than men. In addition to the loss of life and the emotional stress that this pandemic causes, burial costs
and the loss of productive family members can lead to severe impoverishment. HIV/AIDS also saps the
efficiency of government agencies and the commercial sector through loss of skilled human resources.

especially textiles. GDP per capita, however, remains low ($1030 in 20083). Moreover, the
distribution of Lesotho's income is one of the most unequal in Africa. Some 60 percent of the
population are poor, and a third are in extreme poverty. The poverty incidence is 72 percent
in rural areas compared with 27 percent in Maseru, the capitaL4

    The two projects
    1.4    The projects assessed in this report are the Lesotho Highlands Water Project- Phase
    1B and the Community Development Support Project.

1.5     The Lesotho Highlands Water Project-Phase 1B (LHWP-1B) was a large investment
phase of a yet larger and still ongoing water development program to impound and transport
surplus water from Lesotho to South Africa, in exchange for royalties provided by South
Africa to Lesotho. This program is underpinned by a water treaty ratified by the two
countries in 1986, which provides a cooperative framework for water investments, operations
and establishing royalties.

 1.6     Two Bank-assisted projects preceded LHWP-1B. The first - the Highlands Water
Engineering Project (FY87; approved in December 1986 and closed in December 1990) -
financed planning for the overall water development program, including detailed design for
the first investment phase. This first investment was supported by the Bank through the
Lesotho Highlands Water Project-Phase 1A (FY92; approved in July 1991 and closed in
                                                       ,~
March 1999). Phase 1A, costing about $2.5 b i l l i ~ nprimarily comprised constructing two
dams for impounding water in Lesotho and some 80 km of tunnels to enable transfer of the
water to South Africa. The infrastructure was successfully completed, delivering water to
South Africa at 18 m3 per second, as planned. Phase-1A also financed detailed designs for
the second phase of the water program - LHWP-1B (FY98; approved in March 1998 and
closed in December 2006), the subject of this review.

 1.7    The Community Development Support Project (CDSP) was to test how to use the
royalties from LHWP- 1B to finance a social fund supporting small, mostly rural investments.
The investments were to be chosen and implemented with substantial community
participation, and to be targeted on poor communities. As indicated above, reaching the poor,
especially in the rural highlands where the population is particularly impoverished, is a
fundamental need in Lesotho. A community driven development (CDD) approach was
considered the best way to achieve this. CDSP set out to use an existing fund - the Lesotho
Highlands Revenue Fund which had been established in 1991 - as the base institution for
financing and providing technical assistance to the communities. This fund, however, had
become highly corrupted and influenced by politicians and other vested interests. The Bank

  L H W - 1 A was financed by a consortium of lenders including the United Nations Development Program,
African Development Bank, European Union, European Investment Bank, Development Bank of Southern
Africa, Commonwealth Development Corporation, commercial banks, and export credits. The IBRD's
contribution was $69 million out of a planned $1 10 million. The Bank also played a convening role for lenders
and the Lesotho Government.
recognized that the fund would need to be substantially reformulated including new
guidelines on selecting and approving sub-projects, building capacity to provide technical
assistance to communities, and institutional restructuring to provide the skills and
mechanisms to be effective. Measures towards these objectives were taken during project
preparation, and the fund was also re-named as the Lesotho Fund for Community
Development (LFCD).

 1.8     The complementarv roles of the two proiects. Bank and Government strategy
statements have consistently articulated a close link between LHWP- 1B and CDSP.
Royalties from LHWP-1B were to finance poverty alleviation through CDSP. The
Government and the Bank shared the same vision. The two projects would be mutually
supportive and would play a key role in Lesotho's development, especially in tackling
poverty. Thus, as stated in the project appraisal document for LHWP-lB, "The revenues
provided by the project are Lesotho's best opportunity to reduce poverty which is supported
by ongoing economic and sector work and the proposed Poverty Reduction Project LIL,
1998. The FY98 Country Assistance Strategy stated that: "The Bank used its support for the
Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP-1A) to assist the Government to formulate and
implement a rural development program and to explore means to maximize the poverty
reducing impact of the project. The proposed Social Fund Project (i.e. CDSP) would support
the strengthening of the social fund mechanism by building institutional capacity for
delivering services to the poor." Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy (2005) also
stressed poverty alleviation and the linkage through royalties between LHWP-1B and CDSP.
Poverty reduction is, moreover, a central theme in other Government and Bank documents.6



2. LHWP-1B's Objectives and Implementation
Objectives and Design
2.1     The objectives of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project-Phase 1B were: (i) to put in
place the physical and managerial capacity for Lesotho to transform its principal natural
resource o abundance - water - into export revenues that can be applied to poverty
           f
reduction and economic stability while (a) protecting the environment and mitigating any
adverse social and environmental impacts; and (b) maximizing the local development spin-
08s of the project in Lesotho; and (ii) to assist South Africa in developing its lowest cost
alternativesfor supply of water to the Gauteng Region (Project Appraisal Document). The
Loan Agreement contains an abbreviated version of the first Development Objective as stated
in the PAD, and does not include the second Objective. The PAD version, including its
second objective, is used in this assessment because it best represents the intent of the project
as discussed in the text of the PAD.
2.2     Project components of LHWP-1B were concentrated on the physical activities needed
to achieve the project's water export objective plus related supporting activities. Construction

and in the Bank's 2005 Country Economic Memorandum and 2006 Country Assistance Strategy.

of infrastructure (mainly a dam at Mohale in the highlands and some 30 km of tunnels for
water transport) was the primary project component accounting for $378 million or 60
percent of total actual costs.7 Other components were consultancies for design and
supervision of construction, an environmental and social action plan, and training and
capacity building. The total project cost of LHWP-1B was estimated at $884 million, and the
Bank Loan was $45 million, all for training and consultancies. A credit would normally be
provided for Lesotho given its low per capita income, but a loan was chosen because of the
commercial nature of investment and financing for LHWP- 1B. LHWP- 1 3 was financed by a
consortium of lenders which together were to finance $858 million of the project costs. By
project completion total project costs were $629 million and total financing, excluding
government, was $621 million. There was some saving on construction costs but the main
factor for the reduced costs and financing was the depreciation of the Maloti against the
dollar - during project implementation, the Maloti typically exchanged at between 20 and 40
percent below the rate assumed at appraisal.

Institutional Arrangements
2.3     The institutions through which LHWP-1B was implemented had already been
established under the first phase (LHWP-1A) of the Lesotho highlands water development
program.* Nevertheless, the institutional needs were demanding as LHWP- 1B continued to
require close collaboration in water management between two countries and triggered a
special safeguard under Bank policies - the international waterways safeguard.

2.4     At the base of LHWP-1B's institutional structure is the 1986 water transfer treaty
between Lesotho and South Africa. The treaty defined the role of the three main institutions
to be formed for the Lesotho highlands water program, and provided a detailed foundation
for processes, the rights and obligations of the two countries, and the calculation mechanism
for water royalties. The institutions established under the Treaty were the Lesotho Highlands
Development Authority (LHDA), South Africa's Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA),
and the Joint Permanent Technical Commission. The commission was subsequently renamed
the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission (LHWC), playing the same role. LHDA and
TCTA were each responsible for works and actions within their country. But there was a
need for an institution to provide a bridging mechanism for the extensive coordination
required, and to overview the whole program. This was and still is the role of LHWC.




7
  The water was used by South Africa for extra supply to Gauteng province, a water-scarce highly
industrialized region.
  LHWP-1A and LHWP-1B are the first two phases of a long-term water development program, phase 1B being
the "project" under review. Where reference is made in this report to the long term water program (which
includes both phases 1A and 1B and, where relevant to the discussion, future development phases), the term
"program" is used to indicate this (for instance, the "Lesotho highlands water program", or "LHW program").

Implementation
2.5     LHWP-1B was implemented over 8 ?4years including two extensions of a year each
to provide more time for implementation of the social and environmental components. There
was a delay of one year between Board Approval and Effectiveness, mainly due to delays
                                                         6

with institutional adjustments which were conditions of Effectiveness. There was no
restructuring or major change in components.

Safeguards
2.6      Five environmental/social safeguards were triggered by the project :'

         Environmental assessment (OP 4.0 1): LHWP- 1B was designated an environment
         category A project, and a full Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared
         followed by an Environmental Action Plan. This included management of the reduced
         river flow downstream of Mohale dam and establishment of three nature reserves. An
         intended Integrated Catchment Management Program was not implemented.

         Resettlement (OP 4.12): Resettlement, reviewed in paras 3.16 to 3.2 1 and Annex By
         only involved 4 18 families, but was the most difficult safeguard to implement.

         International waters (OP 7.50): The water treaty and its implementation satisfied the
         requirement that the riparians have "entered into agreements" or "established an
         institutional framework" for managing the water (para 3.9 and Annex A).

         Safety of dams (OP 4.37): With a height of 145 meters, Mohale dam is firmly in the
         category of a "large dam", defined in the safeguard policy as one over 15 meters.
         LHWP established an engineering panel of experts who inspected design and
         construction throughout the process. An emergency preparedness plan was also
         established. The IEG mission was advised that the dam was still being inspected
         periodically by the panel.''

         Natural habitats (OP 4.04): A program was implemented to preserve the Maluti
         minnow, the most vulnerable of species affected by the new water regime
         downstream of Mohale and which is indigenous only to Lesotho's highland water
         bodies (para 3.15 and Annex C).

Monitoring and Evaluation
2.7  Based on the design, implementation and utilization of LHWP-1B's M&E, overall
M&E performance is rated Modest.

         Design: Substantial. The appraisal report contains an overly long (1 1 pages) results
         framework and was aptly considered "far too all-embracing" by the Bank's Quality

9
 A "Safeguard is a policy that ia critical to ensuring that potentially adverse environmental and social
consequences are identified, minimized and mitigated (World Bank Safeguard Policies as of February 2010).
There were no major issues as regards fmancial management, procurement, and disbursement.
10
  In February 2006, subsequent to heavy rains and a rise in the reservoir level to spilling conditions, a crack
appeared in the concrete facing. The ICR advises that this has been examined by the panel of experts which
concluded that the crack did not present dam safety conce.rns.

           Assurance Group which reviewed the project in 2002." Nevertheless, the indicators
           have proved helpful for assessing project progress. An M&E unit was also established
           to manage M&E surveys which would primarily be contracted out to consultants, and
           the M&E manager was appointed before project approval. The contents of the
           surveys related to the environment and water infrastructure were spelled out, but this
           was not so for social aspects of the project.

           Implementation: Modest. The M&E unit was maintained throughout the project
           period and continues to this day. Management information data (tracking progress of
           construction, water flows, etc.) has been good, Socio-economic and poverty related
           monitoring was less successful as disjointed contracting of consultants resulted in
           some discontinuity between surveys.

           Utilization: Modest. Data related to the project's physical progress was followed
           closely by LHDA and LHWC, and played an important informational role in
           management decision making. Environmental monitoring was also good quality. The
           regular reporting on water flow below Mohale dam and of the maluti minnow
           population are good practice examples. For socio-economic monitoring, supervision
           reports indicate that information provided by the M&E unit attracted little interest
           from the operational units. This appears particularly so for resettlement. The
           November 2001 supervision mission aide memoire commented that there was little
           evidence that the findings from the socioeconomic monitoring process were being
           used to assess and plan compensation and development activities. The weak
           utilization of socio-economic data contrasts with the good utilization of construction
           and environmental data, moderating an otherwise good performance.

Accounts and audit
2.8     Accounting records were maintained efficiently and any required reconciliations of
accounts were done expeditiously. Audit reports were issued on average 5 months after the
end of each financial year, were unqualified, and were in accordance with the International
Auditing Standards. There were two Inspection Panel requests, both during preparation of the
project, and both dismissed by the Panel.12 A corruption charge related to 1HWP-IB's
predecessor, LHWP- 1A, was successfully prosecuted during the LHWP- 1B project period. l 3



11
     This was before the current appraisal practice of listing a limited number of core "monitorable indicators".
12
   One complaint in the Gauteng region that water supply to a township would be reduced was considered by
the panel to be more a legacy of the previous apartheid regime than due to Bank policies and procedures. The
other was a claim by mining companies that the land submerged under the Katse reservoir (Phase 1A of the
LHW program) came under their exploitation rights. Lesotho's supreme court ruled this was null and void, and
the inspection panel concluded that the Bank was not responsible.
l 3 This involved corruption with consultant engineering contracts. Lesotho, with the Bank's support, acted
firmly, prosecuting the involved persons and companies. Six government personnel, including a former Chief
Executive of LHDA were convicted, and two large international consultant engineering companies were barred
from competing for World Bank financed contracts.

Overall Project Outcome:               Moderately Satisfactory


Relevance
3.2     Relevance of objectives. Both of LHWP-1B's development objectives are relevant.
The project harnesses the respective comparative advantage of each country - Lesotho with
abundant water but in critical need of revenues, and water-scarce South Africa willing to pay
royalties for such water. CDSP's social fund was intended to use the LHW program's
royalties to help poor communities to invest in social infrastructure. LHWP-1B was well
couched within Lesotho's overarching objective to reduce poverty, the highest development
priority of both the Bank and Government (Section 1). Poverty reduction through pro-poor
economic growth has been a consistent goal throughout LHWP-1B's preparation and
implementation. The 1998 Country Assistance Strategy, prepared at the same time as the
project, highlighted LHWP- 1B as a centerpiece for the pro-poor development strategy. The
2006 CAS, prepared as the project was closing, also held pro-poor growth as a strategic
objective. Given Lesotho's situation of low per capita incomes and considerable income
disparities, the relevance of objectives is assessed to be substantial.

3.3     Relevance of design. The project's design was uneven in quality. Engineering design
was strong - there were no significant design changes during construction, while the physical
capacity for the intended water transfers was achieved. Institutionally, it was appropriate to
structure the project within the arrangements under the water treaty, which had been largely
successful. On the other hand, preparation of a training plan for the management
strengthening activities was left in the PAD to be done during project implementation, and in
                                                    9

the event was only formulated shortly before project closure. The resettlement program had
several design shortfalls - principally the limited emphasis on helping re-settlers to become
self-reliant, and the institutional structure for resettlement. The engineering focus of LHDA
did not generate sufficient emphasis on resettlement, and a dedicated institution for
resettlement or some other arrangement might have been better.

3.4      A general weakness, shared with CDSP, was a lack of attention to how the royalties
were to be used (para 3.26). The intention of using royalties for poverty alleviation is clearly
listed in Bank strategy documents and in the LHWP-1B PAD, Yet in the project's specific
design there is no apparent interest once the royalties are handed over, and the design of
CDSP provided no practical solution for using the royalties. In effect, the funds could have
been used, without any monitoring, for any purpose whatsoever. Monitoring, legal covenants
and other safeguards could have been considered in the design of LHWP-1B.

3.5     The weak designs of LHWP-IB's resettlement and capacity building activities and
the gap in determining how to safeguard the usage of the royalties temper the highly
satisfactory design for the construction activities of the project. Hence, the combined
relevance of design for the first project objective is assessed modest. The design for the
second objective - providing water to South Africa at the lowest cost alternative had
substantial relevance. LHWP- 1B' s location and design provided the lowest-cost alternative
for the additional water that Gauteng province required.

3.6     Taking account of both the relevance of objectives and the relevance of design the
overall relevance of LHWP-1B was substantial.

Efficacy
Objective I . To put in place the physical and managerial capacity for Lesotho to transform
its principal natural resource of abundance - water - into export revenues that can be
applied to poverty reduction and economic stability while (a) protecting the environment and
mitigating any adverse social and environmental impacts; and (b) maximizing the local
development spin-ofls o the project in Lesotho.
                        f

Construction, water delivery and royalties

3.7     The project's engineering design and works required complex engineering and major
civil works, especially for the Mohale dam and some 30 km of tunnels to transport water to
South Africa. The works were completed in full by mid-2004, six years after project
approval and six months before the original project closing date. The combined cost of
engineering and works was $457 million which was 72 percent of the cost estimated at
appraisal. There is general consensus in Government, other agencies and the Bank on the
good quality of the infrastructure. The size and complexity of LHWP-1B (amongst other
features, Mohale is one of the highest dams in Africa.14) make this achievement particularly
remarkable. The created infrastructure delivers water as designed - 9.6 m3/second from

14
  Mohale dam has a height of 145 meters. Katse (LHWP-Phase 1A) is 185 meters high, the second highest
dam in Africa.
                                                       10

Mohale to Katsu and 2.2m3/second for Matsoku diversion. Cumulative royalties in 2006
were 1.9 billion Maloti or $240 million, slightly above the projections of royalties made at
appraisal. l5 Hence, based on appraisal targets, the objective to create physical infrastructure
for water delivery in exchange for royalties has been met. Efficacy of the construction
program and the associated earning of royalties was high.

Managerial capacity

3.8     Creation of infrastructure was to be partnered by the strengthening of capacity to
manage the water transfer program. In particular, this was intended for LHDA as the hands-
on implementer of the project. To build LHDA's staff capacity, a substantial training
program had been envisaged at appraisal, which was to be managed by LHDA through an
annually reviewed three-year rolling training plan. This was to commence in 1998, the first
year of the project.16 Three years later, the September 2001 supervision mission aide-
memoire stated that no such plan had been drafted by LHDA. Subsequently, seven years after
project approval, and already into the first of the two project extension years, the April 2005
supervision mission aide memoire commented that there had still been no training
expenditures under the Loan. The non-achievement of the training program was a key gap
given LHDA's need for staff strengthening.

3.9     The Water Treaty. The project contributed indirectly through discussions related to
water management under LHWP- 1B and through technical assistance to the continued
development of the institutional arrangements and processes of the 1986 Water Treaty
between Lesotho and South Africa. The treaty governs all aspects of negotiating and
coordinating water and financial transfers between the two countries, and was set up
expressly for the Lesotho water program at the beginning of Phase 1A. The core institution is
the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission (LHWC) comprising representatives of both
countries, primarily from Lesotho's LHDA and South Africa's Trans Caledon Tunnel
Authority which were the implementing agencies in their respective countries. The treaty has
been an essential part of the Lesotho highlands water program. A number of observers
consider the treaty to be a "best practice'' example of international water sharing. IEG
concurs with this assessment. The IEG mission discussed experience under the treaty with
stakeholders from both Lesotho and South Africa. The main features considered to have
contributed to the treaty's success, as well as aspects that could have been improved, are
noted in Annex A. Taking into account the negligible efficacy of staff training yet the
project's indirect contribution to the continued good management of water under the treaty,
the overall efficacy for improving managerial capacity is assessed modest.

l5 There is no indication in the ICR that the estimated growth of royalties was calculated consistent with the
growth in demand assumed for the economic analysis of LHWP-1B. The recalculation of the economic rate of
return made at project completion resulted in a reduction in the estimated ERR compared with the appraisal
estimate (para 3.23). While estimating royalties is a financial calculation and the ERR uses economic costs, the
direction of changes in the level of royalties and for the ERR would normally be expected to be similar.
Possible explanations include that: (i) royalty levels under the treaty were raised by more than the trend in
demand for water; andlor: (ii) that the appraisal estimate of royalty earnings was made entirely independent of
the ERR analysis, and was overly optimistic compared with ERR assumptions. The IEG mission did not fmd
data to verify such or other explanations.
16
     As listed in the key performance indicators for LHWP-IB (PAD, Annex 1, page 9).

Using export revenues that can be applied to poverty reduction and economic stability

3.10 The water treaty continued during the project period to serve successfully as a
mechanism for determining the water royalties paid by South Africa to Lesotho. Such
royalties went to two budgets: (i) to the social fund (the Lesotho Fund for Community
Development) established under the Community Development Support Project, also assessed
in this review; and (ii) to the government general budget. Under CDSP, the LFCD was to be
specifically targeted to poorer communities. Funds received by the general budget were not
earmarked for a specific purpose.

3.1 1 There is a close conceptual and operational link between LHWP-1B and CDSP, as
stated very prominently in Bank strategy statements when the two projects were being
prepared (para 1.8.). Hence, an overarching question relating to both projects is why, during
design and implementation, this link was not further developed into an effective partnership.
Each appraisal report refers to the other project, but no specific actions are cited. Supervision
continued this pattern. Each project was supervised in isolation. Yet discussions of both
projects together could have added synergies that would have made both projects better. In
the case of LHWP-1B the project achieved its objective to enable more funds that can be
applied for development purpose, but there should be concern if the "can be applied to
poverty alleviation" becomes a clear "it does not go to poverty alleviation," because the
CDSP broke down (Section 5). Given these broader perspectives, LHWP-IB's efficacy
ensuring revenues that can be applied to poverty reduction and economic stability was
modest.

Maximizing local development spin-offs

3.12 This sub-objective is described in the PAD in terms of jobs created in Lesotho by the
project's construction activities. From this perspective the project performed well. Thus, at
appraisal, construction activities were estimated to create 3,000 jobs. By project completion
9,000 jobs had been created involving some 20,000 person-years of employment. Based on
international experience, construction earnings can also be expected to have had multiplier
effects - increased incomes can generate additional jobs and value added, but no empirical
analysis was found of the specific situation for Lesotho. Nevertheless, the known first-round
impacts considerably exceeded targets, and efficacy is assessed to be substantial.

3.13 AIDS. Notwithstanding the above, a relevant unknown is whether the LHWP-1B's
construction camps have influenced the transmission of HIV/AIDS. Lesotho, with an
estimated 24 percent of the population infected by HIV/AIDS can hardly afford the distress
and poverty created by additional sources of possible infection. While no data specific to
LHWP-1B's construction camps was found by the IEG mission, the experience of Lesotho's
labor force working in South Africa's mines is concerning. The South Africa experience is
that the all-male labor camps attracted prostitution and widespread transmission of the virus.
HIV/AIDS was then transmitted to the wives of the miners on their return home. A clear
need is to better understand whether the Lesotho highlands water program enhanced
                                                    12

transmission of HIV/AIDS, how any such risks can be averted, and then, as applicable, to use
such knowledge to design effective preventive measures for the future.17

Mitinatinn social and environmental impacts

3.14 LHWP-1B's objective to protect the environment and mitigate any adverse social and
environmental impacts had substantial efficacy in the case of environmental management
and was partially achieved, hence, with modest efficacy, in the case of resettlement of the
families affected by the project.

Environmental management

3.15 Environmental aspects of LHWP-1 B have in most respects been managed well.
Efficacy was substantial. The two most prominent environmental activities were the
management of river flows downstream of Mohale dam, and a biodiversity program to
protect the Maluti Minnow, a fish unique to Lesotho's highlands and particularly vulnerable
to changes in water flow." To date, both programs have been successful. Environmental flow
options were assessed through monitoring and modeling of in-stream flows and this analysis
was then put into action - Mohale's dam outlet valves and operating rules were adjusted and
the minimum flows specified in the water treaty were increased by over 300 percent. Under
the Maluti minnow conservation program fish were transferred to four locations with similar
habitat upstream of Mohale dam. To date, population density in the new locations has been
stable. Annex C provides further details on these two "good practice'' environmental actions.

Resettlement

3.16 The Mohale dam and reservoir and other infrastructure under LHWP-1B required the
resettlement of 4 18 households. These families were resettled following a comprehensive
resettlement policy with the following main features: provision to each family of a newly
constructed small house, long-term compensation based on the estimated lost income from
the household's fields and other assets, training if requested for an income earning activity,
and community facilities if not present (such as an access road or primary school). Of
particular note is the long compensation period (inflation adjusted) of 50 years (or an
equivalent lump sum payment).

3.17 Field inspections in 2008 by the national O m b ~ d s m a n found that in most cases
                                                                  '~
resettlement for LHWP- 1B families had been concordant with the policy, but for 83 resettled
families, some resettlement actions were still due. Most of the remaining actions were
relatively simple. Over 80 percent of the 83 complaints were only for the complete payment
of the family's compensation package (for instance, for the family's trees or other assets).

17
  The ICR reports that some mitigation activities were undertaken under LHWP- 1B primarily through
education at clinics and in pamphlets and distribution of condoms.
18
   The environmental action plan also included piloting of catchment management approaches, and monitoring
of water quality.
19
  Lesotho's "Ombudsman" heads an independent office created by Government to look into complaints by the
people of unfair or inappropriate actions by government departments or agencies.
                                                        13

Completing the resettlement actions is, thus, not only an evident need but also relatively
straightforward to carry out.

3.18 Based on the IEG mission's field visits and discussions with re-settlers, government
and NGOs, several measures could have improved the quality of resettlement (Annex B).20
Institutional strengthening was one need. There was no equivalent for resettlement of
LHDA's capacity for implementing the construction program. Construction received close
management attention and the staff numbers, specialist skills and technical assistance to
succeed. Resettlement was short-changed in all of these areas.21

3.19 Second, rather than seeing resettlement as primarily a matter of "compensation", a
greater emphasis on "development" was needed - i.e. to help each family to become self-
sufficient rather than dependent on compensation hand-outs. The training and technical
assistance provided under LHWP-1B could have been further strengthened. And third, the
planning and implementation of resettlement needed to be more participatory and flexible,
based on a grass roots rather than top-down approach. Given the incomplete achievements of
the resettlement program, efficacy was modest.

The broader impacts of the resettlement and environmental program

3 -20 Setting standards. Notwithstanding the imperfections noted above, structured
interviews by the IEG mission of different stakeholders indicate that the Bank has had
positive impact on resettlement and environmental safeguards reaching well beyond the
specific confines of LHWP-1B alone.22Typical remarks were that national awareness of
environmental and social issues, in particular resettlement issues, had been raised and that the
Bank's safeguards set standards for others to emulate. The resettlement program for the
Metalong dam project was one of the examples cited.23And, when an NGO that had been a
persistent critic of resettlement under the Lesotho highlands water program was asked by the
mission what would have happened if the World Bank had not been involved with the
program, the response of "disaster!" speaks volumes.

3.21 Are safeguard standards too high? A number of stakeholders (from LHWC, TCTA,
LHDA and DBSA) considered that the Bank may be asking too much in its safeguard

2o  Care is needed in distinguishing between resettlement under LHWP-1B and resettlement under LHWP-1 A.
This PPAR refers only to the LHWP-1B program. There have been significant improvements in resettlement
since the Katse resettlement program under Phase 1A.
*' Improving institutional arrangements would be one of the areas needing examination. Structural options
might include a much strengthened and substantially autonomous unit in LHDA with the same seniority as the
engineering group, a separate institution for R&R, choices regarding the appropriate degree of involvement of
civil society (private companies, NGOs) in implementation and monitoring, and other options as practical.
22 In parallel with this PPAR, structured interviews using a questionnaire were carried out by the IEG mission
with different stakeholders (in some cases the questionnaire was completed by the stakeholder without the
structured interview, although these stakeholders were also interviewed beforehand). The interviews were to
contribute to a separate Safeguards Evaluation Study being undertaken by IEG. Stakeholders consulted
included, the Ministry of Finance, LHWC, LHDA, DBSA, NGOs, development agencies, local government,
villagers and re-settlers.
23   The Bank is contributing to the Metalong Dam project with a Loan of $8.5 million.
                                                             14

    standards, especially for resettlement. The Bank has "set the bar too high"; it is "asking too
    much and the actions are too costly" for government to do or to keep up after the project
    period; the government will be under pressure in non-Bank projects to follow the Bank's
    entitlements; the Bank wants "an overly gold-plated resettlement policy;" "the program to
    save the Maluti minnow is too costly;" the Bank is "too generous to re-settlers;'' the Bank is
    "overly intellectual"; etc. NGOs consulted did not consider that safeguards standards were
    too high. But most stakeholders including NGOs shared the view that good and timely
    implementation of resettlement (the practical) rather than concern with the level of standards
    was the key gap. In short, care was needed to ensure that the "best" was not the enemy of the
    "good".

    3.22 Implementing safeguards. LHWP-1B integrated programs to respond to all five of the
    safeguard needs that it encountered (environment, resettlement, natural habitats, international
    waters, and dam safety).24The number and diversity of these safeguards provides opportunity
    to derive lessons from the group as a whole. Several observations relating Bank performance
    to the quality of safeguard implementation have emerged: (i) the Bank performance
    qualities25that contribute to successful implementation of a safeguard are broadly similar to
    the Bank qualities needed to promote satisfactory performance of a non-safeguard; (ii) both
    good preparation and supervision are required; (iii) highlighting the importance of a
    safeguard can significantly influence government prioritization of the safeguard; (iv) staff
    resources need to reflect the effort needed; and (v) awareness of such needs (likely obvious
    to many Bank staff) does not necessarily translate to actual implementation. "Annex D
    provides a qualitative discussion of these observations, also including safeguards from
    CDSP.

    3.23 Economic benefits from implementing safeguards. Both at appraisal and completion,
    the safeguards that applied to LHWP-1B were seen as necessary costs rather than considering
    the benefits from the safeguard as well as the costs. Accordingly, benefits from implementing
    the safeguards were not estimated or included in the ERR calculations. A better approach
    would have been to recognize such benefits. This would have put the costs in broader
    perspective, even showing in some cases that implementation of a safeguard can be
    economically beneficial. For the resettlement safeguard, if higher standards of living for the
    affected communities are achieved, benefits would, at least partly, offset the costs of the
    program. If LHDNLHWC had calculated the economic viability and the financial benefits
    from resettlement, decision makers in Lesotho might have been more readily persuaded to
    fund and adequately staff the resettlement program to the full extent needed. The constant
    monitoring and calculations of in-stream flow requirements below Mohale dam is LHWP-
    1B's best example of estimating benefits as well as costs.


    24 The international waters safeguard was well handled under the water treaty, with LHWC's coordination, and
    the dam safety safeguard was met through the establishment of a dam safety panel for regular inspections of
    infrastructure and operations).

.   25 Performance qualities considered in Annex D are: (i) a satisfactory environmental assessment (or
    equivalent); (ii) quality of preparation; (iii) implementation readiness; (iv) general effectiveness of supervision;
    (v) presence of required specialists; (vi) effectiveness in institutional strengthening; (vii) emphasis given to the
    safeguard in team interactions with government; and (viii) creation of a good M&E system.

Efficacv o f Objective I1 To assist South Africa in developing its lowest cost alternativesfor
supply of water to the Gauteng Region.

3.24 LHWP-1Bs second objective - to provide water to South Africa's Gauteng region at
the lowest possible cost - was fully achieved. In a comparative costing at appraisal of
alternative water capture and delivery systems for South Africa, it was found that LHWP-
1B's costs of water provision would be at least 20 percent lower than the costs of the lowest
cost alternative water enhancement option.26That differential may be larger now given that
LHWP- 1B's actual project costs were lower than appraisal expectations. Efficacy was
substantial.

LHWP-1B's overall efficacy
3.25 Objective I has a number of features for which efficacy has been individually
evaluated above. For: (i) establishing the infrastructure for water transfer and sales of water
between Lesotho and South Africa - efficacy was high. The works were of high quality, on
schedule, below expected costs, and delivered the quantity of water intended - an exemplary
performance; (ii) the training program for LHDA failed, but coordination between the two
countries improved, a modest step towards improving "managerial capacity"; (iii) for
generating export revenues that can be applied to poverty reduction and economic stability,
efficacy was modest. The revenues were generated, but as CDSP's social fund became
dysfunctional, the possibility to channel funds for poverty alleviation purposes disappeared;
(iv) employment generation from construction was substantial, exceeding targets for such
local development spin-offs; (v) environmental management had substantial efficacy in the
case of river flows management and biodiversity conservation; (vi) resettlement had mixed
performance and was incomplete - a modest achievement. The efficacy of LHWP-1B's
second objective was substantial in that the project fully achieved providing the lowest cost
alternative for supply of water to South Africa.

3.26 LHWP-1B's achievements under objective I were strong as concerns water supply
and revenue generation, but there were shortfalls in capacity building and resettlement. Most
important, the broader strategy - poverty alleviation - was ignored, and the project never
achieved even its modest goal of making export revenues that "can be" applied to poverty
reduction." When there was no possibility of using LHWP-1B's revenues for poverty
alleviation after the social fund was diverted from its intended purpose, this should have been
a concern for LHWP-1B. Leverage from the popular LHWP-1B program might have been
used to pressure use of the fund for its intended purpose. There was an ideal opportunity to
form an effective partnership with CDSP in order to better achieve the goal - poverty
alleviation - that the two projects had in common. Given the shortfalls in capacity building
and resettlement and, especially, the lack of success making funds available for poverty
alleviation, the efficacy of objective I is assessed modest. Taking the two objectives together,
LHWP-IB's overall efficacy was modest.



26 The next lowest cost alternative supply augmentation options were development of a "TugeldVaal transfer
scheme" and an "OrangeNaal transfer scheme."
                                                       16

3.27 The ?hardware?-?software?divide. For both the Bank and Government, there was a
marked difference in effort and performance between ?hardware? (engineering, physical
works and managing water delivery) aspects of LHWP-1B that were excellent, and the
project?s ?software? aspects, in particular resettlement, capacity building and training, that
were less successful. From the IEG mission?s discussions in Lesotho, the reason behind this
differential appears to be largely cultural. LHDA is a strongly engineering oriented
organization, and this is also substantially the case for LHWC and TCTA. Behind these
agencies were two governments more focused on realizing the treaty and its provisions of
water and royalties as expeditiously as possible, than on software considerations. The
governments? orientations to LHWP also reflect the recent history of the two countries. South
Africa had only recently emerged from apartheid policies, and social concerns such as
resettlement were not paramount. Lesotho also appears to have viewed development with an
infrastructure orientation. The Bank team also tended to have a more hardware than software
orientation. For future phases of the LHW program, conscious efforts to overcome any such
biases, both during project design and implementation, would likely help to bring software
actions more to the forefront.

Efficiency
3.28     The economic rate of return at completion, as calculated in the ICR, was 11.5 percent
- about 4 percent less than the ERR calculated at appraisal, primarily due to reduced
estimates of the future growth in demand for water and the economic value of water. This
was because since appraisal South Africa implemented a number of demand-management
activities, which reduced demand for water. Hence, the ICR calculation assumed a 1.5
percent per annum growth in water demand as compared with the three percent annual
growth rate estimated at appraisal. However, a future growth in demand for water of only 1.5
percent per annum would be quite modest relative to economic growth in Gauteng province,
the consumer of LHWP-1B?s water exports and the country?s economic and demographic
center.27Based on the IEG mission?s discussions with TCTA, demand management can be
expected to be only a medium-term palliative to Gauteng?sstructural water scarcity, and in
the longer term, LHWP-1B is likely to become an increasingly important underpinning for
Gauteng?sand Lesotho?sdevelopment. Such strategic needs are not entirely captured through
conventional cost-benefit analysis. LHWP- 1B?s efficiency was substantial.

Risk to Development Outcome
3.29 The primary risk is institutional. The capacities of TCTA and LHWC are adequate,
but LHDA needs strengthening. In particular, the resettlement program needs improvement:
first and foremost to protect the welfare of the project affected persons; but also because a
weak resettlement program could influence popular support to Government for further stages
in the Lesotho highlands water program.



27 GDP growth in Gauteng (which averaged 3.3 percent per annum in 1995-2002) has been faster than the
national average of 2.7 percent in the same period. GDP growth in South Africa also accelerated in the 1990s.
                                                      17

3.30 A fundamental influence will be from the two Governments. As the water program is
to the advantage of both Lesotho and South Africa, significant problems are likely to receive
priority attention from both parties. Further, the water treaty has proven to be an agreement
that can be adjusted to accommodate new developments, and would be an underlying
strength for all institutional linkages. Overall, risk to development outcome is rated
moderate.

Bank Performance
3.3 1    Quality at entry: There were two areas of excellence:

         Engineering. Close supervision of consultants by the Bank team over several years
         resulted in quality design for works and for preparation of tender documents. As a
         result, the project was fully ready for implementation of the construction program.

         International coordination and motivation. Two countries and a large group of
         development agencies and private sector investors were successfully brought
         together. A view expressed to the IEG mission by a number of persons including the
         Development Bank of Southern Africa, a prominent financer of LHWP-lB, was that
         the World Bank, by its presence and considered reliability and quality, provided
         reassurance to these institutions. Some commentators felt that the Bank was uniquely
         placed in its ability to facilitate international cooperation in funding and
         implementing such a complex and multi-actor program as LHWP-1B.

3.32 Counterbalancing these outstanding activities were some of the "soft" aspects of
LHWP-1B which could have been better prepared. In particular, the resettlement program`s
modalities and institutional base had not been firmed up, a plan for training and capacity
building had not been prepared;' and features to facilitate usage of royalties for poverty
reduction had not been considered. Taking the Bank's strong performance with the
construction program and as an international coordinator, as well as the weaker performance
on the project's soft areas, the Bank's overall quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.33 Quality of Supervision: Supervision missions were strongly staffed, were regular
(twice a year), and had a range of specializations. A resettlement specialist was included in
practically all missions. Management recognized that supervision of such a complex project
would need greater resources, and the average annual supervision expenditure between FYOO
and FY06 was $310,000 - over three times a more typical project supervision budget. The
team continued with the high level support on the engineering side that had characterized
project preparation. The highly satisfactory supervision of the project's hardware activities is


28 There was also a general risk in taking the project to the Board with as many as eight actions required as
conditions of Effectiveness. Board presentation could have waited until more of these actions had been
achieved, especially as some required significant institutional adjustments. For instance, the conditions of
Effectiveness included amendment of the water treaty to streamline the governance structure, creation of the
Lesotho Fund for Community Development (under CDSP), and various policy changes for the resettlement
program. In the event, the Effectiveness conditions were met, but not without a one year delay between project
Approval and Effectiveness.
                                              18

nevertheless countenancing software weaknesses - adequate solutions were not found for
resettlement and capacity building, M&E could have been stronger, and, especially, the
degree to which royalties went to poverty reduction should have been cause for concern.
Overall, the quality of supervision was moderately satisfactory.

3.34 Taking both the quality at entry and quality of supervision together, the Bank's
overall performance was moderately satisfactory.

Borrower Performance
3.35 Government Performance. The Government worked closely with the Bank during
project preparation and followed the construction program carefully, providing support as
needed. This included expeditious approvals related to the construction program.
Government for the most part left LHDA, LHWC and TCTA to manage the construction
program themselves. Management actions implementing the water treaty were also
substantially left to these agencies. This was appropriate. The agencies rather than
Government had the expertise, and undue interference by Government would not have been
helpful. Nevertheless, this happened to some extent - for instance, key appointments had to
be authorized by Government rather than the agencies themselves. Notwithstanding,
construction was the fulcrum of the project, and in this field Government provided a good
supportive environment. But little attention was paid to the utilization of the royalties for
poverty reduction, even though addressing poverty was Government's central development
objective (para 1.8). Government performance was moderately satisfactory.

3.36 Implementing Agencies' Performance: Construction and water management activities
of the three agencies were highly satisfactory. LHDA successfully implemented the
construction program - a major achievement. LHWC provided technical support to LHDA
and was a largely effective overall coordinator. TCTA played a fully satisfactory role in
liaising with LHWC and LHDA, and having the infrastructure ready to transport water
deliveries from Lesotho. In managing the soft aspects of the project - training and
resettlement in particular - LHDA and LHWC paid less attention, and the project results
reflect this. These shortfalls diminish the overall evaluation of the performance of the three
institutions - from an otherwise excellent assessment (on hardware aspects of the project) to
a moderately satisfactory assessment when considering the project as a whole.

3.37 Taking the performances of both Government and the implementing agencies
together, the borrower's overall performance was moderately satisfactory.



4. CDSP's Objectives and Implementation
Objectives and Design
4.1     The objectives of the Community Development Support Project were to: (i) test a
demand-driven and participatory approach through a multi-sectoral special fund and draw
lessons as to whether it is an appropriate mechanism to support community development in
                                                      19

Lesotho; and (ii) test various mechanisms and tools to monitor poverty trends in Lesotho and
to coordinate national poverty monitoring and analysis activities. (source: Development
Credit Agreement.)29

4.2     The Community Development Support Project was a pilot project to test Community
Driven Development (CDD) approaches for financing poverty alleviating community
infrastructure. Funded under a Learning and Innovation            CDSP's components,
supporting the project's first objective were to finance 22 sub-projects using CDD processes
so as to learn for subsequent scaling-up to a national CDD program; and related to this, a
component to strengthen a social fund agency. This would be the conduit for provision of
finance and technical assistance for the sub-projects. CDSP's second objective was supported
by a program to strengthen the nation's capacity for monitoring poverty, implemented b
Lesotho's Bureau of Statistics. CDSP's objectives and components are shown in Box 2.                    z
4.3     Using royalties. CDSP was conceived as a way to utilize the royalties from water
exports to South Africa under LHWP- 1B. Poverty alleviation was the central thrust in both
the Bank's and Government's strategies (Section 1). The LHWP's royalties, channeled
through a CDSP-supported social fund, were seen as a means of directly financing rural
infrastructure, through community driven processes targeting the poor. (Royalties over and
above the needs of the fund would go to Government's general budget.) The project was a
challenge as Lesotho had little experience with CDD approaches. Also, the existing social
fund agency - the Lesotho Highlands Revenue Fund (LHRF), which had been established in
1992 and had been the channel of LHWP (Phase 1A) royalties - was dysfunctional and
needed major revamping. To this purpose, LHRF was reorganized in institutional structure
and with new financing guidelines, to become the Lesotho Fund for Community
Development (LFCD).

 4.4    The LHRF reformulation. LFCD was established in March 1999 during preparation
 of CDSP. LFCD was to make a new start on LHRF. In the words of Government's Letter of
 Development Policy for the CDSP (March 23, 1998)' LFCD was to be a "community-based
fund that i more responsive to the needs of the community, particularly the poor.'' This
           s
 would be accomplished by strengthening fund management and using CDD approaches
 following transparent procedures set out in an operational manual. The Bank and government
 viewed the LFCD and the supporting CDSP as central elements in Lesotho's poverty


29
   The PAD version of the Project Objectives is substantially similar to the DCA version used here, but is less
precise in some of the wording. Accordingly, the DCA wording has been used. (For Objective (i) the PAD
wording is "to test demand -driven and participatory approaches through a multi-sectoral special fund and draw
lessons on how to support community development in Lesotho." )
30
   A Learning and Innovation Loan provides small loans for projects experimenting with or piloting
innovations. It is in particular used where successful piloting would open the way for subsequent scale-up of a
key development activity. In CDSP's case this was to be the CDD approach. A Learning and Innovation Loan is
expected to include good monitoring so that a documented base is available for adjustment and future
application, and it should also integrate participatory learning processes by the borrower.
31
   CDSP was Approved in December 1999, and became effective seven months later in July 2000. It closed as
scheduled in September 2003.

alleviation strategy. For the Bank, this even went as far as linking the size of the Bank's
lending program to satisfactory performance of CDSP.32

as to whether it is an appropriate mechanism to support community development in Lesotho.

(ii) To test various mechanisms and tools to monitor poverty trends in Lesotho and to coordinate national
poverty monitoring and analysis activities.

ComDonents:

     A. Support for the establishment and implementation of the LFCD by: (i) piloting the LFCD cycle
        through sub-projects in 22 communities, and for different types of sub-projects; (ii) Systems
        development and operationalization for LFCD; and (iii) Management and coordination of LFCD. Costs
        including contingencies were estimated at Appraisal to be $7.6 million, and actual costs were $18.7
        million.
     B. Capacity building for LFCD by: (i) Training of LFCD staff in operations, finance and management;
        and (ii) Training for LFCD partner institutions (communities, central and district level government
        staff, local governments, NGOs and private sector). Costs including contingencies were estimated at
        Appraisal to be $1.4 million, and actual costs were $0.4 million.
     C. Support to the National Poverty Program Monitoring by: (i) collecting data for poverty
        monitoring; and (ii) Program monitoring and poverty analysis. Costs including contingencies were
        estimated at Appraisal to be $1.4 million, actual costs not available.

Institutional Arrangements and Implementation
4.5      CDSP was under the Ministry of Development Planning, with implementation
through the LFCD for the first two components and the Bureau of Statistics (BOS) for the
national poverty monitoring component. LFCD was headed by a Board of Directors, with
hands-on implementation through a management unit. LFCD also had small field offices at
district level which were to coordinate activities of line ministries that would provide
technical assistance to communities in their areas of specialization. The intention was that the
32
   Thus, the 1998 CAS stated that "high case lending to Lesotho would be contingent on the implementation of
a program to deal with poverty reduction (such as the establishment of the enhanced L H W (which would
become the LFCD) and better implementation and monitoring of the Poverty Action Program."
                                                      21


LFCD Board and management unit (MU) would be substantially independent from political
influences. Thereby, LFCD could operate as a technocratic institution with transparent
criteria for sub-project selection, and standard operational norms for implementation using
CDD processes.

4.6     The estimated cost of the project at appraisal was $10.4 million of which IDA was to
contribute a $5.7 million grant. At project completion about half ($2.5 million) of the grant
had been disbursed. The shortfall was in part due to lower expenditure on establishing and
equipping the Lesotho Fund for Community Development, and in part to depreciation of the
maloti. Government expenditures on the project increased considerably - from an estimated
$5.7 million at appraisal to $17.0 million at closure. The increase was almost entirely due to
the funding by government of more and larger sub-projects, amounting to considerably more
than the originally planned 22 sub-projects. CDSP was closed as scheduled, in September
2003, some 3 % years after Board approval. The LFCD was disbanded at the end of 2008,
with no plans for a replacement organization.

Safeguards
4.7     CDSP triggered the environmental assessment safeguard (OP 4.01), and an
environmental impact assessment was undertaken (category B). For the project's main
component - community development - the approach was to integrate an environmental and
social screening process as part of the appraisal of each sub-project. However, preparation
for such a screening process was incomplete. First, while the environmental impact
assessment was of reasonable standard, a clear environmental action plan was not prepared.
Further, the operational manual, which was to be the key guide during sub-project appraisal
and implementation, contained minimal guidance on how to carry out environmental and
social screening.33In the end, however, all this was moot as political influences on LFCD
caused all environmental and social processes to be abandoned.34

4.8    CDSP's National Poverty Monitoring component had a happier experience. It
provided poverty data that have been useful for both Government and the Bank, and BOS'
surveys are still continuing, substantially using the survey and analytical methodologies
introduced by CDSP.

Monitoring and Evaluation
4.9    Evaluating CDSP's M&E needs to distinguish between two very different
experiences: the positive experience under the project's small national poverty monitoring
                          ~~_______

33
   The operational manual was also unrealistic regarding environmental impacts. "Any project which might
have an impact on the environment is not accepted until an Environmental Impact Assessment has shown that
the impact is only positive." Some environmental impact(s), positive and/or negative, can be expected for most
subprojects, and mitigation rather than abandonment would have been a better orientation.
34 Nevertheless, Lesotho ex-CDSP staff felt that if the political take-over had not occurred, the Bank's
involvement with the project would have increased environmental and social awareness, both at the project
level, where there would have been some positive influence on handling environmental and social issues, and
more broadly by acting as a demonstration for other projects in Lesotho.
                                              22

component (paras 5.22 and 5.23), and failure as regards monitoring the CDD program. Good
M&E for the CDD program was particularly important. As a Learning and Innovation (LIL)
project intended to "test demand-driven and participatory approaches" and to "draw lessons
on how to support community development in Lesotho'' (project objective I); it was
important that CDSP had a strong base of comparative data for this testing and learning
process. In this, and other respects M&E for the CDD program had a negligible performance:

        Design was modest: The particular importance of M&E for the experimentation and
        learning intended under a Learning and Innovation Loan was well recognized at
        appraisal. But this was not translated into designing a firm M&E program. Much of
        the discussion in the appraisal report refers to actions to be done rather than
        preparatory actions completed.

        Implementation was negligible: Supervision missions emphasized the importance of
        M&E and MIS, but little was achieved. In May 2001 an M&E specialist reviewed the
        CDD program's monitoring arrangements, and found that M&E arrangements were
        still in early preparation and that preparation of the MIS had achieved even less.
        These observations were nearly 1 % years after Board approval, and only 2 years
        from the scheduled project closure. Another concern of that mission was that no
        M&E unit had been set up in LFCD. Such arrangements appear to have remained in
        limbo. Thus, the IEG mission found that the CDSP management unit was under the
        impression that M&E had perhaps been under the Ministry of Development Planning,
        but "had not been visible".

    0   Utilization was negligible: There was no data to use.

Accounts and audit
4.10 LFCD had a financial manager throughout the project period. Despite the disruptions
caused by the takeover of LFCD, there are few references to accounting or financial
management problems in supervision mission aide memoires. Accounts were reviewed
annually by an external auditor (four audits in the 4 year project period). The May 2003
supervision mission aide memoire drew attention to a delay in the clearance by the LFCD
Board of the 2001/2002 audit, but otherwise, no major issues are reported.



5. Ratings for CDSP
Outcome
5.1     Considering the relevance, efficacy and efficiency of CDSP - especially of
community development, the project's largest and most central component - and the lack of
monitoring and learning processes intended under a LIL, the CDSP's outcome is rated
unsatisfactory. The results are summarized in Table 2 and amplified below.
                                                           23

Overall Project Outcome:                 Unsatisfactory
a/ The objectives expressed in the PAD have identical wording


Relevance
5.2    Relevance of obiectives. Substantial. Both of CDSP's objectives had substantial
relevance. Poverty alleviation, especially in rural areas and the impoverished highlands was,
appropriately, the central concern of both Government and the Bank (Country Assistance
Strategy, 1998). Also, improving the capability of the national Government to collect and
monitor poverty related data could help keep poverty alleviation at the center of development
planning. Pro-poor economic growth remains the Bank's primary concern for Lesotho (CAS
2006).

5.3     Relevance of Design. CDSP's design was critically flawed as concerns the
community development objective, contrasting with the design of the poverty monitoring
objective, which had substantial relevance.

5.4     Ambiguity of proiect scope. The PAD and DCA create some confusion as to what the
project actually was. The Development Credit Agreement refers to a project with a
Government contribution of $36 million, implying that CDSP was responsible for all sub-
projects funded by the LFCD. The PAD refers to a Government contribution of $5.7 million,
indicating that CDSP concerned the 22 pilot projects only. But elsewhere in the PAD the text
indicates that all subprojects, including the Government funded sub-projects, would be
subject to the same CDD approach. This ambiguity continued throughout project
implementation.

5.5     Relevance of design for testing a CDD model. A social fund was a potentially good
vehicle for reaching poor villages. Also, based on experience elsewhere, a CDD approach,
through community participation and in-kind contributions to investment costs and resultant
"ownership" by the community of their infrastructure, had the potential to reach the poor.
This was especially so given Government's limited implementation capacity and Lesotho's
rugged terrain impeding access to many poor communities which would need to be
substantially self-reliant. It made sense also to start by piloting the CDD approach to gain
experience and to build the capacity of the funding agency. And a Learning and Innovation
                                                        24

Loan was a good means of testing the CDD approach. But measures to reduce vulnerability
against vested interests were not taken.

5.6     Vulnerability to political capture. The critical shortfall in CDSP's design stemmed
from the underestimation of the strength of political stakeholders and other vested interests
(in particular, politicians in the constituencies) compared with the bureaucracy (the civil
service and a core of senior ministers). Against such vested interests, and as further reviewed
under efficacy below, royalties were highly vulnerable to diversion for uses outside the CDD
framework. An alternative solution using the Government budgetary processes was available
(para 5.17).

5.7      Quality at entry. Significantly compounding these problems, CDSP was not ready for
implementation, and this contributed to the project's vulnerability. A fast start with an
already formed Board and management unit would have made it more difficult to derail the
project's institutional structure and CDD focus. But, at the time of project approval, the
institutional base for the project had not been sufficiently established: (i) LFCD's Board had
still not been appointed; (ii) the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director of the
management unit (MU) had not been recruited (they were appointed six months later); (iii)
                                                                                                                       `




while the operational manual had been prepared, the more detailed im lementation guides
that were necessary for field implementation had not been produced; 3 9(iv) the training plan
was still to be prepared; and (v) the M&E unit and M&E work plan had not been established.
Un-readiness is also apparent from supervision documents. Thus, the November 200 1 aide
memoire (almost two years after Board presentation and over half way through the project
period) commented that LFCD management had only recently initiated preparations for the
22 pilot communities. In this situation the choice of a project period of only 3 % years was a
highly unrealistic expectation.

5.8     Linkage with LHWP-1B. Like the LHWP-IB, CDSP was conceived as part of an
overall goal - LHWP-1B would earn revenues for poverty alleviation, and CDSP would be
the vehicle for using these revenues to alleviate poverty.'' 36 The conceptual linkage between
the two projects is clearly ex ressed in the 1998 country assistance strategy and the two
appraisal reports (para 1.8).3 PYet the linkage between the two projects went no further than
the concept stage. CDSP, like LHWP-lB, contained no tangible features that would actually
achieve better linkage. Thus, what had been articulated as a poverty alleviating partnership



35 The operational manual had been prepared, but this was a broad guide and provided insufficient specific
guidance, essential for a CDD program, The preparation team had planned for more detailed field guides, but
they did not materialize. The training plan was not prepared until the final year of the project. The intended staff
strength in the management unit was far from complete.
36 The Loan Agreement for LHWP-1B even had management of the social fund as a project component, which
was included as the project's Part G: "Lesotho Highlands Water Revenue Fund: Strengthening LHWRF's
capacity to manage efficiently Royalty Payments accruing to the First Guarantor as a result o the Project."
                                                                                             f
(Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement - Description of the Project.)
37
  "One component of such effort (the CAS strategy) would be the reformulation of the Lesotho Highlands
Revenue Fund - a special fund established in order to effectively utilize royalties from water exported to South
Africa under the Lesotho Highlands Water Project." (LHWP-1B PAD, strategic context section, page 3.
                                              25

between the two projects was not realized in design, and this isolation continued during
project implementation.

5.9     Taking account of the ambiguity of the project's scope, the design weaknesses
making CDSP vulnerable to political capture (significantly accentuated by the project's lack
of readiness for implementation) and the lack of a monitoring and evaluation capacity,
essential for a LIL, the overall relevance of design for the CDSP's community development
objective was negligible.

5.10 Relevance of design for the national poverty monitoring obiective. The design for
achieving this objective is only sketched briefly in the PAD but the survey approach was
discussed in greater detail between the Bank preparation team and the Bureau of Statistics -
an established agency with prior experience in survey design and implementation. The
survey technique to be used -the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) - had
already been developed by the Bank and had been successfully tested in a number of other
other African countries. It was a suitable choice to start the poverty monitoring program. The
relevance of design for the national poverty monitoring objective was substantial.

5.1 1 Thus, considering the relevance of both objectives and of design, and balancing the
contrasting ratings for community development and national poverty monitoring, the overall
relevance of CDSP is assessed modest.

Efficacy
5.12 CDSP's overall efficacy is rated modest based on the substantial achievements in
poverty monitoring (objective 11) partly compensating for the negligible achievements in
testing the community development model (Objective I). Efficacy by objective is reviewed
below.

Objective I. To test a demand-driven and participatory approach through a multi-sectoral
special fund and draw lessons as to whether it is an appropriate mechanism to support
community development in Lesotho.

5.13 A rapid chronology of events contributed to a comprehensive failure with this
objective:

5.14 Initial signs of commitment. The initial signs from Government were that a
supportive environment existed for a CDD approach. By Board approval of CDSP in
December 1999 a number of events had occurred suggesting commitment to implement
CDSP in the pro-poor and community oriented approach envisaged. The LHRF was
increasingly acknowledged in Lesotho to have been ineffective at reaching the poor, and it
was recognized by both the Bank and Government that it needed revamping. The 1998 CAS,
which was discussed with Government during preparation of CDSP, emphasized
reformulating the LHRF as one of the key Government actions. From Lesotho's side, in a
workshop in November 1997, which included Government, political, NGO, and private
sector representatives, it was agreed to reformulate the LHRF as a transparently managed
poverty alleviation vehicle. Key principles of CDSP - poverty orientation, community
                                                     26

leadership, clear screening criteria for selecting sub-projects and use of an operational
manual as the base for project implementation - were discussed. There were also promising
early actions by Government before CDSP's Board approval: the Lesotho Fund for
Community Development was established to replace the LHRD; the locations for the
intended 22 sub-projects under CDSP had been chosen using poverty screening criteria; and
the operations manual for CDSP had been produced (though without detailed guidance on
implementation).

5.15 Demand-driven approaches were iettisoned. These apparently promising actions
suggesting commitment were very quickly overturned by a group of actions, mostly taking
place shortly before or after project effectiveness. The LFCD Board of nine members had
initially been intended to include permanent secretaries rather than political members, but
right at the beginning of the project four ministers were appointed to the Board (at a later
point six ministers were on the Board) and the two intended community members of the
Board were never appointed. The presence of the ministers introduced an inevitable political
element and the influence of other politicians as well. In July 200 1, political influence was
further abetted by an amendment to the LFCD Act to enable members of the National
Assembly to submit sub-project proposals. Choice of communities for sub-projects was now
entirely a decision based on constituency considerations. Also, the operational manual was in
effect jettisoned, even before the project got underway. By effectiveness, Government had
approved some 25 sub-projects (additional to the intended 22 pilot projects which had not
started), with the CDD and sub-project selection processes ignored.

5.16 Non-establishment of key units in the implementation agency. Another serious
problem was the LFCD Board's evisceration of the institutional structure of the LFCD
management unit from the start of the project. Dispensed with were: the technical
department, management information unit (MIS and M&E), internal audit unit, and the
communication and capacity building unit. The loss, in particular, of the communication and
capacity building unit, the technical department, and the M&E unit, drastically reduced
capacity for community development approaches. As a result, while it dispensed funds for
non-CDD development activities in the constituencies, LFCD and its management unit did
not develop as a specialist community development agencya3*

5.17 Unprotected funding from royalties. Compounding CDSP's vulnerability to political
capture was the decision during project preparation to finance the fund directly from LHWP-
1B's royalties. The idea was conceptually appealing - it would give the LHWP- 1B greater
legitimacy as the source of poverty alleviating activities. But it also significantly raised the
LFCD's profile and vulnerability to capture. Royalties were seen by many in Lesotho
somewhat as a windfall, with access as the people's (and politician's) right. Several
government officials and Bank staff advised the IEG mission that a better approach would




38 "It would appear that the LFCD Board was not following the gazetted purpose of the Fund" To provide
effective management of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project water royalties allocated to it for community
driven projects intended for poverty alleviation." (CDSP ICR, also quoting the statutes of LFCD.)
                                                       27

have been to channel all royalties to the Government central budget, and then allocate funds
to LFCD in the same way as for other government programs.39

5.18 Performance of the CDSP sub-proiects: The absence of an M&E unit in LFCD has
resulted in a dearth of M&E data on the performance of the CDSP pilot sub-projects. An
empirically based assessment of the sub-projects' benefits and sustainability is thus
precluded. Nevertheless, mission discussions with the MU and NGOs, and a field visit to one
of the sub-projects suggests that there was some positive impact and that the CDD approach
was probably better than the supply-driven approach of the royalty-funded LFCD projects. In
2005/06 two years after CDSP closure the LFCD MU did a tour of all 17 (five of the original
22 proposals were rejected4') of the CDSP sub-projects. It found that all of the sub-projects
were still operating, 16 reasonably well. One village water scheme was partly operative. The
MU advised the mission that the only known change since the 2005/06 inspection is that a
footbridge was swept away by a storm in 2008. The view of the MU was that they would
know of other problems because parliamentarians are vocal when there is a difficulty in their
constituency. Finally, a visit by the mission to one of the CDSP sub-projects - Lesala
community training center41- confirms that at least one of them is very much community
owned and operated, is working well, and appears sustainable.

Lesala community's training center was built in 2003 as one of the 17 CDSP sub-projects. The community
provided stones, water and some labor during construction. The center provides training to local men and
women (mostly of student age) in vocational trades. Courses are typically of two years duration. The instructors
are all local. The training center is popular with the community, and some students who were at secondary
school chose to come to the center during their weekends. The community committee was active and met
monthly. Instruction rooms were neat and clean. At the time of the mission visit several hands-on training
activities were in process: carpentry for the men and boys, and cutting and sewing to make school uniforms for
the girls. Some 6 years after commencement, the popularity of the center, its good condition, and the
commitment of the community committee, indicates a valued facility with good chance of sustaining its
activities.

5.19 The apparent difference in performance between the royalty-financed and the CDSP
financed LFCD sub-proj ects lacks corroborating data although there is some consistency
between information and opinions from different sources.42The general view was that the
CDSP financed sub-projects performed better. The LCDF MU had definite views on this.
First, in their strong view the CDSP sub-projects helped the poor. The 17 selected


39 This mechanism could have been further tightened to ensure that sub-projects were chosen and implemented
following the CDD approach to be used under CDSP. Thus, a strong monitoring system could have been
established, and Government funds rationed out to LFCD in amounts corresponding to LFCD's absorptive
capacity to handle its CDD sub-projects. As funds would only go to LFCD if it followed an effective CDD
approach, the project would have been substantially shielded from political pressures.

40Of the 22 originally intended pilot sub-projects, proposals for feeder roads projects were rejected as costs
exceeded the hnding threshold, hence reducing the number of pilots to 17.

42
  From the mission field visit, discussion with NGOs and the Ministry of Finance; and the general views on
CDD (not CDSP specific) of several development agencies.
                                                         28

communities were all in poor areas identified by consultants following a process agreed with
the MU and the Bank.Second, the MU advised that communities were fully involved in all
of the 17 sub-projects. The communities also contributed some 10 percent to construction
(through provision of labor and materials). By contrast, they advised that the government
projects had little community participation, no sub-project committees and no community
contributions.

5.20 These are all encouraging signs, but no records were found by the IEG mission.
Information is restricted to the hearsay above and the mission visit to one of the sub-projects.
Particularly critical is the absence of documentation on the experience of each sub-project,
the results achieved, and the lessons that each experience provided. The absence of such
documentation largely eliminates the value of CDSP's sub-projects as a means to "test a
demand-driven and participatory approach through a multi-sectoral special fund and draw
lessons as to whether it is an appropriate mechanism to support community development in
Lesotho" (development objective I).

5.21 Summing up, CDSP did not achieve the objective of testing and drawing lessons from
community development pilot projects. LFCD was never established as planned, drastically
reducing its capacity for CDD approaches and preventing its development as a specialist
community development agency. While there are signs that the CDSP financed pilot sub-
projects fared better than the government funded sub-projects, the CDSP funded sub-projects
were only established in the last few months of the project precluding any learning during the
project period.43No end-of-project action plan was prepared for CDD in the future, and
                                               ,~~
lessons from CDSP were not d o c ~ m e n t e dthus forgoing the learning purpose of a LIL.
CDSP also failed to revamp the social fund and to help ensure that royalties were used in an
efficient and transparent manner. Further, the breakdown of LFCD as a funding channel for
poverty alleviation precluded the cooperation between LHWP-1B and CDSP that had been
envisaged in the country strategy. The efficacy of objective I was negligible.

Efficacy of national poverty monitoring

Objective II. To test various mechanisms and tools to monitor poverty trends in Lesotho and
to coordinate national poverty monitoring and analysis activities.45

5.22 Efficacy was substantial.The Bureau of Statistics satisfactorily implemented the Core
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) survey, although an intended repeat CWIQ survey
was not done. However, the project provided a good learning experience, and a base for
BOSS' continued work program. Data collected under this survey and other subsequent
surveys have been extensively used for monitoring poverty. BOS's work is also appreciated
by Government and has been used by both Government and the Bank.46The data were used
43
   The Supervision Mission Back to Office Report of December 21,2001 (2 years after Board approval) stated
that the needs assessments and project identification in the pilot communities was only just commencing.
44   There are also no indications that there were any workshops under the project.
45
     The PAD has identical wording of Development Objective 11.
46
  For instance, the February 2003 CDSP supervision report commented that Government considered the
poverty monitoring component a priority in view of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper under preparation.
                                                      29

for the 2005 Poverty Reduction Strategy, have been applied for tracking progress with the
Millenium Development Goals, are a source of data in Bank papers, and are used by BOS for
providing specific data to politicians and Government on a request basis.

5.23 The Director and staff of BOS advised the IEG mission that CDSP's poverty
monitoring component enhanced the quality of BOS' survey analysis, and was a good
learning experience for BOS staff. It had also helped catalyze interest in undertaking a series
of additional poverty related surveys. CWIQ was followed by a Household Budget Survey in
2003, the last year of project implementation, although it was financed separately. The
Household Budget Survey borrowed from the CWIQ methodology, but added additional and
broader indicators. A "continuous multi-purpose survey" is now planned if possible as an
annual exercise. The Director also believed that the CWIQ and the follow-on surveys had
helped make Government more poverty conscious. In these respects achievements have been
greater than appraisal expectations and the assessment in the ICR.47

Efficiency
5.24 Efficiency was modest overall. There are indications that the community development
sub-projects had some impact on welfare, but there is no corroborating data, which is
particularly deficient given CDSP's purpose as a learning and innovation project. Based on
the IEG mission discussions and the field visit (M&E was not established under the project) a
modest positive impact on community welfare from the sub-projects is ascribed (para 5.18).
The BOS' relatively small costs had substantial impact in stimulating Government's poverty
alleviation efforts (paras 5.22 and 5.23).

Risk to Development Outcome
5.25 Risks are sign$cant overall. National poverty monitoring under BOS is continuing to
develop and Government has shown interest in the program by using BOS' data and
continuing to fund BOS. BOS established a recognized role in Lesotho and its work program
has proceeded unabated since project closure. Hence, risks that the national poverty
monitoring program will dissipate appear only moderate. The community development
objective has little left to fail. The LFCD has recently been closed, and the CDD program did
not continue. One sub-project is still functioning well (para 5.17), but without information on
the other pilot projects, risks for the CDD program are best assessed as signzjkant.




47 IEG's assessment of CDSP's poverty monitoring program differs substantially from the assessment in the
ICR which rated achievements under this objective as "negligible." In part, the difference reflects the
opportunity available for the IEG mission to look at impacts as they have further developed since project
closure. Additionally, IEG has taken a broader view than the ICR, in particular looking at the national level
utility of the program, and the statistical capacity building impact. Also, the ICR's comment that a strategy to
monitor poverty data was not prepared (one of the project's monitorable indicators and the main criterion used
by the ICR) appears inaccurate, as supervision documents indicate that such a report was produced, discussed at
a workshop in May 200 1, and subsequently finalized,
                                                        30


Bank Performance
5.26 The Bank's performance was unsatisfactory in project preparation, and highly
unsatisfactory for supervision. The poor quality of supervision had the greatest influence on
CDSP's disappointing outcome, and Bank Performance is therefore assessed highly
unsatisfactory overall.

5.27 Ouality at entry was unsatisfactory. While CDSP's national poverty monitoring
component was adequately prepared, there were major problems with the far larger
community development program. On the positive side, CDSP's concept was basically
sound. Further, extensive use of participatory workshops helped build consensus, at least at
the working level of government and civil society, on most project features. Substantial
efforts were also made to get agreement on relevant policies and core project features at
senior government level, as can be attested from the Letter of Development Policy.

5.28 But there were four critical gaps. First was the Bank's inadequate assessment of risks
from vested interests. Although taking the socio-political pulse of a country is a complex
task, the earlier political capture of LHRF, due to factors identical to the later experience of
LFCD, provided a clear warning that this might happen again.48Second, CDSP was not
ready for implementation (para 5.7). Third, the project's scope - responsibility for all LFCD
sub-projects or only for the 22 pilots - was unclear; and fourth, the M&E unit and an M&E
work plan to test the CDD model had not been established despite the particular importance
of M&E for a Learning and Innovation Loan.

5.29 Oualitv of supervision was highly unsatisfactory. The project faced critical issues.
Amongst them were the take-over of the project by vested interests, the abandonment of
community driven approaches, and the failure to establish essential units in LFCD's
management unit. Yet discussion of such issues hardly featured in supervision mission aide-
memoires until mid 2001, two years after Board approval. By then these harmful actions had
become entrenched and the Bank's efforts thereafter did not ameliorate these core problems.
It was not until December 2001, two and a half years after Board approval, that CDSP was
                              By
classified as unsati~factory.~~then, 68 sub-projects had been approved by LFCD for
funding from royalties, with a total value of M109 million (about $16 million), with no
evidence that any of the OM'S CDD processes had been used. All of these sub-projects were
selected by Members of Parliament.




48 The nearest that the PAD gets to discussion of the risks from vested interests is in the critical risks section
(page 2 1) where there is reference to the risk of "change in political commitment to the LFCD's goal of poverty
reduction," which is rated as a "modest" risk. But this refers to the overall political environment and not
specifically to vested interests and the LFCD.
49 The staffing and timing of supervision missions may have contributed to these weaknesses. The first
substantially staffed mission was not until January 2003, only eight months before project closure. Prior to that,
missions had typically comprised only the Task Team Leader and possibly one other team member.
                                             31


Borrower Performance
5.30 Borrower performance is rated highly unsatisfactory overall. The highly detrimental
actions taken by the political stakeholders resulted in minimal results from the community
development side of the project. This was CDSP's dominant objective and represented nearly
90 percent of project costs. The small national poverty monitoring program, while
implemented well, is not significant enough to justify an overall performance rating above
highly unsatisfactory.

5.3 1 Government Performance. Highly unsatisfactory. The series of policy and
institutional changes introduced by the political apparatus completely changed the
fundamental features and outcome of CDSP. According to several members of the former
MU interviewed by the IEG mission, there were other problems as well: decision making by
the LFCD Board was slow, and it was common for Board meetings to be cancelled due to
lack of a quorum. Throughout the project period the Board also paid little attention to key
implementation constraints. And, despite having been identified during project preparation,
the 17 sub-projects were only confirmed for implementation in the last year of the project.

5.32 Implementing;agencies performance. Moderately unsatisfactory based on the
unsatisfactory performance of LFCD, implementing the main project component, somewhat
attenuated by the satisfactory performance of BOS:

       LFCD: unsatisfactory. The MU was not given a chance to perform satisfactorily. Its
       operational structure and staffing was never established as intended, and its
       effectiveness was seriously compromised by the vested interests that disabled the
       intended CDD approach. A bright spot is that the sub-projects were eventually
       implemented, though only in the last months of the project due to late clearance by
       the Board.

       M:satisfactory.     The CWIQ poverty survey was implemented. BOS followed on
       with other surveys, and continued to develop its capability after project closure.



6 . Lessons
The varied experience of LHWP- 1B and CDSP provide seven principal lessons:

       When projects are contributing to a common purpose, linkages between the projects
      should be exploited and reflected in a combined or mutually supporting design
      package. LHWP- 1B and CDSP were seen as closely related in the development
      strategies of both the Government and the Bank, and justified as such in the project
      documents - poverty alleviation through revenues earned by LHWP- 1B channeled
      through a social fund managed under CDSP. But specific features to achieve this and
      to better assure the proper use of the social fund were not incorporated in either
      project, and each was supervised in isolation.
                                       32

A successful construction program does not necessarily mean a successful
development program. Attention is needed to the full objectives o a project, including
                                                                   f
on "software as well as "hardware. LHWP-1B's successful water infrastructure
              "                       "

program will be a main pillar in Lesotho's development program for decades to come.
But, despite the LHWP-1B and the CDSP, the royalties did not go to poverty
reduction, the project's most fundamental objective. Also, while LHWP-1B was
strong in all aspects related directly to construction (engineering, physical works and
water delivery), it performed weakly in software aspects - capacity building, training
and resettlement.

 Vested interests can "capture"and severely compromise a project - special project
features and Bank actions are needed to counteract any such risks. The political take-
 over of the LFCD and the resultant collapse of community development processes
 illustrate that vested interests can outweigh apparently firm agreements and can
 compromise, or even as in the case of CDSP, nullify development intentions.

Lesotho and South Africa s "GoodPractice '' Water Treaty has features that may be
relevant elsewhere. The following features have contributed to success: (i) clarity and
detail in the treaty document, including procedures for adjusting to changing
circumstances; (ii) appropriate institutions - a bridging institution has worked well in
coordinating actions between the two countries; (iii) focused objectives; and (iv)
independent dispute resolution mechanisms within the institutions themselves. The
Bank's 20 year engagement providing technical and policy support, and as a
motivator for the financial involvement of other lenders, also contributed to the
treaty's success.

Practical application can make resettlement work. Improving implementation is more
important than perfection of resettlement policy. LHWP- 1B's resettlement program
was far less complex than the construction program, was not large, and need not have
been any less successful. Missing needs were: (i) a motivated and competent
institutional structure; (ii) emphasis on practical, socially responsible, flexible and
participatory implementation more than perfection in policy; and (iii) particular focus
on helping resettled families to become self-reliant rather than relying on
compensation payments alone.

Economic benefits from safeguards should be assessed as well as costs. Under
LHWP-1B the costs of safeguards were considered but benefits were seldom
assessed. A better approach would have been to recognize such benefits, which would
have put the costs in broader perspective. For resettlement, decision makers in
Lesotho might have been more readily persuaded to adequately fund and staff the
resettlement program if its economic viability had been assessed as a whole.

Safeguards implementation should not be frequently given second-tier priority, but
should receive the same attention as the main project components. Successful
implementation of a safeguard program requires the same design and supervision
qualities as other project components. Compliance with a safeguard requires a range
                                      33

of skills and resources very familiar to Bank project operations in general: a good
action plan; readiness for implementation; good supervision including relevant
specialist skills; highlighting the safeguard's importance in dialogue with
Government; building implementation capacity; and monitoring. Implementation of
the safeguard actions should have no lesser priority than other key project
components. There is likely to be a cost, however - quality actions such as the above
would tend to increase staff resource needs, and would need additional Bank budget.

    Annex A. The Lesotho-South Africa Water Treaty
    1.      The 1986 Water Treaty between Lesotho and South Africaso was the foundation of
    the Lesotho highlands water program, and, indeed, was prepared and signed between the two
    parties expressly to enable the carrying out of the program (Box A. 1).
                        Box A-1: Main Features of the Lesotho - South Africa Water Treaty

    Signed in 1986, the treaty provided the institutional, operational and financial base for commencement of the
    first phase of the Lesotho highlands water program - the Lesotho Highlands Water Project-Phase 1A (LHWP-
    1A). The three institutions involved (LHDA, TCTA, and LHWC) have their roles, rights and obligations
    defined. The nature of the program - water provision for South Africa by LHDA in exchange for royalties paid
    to Lesotho by South Africa, bulk distribution of the water within South Africa by TCTA, all hydropower to
    Lesotho, and coverage of construction and operations and maintenance costs of LHWP infrastructure by South
    Africa - are defined. An overview and coordination role for the Joint Permanent Technical Commission (later
    renamed as the Lesotho Highlands Water Commission) is specified. The Treaty also describes, backed in more
    detail by a "Royalties Manual," how the royalties are calculated. Over time, six adjustments ("protocols") have
    been made to the Treaty to accommodate changing circumstances.

    2.      International water agreements have had mixed performances, and have often been
    fraught with difficulties. In contrast, the Lesotho-South Africa Water Treaty has been largely
                                                                                        What
    successful,sl and is often cited in water literature as an example of good pra~tice.'~
    have been the underlying factors that have enabled success? Some key points from mission
    discussions and literature review (which, however, excludes any discussion of the relative
    share of benefits between the two countriess3)are highlighted below:

      Titled the "Treaty on the Lesotho highlands water project between the government of the Kingdom of
    Lesotho and the government of the Republic of South Africa", and signed at Maseru on 24 October 1986.
    51
       From one commentator: "It is testimony to the resilience o these arrangements (Le. the treaty) that no
                                                                 f
    signiJicant changes were made despite the dramatic political sh@s in South Africa at the end o the 1980s." (In
                                                                                                  f

       For instance, the cooperation between Lesotho and South Africa was termed in one commentary as "one o      f
    the most far reaching examples o water cooperation on the African continent. Since bilateral cooperation is

    a model for economic, efficient and fair water cooperation elsewhere. (Sadoff and Grey, 2002).
                                                                           "



    53 NOTE: The appropriateness or otherwise of the relative shares of benefits between South Africa and
    Lesotho is not evaluated by IEG. The analysis and discussion in this report refers only to mechanisms, features,
    and implementation of the treaty, and in no way to benefit shares.

Features that have contributed to the Treaty's success were:

     (i) A win-win situation. Lesotho and South Africa start with the major advantage that
           they have intrinsic and mutually complementary reasons to cooperate with water
           transfer. South Africa's Gauteng region, contributing almost 60 percent of the
           country's GDP and some 40 percent of the urban population, is water short, and
           this will accentuate over time. For Lesotho, water is abundant but revenues for
           development and addressing extreme poverty are highly constraining. By building
           and operating infrastructure for Lesotho to sell water to South Africa, both parties
           have become better          Nevertheless, despite this inherent advantage, there
           were enormous hurdles to surmount at the beginning. Political relations between
           the two countries were not strong, and, particularly for Lesotho, water
           professionals were, and remain, scarce.



                 Box A-2: Flexibility and Dispute Resolution Features of the Water Treaty

Flexibilitv: While the Treaty is detailed, mechanisms exist for adjustment in,program arrangements as needed:
(i) LHWC rather than political decision makers has the institutional mandate to make operational decisions and
coordinate plans for the future. (ii) The phased design of the Lesotho highlands water program also provides
scope for adjustments at closure of each phase. And, more formally, (iii) !`protocols" are occasionally used to
adjust the treaty itself. For instance, the most recent protocol in 1999 refmed the functions and responsibilities
of LHDA and TCTA, adjusted the role of the institution connecting the two countries and renamed it the
"Lesotho Highlands Water Commission."

Dispute Resolution: There are four levels of dispute resolution under the treaty, the first two internal to the
institutions. A first role is that of LHWC itself, established for the very purpose of coordination and
cooperation. The equal representation of each country (3 delegates each, with alternating chairmanship) and the
small size and permanent nature of LHWC tend to make for a cooperative and informal environment.

The second dispute resolution level is a more formal meeting between the three institutions backed by a report
prepared by LHDA andor TCTA, or possibly by LHWC. As commented on, however, by the Chief Executive
of LHDA and in similar vein by LHWC and TCTA , informal discussions between the institutions have tended
to enable agreements by consensus between the three institutions themselves. There have been only two cases
where going beyond the second stage has been necessary. Nevertheless, provisions for such steps as needed are
present. Thus, the third step would be negotiation between the governments. Finally, if matters are still not
resolved, provision is made for establishment of an Arbitral Tribunal. This would comprise three persons with
legal background, one each appointed by the two countries and the third appointed by the two arbitrators
themselves. Decisions at this level are considered in the treaty as final and binding.




54 Mutual sharing of benefits is widely referred to in the literature on international waters. For instance: "The
LHWP can be considered as highly effective in the sense that it creates a "win-winsituation "for both
countries, which would both be losers otherwise." In "Sustainable management of international waters- the
Orange River Case." A. Conley and P. van Niekerk, 2000.
                                                      36

             A clear, detailed yet flexible water treaty. The treaty, now 23 years old, is still
             substantially relevant. Protocols or informal consensus have been used from time
             to time to adjust to changing circumstances (Box A-2)."

             Appropriate institutions. It was and remains sensible to have separate national
             institutions - LHDA for Lesotho and TCTA for South Africa - to handle each
             country's part of the program. Each could best navigate the administrative and
             operating environments specific to its own country. The vital inter-country
             coordination role is provided through LHWC, with equal representation of both
             nations. LHWC is a small entity, comprising three permanent delegates and three
             alternate delegates from each country. The small size and professional experience
             of this group facilitates decision^.'^

             A cooperation culture. In IEG mission discussions with the three key institutions
             (LHWC, LHDA and TCTA) and with senior Lesotho Government officials and
             the Development Bank of Southern Africa,57 inter-agency relations concerning
             water management were considered to be generally good. Cooperation was thus
             easier.

             Institutional autonomy and dispute resolution mechanisms. Although the mission
             found that the two governments and their politicians followed LHWP with great
             interest, LHWC, LHDA and TCTA enjoy substantial autonomy in implementing
             the water program. In part this is because LHWC plays the overview role that
             would normally be done by the governments. But also, dispute resolution
             mechanisms are integrated within the treaty (Box A-2).

             Limited objectives. The Treaty focuses exclusively on the Lesotho highlands
             water program (LHWP-1A, LHWP-1B and future investments as appropriate). It
             does not include water resources management in the larger Senqu-Orange river
             basin.58 The two countries are free to implement activities in their respective
             countries as they wish, providing they do not impinge on LHWP water
             management (for instance, resettlement modalities differ between the countries.


55 "The advantages of aflexible approach are further illustrated by the LHWP that allows for a continuous
monitoring and adjustment of regime provisions in the light of changing circumstances." ( S . Lindermann, 2005
in "Explaining success and failure in international river basin management - lessons from southern Africa)
56
   For instance, "The bilateral arrangement of South Africa and Lesotho is fairly complex and comprises not
only financial and ownership arrangements but also dispute settlement mechanisms and the formation of a
bilateral organization and two implementing organizations enjoying autonomous status. Clearly, the LHWP
demonstrates that bilateral functional water cooperation needs not technical andfinancial cooperation but
complex institutional arrangements in parallel." In Understanding Trans-Boundary Water Cooperation:
Evidence from Africa. A. Klaphake and W. Scheumann, 2006
57DBSA was one of the main project financers and has been closely associated with LHWP-1B's
implementation.
58
  There is an institution for broader basin management - the Orange-Senqu River Commission, established in
2000.
                                                      37

             There is, however, a downside - the treaty's limited attention to social issues may
             have contributed to less attention on resettlement.

     (vii)   Prompt implementation. Signing of the treaty in 1986 was paralleled by Bank
             approval in the same year of the Lesotho Highlands Water Engineering Project
             which provided the funds for preparation of a long-term investment program to
             put the treaty into implementation. In 1991 the first phase of this program - the
             Lesotho Highlands Water Project - Phase 1A - got underway, also with assistance
             from the Bank. The implementing institutions as well as the financial means to
             carry out the program were also established early - LHDA and the Joint
             Permanent Technical Committee (the predecessor of the LHWC) were both
             established in 1986. Thus, momentum to carry out the treaty was unintempted.

     (viii) Training and technical assistance. This was a weak area. LHDA's need for staff
            training and technical assistance was frequently expressed to the IEG mission,
            generally with comments that capacity building for LHDA was the greatest need.
            The highly technical skills for LHWP- 1B implementation, especially for design
            and supervision of construction works, were provided through large contracts
            with international firms. For instance, engineering supervision contracts amounted
            to $78.5 million. But there was no concerted plan to train staff. The ICR
            commented on key LHDA positions that still remained vacant at loan closure. The
            Borrower's comments on the ICR refer to the short-term nature of capacity
            building in LHDA and the limited efforts placed on training." Lesotho's Minister
            of Environment and Natural Resources had similar views on capacity building.

    (ix)     Long-term Bank support. Last but not least, has been the quality and continuity
             of the Bank's support, together with other agencies such as the Development
             Bank of Southern Africa. Continuity was also good - spanning preparation of the
             program under the 1986 Engineering Project to LHWP-1B closure in 2006, a 20
             year period, and the Bank's association with Lesotho's water sector is continuing
             under the Bank assisted Metalong dam project.




5 9 "The success o this component has been rather short term, relating mostly to support during the
                   f
construction phase." ... ... "Theformal training policy andplan ... was never prepared .... Professional
training that tookplace between 1998 and 2003 mainly involved working as counterparts to the expatriate
specialists, attachments to consultancies, (and) some short-term and limited long term academic training.
                                                                                                        "

Annex B. Unfinished resettlement
1.      The resettlement program: The Mohale dam and reservoir and other infrastructure
constructed under LHWP-1B required relocation of some 41 8 households in three stages -
stage one where 99 households which would have been immediately affected by the
construction were relocated, a stage two where 2 16 households with houses in the reservoir
impoundment area were relocated, and a stage three of 103 households which could no
longer sustain their livelihoods due to significant loss of agricultural land to the reservoir.
Additionally, LHDA reports that an extensive water and sanitation program was mounted to
cover the whole Mohale catchment area, well beyond the population directly affected by the
LHWP-1B. This program provided piped water and 2,545 ventilated pit toilets to 126
villages.

2.      An adequate policy but laaging implementation: The compensation policy for project
affected persons has evolved over time, with Phase 1B learning from Phase 1A's experience
and with further improvements since closure of LHWP-1B. Box B-1 shows the main
elements of the policy as of March 2009.60The resettlement package is quite comprehensive.
LHDA provides each family with a newly constructed small house, long-term compensation
based on the estimated lost income from the household's fields and other assets, training if
requested for an income earning activity, and community facilities if not present, such as an
access road or primary school. Of particular note is the long compensation period (inflation
adjusted) of 50 years (or an equivalent lump sum payment). The IEG mission field visits
indicate that the compensation package has the potential, if flexibly implemented and in a
timely fashion, to protect the material welfare of re-settlers.
                      Box: B-1. Main Elements of LHWP-1B's resettlement package
         Choice of resettlement location
    Each household provided with:
    e    Fenced site of 1,200 m3
    0    New house with heating and cooking facilities
    e    Water tank
    0    Ventilated pit toilet
    0    Disturbance allowance over 3 years (year 1 Maloti 6,000, Year 2 M4,000 and year 3 M2,000)
    0    Annual compensation payments over 50 years, based on estimated net value of agricultural production (with
         inflation adjustments) and any other income sources (eg. trees, brick kiln).
    0    Option of substituting the 50 year annual payments by a lump-sum withdrawal (based on a Business Plan for the
         family involved).
    0    Minimum threshold of compensation - any individual who was getting less than M3,960/year has annual
         compensation allowance topped up to this level.
    e    Development assistance - training and technical assistance to establish a skillkrade and/or provision of
         agricultural extension.
    0    Community facilities to include as needed an access road, reasonable proximity to primary school, and,
         sometimes, other facilities such as a church, etc.
         Communal compensation for lost communal assets such as rangeland, wild vegetables, useful grasses and
         medicinal Dlants

   The resettlement package is as of 2009. Resettlement entitlements under LHWP- 1B were substantially
similar to 2009 entitlements. The main difference is that a compensation period of 10 years rather than 50 years
was applied.

3.      Boxes B-2 and B-3 illustrate situations where re-settlers, while encountering some
adjustment issues, have adapted to their new environment and lifestyle. These encounters
corroborate the apparently adequate provisions under the compensation policy. But in its
application, the policy has had mixed performance. The greater issue then is to effectively
carry out compensation. In effect, one can debate the policy, with arguments that could
perhaps be made for additional benefits or for lower benefits, but any gaps that may be
present in the policy would appear to be a far lesser concern than shortfalls in
implementation. Indeed, the IEG mission found a widespread view within Government and
civil society that this was the case - improving the implementation of resettlement was the
key need.61

                   Box B-2: Success and difficulties resettling in a rural host village

The IEG mission visited Ratau village and met with the Acting Principal Chief, Area Chief, Village Chief and
several host and settler household heads. Some 33 re-settler families had come to the village of 680 families in
2002. Meeting participants advised that, although the settlers had the same language and culture as the host
villagers, integration had still been a problem, though not major. Initial misunderstandings had included how to
use the re-settlers communal compensation for lost grazing. The resettlers initially thought this was only for them
whereas it should have been shared. The issue was resolved through construction of a communal grain mill which
benefitted all villagers and brought some income from usage by other villages. Management of the mill had still
been a problem but a committee comprising both settlers and host villagers had substantially resolved these
difficulties. LHDA and the Department of Cooperation had helped in this. The village elders could also help by
getting different parties together for discussions.

Despite the initial integration problems, meeting participants felt that people's lives were improving. There were
issues here and there but in most respects there had been "a great change in the lives of people." Most re-settlers
were now "better off', and this could be seen in better clothes and appearance, purchase of household appliances
and furniture. Typical improvements cited were: a better house, access to water, electricity, a clinic and nurse and
a school now in the village, access to roads, possibility with improved road access to request a doctor if a family
member is ill, only a short walk to a mill, and climate less cold compared with the highlands. The host villagers
also benefitted from the amenities provided. However, one host villager also commented that benefits were not
always there - there were other villages where livelihoods had not improved.

A particularly appreciated provision was the income generating schemes, including the possibility to learn crafts
such as sewing, carpentry, welding, purchase of a taxi, etc. The agricultural intensification activities were also
strongly valued. There was "treasure in the soil", and agricultural improvements (e.g. more diversification into
fruits and vegetables, better agronomic practices, improved livestock breeds and range management) could
provide greater income.

However, participants commented that sustainability of incomes might be a problem on a case by case basis: for
instance, if a taxi breaks down and repairs are too costly, The "business plan" that LHDA required before granting
a lump sum payment to a household was considered a good idea.

61 The Bank was also concerned with the weak implementation of resettlement. In the last year of the project
(2006) the supervision team downgraded the project's status of implementation to moderately unsatisfactory
based on the poor performance of the resettlement program.
                                                            40


                                        Box B-3: Flexibility in urban resettlement

    Eleven households have re-settled in Tsolo, near Thatsane Industrial Zone on the outskirts of Maseru. The
    households were re-located in 2001. An IEG interview with the wife in a family of two older persons
    illustrates both the variability of family needs in a resettlement program, and a situation where LHDA was
    flexible in dealing with the special needs of this family.

    The couple's house was situated in a 1200 m2 fenced off plot of land which enabled some kitchen gardening.
    The house had been built in 2003 and was in good condition. It had electric wiring, piped water, a kitchen in
    the house and two VIP toilets. The couple had taken lump sum compensation. With this they had bought a
    field outside Maseru and cultivated maize. They had also bought a freezer and a larger TV. Both the husband
    and wife had tried to get jobs, but they found that the factories were not employing older people. A solution
    had been found for a sustainable income stream. The couple requested LHDA to build an extension to their
    house so that they could rent out rooms. Six such rooms were constructed and all had lodgers (the second
    toilet had also been provided by LHDA following city standards for the larger number of residents).

    The woman advised that "life is better" as a result of resettlement. However, she complained of one matter
    They had been compensated by LHDA for their land (and 138 trees) but she felt that she should also have
    been compensated ,for a livestock corral.

    4.      The status of implementation: The most recent report of the national Ombudsman
    (April 2009) provides a factual inventory, based on village by village field visits, of the
    present status of the resettlement program.62The village inspections were carried out in
    September 2008 and the Ombudsman provides a household by household account of the
    compliance of the resettlement program compared with a previous visit in September 2007.
    The 2007 inspection followed a first round of visits made by the Ombudsman in June 2006.
    The primary observation of the Ombudsman in the April 2009 report is that very little had
    been done by LHDA in following up his recommendations of September 2007. And the
    September 2007 inspection had also been critical of the limited progress since 2006.63

    5.      The Manageability of resettlement needs: The striking feature of the problems listed
    by the Ombudsman is how manageable they actually are. Compared with the major
    resettlement programs that have been undertaken for some schemes in India and China,64the
    LHWP- 1B, dealing with only 4 18 resettled families, has a modest task. Further, there now
    remain only some 20 villages with 83 re-settled families, for whom some actions are still

    62   "Ombudsman's Inspection of Compliance in the Mohale Areas", April 2009.
    63 From the April 2009 Ombudsman's report: "Following the release of his report on the Mohale Inquiry in
    June 2006, the Ombudsman carried out a compliance inspection during September 2007, 15 months after the
    release of his report. His findings in that exercise were that LHDA had not complied with his
    recommendations." .. .. .. and ... "Again in September 2008 the Ombudsman embarked upon a similar exercise.
    I regret to have to say that once again ... ..... Very little has been done in answer to the complaints lodged with
    the Ombudsman by the affectedpeople and households.      'I


    64
      For example, India's Andhra Pradesh Third Irrigation Project resettled over 4000 families. China's
    Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project (dealing with persons displaced by a dam project) resettled over 170,000
    families.
                                                        41

due. Most of the actions are relatively simple. Over 80 percent of the 83 complaints are only
for payment of a still due part of the family's compensation package (for instance, for the
family's trees or other assets). Few physical works are thus required from LHDA, and
distribution of funds due should be straightforward. Most of the remaining complaints - such
as completing a business plan in order to provide lump-sum payment - are matters well
within LHDA's experience.

Key Resettlement and Rehabilitation Needs

6. From the IEG mission's discussions and field visits in Lesotho, discussion with Bank staff
and review of the literature on LHWP's resettlement program, the following implementation
issues have emerged:65

(i)      Timely implementation: The delays that LHWP- 1B's resettlement program
         encountered have resulted in hardship for a number of re-settlers and substantial
         criticism from the national ombudsman, civil society and others. This need not have
         been the case. An adequately staffed unit in LHDA should have been able to address
         the issues raised by the ombudsman.

(ii)     Institutional strengthening: While there is no reason why LHDA's present
         institutional capacity cannot expeditiously implement the Ombudsman's fairly
         straightforward recommendations, capacity building for the future is desirable. Just as
         there is a basic engineering capacity in LHDA, an equally proficient and adequately
         staffed department or ancillary institution, with substantial autonomy, is needed for
         implementing the resettlement and social development aspects of the water
         investment program. This could be supplemented through contracting private
         consultants or NGOs. There also needs to be a better system for tracking resettlement
         progress - M&E was hardly utilized.

(iii)    Enabling; oversight: The degree and method of oversight also needs attention. A
         number of sources commented to the IEG mission that LHWC was overly micro-
         managing the resettlement program, which was impeding implementation. The
         ombudsman's report also refers to reports of impediments involving LHWC, stating
         that limited progress with the Mohale program was attributed by LHDA to be because
         "the Commission (LHWC) having taken its time to give it (LHDA) the necessary
         authority and funds to execute the many jobs it had to execute.66
                                                                         67



65   Care has been taken to reflect the needs as during LHWP's Phase IB and as still relevant today. Much of the
literature refers to Phase lA, the Katse program. As indicated by the discussion in this section, there have been
significant improvements since that learning experience. There is, nevertheless, room for further improvement,
as listed below.
66 A broadly similar observation has been made by Thayer Scudder, formerly a member of LHWP's panel of
experts for social and environmental issues. "The Commission has been a constraint on developing theproject
in the interests of affectedpeople ... .... and . . . . " A
                                   "                      nother constraint has been the Commission's ongoing micro-
management of the affairs of the Environment and Social Services Group (T. Scudder in "On the wrong side
                                                                            "

of development" (editors M. L. Thamae and L. Pottinger, 2006).
67 However, a viewpoint expressed to the IEG mission by an observer who was familiar with both LHDA and
LHWC was that the degree of involvement by LHWC might primarily be influenced by the degree to which
LHDA needed help. Where less help was needed, LHWC could become less involved.

(iv)      A ?development? approach for sustainable income generation: The term
         ?compensation? used under LHWP to designate re-settler benefits, distracts from the
         central need - to rehabilitate welfare emphasizing development - i.e. helping families
         to become self reliant rather than perpetually dependent on the resettlement
                     A
         packages6* ?development approach?, emphasizing the families? independence and
         capacity to provide for self-sufficient and sustainable wellbeing and income is
         needed. This is increasingly LHDA?s approach. Commonly chosen activities by
         settlers have been establishment (with vehicle) as taxi or delivery van drivers, trades
                                                                        The
         such as carpentry and welding, and intensified agric~lture.~? development
         orientation could be further enhanced. Training of women could also be emphasized.
         In Lesotho?s society, where a large proportion of the men are working in the South
         African mines, women manage the farms and any domestic enterprises.

(v)       Participatory approaches: Several NGOs and donors as well as individuals in LHDA
         and LHWC commented that LHDA?s approach to re-settlement to date had been top
         down rather than involving communities in a participatory and bottom-up approach.
         The engineering culture of LHDA prevailed, tending to a more directive than
         participatory orientation. Instead, re-settlers should be a part of the project planning,
         identifying their needs and participating as implementers as well as beneficiaries of
         resettlement during implementation.

(vi)      Flexible Implementation: Boxes B-2 and B-3 illustrate both the distinctly individual
         nature of resettlement - the needs of each household or community may vary
         considerably - and, for these families, LHDA?s flexibility in catering to these
         different needs. Nevertheless, several observers commented to the mission that the
         more typical orientation has been a ?one size fits all? approach. The more case by
         case approach exemplified in the boxes merits application as general practice.

(vii)    Involving civil society: To date, the implementation of re-settlement has been almost
         exclusively done by LHDA. The NGO sector, while still quite small in Lesotho, is
         growing, and world experience is that such organizations can have greater capacity
         and aptitude than Government agencies in community outreach. Several
         representatives from the NGO sector and donor agencies commented on the potential
         role of NGOs in community activities related to re-settlement. An option to consider




68
    As stated in the Treaty for LHWP between Lesotho and South Africa, the need is to set families up to have
?a standard of living not inferior to that at the time offirst disturbance?. Improving rather than maintaining
welfare would be even better. In fact, this was recommended by the water program?s Panel of Experts as far
back as its first report in 1989, which stated that the project should aim not just to restore but also ?to raise
living standards and incomes.?
69 A well-known example of agricultural diversification is the seed potato program in the mountains, which has
proven to be popular and remunerative for farmers.

         would be to have contracts with selected NGOs with proven experience in community
         development and a practical and field oriented appr~ach.~'




70
   A number of observers commented to the IEG mission on the varying quality and motivation of NGOs, both
national and international, that are present in Lesotho. NGOs with capacity and motivation for participatory
field implementation rather than representing special interests would be the type to consider.

Annex C. Well handled environmental initiatives
1.      LHWP- 1B handled environmental flows and biodiversity well. These two "good
practices" are summarized below:

Environmental Flow Requirements

2.       Measurement and management of water flow and In-stream Flow Requirements (IFR)
for river reaches below Mohale dam was conscientiously carried out based on regular
monitoring and periodic studies by consultants. The IFR studies were done after the
environmental impact assessment and engineering design for Mohale had been completed.
This was not ideal as it required retrofitting IFR requirements into a previously determined
dam design and operating plan. Developing the IFR, which is an inexact science given the
many variables involved, also required an iterative and learning by doing-and-measuring
approach. As a result, changes were made to Mohale's dam outlet valves and operating rules,
and the minimum flows specified in the treaty were increased by 300 to 400 percent. It is too
early to be sure of the long-term effects of flow levels, although, from discussing with Bank
and LHDA engineers the technical management of flow levels is well controlled at the levels
considered appropriate by LHDA. More complicated is considering what is an acceptable
IFR and what social and environmental benchmarks are needed. Further questions to
consider would be - in what way and at what reduction in river flow, do downstream impacts
start to have significant social and environmental costs? And, what are the economic trade-
offs between environmental benefits and any changes in delivery of water to South Africa.

Species preservation

3.      A promising biodiversity initiative has been the program to preserve the Maluti
Minnow. This species is only found in particular areas of Lesotho and was at risk due to the
reduced river flow downstream of the Mohale dam. In 2003 four upstream sites without
predatory species were selected and 1700 of the minnows were transported to these reaches.
The initial experience is encouraging. The table below shows that in three of the four sites
the minnow was still surviving some four years after the relocation, and that population
density increased from 20.07 to 2008. But some caution is needed as the percentage of fish
less than one year old diminished in that period. The Maluti Minnow action plan will need
continued monitoring. Migration to these sites of trout, a predator of the minnow, is a
possible risk which may require preventive measures.

Annex D: The quality and effectiveness of Bank support
to implementing safeguards
 1.       Safeguards were triggered between the two projects: environment for both projects,
social/poverty impact (within the environment safeguard) for CDSP, and resettlement,
international waters, dam safety and natural habitat for LHWP-1 B. This diversity provides
fertile ground for observing how the quality of the Bank's efforts promoting a safeguard can
influence compliance with the safeguard.

2.      This PPAR's review of implementation and ratings for LHWP-1B and CDSP,
indicate a generally close relationship between the quality of the Bank's work promoting a
safeguard and the degree to which the safeguard is satisfactorily implemented. For the dam
safety safeguard which was satisfactorily complied with, even before LHWP- 1B's
implementation, the institutional capacity and procedures under a panel of experts were
established to overview dam safety, and the Bank supervision task team contained the
technical specialization and made the effort to monitor safeguard activities. By contrast,
resettlement issues were unevenly tackled by the Bank, especially during project preparation.
LHDA had several shortfalls which could have been better influenced by the Bank -
incomplete preparation resulting in slow commencement of resettlement, an institutional
capacity which was never fully competent for the task, and weak M&E. During supervision a
resettlement specialist helped make some progress with resettlement, though not enough to
consider the safeguard to have been fully met.

3.     Such examples support what might be considered obvious - both intuitively and from
Bank experience - that the quality of the Bank's safeguard efforts have causative influence
on safeguard achievements. But this PPAR review indicates that "obviousness" is not
necessarily translated into action by the Bank. More probing observations of the safeguards
experience of LHWP-1B and CDSP may be illuminating.

4.      For illustrative purposes an assessment of the quality of the Bank's support to
implementing safeguards is provided in Table D. 1. Each row represents a safeguard that was
triggered either by LHWP-1B or CDSP.71For comparative purposes, one activity that is not a
safeguard - the construction of water infrastructure under LHWP- 1B - has also been
included. The quality of the Bank's support (performance of the task team and management)
is assessed using eight criteria which typically make a difference in the Bank's effectiveness
preparing and supervising a project component. For the preparation period: (i) a sound
diagnostic of needs and issues (or the equivalent for a safeguard - e.g. a satisfactory
environmental assessment for the environment safeguard); (ii) the quality of component

71
   The safeguards include CDSP's poverty alleviation goal under the community development program
because: (i) improving the welfare of the poor was the key element in CDSP's objectives and is also central in
Lesotho's development strategy; and (ii) social concerns such as poverty would normally be part of a project's
environmental assessment (OP-4.01). The environmental assessment is meant to cover social as well as natural
environment issues, unless covered separately, as done for LHWP-1B's resettlement program. Of note is that
Lesotho's environmental assessment for CDSP (January 1999) covered the environment only, and did not cover
poverty issues.

           preparation (or the safeguard equivalent - e.g. an environmental action plan, resettlement plan,
           etc.); and (iii) readiness for implementation. And, during project implementation: (iv) the
           Bank's general effectiveness (competence and experience) in project supervision; (v) the
           presence in the team of adequate specialist knowledge relevant to the safeguard or component
           concerned; (vi) the effectiveness of the Bank in promoting the borrower's institutional capacity
           for implementation; (vii) the degree to which the Bank places emphasis on and highlights the
           importance of the componenthafeguard during interactions with Government; and (viii) whether
           an effective M&E system is established. For each safeguard, the quality of the Bank's support is
           then assessed relative to these criteria.72Given the nature of this exercise, the assessments are
           indicative only, but they are consistent with the findings and ratings in Sections 3 and 5.73

           72 Evaluations take the context of each criterion into account. For instance, the quality of supervision for CDSP
           was poor at the beginning of the project and approaching satisfactory at the end. However, a simple "average" of
           the two performances would not capture the quality of supervision when it mattered. All of the key Government
           actions which resulted in project failure happened during the first two years of project implementation. Thus, the
           rating of highly unsatisfactory for quality of supervision reflects the very deficient supervision in that critical
           period.
           73 For instance, the highly satisfactory rating in Table D.l for quality of supervision of LHWP-1B's construction
           program is also reflected in the commentary on the Bank's quality of supervision for construction in Section 3 -
           LHWP-1B's ratings.

Prospects for enhancing the Bank's effectiveness with Safeguards

5.     From Sections 2 to 5, and Table D. 1 above, the following observations arise:

       The Bank performance qualities that typically contribute to successful compliance
       with a safeguard are broadly similar to the Bank qualities that help achieve
       satisfactory implementation of non-safeguard project components.

       At least for the 6 safeguard examples here, there is nothing particularly mysterious
       about what is associated with success or failure: application of high quality skills and
       effort by the task team and management is associated with good results - for instance,
       the international waters and dam safety safeguards as commented above. In contrast,
       CDSP's community driven poverty alleviation efforts had low performance qualities
       in practically every aspect. National poverty monitoring and natural habitat
       safeguards had moderate performance, and resettlement was on the lower side,
       though considerably better than CDSP's CDD poverty alleviation program.

       The highest performer is a non-safeguard - the LHWP- 1B construction program,
       which was implemented well and has almost flawless Bank performance qualities.
       This program was LHDNLHWC's highest priority, and received similar priority
       attention from the Bank and Government. The only score below highly satisfactory is
       in "The effectiveness of helping build institutions." The moderately unsatisfactory
       assessment reflects the Bank's neglect of capacity building for LHDA. However,
       even here, while the Bank was not successful in helping strengthen LHDA overall,
       the project used turnkey consultant contracts for design and supervision of
       construction which were effective. Thus, for the construction activity, institutional
       capacity was created, albeit for only a temporary period.

       Good quality Bank performance is needed for both preparation and supervision o the
                                                                                      f
       safeguard action plan.
       Higher Bank performance is associated with good ratings both in preparation and in
       implementation - the same as would be expected for a non-safeguard project
       component.

       The degree to which the Bankprioritizes and highlights a safeguard in its
       interactions with the borrower can have signijkant impact on safeguard compliance.
       Bank emphasis on a safeguard appears to influence Government efforts as well.
       Supervision aide memoires for LHWP-1B put resettlement near the end and
       construction at the beginning. aide memoires tended to be over 10 pages - hence
       attention to an item at the end of the aide memoire would likely be less. Also, the
       order of subjects covered in wrap-up meeting discussions might have provided a
       psychological signal to LHWC and LHDA that the safeguard action is less important
       than other project activities. CDSP is an extreme example of signals or lack of them
       provided to the borrower - early CDSP missions placed minimal emphasis on the key
                                                    49

         factors causing the collapse of the CDD program. By contrast, CDSP's national
         poverty monitoring even had visits by Bank specialists uniquely for this component.

         Staff resources need to reflect the implementation needs for safeguard compliance,
         and not get secondary treatment relative to other components.
         If achieving compliance with a safeguard requires a set of Bank qualities not unlike
         the needs of a standard project component, there is an evident consequence for
         budgets and management decisions. The resources to achieve safeguards compliance
         need to be mainstreamed and not considered as only an "add-on" after the resource
         needs for the main project components have been catered for. Additional Bank
         resources to enable the qualities needed may be required - more safeguard related
         specialists in task teams, more staff time to promote improved implementation
         capacity and M&E, et^.^^

  For preservation of the Maluti Minnow, LHDA contracted a research program during LHWP-1B preparation
which led to a subsequent action plan. The Bank encouraged and monitored progress. There was no particular
Bank expertise in aquatic ecology, but the consultants provided that. The Bank also encouraged careful
monitoring of the minnow population, so progress and impact were transparently known (Table B.1).
Supervising all these activities required some incremental staff resources.
