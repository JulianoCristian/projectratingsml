There is risk that development policies and\n            priorities could change while subprojects are underway.

The\n            risk of the institution building component of the\n            subprojects being delayed or not being implemented or\n            followed up by the concerned agency would be minimized by\n            prior review by IDA and the government of the agency's\n            actual commitment to the component."}, "docdt": "1983-05-31T00:00:00Z"}
