The project\n            achieved its primary objectives, its impact has been\n            significant, sustainability is likely, and both the Bank and\n            Borrower performed satisfactorily. Several lessons can be\n            learned from this project. First, attention in the design of\n            future technical assistance (TA) credits should be focused\n            on responding to the Government's demand for the type\n            of TA appropriate under reimbursable credits and building in\n            regular reporting to line ministries about the status and\n            availability of TA funds. Second, implementation delays\n            experienced while the Government searched for alternative\n            sources of TA funding on a grant basis suggests that the\n            Bank Group might consider providing grant funding for\n            certain kinds of TA as an additional tool in its country\n            lending strategy. Lastly, there also appears to be a need\n            for the Bank to focus on the value it attaches to Borrowers\n            meeting their obligations under dated covenants as well as\n            the appropriateness of the covenants themselves."}, "docdt": "1991-10-03T00:00:00Z"}
