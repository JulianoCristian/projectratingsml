Amount:                  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 5.6 million
(US$6.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                   Standard
Project Objectives       The Credit would provide assistance for preparation
and Description:         of a number of high priority projects suitable for

In addition, it would finance activities in the
field of pre-investment planning, engineering
studies, and consultancy services and training for
developing project preparation and implementation
capacities of the borrower's institutions.
Risks:                   There is a risk that development policies and
priorities could change while sub-projects are under-
way. This would be minimized by selection of
sub-projects which are in support of a high-priority
Government investment plan. The risk of the
institution building component of the sub-projects
being delayed or not being implemented or followed
up by the concerned agency would be minimized by prior
review by IDA and the Government of the agency's actual
commitment to the component.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
KINGDOM OF NEPAL FOR A SECOND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal in an amount of Special Drawing
Rights (SDRs) 5.6 million (US$6.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms
to help finance a Second Technical Assistance Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      The most recent economic report, "Nepal - Policies and Prospects for
Accelerated Growth" (Report No. 3577-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on October 15, 1981. The principal findings of the report and
recent developments are described below. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.      Nepal is one of the least developed countries in the world.  Per
capita income is estimated at US$156 (1981) 2/ and health and education
standards are well below the average for South Asia: life expectancy at
birth is only about 44 years, infant mortality is 150 per thousand, and adult
literacy is only about 20%. The population, estimated to be 15.0 million
(1981), grew at a rate of about 2.6% per year during 1971 to 1981. About 95%
of the population live in rural areas.
4.      Population density with respect to arable land has reached alarming
levels and is threatening to overwhelm the resource base of the economy.
Cultivation has been extended beyond economically feasible and ecologically
safe limits in the Hills, and together with denudation of forests to meet
housing and fuel needs, soil erosion has become a critical problem. Firewood
and water have become more difficult to obtain as the forests are reduced
and springs and streams dry up. This degradation of the agricultural base
has made even the present low level of living standards difficult to main-
tain.
5.      Agriculture accounts for nearly 60% of Nepal½s GDP and 75% of
merchandise exports, and provides the main source of livelihood to over 90%
of the population. Crop production accounts for about 60% of agricultural
output, livestock for 30%, and forestry for 10%. Paddy is the predominant
i/ Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as in the Presi-
dent's Report (No. P-3467-NEP) dated March 3, 1983 for the Cash Crop
Development Project in Nepal which was approved by the Executive Direc-
tors on March 22, 1983.

food crop (planted on about half of the total cropped area), followed by
maize, wheat, millet, and barley; cash crops (oilseeds, jute, sugar and
tobacco) are grown on about l0N of the cropped area. About 25% of total
rural incomes arise from nonagricultural activities, of which cottage
industries are one of the more important and engages over one million people
on a part time basis.
6.      Apart from agricultural land, Nepal's only other important
exploitable resources are hyidropower and tourism.  The exploitation of the
vast hydropower resources, however, beyond that required to satisfy the
country's own power demand, will depend crucially on Nepal's ability to enter
into complex financial, exploitation and export agreements with neighboring
countries. The tourism sector, based on Nepal's raagnificent landscape and
rich cultural heritage, has been dynamic though it: still accounts for only
about 1% of GDP.
7.      When modernization efforts started in the early 1950s, there was
virtually no economic or administrative infrastructure, and initial develop-
ment efforts were necessarily concentrated on establishing a foundation for
future development. The Fifth Development Plan (1975/76-1979/80) marked a
shift in development objectives; acceleration of economic growth, employment
creation and raising living standards of the population became major plan
objectives. Development expenditures rose during this period and there were
substantial shifts in the composition of spending away from transport to
agriculture, power and social services. But given the lead time required for
investments to start yielding returns, GDP growth barely kept lap with that of
population.
8.      Part of the reason for t:his stagnation lies in factors beyond Nepal's
control. The difficult topography and poor resource base are obviously
important in retarding growth. Nepal's landlocked position, long open border
with India and the dependence of its overseas trade on transit through India
create additional disadvantages. While Nepal benefits from the proximity of
a vast potential market for Nepalese goods, the ability to pursue independent
economic policy measures is limited. Furthermore, industrial development
faces the competition of a far larger and more efficient industrial sector in
India.
9.      But factors within Nepal's control have also contributed to the
stagnation. Problems with the implementation of projects in most sectors of
the economy have constrained the growth of public sector capital formation
which grew at an average of only 5.5% per annum in real terms cluring the
1970s. In addition, the returns on investments were often lower than
expected because necessary complementary investment's or current spending were
lacking, and because of managerial deficiencies. An example is the agricul-
ture sector where output stagnated despite considerable investments in
irrigation  and a 40% increase in fertilizer use between 1974/75 and 1979/80.



-3-
In the past, insufficient attention was paid to bringing water down to the
farm level and this was compounded by inadequate support services such as
extension and research, by the lack of timely supplies of improved seed,
fertilizer and other inputs such as credit, and by the lack of farm-to-market
roads. Recent major irrigation projects financed by IDA and the Asian
Development Bank are now addressing some of these problems by taking more
comprehensive and integrated approaches.
10.     Over the past decade, the Government has made continuous efforts to
increase tax revenues. But, despite the improving long-term trends, the
revenue effort (about 9% of GDP) remains small by comparable international
standards. With limited domestic resources, current expenditures have been
squeezed in order to generate savings for investment spending, with the
result that the efficiency of total spending was lowered. Furthermore, while
about one quarter of total budgetary expenditures (regular and development)
was being financed by the rest of the world in 1974/75, this proportion was
36% in 1981/82.
11.     The slow economic growth has been accompanied by a widening trade
deficit. Import payments have grown while the trend in export earnings has
been sluggish due to declining rice exports. Increased tourism receipts and
remittances, together with foreign assistance in the form of grants and
concessionary fi4nancing have, however, generally ensured that the overall
balance remained in surplus. But even so, foreign exchange reserves have
declined from being equivalent to about one year of imports in the early
1970s to six months in 1981.
12.     Whereas 1980/81 was a year of recovery from the previous year's
severe drought, 1981/82 was a more modest year; agricultural production is
estimated to have grown by 3.5% and GDP by about 4%. Budgetary developments
were quite encouraging. Development expenditures increased sharply, and
revenue collections increased substantially for the second successive year.
Nevertheless, the budget deficit increased from about 5.5% of GDP in 1980/81
to about 8.5% in 1981/82, and while foreign assistance also increased, domes-
tic borrowing rose sharply. Also, the underlying economic trends have not
picked up yet, and the economy remains dependent upon the weather.
13.     On September 19, 1981 Nepal unified its exchange rate with the US
dollar at NRs 13.2 = US$1; the exchange rate with the Indian rupee was
unchanged at NRs 145 = 100. This completed a series of steps to reform
Nepal½s exchange rate system which began when a complex system of multiple
exchange rates and trade restrictions for overseas trade was replaced with a
dual exchange system on March 31, 1978. A technical adjustment to
re-establish cross-rates between the Indian and Nepalese rupees was effected
on December 17, 1982 setting the exchange rate with the US dollar at
NRs14.3=US$1.



-4-
14.     During 1979-81 economic policy making had been delayed by political
developments. Following disturbances in 1979, a referendum was held in May
1980, which reaffirmed the exist:ing partyless system, with suitable reforms.
The constitution was amended in December 1980 to provide, among other things,
for direct election of members of parliament. General electionls were held in
May 1981, and the political situation appears to have since stabilized.
During the past year, the Government hes focussed its attention on economic
problems and on implementing the Sixth Plan (1980/81-1984/85).
15.     The Sixth Plan reflects Nepal½s determination to search for ways to
overcome stagnation and, as a set of objectives, it was endorsed by members
of the Nepal Aid group at its December 1981 meeting. The strat:egy to shift
investment into more productive sectors is continued and emphasis is given to
alleviating some of the factors that limited past growth. The Plan's prin-
cipal objectives are to increase production at a faster rate, to increase
employment, and to meet basic minimum needs in food, fuel (firewood), drink-
ing water, health services, primary education and rural transportation. The
strategy: (i) accords high priority to developing agriculture, small-scale
industries and Nepal's abundant water resources; (ii) stresses soil conserva-
tion and population control; and (iii) emphasizes full utilization of exist-
ing infrastructure and alleviation of absorptive capacity constraints. The
development strategy also calls for full involvement of the private sector in
agriculture, manufacturing, trade, tourism, construction and transport opera-
tions.
16.     Achieving the Plan's objiectives will require quick-yielding sector
programs to generate growth in the short to medium-term as well as human
resource development programs to lay the foundation for sustained growth in
the longer term. Program targets must also be made consistent with overall
financial and implementation capacity. But at the same time, vigorous
measures are needed to remove administrative and domestic financial con-
straints, and the Government has begun to respond to these problems. Reforms
in development administration include the establishment of an Administrative
Staff College; appointment of a Plermanent Pay Commission to review civil
service salaries and schemes of service; creation of a Central 14onitoring
Unit within the Foreign Aid Division of the Ministry of Finance; and estab-
lishment of treasury offices in each of Nepal½s 75 districts to expedite the
release and audit of budgetary funds. The record 49% increase in development
expenditures during 1981/82 may indicate that these efforts have resulted in
a speed up in disbursements. To strengthen domestic resource mobilization,
the Government has set up a revenue training center; formed a Tariff Board
which recommended increases in indirect taxes for the 1982/83 budget; made
preparations for close monitoring of all public enterprises and also liqui-
dated certain of these enterprises; and decided to phase out rice and fer-
tilizer subsidies in the relatively higher-income Kathmandu Valley.
17.     Nepal has received substantial external assistance.  Aid commitments
have averaged US$165 million per year since 1976, and, according to current



-5-
indications, could reach an average of about US$300 million per year during
1981/82-1983/84. Foreign assistance is expected to account for about 53% of
total development spending during the Sixth Plan period. The Nepal Aid Group
was formed in 1976 to assist in the overall coordination of financial and
technical assistance efforts and the Group now accounts for some 70% of all
aid disbursements. The Group has met four times at plenary meetings under
the chairmanship of the Bank to discuss overall external assistance needs;
local Aid Group meetings in Kathmandu are also held to discuss and coordinate
sectoral development strategies.
18.     Foreign aid disbursements grew rapidly in current prices during the
past five years and were estimated to be US$156 million in 1981/82, but only
about 42% of disbursements were from foreign borrowings, the remainder being
grants. As of December 31, 1981, official foreign debt outstanding was
US$234 million, of which US$192 million was due to multilateral agencies.
These loans were obtained on a highly concessional basis and the grant ele-
ment of total loans remains in excess of 70%. As a result, debt service
payments were only US$4.0 million during 1981, equivalent to less than 2% of
exports of goods and services.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL I/
19.     Bank Group operations in Nepal began in FY70 with an IDA credit of
US$1.7 million equivalent for a telecommunications project. Since then, 30
additional credits have been approved, bringing total IDA assistance to Nepal
to US$345.5 million equivalent, net of cancellations. In view of Nepal's
many development needs, this assistance has been for projects in a wide
variety of sectors. Six of these sectors account for about 85% of IDA
credits by amount: irrigation/agriculture (US$143.0 million for eleven
projects); water supply and sewerage (US$46.8 million for three projects),
power (US$40.8 million for one project); telecommunications (US$21.7 million
for three projects); highways (US$19.2 million for two projects); and rural
development (US$19.0 million for two projects). The proposed credit would be
the third in FY83, bringing the total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to
US$351.5 million equivalent, net of cancellations. No Bank loans have been
made to Nepal. IFC made its first investment in Nepal (US$3.1 million) in a
hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75. In addition, IFC approved a loan of
US$6.23 million equivalent to Nepal Orind Magnesite (Private) Limited (i.e.
a private company) on March 16, 1982. The loan was to help finance a US$24.9
million project to mine and process magnesite ore. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank Group operations as of March 31, 1983, and notes on
the execution of ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain delays in the
implementation of some of these projects, particularly during the initial
i/ As of March 31, 1983.



-6-
periods. The delays have been largely due to Nepal's limited technical and
managerial capabilities. In order to assist Nepal in coping with this con-
straint, considerable technical assistance is being given by Bank Group
staff, including our Resident Representative in Kathmandu. As a result, the
rate of disbursements is improving; during FY81 and FY82, US$27.8 million and
US$28.5 million equivalent, respectively, was disbursed compared to US$65.1
million equivalent disbursed during the entire previous 10 yeaLrs. Project
completion reports have been prepared for four projects--First Telecommunica-
tions (Credit No. 166), First Highways (Credit No. 223), Tourism (Credit No.
291) and Birganj Irrigation (Credit No. 373). All four projects experienced
delays in implementation, and institutional improvements were less than
anticipated; however, all four generated acceptable rates of return. A
completion report on the Settlement Project (Credit No. 505) has also been
written and is under review.
20.     Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level com-
pared to the country's need for external assistance. The international
community has shown considerable interest in NepalTs economic development
and, to date, the shortage of funds has not been a major bottleneck. The
main constraint on the utilization of increased aid has been Nepal's limited
absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation and implemen-
tation. The Bank Group has provided assistance to the Government in project
preparation through a Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No. 659-NEP) and by
acting as Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance projects
financed by UNDP.
21.     The Bank Group-s current lending strategy places major emphasis upon
the directly productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the develop-
ment of complementary infrastructure, including manpower training programs
and facilities, transport, and hydroelectric power. For agriculture, the
basic strategy is to assist Nepal maintain overall foodgrain self-sufficiency
and where possible promote exports of agricultural products. This strategy
has two major elements: (a) to assist in building the irrigation infrastruc-
ture in the Terai mainly to increase paddy production, and (b) to help reduce
the food deficits in the Hills both through rural development projects which
emphasize increasing food product:ion, and more recently through a specific
Hill food projects. In order to enhance the success of these efforts, the
Bank has, at the same time, assisted in the improvement of agricultural
extension as well as the provision of other inputs including credit.
Prospective projects for which preparatory work is being undertaken include
those in forestry, irrigation, highways and hydroelectric power.



-7-
PART III - TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
22.     Nepal's need for technical assistance is reflected in its limited
ability to make full use of aid available from bilateral and multilateral
sources as few projects have been adequately prepared for investment deci-
sions by Government agencies. Project selection, in turn, has sometimes been
decided on the basis of available studies or the preferences of donors,
rather than on the basis of development priorities. In addition, during
project implementation, most donors have found that working with weak public
institutions has often involved lengthy delays in decisions related to
tender, procurement, consultant services and project personnel. Given
NepalTs relatively recent start in the process of economic development, the
need for Technical Assistance (TA) for building local capabilities may remain
for many years to come.
23.     Considerable technical assistance has been provided to meet Nepal's
need. Based on data collected by UNDP, technical assistance commitments in
1981 amounted to nearly US$120 million. This compares with approximately
US$66 million of technical assistance committed in 1975/76. About one-half
of TA commitments were channeled into agriculture and natural resources.
General development planning, health and population have also received sig-
nificant resources. Major sources of TA financing include UNDP, USAID,
Canada, Germany, India and IDA.
24.     In part because of world wide economic conditions during 1982, the
availability of both capital and technical assistance has been constrained.
This is particularly evident in the technical assistance provided by the UNDP
funding which in 1983 amounts to 55% of the 1981 level. Since the UNDP has a
large pipeline of ongoing TA projects, few funds are available for new TA
commitments.
25.     Because of Nepal's large TA needs, insufficient financing on
reasonable terms from other sources, and timing and flexibility considera-
tions while undertaking project work, IDA has been playing an important role
in providing technical assistance financing to Nepal. Most of IDA technical
assistance financing has been through project work in Nepal. Some projects
such as Agricultural Extension (Cr.1100) and Technical Education (Cr. 772)
have been directly focussed on institutional and administrative improvements.
26.     IDA has recently agreed under a new program of non-reimbursable
technical assistance to provide staff which would help in establishing and
operating a newly formed Development Project Monitoring and Evaluation Unit
in the Foreign Aid Division of the Ministry of Finance.  The unit would
establish a system to monitor and evaluate performance of individual develop-
ment projects, particularly those funded by various bilateral and multi-
lateral agencies. It would concentrate on identifying key information needed
by decision-makers in the Government to remove-constraints and bottlenecks in
project implementation and to ensure speedy implementation.



-8-
27.     IDA has also provided TA through the first US$3.0 million technical
assistance credit (Cr. 659-NEP) which was approved in 1976. While implemen-
tation of this credit has been slower than anticipated, it is meeting its
objectives. Difficulties were experienced in the beginning because of delays
in identifying sub-projects, reluctance to use expatriate consultants and
complicated and diverse contracting procedures followed by different execut-
ing agencies.  Gradually, however, as the governme:nt agencies became more                    *
familiar with the project, the problems have been overcome. Some of the
problems have been addressed by the proposed second TA project where these
are sought to be resolved by a prior agreement between IDA and HMGN on                        *
sub-project selection and adoption of a uniform standard contracting proce-
dure for hiring consultant services (para 34). The first TA credit is now
fully committed with 15 sub-projects. All but one sub-project have been
completed. Less than US$200,000 of the credit remains to be disbursed. To
date, the credit has assisted in the preparation of follow-up investments
by IDA amounting to over US$32 million in various fields such as agriculture,
natural resources, cottage industry, manpower development, etc. A brief
description of individual sub-projects financed under the first TA credit is
given in Annex IV.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.     Having fully committed the first Technical Assistance credit, the
Government (HMGN) in early 1982 requested that consideration be given to the
preparation of a second TA credit. Preparation of the proposed project took
place during supervision missions of the existing TA credit in March and
November, 1982. Negotiations for the proposed credit were held in
Washington, D.C. on April 28, 1983.  HMGN was represented by Mr. K.B. Shrestha,
Charge d'Affaires, Royal Nepalese Embassy, Washington, D.C. A timetable of
key events relating to the project and special cond:itions of the credit are
given in Annex III.
Projett Objiettiveg anid Destription
29.     Nepal's overall need for TA continues to grow as development efforts
continue to expand. The basic rationale for IDA financing of TA established
by the first TA credit remains valid. That is, the proposed TA project would
provide an assured and flexible source of financing for TA in cases where
financing is not readily available on appropriate terms and where IDA financ-
ing would permit more expeditious action. The immediate objectives of the TA
would be to assist the Government in the identification, preparation and
implementation of high priority projects. Underlying the immediate objectives
is the lor.ger term objective of strengthening institutions so that the
country would develop its own capacity to undertake its development program.



-9-
30.     The proposed project would finance approximately 10-15 sub-projects.
It is expected that these will include preparation of investment projects
suitable for external financing, technical assistance for implementation of
investment projects, sectoral studies and strengthening of institutions.
Individual sub-project commitment would be made after receipt of proposals
from HMGN which would be in line with the priorities of the Government's
economic development plan and IDA's lending strategy in the country during
the next few years. While emphasis would be placed on agriculture, the
credit would be flexible enough to accommodate the TA needs in other sectors.
Criteria for eligibility of the sub-projects are set forth in Annex V to this
A      Report.
Organiiation anid Ifnpletoeitation
31.     The Ministry of Finance, which coordinates all foreign aid, would
have overall responsibility for the coordination and monitoring of the
project. The Ministry of Finance would also monitor the sub-projects and
provide advice on procurement of consultants and related equipment and dis-
bursement procedures. The Ministry would provide periodic overall status
reports on the progress of the project. To ensure the overall coordination
and administration of the credit, the Ministry of Finance would appoint a
Project Coordinator whose qualifications and experience would be acceptable
to the Association (Section 4.01(c) of the DCA).
32.     The implementation of the individual sub-projects would be the
responsibility of the executing agency. It is expected that in most cases
the executing agency will be the line ministry. The executing agency would
select and employ the consultants required to undertake the sub-projects in
accordance with the agreed Terms of Reference (TOR). Each TOR would identify
required counterpart staff and specify their responsibilities. Wherever
appropriate, training would be a separate item specified in the contract and
the trainee selection procedures/criteria would be agreed with IDA. The
executing agency would also provide support services and be responsible for
supervising the work of the consultants. The executing agency would be
responsible for keeping accounts. A brief quarterly report covering
sub-project status and disbursements would be submitted by the executing
agencies to the Project Coordinator.
*      33.     To obtain financing for a sub-project proposal, the executing agency
would prepare a request which would include a description and justification
of the proposal,terms of reference, foreign and local cost estimates and
counterpart staffing and support arrangements, and submit it to the Ministry
of Finance. The Ministry of Finance, after ensuring that the sub-project
proposal is in line with the priorities of the Government-s development plan,
would submit it to IDA for approval. The specific purpose and scope of each
sub-project, the method of its execution and the allocation of funds will in
each case be made by agreement between the Government and IDA (Section 3.01
of the DCA).



-10-
34.     In line with the longer term objective of strengthening the local
capacity, steps would be undertaken to improve the overall administration of
TA. One of the difficulties encountered during the previous project was that
different agencies had different procedures for the procurement and contract-
ing of consultant services. Agreement was reached during negotiations that
a draft standardized consultant contract would be furnished by IHMGN to the
Association not later than March 31, 1984. It would be finalized after IDA
review and utilized in the hiring of consultants under the project (Section
4.06 of the DCA).
35.     Under the first TA credit several sub-projects were undertaken by                    k
local consulting firms, including those supported partly by HMGN.  Further
steps should be taken to encourage the use 6f local consultants. A plan of
action would therefore be prepared by HMGN to undertake specific steps to
promote the industry and submit:ted for IDA review not later than December 31,
1983. Such steps would include a survey of existing firms, development of
guidelines for selection and use of local consultants, creation of a
registry, training seminars ancd conferences (Section 4.07 of the DCA).
Assistance for implementation of these actions could be made available under
the TA credit.
Project Cost ahid Dfsburseniefit
36.     Although the proposed sub-projects have not been identified, it is
expected that approximately 10-15 sub-projects would be financed under the
project amounting to about US$6.0 million equivalent, or about 90% of total
project costs. The proposed IDA credit would finance 100% costs of consult-
ants irrespective of whether they are foreign or local consultants. It would
finance 100% of the cost of training programs associated with the
sub-projects as also 100% of the cost of foreign expenditures for equipment
and materials required for carrying out the sub-projects. For equipment and
materials procured locally, the credit would finance 100% of ex-factory cost
and 75% of expenditures for other items procured locally. The credit would
also finance 100% of foreign expenditures incurred in connection with over-
seas travel of the Borrower-s personnel working on the sub-projects with the
consultants engaged for the sub--projects. Reimbursement of all expenditures
under these categories would be made on full documentation.
37.     Contracts for equipment and materials valued over US$50,000 equiv-
alent or more would be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDATs procurement guidelines. For bid evaluations,
Nepalese manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the
CIF costs of competing imports cr the relevant customs duties, whichever is
lower. For awards of contract of US$100,000 equivalent or more for equipment
and materials IDA's prior review would be required. Small contracts
estimated to cost under US$50,000 equivalent,,provided such contracts



-11-
together total less than US$500,000 equivalent, would be let through local
procurement procedures which are acceptable to IDA.
38.     The Government's contribution to individual sub-project costs,
estimated to be about 10% of total project costs, would normally be the
provision of counterpart staff, office space and supplies and would be
specified in the TOR. The Government's commitment to make these contribu-
tions would be a condition of approval to each sub-project.
AcCofnits and Aiditing
39.     The executing agencies would establish and maintain accounts for each
sub-project. The Project Coordinator would-maintain a consolidated account
for the project. These accounts and supporting records would be audited
annually by auditors acceptable to the Association and audit reports would be
submitted promptly to the Association (Section 4.05(b) of the DCA).
Monitoring and Evaluation
40.     The Project Coordinator would be responsible for overall monitoring
of the sub-projects and would collect, review and evaluate information
received from the executing agencies. Quarterly reports would be forwarded
to the Association. The Project Coordinator would also be responsible for
preparing a project completion report which would summarize the implementa-
tion of the project and its overall impact (Section 4.04(d) of the DCA).
Beniefitg and Risks
41.     As the previous TA credit has already shown, a major benefit of the
proposed project would be the development of a pipeline of high-priority
projects suitable for external financing. It would also assist project
implementation and, in the longer term, improve the institutional capacity of
the Government. Administration of the TA would be improved and the local
consulting industry could be further developed. This in turn would help
Nepal make a more effective use of domestic and external resources for the
development of its economy.
42.     For individual project preparation studies, there is a risk that
development policies and priorities could change while sub-projects are
underway. This risk would be minimized by IDA satisfying itself that the
study is in support of a high priority investment within the Government's
investment plan. Also, there is the risk that the institution building
component of the sub-projects could be delayed, not fully implemented or
followed-up by concerned ministry or executing agency. Again, this risk
would be significantly reduced by a prior Government and IDA review to ensure
that the recipient agency is genuinely interested in the component, agrees to
its time framework and its general feasibility. As in the past, the project
would require very close supervision.

PART, V -LEG.AL-INSTRUMENTS-AND AUTHORITY
43.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed tco
the Executive Directors separat:ely.
44.     Special conditions of t:he project are listed in Section III of Annex
III. Additional condition of credit effectiveness would be that the Project
Coordinator has been duly appointed (para 31).
45.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART-VI--RECOMMENDATION
46.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

Credit No. 470 Water Supply and Sewerage Project $11.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The credit is about 90% disbursed. Delays continue with the execu-
tion of the sewerage component, but the Water Supply and Sewerage Board
(WSSB) is making every effort to commission the system. The main contractor
responsible for the execution of the work is struggling to complete minor
works such as manholes, sewer cleaning and road restoration; the WSSB is now
executing the latter by force account. The sewerage system, however, is 95%
complete and trunk sewers, pumping station and treatment plant are ready to
go into operation. Apart from some minor works, the water supply component

1976; Effective Date: July 15, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
With the appointment of a new project coordinator during early 1982,
overall management and supervision of the project improved substantially.
However, delays in the release of HMG funds prevented timely implementation
of the 1982-83 work program. Project completion and credit closing dates
have been extended to July 31 and December 31, 1983, respectively, by which
time all ongoing project activities will have been completed and about 90
percent of the IDA credit will have been disbursed. With UNDP funds a second
phase of the project is now being prepared.

projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems which
are being encountered and the action being taken. They should be used
in this sense on the understanding that they do not purport to present
a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 659 Technical Assistance Project $3.0 million Credit of
September 16, 1976; Effective Date: November 16, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The Marsyangdi Technical Review Panel is t'he one subproject that is
ongoing and is proceeding satisfactorily. Fourteen of the subprojects
financed under the technical assistance credit have been completed and are
contributing to the pipeline of bankable projects in Nepal.
Credit No. 704 Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project; $8.0 million
Credit of May 27, 1977; Effective Date: February 28, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The credit is about 70% disbursed. The sewer work is about 55%
completed. All the sewer pipes, however, have been manufactured and paid for
by WSSB. Performance of the contractor of this component has been very
unsatisfactory. WSSB is now considering whether to complete the works by its
own hand, by a recognized public contractor or through a rebid. The WSSB is
reviewing the situation to decide wh,ich is the more expeditious way to
proceed and will communicate proposals to the Bank.
Work on the water supply components is proceeding satisfactorily.
The orders for pressure pipes have now been fulfilled. Some minor problems
incurred in the installation of the pumping equipment in the secondary towns
are gradually being overcome. The delays in executing Credits 470 and 704
involve extended consultant services for construction supervision.
Credit No. 705 Nepal Industrial Development Corporation Project; $4.0
million Credit of May 27, 1977; Effective Date: February 17,
1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Since March 31, 1982 (latest date of subloan authorization) NIDC has
fully committed the $4.0 million Credit.  Close supervision is being carried
out to ensure further improvements in NIDC's operations and implementation of
subprojects and disbursements under the Credit within the closi'ng date. An
appraisal of a second Credit to NIDC is planned for August 1983 under a
proposed Industrial Development Project.
Credit No. 730  Second Highway Project; $17.0 million Credit of October 19,
1977; Effective Date: December 23, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984
The project is now moving steadily towards a successful conclusion,
though there remain several areas where improved performance is required.
Procurement, which has been a source of considerable delay in the past, is
now virtually complete. The work on the Thankot-Naubise road pavement has
now been completed. Much supervisory attention is currently being given to
the Tulsipur feeder road in an effort to improve performance oni a few con-
tracts. Disbursements, which currently stand at 75% of appraisal estimates,
are expected to improve substantially over the next year since the major
project component has been completed.

Date: September 30, 1983
The project, which provides new facilities for technician training at
the Institute of Engineering in Kathmandu, will be completed by June 1983.
Good progress has been made with equipment procurement, furniture procurement
and part of the civil works.
There has been partial delay in construction due to failure of one
contractor. Civil works are now expected to be completed by June 1983.
Credit No. 799 Third Telecommunications Project $14.5 million Credit of
August 22, 1978; Effective Date: February 27, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The earth
station for satellite communication and the international telex exchange
(both financed by ODA of UK) have been completed and commissioned. Procure-
ment under the IDA credit is also progressing satisfactorily and all major
equipment items have been contracted.
Credit No. 812 Sunsari-Morang Irrigation and Drainage Development Project
$30 million Credit of July 7, 1978; Effective Date:
November 30, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
In July 1980, a landslide in the catchment area caused a major flood
in the Kosi river, causing a considerable erosion and endangering the Chatra
Main Canal. Emergency flood protection works were carried out. Investiga-
tions for the design of headreach works to improve the water supply to and
distribution within the main canal have been completed. The ICB process for
the construction of the headreach improvements and irrigation and drainage
works in about 12,000 ha has been completed; bids have been evaluated and a
contract award has taken place. Project implementation has fallen about two
years behind schedule.

$14.0 million Credit of November 27, 1978; Effective
Date: January 8, 1979; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Project implementation is proceeding steadily, although slower than
anticipated. The major constraint is the weakness of local contractors.
Construction is now on-going in all six irrigation blocks. Most civil works
and equipment contracts have been awarded, and construction is progressing
satisfactorily.

million Credit of August 9, 1979; Effective Date:
January 15, 1980; Closing Date: February 28, 1985
Although there have been some zimprovements recently, overall progress
in project implementation continues to be unsatisfactory. Delays in the
release of HMG funds, staff turnover, shortages in field staff, and vacancies
in a number of senior critical post:s have severely constrained project
implementation. Communication has somewhat improved with the installation
of radio transreceivers and widening of a major link road in the project
area. HMG has taken some steps to improve the planning and implementation
of RD projects and the concerned Ministry's monitoring and supervision of
project implementation have substantia:Lly improved during recent months.
Credit No. 1008 Community Forestry Development and Training Project $17.0
million of May 22, 1980; Effective Date: September 19,
1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The Project is progressing well. An effective administrative
organization has been established into which the UNDP/FAO technical assis-
tance team has been integrated. Except for Panchayat Protected Forest the
field planting targets have been met. A total of 700 stoves have been dis-
tributed. Motivation and Education, and Monitoring and Evaluation programs
are being efficiently conducted. ]'roject committees have been set-up and are
functioning.  Shortages of staff, delays in release of funds and -HMG½s
failure to pay project and training allowances are causing implementation
problems. The recent provision of a pool of permanent posts to which Com-
munity Forest Assistants can be posted will help keep posts filled.
Architects have been appointed for construction of training facilities at
Pokhara, Hetaura and Kathmandu, and designs have been approved by IDA.
Tender documents have been produced.  The designs for the Kathmandu Training
Wing have been completed and the building contractor appointed. The urban
fuelwood study has been completed.
Credit No. 1055 Mahakali Irrigation Project (Stage I); $16.0 million
Credit of September 29, 1980; Effective Date: February 27,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
Contracts for undertaking the survey and engineering designs have
been awarded to local engineering consultants. Most of the work is progress-
ing satisfactorily. ICB tenders for the procurement of the project's equip-
ment and vehicles requirements have been invited. The project area has been
reduced by about 20%, because (i) inaccurate maps were used, and (ii) HMG
decided to puc restrictions on forest clearing.

1981; Effective Date:  July 31, 1981; Closing Date:
September 30, 1984
The project is about two years behind schedule due largely to HMG-s
past indecision on the institutional arrangements envisaged under the
project. 11MG has now decided that grain procurement and distribution
activities should be integrated under the Nepal Food Corporation (NFC) as
planned at appraisal. PEU has completed designs and tender documents for
Phase I construction. Consultants have been envisaged to assist NFC in
management, finance and quality control. The project study on marketing is
completed, and the one on future storage and processing needs is in progress.

Subproject I - Kosi River Training & Chatra Main Canal Sediment Control Study
(A-US $735,598) (D-US $735,598) 1/
A principal objective of the study was to advise the project authority
on the most appropriate measures to ensure that sufficient water is diverted
from the Kosi River into the Chatra Main Canal (CMC) at all times, to reduce
the quantity of sediment entering CMC from the Kosi River, to ensure that CMC
is protected against flood damage and to maintain the discharge capacity of
CMC. The study supported the project assisted by IDA credit No.812 which was
approved on May 25, 1978 for $30.0 million for Sunsari-Morang Irrigation and
Drainage.

aeromagnetic records and process aeromagnetic data and maps for the Govern-
ment to interpret and delineate the extent and configuration of the sedimen-
tary rocks and the faults, basement uplifts and other structures underlying
them as a first necessary step for possible future oil and gas exploration.
Based on the results of the initial study the Bank has approved hiring a
petroleum geologist to integrate geological information with airborne
geophysical results and to prepare seismic programs to form the basis of
minimal work programs to be negotiated with oil companies. This component
was be completed in November 1982. The subproject is being followed up by a
