The hydro plant would consist of the construction\n            of a double curvature thin arch dam with a height of 201m,\n            an energy tunnel of 2.05km length and an inside diameter of\n            9.30m, and an underground power plant.  The reservoir active\n            volume is 300 million m.  When complete, the complex will\n            provide 1,600 GWh p.a. of electric energy.  The transmission\n            component consists of construction of 737 km 154 kV\n            transmission lines and 12 substations with installed\n            transformer capacity of 1,350 MVA and a modern load dispatch center."}, "docdt": "1992-05-05T00:00:00Z"}
