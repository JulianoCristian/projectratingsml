PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
TURKEY
BERKE HYDROPOWER PROJECT
(Loan No. 3476-TU)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Note (PCN) for the Berke Hydropower Project in Turkey, for
which loan 3476-TU in the amount of US$270 million equivalent was approved on May 29, 1992 and
made effective on October 29, 1992. The Borrower was the Republic of Turkey; the beneficiary, a
privately-owned, regional power company -- Cukurova Elektrik, A.S. (CEAS).
Because of non-compliance by the Borrower and CEAS with procurement covenants of,
respectively, the Loan and Project Agreements, the Bank, after extensive discussions and
communications with Turkish authorities, suspended disbursements from Loan 3476-TU on February
1, 1995, and closed the loan on March 3, 1995, about three years before the originally scheduled
closing date. At that time the project was about one year behind schedule and less than 30%
complete; a balance of US$227.5 million equivalent was canceled.
The PCN was prepared by Luiz Gazoni, Task Manager, Infrastructure Division, ECI. It was
reviewed by Ricardo A. Halperin, Division Chief and George C. Zaidan, Project Advisor. The
Borrower and the implementing agency were requested to provide comments on the draft Project
Completion Note; however, their comments have not reached the Bank in time to be included in the
the Note.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE'
TURKEY
BERKE HYDROPOWER PROJECT
(Loan No. 3476-TU)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
Power Loans to Turkey. The Bank has loaned over US$2.0 billion to Turkey to help finance
power projects, including US$1.57 billion since 1985. The subject loan--Loan 3476-TU (US$270 million;
1992), which was to help finance the Berke Hydropower Project--was the seventh Bank loan to benefit
Qukurova Elektric A.S. (CEAS), a privately-owned regional power company. The Borrower was the
Republic of Turkey (ROT) (para. 1).
Proiect Objectives and Description
Objectives. The objectives of the Project were to assist the ROT in accelerating the development
of the country's hydropotential and expanding the role of the private sector in power generation (para. 3).
Description. The project was to consist of a concrete arch dam, related structures (including
tunnels, spillways, intake, surge tank, and a power house with an installed capacity of 510 MW), and a
reservoir; 730 km of transmission lines, the extension of six substations and the construction of six new
ones; technical assistance for the studies related to the regional dispatch center; and a resettlement
program. The expected total project cost and project completion date were, respectively, US$663.3
million and mid 1996 (para. 4).
Evaluation. The project objectives and description were compatible with sector guidelines and
clearly stated in the loan documents (para. 5).
l Because the project implementing agency - the Cukurova Elektric A. S. (CEAS) did not complete the
implementation of the proposed Berke Hydropower Project, this report is a Project Completion Note
(PCN) which focuses on the reasons that led to the premature closing of the loan and assesses the
performances of the Borrower, CEAS and the Bank.

Implementation Experience and Results
Achievement of Objectives. In July 1994, the main civil works contractor terminated his contract
due to disagreements and disputes with CEAS. CEAS subsequently sought a new contractor without
adhering to the Bank requirements on procurement. Because of non-compliance by CEAS with respect
to the agreed procurement procedures, the Bank closed the loan on March 3, 1995 -- about three years
before the originally scheduled closing date--and cancelled the undisbursed balance of US$227.5 million.
At that time, the project was about one year behind schedule and less than 30% complete; and no project
objectives had been achieved. Clearly, this outcome is highly unsatisfactory. The failure to complete the
project does not make it possible to discuss the sustainability of project objectives or benefits, the least-
cost rationale, or the internal rate of return (para. 7).
Factors Affecting Implementation. CEAS' shares are traded in the stock market and distributed
among a relatively large number of shareholders. In April-May 1993 a new group of investors acquired
a controlling interest in the company. Shortly after the management was replaced, disputes arose with the
main civil works contractor that had been selected in August 1992, following ICB procedures acceptable
to the Bank. In July 1994, the main civil works contractor decided to terminate the contract and the
CEAS Board of Directors did not follow the Bank's procurement procedures in his replacement.
Performance.  Given the unsuccessful outcome of the project, the performances of the
Government and CEAS are rated as highly unsatisfactory. The Bank did what it could to keep the project
on track, trying to promote the reconciliation of the CEAS with the civil works contractor, but its best
efforts were not successful. The Bank's performance is, therefore, rated as satisfactory (paras. 17-20).
Future Operation and Lessons to be Learned
Future Operations. No further projects are planned with CEAS (para. 7)
Key Lessons. The experience of this project suggests that: (i) in connection with loans benefitting
private power companies, the appraisal process should include an explicit evaluation of the vulnerability
of the power company to a takeover by a new group of owners (para. 20); (ii) the Government should
strengthen the regulatory framework and regulatory capacity to better deal with similar problems in the
future; this is being undertaken under a separate project (paral7); and (iii) the Bank would be well advised
to make a standard lending requirement the placement of a reputable engineering consulting firm in a
position of responsibility to supervise the implementation of a hydroelectric power project (para. 12).



PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE (PCN)
TURKEY
BERKE HYDROPOWER PROJECT
(Loan No. 3476-TU)
PART I: FINDINGS AND LESSONS
A. Background
1.     Bank Power Lending to Turkey. The Bank has made twenty one power loans to Turkey,
amounting to over US$2.0 billion, including eight loans since 1985 amounting to US$1.57 billion. To
help finance the Berke Hydropower Project, the Bank made Loan 3476-TU (US$270 million; approved
on May 28, 1992) to the Government of Turkey (GOT) which on-lent the proceeds to (ukurova Elektric
A.S. (CEAS), a privately-owned regional power company. This on-lending feature had already been
utilized in previous six loans benefitting CEAS since 1963. The loan next preceding Loan 3476-TU was
Loan 2750-TU (US$132 million, approved on August 26, 1986), which helped finance the Sir
Hydroelectric Project.
B. Project Objectives, Description and Design
2.    Power Sector Strategy and Policies. The Government's basic strategy for the power sector was
to ensure a balanced, least-cost expansion of the system at a rate adequate to meet the country's economic
growth requirements. The Sixth Five-Year Plan called for the exploitation of domestic energy resources,
especially hydro. To advance this strategy and at the same time limit the financing demands and the
budget the Government sought, inter alia , to maximize private investment in power generation. The
proposed Berke Hydropower Project was identified as supporting this strategy.
3.    Project Objectives. According to the loan documents, the objectives of the Project were to assist
the Borrower in:
(a) accelerating the development of the country's hydropotential; and
(b) expanding the role of the private sector in power generation.
4.    Project Description. The project included the following components:
(a) the construction of a concrete dam 201 meters high to forn a reservoir with a storage
capacity of about 427 million m3, and related structures ( tunnels, spillways, intake, surge
tank, power house), that would allow for the installation of three generating units with a
combined installed capacity of 510 MW;
(b) the construction of 730 kms of transmission lines and the extension of six substations as
well as the construction of six new ones;
(c) technical assistance for studies related to a regional dispatch center; and



-2-
(d) carrying out a resettlement program for 144 people affected by the Project.
The project was expected to cost US$663.3 million, including financing charges of US$71.2 million.
After deducting cumulative expenditures through 1991 (land acquisition, access roads, etc.) amounting to
US$39.6 million, the financing required to complete the project amounted to US$623.7 million, including
the Bank loan for US$270 million. Following approval of the Bank loan (1992) project implementation
was expected to be completed by about mid 1996.
5.    Evaluation. On the basis of the information available at appraisal, the project objectives and
description were compatible with sector guidelines, and, as set forth in the loan documents, they were
clearly stated.
6.    Project Design. CEAS followed the same approach to project design which had been successfully
used in connection with the Sir Hydroelectric Project (para. 1). For the dam and the powerhouse, CEAS
established a separate Project Manager and associated support staff.  An international engineering
consulting firm was engaged to complete detailed engineering and design, to prepare the main bidding
documents, and to assist CEAS in construction supervision. The loan documents, however, did not specify
the role of these consultants, which CEAS financed from its own funds. During construction, an
international panel of experts (POE) was to advise CEAS on design/safety problems and to monitor
progress and their appointment and role were covenanted in the loan.
7.     Achievement of Project Objectives. At the time of the cancellation of the loan, the project was
about one year behind schedule and less than 30% complete. No objectives had been achieved. Clearly,
this outcome is highly unsatisfactory. The non-completion of the project voids the relevance of any
discussion on the sustainability of project objectives, the least-cost rationale for the project, or its actual
vs. expected economic internal rate of return. No further projects are planned with CEAS.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
8.    Project implementation, although delayed by 6 to 8 months, proceeded in a satisfactory manner
until about May 1993 when a corporate takeover took place and control of CEAS shifted to a new Board
of Directors (BOD). The new BOD expressed dissatisfaction with what they considered the uneconomic
ways of the then current management, most of whom promptly departed (May-June 1993), including the
project management team.
9.    The change in management had a very significant effect on the way that CEAS was run; decision
making became highly centralized and all decisions were referred to the company president who resided
in Istanbul (CEAS' headquarters are located in Adana, in SE Turkey). Furthermore, the position of site
project manager was left vacant for a long period of time, and many technical problems had to be referred
back to the BOD, thus hindering construction activities.
10.   In the summer of 1993, disputes on technical issues started between, on the one side, the
contractor, the consultant, and the POE and, on the other side, the new BOD. For example, some
variations in geological conditions led to disputes over how to deal with the right bank stabilization, the
left bank upstream excavation, the T-2 tunnel, and the tail race outlet structure. The recommendations
of the consulting engineers and the POE on the technical issues were not followed by CEAS who, having
consulted third-party engineering consultants, instructed the contractor to implement simplified solutions



- 3 -
that the Bank feared could have serious impact on the safety of the works. These technical disputes
contributed to the growing mistrust between parties involved in the project construction. In October 1993,
the POE resigned as a group because they felt that their advice was being ignored. This became a serious
issue in the dialogue with the Bank; however, eventually the Bank agreed to the appointment of a new
POE composed of well known technical specialists.
11.   Soon after the problems with the POE, commercial disputes arose with the contractor regarding
the down payment (made by the previous management) and the interpretation of the contractual price
adjustment mechanisms. As a consequence, contractor invoices were disputed and not paid by CEAS.
The Bank tried at all levels and on several occasions to mediate between CEAS and contractor; however,
the situation continued to deteriorate until the contractor decided to terminate (July 1994) the contract on
the grounds that CEAS failed to give them proper and timely instructions, to reply to the application for
time extension and to certify and pay the works performed. The matter was then taken to court, and no
final ruling has yet been given.
12.   Following the termination of the construction contract, the Bank and CEAS again had many
exchanges on the best course to follow to complete the project in a sound manner. Finally, CEAS sought
to find new contractors, but ignored the procurement procedures recommended by the Bank. The
procedures chosen by CEAS raised safety concerns. Specifically, in early September 1994, CEAS
completed new bidding packages and published a procurement notice for the Berke Project which, instead
of one single civil works contract as earlier, split the civil works into three separate contracts, the main
dam, the powerhouse and tunnels, and drilling plus grouting. The Bank objected to this approach as well
as to the documents. The main concerns that the Bank had were: a) the lack of an independent project
engineer (it had become evident that the engineers then in place were playing a very limited role which
limited their efficacy) which had become an issue in view of the highly technical nature of some of the
points of contention between CEAS and the Bank; b) the necessity of addressing, based on the
recommendations of the POE, the geological problems on the right bank of the dam which posed a threat
to its stability; c) the lack of contractor responsibility for the dam, given that instead of one company
being responsible for the entire civil works, two, and possibly four companies, were to be responsible for
the entire works; d) CEAS' ignoring Bank procurement procedures since the bidding documents and
procurement notice used by CEAS were not satisfactory to the Bank; and e) uncertainty about the
financing plan and project costs given the delays resulting from the termination of the prior construction
contract.
13.   In the bidding carried out in October 1994, CEAS received no bids either for the main dam
contract or for the powerhouse and tunnels contract. Only one of the three packages, the small drilling
and grouting contract, was awarded; however, the Bank had not approved the bidding documents and was
not informed about the award. It took CEAS until January 1995, when it received a bid from a local
contractor to contract the remaining works, again without Bank approval.
14.   As events unfolded, the Bank made its views clearly known to CEAS and the Government that
the course of action taken by the CEAS management regarding the project construction was risky. This
course of action, in addition to ignoring agreed procurement procedures, was leading to unnecessarily
increased construction risks, impinging on the safety of the dam, which by far outweighed the immediate
monetary gains that CEAS was presuming would accrue from its disputes with the contractor.
15.   As the project implementation got further delayed on account of the above, and the possibility of
a compromise between the Bank and CEAS faded away, CEAS started to question the cost of the Bank
loans it still had to service, alleging that it was too high and that the currency pooling system was not



- 4 -
defined clearly in the loan documents. CEAS management complained about the lending terms of the
Bank, and, although it received clarifications from the Bank, it continued to raise the subject and requested
a change in the loan terms.
16.   After providing several opportunities to CEAS to reconsider the course it was following for project
implementation, and given the unwillingness of the Government to intervene, the Bank decided to suspend,
as of February 1, 1995, disbursements under the loan and then, as no positive demarches were made
either by the Borrower or the implementing agency, close the loan on March 3, 1995. The Bank could
not continue to be associated with a project under a management who disregarded the use of agreed
procurement procedures. The undisbursed proceeds of the loan (about $227.5 million equivalent) were
cancelled.
D. Performance
17.   The Borrower and the Beneficiary. The performance of the Government authorities during the
events that led to the cancellation of the Bank loan, was quite passive; however, it is difficult to imagine
what the Government could have done short of intervening in the management of the company, which was
not warranted. It is debatable whether a more graduated and proactive role on the part of the Government
vis-a-vis CEAS would have changed the course of events. However, the takeover of CEAS by a new
group of shareholders was beyond the control of the Government. Even if the Government could have
legally prevented the takeover had it wished to, it is doubtful whether this would have been desirable.
On the other hand, as the Government seeks to promote an expanded private sector role in electricity
generation it will need to strengthen its regulatory framework and regulatory capacity to deal better with
similar problems in the future.
18.   The new management received a project with the financing lined up, the bulk of the contracts
signed within reasonable conditions, and it managed from the outset to antagonize most of the
organizations who were collaborating on the implementation of the project. Its actions undermined many
of the mechanisms in place that would ensure sound implementation like, for example, an experienced
project team, the working of the panel of experts, the contractual responsibility for construction, and its
relations with the Bank.
19.   In November 1995 the Istanbul Stock Exchange suspended trading of the CEAS shares, and the
Ministry of Energy and National Resources took control of the company for breach of its license. The
control was later returned to the majority shareholder after its statements to the Exchange limiting the
activities to the ones defined in the license. In January 1996 the local press reported labor relations
difficulties in some of the company's power plants.
20.   The Bank. The supply of electricity to the country has clearly suffered a major setback not only
because of the uncertainty regarding the completion of this project, but also because of the challenge to
the model of private sector development for major hydropower projects. If, on one hand it is difficult for
the Bank to dissociate itself from the failure, it is also difficult, to imagine what the Bank could have done
that it did not do. Even if the vulnerability of CEAS to a hostile take over had been detected during
appraisal, it is not clear what could the Bank have done to preserve the competent management with
whom it negotiated the loan. The Bank was proactive enough in trying to promote the reconciliation
between the civil works contractor and the new management of CEAS; however, the Bank was not in a
position to advise the Government to take over the project, although there were indications (like the
questioning of the cost of Bank loans and complete disregard of the agreed procurement procedures for



- 5 -
the contracting of the civil works contractors) that this could be the final outcome. The Bank did what
it could to keep the project on track, but its best efforts were not successful. The decision to suspend and
cancel the loan was justified as failure to do so would have rendered the obligations in the loan agreement
meaningless and the Bank would have been associated to a project that posed unacceptable risks. Under
these circumstances the Bank's performance should be rated as satisfactory as there were no alternatives
open to keep the project on track. Regarding the Bank's performance it is worth mentioning that the
resettlement plan developed for the project demonstrated that the private sector has the flexibility of
compensating the affected populations promptly and providing resettlement assistance effectively.
E. Lessons to be Learned
21.    The experience of this project suggests two lessons: (i) in connection with loans benefitting private
power companies, the appraisal process should include an explicit consideration of the vulnerability of the
power company to a takeover by a new group of owners; (ii) the Government should strengthen the
regulatory framework and regulatory capacity to better deal with similar problems in the future; this is
being undertaken under a separate project; and (iii) the Bank would be well advised to make as a standard
lending requirement  the placement of a reputable engineering consulting firm  in a position of
responsibility to supervise the implementation of a hydroelectric power project.

* These estimates updated the project costs after the award of the major contracts but before the termination of the
contract for the civil works (para. I 1). The costs shown are lower than the appraisal figures due to the intense
competition for the Bank-financed contracts. If the costs were to be updated to consider the turmoil suffered by the
project in 1994, it is likely that the estimates would show figures considerably higher than the appraisal estimates,
but such information is not presently available.
