The borrower was the Republic of Turkey\n            (ROT); the beneficiary, a privately-owned, regional power\n            company - Cukurova Elektrik, A.S. (CEAS). The overall\n            outcome of the project rated as unsuccessful; and the\n            performances of the government and CEAS are rated as highly\n            unsatisfactory. Because of non-compliance by the borrower\n            and CEAS with procurement covenants of, respectively, the\n            loan and project agreements, the Bank, after extensive\n            discussions and communications with Turkish authorities,\n            suspended disbursements from loan 3476-TU on February 1,\n            1995, and closed the loan on March 3, 1995, about three\n            years before the originally scheduled closing date. At that\n            time the project was about one year behind schedule and less\n            than 30 percent complete; a balance of US$227.5 million\n            equivalent was canceled. The objectives of the Project were\n            to assist the ROT in accelerating the development of the\n            country's hydro potential and expanding the role of the\n            private sector in power generation. The experience of this\n            project suggests that: (i) in connection with loans\n            benefiting private power companies, the appraisal process\n            should include an explicit evaluation of the vulnerability\n            of the power company to a takeover by a new group of owners;\n            (ii) the Government should strengthen the regulatory\n            framework and regulatory capacity to better deal with\n            similar problems in the future; this is being undertaken\n            under a separate project; and (iii) the Bank would be well\n            advised to make as a standard lending requirement the\n            placement of a reputable engineering consulting firm in a\n            position of responsibility to supervise the implementation\n            of a hydroelectric power project."}, "docdt": "1996-05-24T00:00:00Z"}
