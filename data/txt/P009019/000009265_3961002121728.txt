MIORh~A1D  AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRSIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EECUTIVE DIRRETORS
ON A PROPOSED WAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE BERKE HYDROPOWER P_RQJEC
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Turkey for US$270 million equivalent to help
finance a project for the development of hydro-electric generation capacity. The
Loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of
17 years including 5 years of grace. Private sources of financing, including the
IFC, have been identified to provide financing up to US$100 million equivalent
to the Project.
2.   Bacground.   Turkey has made remarkable progress in developing its
commercial energy base over the last two decades. Net primary energy supply
increased threefold since 1970, reaching 58.8 million TOE in 1990. Lignite is
the most important commercial source of domestic energy (with an output of 11.4
million TOE, representing 19 percent of the total energy supplied) followed by
about 7.1 million TOE of hydroelectric generation (providing 12 percent of total
primary energy supply). The importance of natural gas (of which 89 percent is
imported) is slowly increasing (from 12 in 1987 to 7X in 1990) mainly as a result
of its increased competitiveness as an industrial fuel and its environmental
benefits relative to lignite fuels for electricity generation and residential
heating. However, Turkey's dependence on imported energy has increased over the
last two decades and is expected to remain high beyond the turn of this century.
The Government's long-term energy strategy calls for the accelerated development
of domestic energy resources. Turkey's most important domestic sources of energy
are hydroelectricity and lignite. Development of hydroelectric resources has
been steadily increasing since the 1970s, and is expected to accelerate even
further in the next 20 years in order to match the subsector's required
investment expansion. The exploitable hydropower potential is estimated at 31
GW, of which 7.5 GW has been developed and another 3.2 GW is under construction
or planned to be developed by 1994. The installed power generation capacity is
18 GW, of which 431 is based on hydro, 30X on lignite, 15% on imported natural
gas and 121 on fuel oil. The Government's least-cost plan which takes into
account the environmental concern associated with lignite plants, emphasizes
hydro potential and the proposed Berke project exploits an additional generation
capacity of 510 MW. GOT's strategy calls for mobilizing private sector resources
through build-own-operate (BOT) schemes and by assigning entrusted regions to
private utilities to supplement the scarce public sector finances. Vukurova
Electric A.S. (EAS), a small, efficient joint-stock company, licensed to operate
as a regional power utility in the gukurova region, has been authorized by GOT
to implement the proposed project. GOT regards SEAS as a replicable model for
establishing new regions of entrustment.
3.    Project Objectives.  The proposed Project would assist the Government in:
(a) accelerating the development of hydro potential; (b) expanding the role of
the private sector in power infrastructure, thereby alleviating the pressure on
the public sector for mobilizing financial resources.
4.    Project Descrintion. The proposed Project involves:  (a) the construction
of a 201 m high thin arch double curvature concrete dam and related facilities;
(b) the installation of 510 MW hydroelectric generating capacity comprising three
units of 170 KW each; (c) the construction of 737 km of 154 kV transmission lines



-2
and substations with installed transformer capacity of 1,350 IVA; and
(d) technical assistance for the above.
5.    The Bank funds would be onlent to Vukurova Electric A.S., the beneficiary
and project inplementing entity. The Government of Turkey would charge an
onlending fee equivalent to 0.35 percent per annum on the outstanding amount of
the Bank loan. Qukurova Electric A.S. would bear the foreign exchange risk as
well as the interest risk on the Bank Loan. Retroactire financing of US$20
million would be allowed to cover eligible expenditures and advance payments to
the civil works contractor.
6.    Project Implementation.  VEAS, a regional and private power utility, will
be responsible for implementing the Project. QEAS successfully completed the
Bank financed Sir Hydro Power Project in 1991. Most of the preliminary works are
already completed in the 1989-91 period and the remaining works are expected to
be completed by June 1992. The proposed Project would be commissioned in early
1997. VEAS has appointed Coyne and Bellier, France, as engineering consultants
to assist in the implementation of the Project, including technical supervision
and commissioning.   It is expected that the experience gained from the Sir
Hydropower Project - also with the assistance of Coyne and Bellier - would
contribute to timely implementation of the proposed Project.
7.    Exerience of Ongoing Projects.  Ongoing projects in the power subsector
consist of Power System Operations Assistance Project (Ln. 2602-TU) and TEK
Restructuring Project (Ln. 3345-TU) with TEK; Kayraktepe Hydropower Project
(Ln. 2655-TU) with DSI; and Sir Hydropower Project (Ln. 2750-TU) with gEAS. In
addition, the Energy Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2856-TU) being implemented
addressed several policy and institutional issues across the sector as a whole,
although progress in the power subsector in the area of tariff policy for TEK was
less than planned. PCRs on three Bank financed projects in the power subsector
(Loans 1023-TU, 1844-TU and 2650-TU) noted major problems with regard to TEK's
performance, including, in particular, weak financial management, absence of
strategic corporate planning, lack of autonomy and inadequate tariff levels. TEK
emerged as a major contributor to GOT's PSBR. The Bank was requested to assist
GOT in restructuring TEK. GOT's commitment in this direction has been amply
demonstrated by upfront actions, the most important of which is the monthly
adjustment of electricity tariffs to maintain at no less than US cents 6/kWh.
The corporate restructuring of TEK and the policy reforms for the subsector have
been launched through the TEK Restructuring Project (Ln. 3345-TU) approved in
June 1991. GOT has also initiated actions to commence the Kayraktepe Hydropower
Project. The just completed Sir Hydropower Project was implemented by QEAS,
whose performance has been satisfactory in this and three other past projects.
8.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Bank's involvement would support GOT's
strategy of mobilizing private funds for the power sector. The delays being
experienced in establishing BOT scheme have escalated the pressure on GOT for
ensuring that the proposed Project is implemented without delay. The proposed
Loan would secure resources on terms and conditions suited for long-gestation
investment. Private resources, which would not otherwise be available without
Government guarantee, are to be mobilized by IFC while the Bank would provide the
additional funds needed to meet the foreigr. costs.   Further,  the Bank's
involvement would ensure that environmental and resettlement concerns are
properly addressed.

9.    During negotiations agreement with the GOT was reached to: (a) ensure that
programs for the mitigation of the adverse, and the enhancement of the
beneficial, environmental impact of the Project, as well as for the resettlement
of the affected population will be carried out in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank; (b) maintain the prevailir.g tariff setting system and continue to establish
electricity prices as agreed under the TEK Restructuring Loan; and (c) ensure
that electricity prices including the exchange prices between TEK and VEAS under
the new tariff policy would not adversely affect the financial condition of gEAS.
10.   During negotiations agreement with VEAS was reached to: (a) carry out, in
a manner satisfactory to the Bank, the programs for the mitigation of the
adverse, and the enhancement of the beneficial, environmental impact of the
Project as well as for the resettlement of the affected population; (b) complete,
by December 31, 1992, an environmental revieca of the transmission lines component
of the Project and implement the recommended measures to mitigate environmental
impact in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; (c) carry out a load dispatch center
study by December 31, 1993, under terms-of-reference satisfactory to the Bank,
to determine location, type, size and other specifications for the proposed load
dispatch center; (d) finalize agreements with cofinanciers before June 30, 1993,
to ensure availability of funds; (e) maintain, beginning with 1993, a minimum
debt-service-cover-ratio of 1.2 net of dividends paid; (f) periodically exchange
views with the Bank on the progress of distribution take-over and review the
details of such take-over,including the implications thereof, before finalizing
the agreements to ensure that change in its scope of operations does not affect
the implementation of the proposed Project; and (g) submit to the Bank, beginning
with 1992, its audit reports prepared by private auditors under terms-of-
reference satisfactory to the Bank, within six months after the end of the fiscal
year. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOT and gEAS, on
terms satisfactory to the Bank, is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
Loan.
11.   Dam Safety AsRects.  In accordance with the Bank guidelines for safety of
dams, the project provides for the needed specific safety measures to ensure
safety of the dam, including: (a) engagement by QEAS of a well known
International engineering firm with extensive experience in arch dams for project
engineering and construction supervision; (b) establishment of an independent
panel of International Experts for a comprehensive review of the designs and
advise on the safety aspects; and (c) installation of extensive instrumentation
for dam safety monitoring. Also, DSI would carry out the dam safety inspections
as required by law. DSI as an independent inspection agency would be acceptable
to the Bank.
12.   Environmental AsDects.  The EA identified the impacts to the physical,
geological and socio-economic environment. The consultation process involved a
series of a consultations with national government ministries and agencies as
well as scoping sessions with local government, non-governmental organizations
and affected population. Additional studies were carried out to address the
concerns expressed through the consultations. The overall process has provided
the mit1gation progtam of measures which will be implemented in order to avoid,
or reduce to acceptable levels, the potential adverse environmental impacts of
the project. The monitoring plan, which defines the activities to be undertaken
would be amployed to monitor environmental impact. The main conclusion of the



- 4 -
EA report is that overall long-term environmental impact of the project is
positive.
13.  Benefits and Risks. The measurable benefits attributable to the proposed
Project include incremental generation of electricity along the least-cost path
with no claims on GOT's budget for the domestic financing of the project. An
additional important benefit is the demonstration effect expected to derive from
the success of the expansion of VEAS's scope of activities as an integrated,
privately owned, regional power utility, effectively cooperating with Tr  and DSI
in Turkey's power subsector. The main risks envisaged are the possibility of
cnnstruction delays derived from construction site conditions as well as the size
of the project. This risk is substantially reduced since CEAS has appointed
consultants of proven competence, to assist in design and engineering as well as
implementation.
14.  Recomndation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
