POLICY FOR RESETTLEMENT AND RELIIABILITATION OF
DISPLACED AND AFFECTED PERSONS OF
ffl                           A.P. STATE HIGHWAYS PROJECT
1     INTRODUCTION                                                  -     X
1.1    Andhra Pradesh State FHighways Project (APSHP) is being formulated and posed for
funding to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in various
currencies equivalent to about US$300 million. The main aim of the project is to
improve the performance of the state's road transport network. The project intends to
U14             improve State Highways, road conditions and capacity along witlh development of in-
house capabilities of the Roads and Buildings (R&B) Department to plan, development
and maintain A.P. roads network.
1.2   Based on the results of the strategic option study conducted in 1994 the Government of
flj             A.P. (GOAP) has identified 3178 krns of high priority roads covering 17 districts. Of
thlis, about 1400 km is proposed for improvement with the assistance from the World
Bank. The techno-economic feasibility studies were completed and the roads to be
ID              upgraded were identified. Improvements mostly include strengtheninig and widening the
existing pavement with some minor realignment whiere necessary.
1.3   The main objective of the APSIIP is to improve the performiiance of thle state's road
transport work. Road users, will benefit from the proposed improvemiienit through
23              improved comfort, safety and reduced travel time.
1.4   A significanit short terml economiiic benefit of the pi-oject will be the genel-ation of
|               employment opportunities in tihe constructioni activities. CoiimmuIities aloing the nlew
roads will also benefit from the increased economic activity resultinig from increased
traffic flow. Local communiities wvill have greater access to the public and other transport
facilities.
31 ,,     1.5   Road safety for communities along the upgraded roads will be enhlaniced by the project,
111             including the construction of wider roads to allow separation of slover and faster traffic.
Street lightinig is also to be included in thle project in some urban  areas to improve night
| r          visibility.
I .6  TIhle proposed landscapinig. includinig tree planting and native scedilng, of thle Righlt of
Way (ROW) wlhich will improve thle enviroinmenit in the vicinity of the road, is another
significant benefit of thie pojoect.

3    SCOPE OF LAND ACQUISITION AND DISP'LACEFVMENT
3.1    Most of the road imnprovemiienits are proposed wilihini the Righlt of Way (ROW) and henice
the area of private land to be acquired will be small. However, there are many squatters
living withiin the ROW  and the project may require eviction of some of these squatters
and the removal of encroaciihnents found witilin the limits of constructionl. While many
of the structures found withinl the ROW  are temporary in natul-e and tilerefore could be
pushed back with little disturbanice to the occupant, the project imiay necessitate relocation
of some encroachiers due to the loss of hiousing and/or econiomic activity. Nevertheless,
as the World Bank is likely to fund the project, its policy (O.D.4.30) oln involuntary
Resettlemenit applies to this project.
3.2    World Banki Policy requires that the project affected populationi receive beniefits fi-om the
project. Involuntary resettlemenit, if it becomes unavoidable; silould be an integral part
of the project and should be dealt wvithi from the earliest stages of the project. TI'le policy
furthier emphiasises that involulitary resettlement should be avoidcd or minimiiised where
possible by exoloring alteriiative pro ject designs. Wlhere displacement is uniavoidable tihe
project should assist with mieanis to improve the former living stalidards of those
displaced.
3.3    The State of A.P. hlas experienice of tackling problems of dispklcemicnt arisinig out of
developmenit projects. In thle post independenlt India the first large scale relocationi of the
populationl in A.lP. took plaice wvhcni thle Nagarjunasagar project was colistructed.

5  0  PRINCIPLES IN R&R OF PROJECT AFFEC TEI) IPUsRSONS                                              |
5.1    The overall objective of the R&R policy is to see that those affected by the project are
not worse off and to ensure that the following operational principles will be adopted.
i)    Families losing privately held land and other properties will be entitled to
compensation unlder the Land Acquisition Act. Those adversely affected also be         I
aided in their R&R thirough a package of assistance.
ii)    Families losing access to public land and other properties within the corridor of
impact will be aided in their R&R through a package of assistance.
iii)    A baseline survey will be carried out among the potential PAPs to understand
their socio-economic conditions, types of losses and their impact on their living
standards.
iv)    A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be prepared in close consultation with the
affected families to ensure popular acceptance by them.                               I
v)    Personal attention will be paid to assisting the affected families during their
resettlement. TIhe focus will be on minimising the transition period involved in
resettlement.
vi)    The relocation sites, as far as possible, will be close to the original lhabitation and
support will be provided during the physical movement of the household
belongings and personnel.                                                            I
vii)   Adequate infrastructure and civic amenities will be developed in the resettlement
centres to make the living of those relocated comfortable.
viii)  Focus will be given to the vulnerable sections of the affected community.           |
Specific development programs for these sections of the community will aim at
improving their standard of living rather than maintaining them at current levels.
ix)    For the tribal communities affected, an Indigenous People's Development Plan
(IPDP) will be prepared as per the World Bank O.D.4.20 on "Indigenous People"
focusing on issues relating to tribals and suggesting mitigation measures. The
Plan will take into consideration central and state legislation and related policies.
x)    It is essential that participation of the affected community is ensured at every
stage of the planning, implementing and monitoring of R&R programmes by
effectively using the existing social and cultural institutions.

xi)    Specific arrangements be made to deal with grievances ol tllc al'Pcctd persons.
R&R  and compensation programmes must provide adcliua(c institutional
arrangements to ensureL  ef,fcctive and timely  implcmcn(ation and proper
i, monitoritng.

provided to implement resettlement.
rl .        xiii)  Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimised, where feasible, through
the exploration of all viable project designs.
xvi)   Civilworks will not commence on any section of road before the resettlement and
rehabilitation required on that section has been completed ancl ali compensation
paid.

8      ENTITLEMENTS                          .
From the categories in section 7, it can be seen that there are two main groups of PAPs to be
considered in this policy:
i)     PAPs from whoom private land and structures on1 private land are acquired
ii)    PAPs who are squatting or encroaching in the corridor of impact
The entitlements proposed for each group are as detailed in the following sections. The
entitlements are summarised in Annexure V.                                                           I

i)     The Land Acquisitioni Act (1894) amended in 1984 governs the acquisitioni of           3
land and other immovable properties. It is a Central Act that empowers the
government to acquire compulsorily any land (not owned by it) which is required
for a public purpose.                                                                 I
ii)    All PAP's from whom private land and or structures are acquired are eligible for
compensation in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act. In addition, some
PAP's will be eligible for assistance in relocating to anotlher area, as detailed in
the following sections.
iii)    Where compensation of privately owned lands, trees, structures and othier assets
is paid, it is provided at the prevailing market value.  In addition, a sum            |
equivalent to 30% of the value of compenisation, knowni as "solatiuin", is paid in
consideration of the comipulsory naLtur-e of th1e aclCCUisition. llnterest is paid on tihe
compensation and solatium amount from the date of no lihcatioll of tile land          1
acquisition or the date of taking possession of tlhe land, wlliclhever- is the earliest.
iv)    If there are any disputes relating to the fixation of rates unlider the Land
Acquistion Act the same will be referred to the court for settlemiienit. H-Iowever,
in order to accelerate the process of settlement, the government may constitute      - 3
"Lok Adalat" to take up such disputed cases. This hias already been successfully
tried in AP for the Sriramsag Project.
v)    If thie land acquisition results in a hiolding beinig operationially noll-viable, the
entire holding will be acquired and compenisated accordinlgly. A similar approach
will be adopted for structures affected partially.                                    U

in their own home communities or as close to existing social aand economic networks as
possible. However, if in a resettlement site more than 100 affected families are resettled,
it will be developed as a colony with necessary civic amenities and other infrastructure
facilities (including drinking water, school, approach road, internal roads, etc.)

10    PEOPLES PARTICIPATION
10.1  Project displaced/affected persons will be involved in all stages of the land acquisition
rI            and resettlement activities. Their involvement will be ensured in developing the family
profile. Participatory planning of R&R activities will be necessary in developing a
practical and implementable Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). The project displaced
community will also be consulted by the various project authorities while implementing
the RAP. In addition to building up rapport and close contacts with the PAPs, the
concerned project officials will conduct village level meetings in the project affected
area. The focus of discussions of these meetings will be land acquisition, compensation
rates, resettlement and rehabilitation aspects. These discussions will thus provide a
nj.           forun for PAPs to put forth their problems to the concerned authorities, express opinions
and offer suggestions for better implementation of R&R programmes.
10.2  In addition, meetings would be held with any host communities receiving PAPs. As
almost all are expected to relocate within the same village and at least within the same
district (including those in resettlement colonies), it will be important to involve the
II1           whole village in discussions to inform them and gain their feedback about relocation
plans. This would help ensure their preparedness for possible neighbours and their input
to make for better overall planning.
10.3  In order to organise resettlers and those adversely affected, to educate and motivate them,
to provide group support and to help them to choose any vocation which can be used by
them productively, local active groups will be formed. Such groups will be provided
witlh opportunities to acquire skills in comnmunity organisations and improved productive
I              system. NGOs engaged in the implementation will organise such training programmes
for thie PAPs.
l  l     10.4  By this process, PAI's will be able to choose from R&R alternatives available to them,
thereby ensuring acceptance of R&R measures. Involvement of NGOs will provide
l              valuable assistance and ensure viable community participation.

I02    IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURES
2.1   Development of RAP
A resettlement actiotn plan will be prepared based on thie base line information collected
from the PAPs during the socio-economic survey. Tlhe plan will be prepared in close
consultation with the affected persons and will retlect their preferences for R&R
alternatives. The RAP will also include an implementation schedule broken into specific
activities and co-ordinated with the chronogram of construction.
12.2  Institutional Arrangement
Since the displacement, resettlement and rehabilitation involve a series of formal
I  .    activities starting from the acquisition of land till proper resettlement and rehabilitation
or affected persons, the following organisational set up is envisaged for the
implementation of R&R programmes. Efforts will be made to post such staff who have
concern for the problems of the PAPs and are committed to the task.
At the project level, the Project Director APSHP, will be responsible for implementing
I        R&R programmes. At the district level, an officer of the rank of an Executive Engineer
with the supporting staff will act as District R&R Officer and will be responsible for
3        implementation of resettlement programmes in his jurisdiction. These two Committees
would coordinate their activities to ensure all programmes were implemented as planned.
Detailed Organisational Chart for execution of R&R programmes is given in Annexure-I.
12.3  Involvement of Non-Government Organisations (NGOs)
The resettlement and rehabilitation involve human problems and tackling such problems
require special skill and sociological background on the part of the implementing agency.
I         Besides posting staff who have concem for the problems of those displaced ahd affected,
credible NGOs would be involved in the preparation and implementation of the R & R
fl.       Plans. For this purpose, efforts will be made to identify such organisations who have
*         local presence and are committed and acceptable to the PAPs.
3         NGOs will be chosen by the District Level Committees to participate in the
implemetation of the R&R measures based on the following criteria:
|          -     previous successful involvement in similar capacity in similar projects
-     previous involvement in other projects in the District
-     proven capacity to satisfactorily complete their activities oln time
I          -     adequate professional expertise and financial viability
-     proven commitment to the cause of PAPs represented on previous project

12.4   Monitoring and Evaluation            .                                                     3
Concurrent monitoring will be carried out by a Project Level Monitoring Cell. This will
be created within the R&B Department. This cell will ca-ry out timely monitoring of the
implementation of Resettlement Action Plan. Development of prescribed profromae for
monitoring at different levels and the reports on the progress of R&R activities will formn
the important tasks of this cell. In order to strengthen monitoring of R&R programmes      I
the following committees will be constituted.
Project Level R&R Coiniiittee: This will be headed by the Pl-ilncipal Secretary, R&B
Department. The committee will be responsible to approve plans and monitor
implementation of Resettlement Plans. It will advise project level staff on various
aspects of the programmes to make implementation more effective. TIhe composition of
the committee and its functions are given in Annexure II.
District Level R&R Committee: A district committee will be constituted under the
chairmnanship of the District Collector mainly to coordinate among various line
departments involved in R&R activities within a district. The commilittee will also
monitor the implementation of R&R programmes. It will also have representatives of the
PAPs and the NGO, to help in bringing the programmes faced by the l'APs to the notice
of the concerned agenicies for redressal and follow Up actioIn. The comlipositioln anld 
functions of the committee are given in Annexure 111.
Impact evaluation of the implementation of R&R programmes by an independent agency
not associated with the project execution will be taken up two times during the project
period. The first evaluation will be after the half way period of execution and the final
evaluation will be after completion of the project period.
12.5   Grievanice Redressal Mcchanisimi
Grievance Redressal Committee will be constituted at district level. It will include
representatives from the project, land acquisition agencies, rur-al developmenit agencies,
local bodies, NGOs and other concerned agencies. It will also have representatives from
the affected persons. The Committee will take care of not only the grievance issues of
land acquisition but also grievance matters relating to provisions and entitlements for
resettlement and rehabilitation under the project which go beyond thle LA Act. This is
particularly important for the project where an overwhelming majority of those affected
by the project are encroaclhers/squatters. As inidicated in the institutionial arranigement,
the Land Acquisition Officer shall be the first agency to attend to grievanles in respect
to land valuation and acquisition. Similarly, the Project Director of the District Rural
Development Agency and District Level Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officer will be
the first Level Redressal Mechanism for redressing grievances of the displaced
persons/project affected persons. A detailed Flow Diagram is given indicatilng the levels
of grievance redressal mechanism and the alternative courses ol action lor the displaced
persons/project affected persons for the redressal of their grievanmcs (Annexure IV).
