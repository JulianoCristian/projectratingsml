provide a\n            part of MIDB's foreign exchange requirements over about\n            two years. Besides supporting MIDB in promoting and\n            financing medium and larger industries in the private sector\n            in Egypt, which has received renewed Government support\n            recently, it will support in particular industries in three\n            sectors which have been identified as priorities for growth\n            in the Egyptian economy: a minimum of 25 percent of loan\n            proceeds would be allocated each for building materials and\n            construction/contracting industries; capital goods\n            industries; and export oriented industries. During the\n            commitment period, MIDB's institutional framework would\n            be further strengthened to provide assistance to industrial\n            enterprises in the private sector. The risks are associated\n            with the possible failure of MIDB to fully utilize the funds\n            allocated for capital goods and export oriented projects,\n            although diligent promotion should enable MIDB to meet the\n            target allocation."}, "docdt": "1980-04-30T00:00:00Z"}
