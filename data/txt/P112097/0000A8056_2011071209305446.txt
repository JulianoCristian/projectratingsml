                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the last ISR of December 2010, the project's overall status has improved significantly. The long-delayed Technical Implementation Support Consultancy (TISC) was finally
                         mobilized and all three key long-term staff of the consultancy, i.e. Team Leader, Civil Engineer and Procurement and Contract Management Specialist have been fielded and begun
                         their work in Kabul since March 1, 2011. In addition, one short-term specialist on river basin modeling has also been fielded to support the preparation of the consultancy's Inception
                         Report. In order to further strengthen the management of the project, the Deputy Minister (Water) has appointed the General Director of Planning to be the Project Director.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The closing date of the project has been extended to March 31, 2013 to allow time to complete project activities which were delayed due to issues in recruiting the Technical and
                         Implementation Support Consultancy (TISC).
