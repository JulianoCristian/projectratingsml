                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR is a desk review to confirm the final ratings of the project at closure. The rating for the PDO at closure is Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) to reflect partial completion of
                         planned activities, despite the extension of the project by two years. Also, asconcluded already by the last implementation support mission of December 2012 and given significant
                         shortcomings of the technical implementation support consultancy (TISC) activities for the entire project duration, the overall Implementation Progress is Moderately Unsatisfactory
                         (MU).
