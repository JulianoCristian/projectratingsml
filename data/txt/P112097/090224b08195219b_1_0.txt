                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The mission fielded in December 2012 has concluded that achievement of PDO is likely and has therefore maintained the PDO rating to Moderately Satisfactory (MS). However,
                         during the review period, the performance of TISC has deteriorated especially in basin planning activities. Given some of the significant shortcomings, the mission rated overall
                         implementation progress as Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU).
