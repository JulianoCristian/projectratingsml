improve and strengthen the agricultural base\n            of the rural population who form the majority of East Timor.\n            Among the project components, the Pilot Participatory\n            Development and Natural Resources Management component\n            involves activities which are small in scale, and therefore\n            the environmental impact in the short term is not expected\n            to be significant. The Rapid Infrastructure Rehabilitation\n            component will support community irrigation rehabilitation.\n            Such activity may generate dust, local turbidity of\n            watercourses, and localized downstream erosion arising from\n            river diversion. Also under this component, civil work\n            activities will be employed in the rehabilitation of a total\n            of 7 medium-scale irrigation schemes. The works will include\n            the rehabilitation of main structures and canals, as well as\n            secondary and tertiary canals that would provide irrigation\n            to an estimated 1,500 hectares. The highest rating for the\n            potential environmental impact of the irrigation scheme\n            rehabilitation is moderate in intensity and medium-term in\n            persistence, and the impacts occur mainly during the\n            construction phase of the activity. The operational phase of\n            the irrigation scheme is not expected to produce significant\n            negative environmental impact. The rest of the project\n            components will involve no significant environmental impacts."}, "docdt": "2001-07-26T00:00:00Z"}
