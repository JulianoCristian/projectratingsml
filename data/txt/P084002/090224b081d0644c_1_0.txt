                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic infrastructure and services,
                         including water supply. To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools
                         and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the
                         public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project has made some progress towards achieving its development objectives. As of June 15, 2013, 200,000 additional people living in low-income settlements, representing
                         50% of the end-of-project target, have benefited from basic infrastructure and services, including water supply.

                         The first phase of infrastructure works in low-income settlements have been completed in the cities of Yaoundé, Douala, Bamenda, Mbalmayo and Maroua, and the procurement
                         processes for the additional activities is completed, and all the contracts are ready to be launched, subject to the Government signing of the pending compensation decrees.
                         With regard to the water component, while the project contributed to increase access to piped water for about 70,000 households, its implementation is slowed down by the financial
                         disequilibrium of the sector due mainly to delays in the Government’s payments of the contributions and the public agencies’ water bills, limiting Camwater's investment capacity, and

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         There is a need (i) to restore the financial equilibrium of the water sector; (ii) to accelerate the procurement process of the water component of the project; and (iii) to finalize the
                         compensation process of the project affected people before start of civil works under the urban component.
