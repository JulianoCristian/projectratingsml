F. Results Framework Analysis


Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
(Loan Agreement) The objective of the project is to increase access of the urban population,
particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic infrastructure and services,
including water supply.

(Details added in the PAD) To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various
stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools and
investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as
                                                iii
possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the public-private partnership
in the provision of urban water services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      In 2006, Cameroon was still recovering from the late 1980s structural adjustment
period and from a challenging economic and social climate. The economy was slowly
returning to a steady growth path (3.3 percent per year); poverty was declining although
remaining widespread with 40 percent of the population living below the poverty line of
US$1 per day. Social indicators, including health and water supply, were lagging and the
country was off-track in meeting most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.     To address needed reforms and to reach the MDGs, the Government of Cameroon
(GoC) focused its first poverty reduction strategy (PRS), adopted in 2003, on improved
basic service delivery and on private sector driven growth. It initiated participatory
consultations and pursued data collection and analysis on poverty. It introduced new
regulatory frameworks to enhance business environments in the electricity,
telecommunications, transport and water sectors. Such structural reforms led to the
completion point of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative in 2006.
3.      Rapid urbanization, coupled with years of economic crisis and lack of investment
in infrastructure, had brought major challenges to growing cities, primarily Yaoundé and
Douala. Despite a decline in urban poverty, informal low-income settlements spread in
urban areas, covering up to half of the capital cities’ areas and totaling two-thirds of their
population. Some areas were isolated due to a lack of access roads and were plagued by
unemployment and insecurity. People had little or no access to basic services (water,
sanitation, drainage, etc.). Given the economic role of cities, the PRS outlined the need for
a strategy of urban poverty reduction. In 2004, decentralization laws were enacted with the
intent to foster local participatory planning and better service delivery to communities.
4.      In the 2000s, less than half of the population had access to safe water: the PRS
noted that the issue was key to achieving poverty reduction and growth. A Rural Hydraulic
Program was designed to drastically increase access rate in rural areas, which then was
below 30 percent. Water supply in urban areas was in a dire situation after 20 years of poor
performance and weak governance on the part of the national water corporation SNEC
(Société Nationale des Eaux du Cameroun). Due to lack of maintenance and fast growing
demand, supply was unreliable and water was of poor quality. In 2006, only 25 percent of
the urban population had access to piped water through private connections. Following the
failed attempt to establish a concession contract with a private partner in the early 2000s,
GoC decided to divest the SNEC. A presidential decree in late 2005 outlined a new Public
Private Partnership (PPP) model supporting the urban water reform that involved a public
asset-holding company and private operators to manage water supply services.
5.      Rationale for Bank intervention. The proposed operation built on ongoing
operations and financing opportunities created by debt relief initiatives. The Fiscal Year
(FY) 04-06 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was fully aligned with the PRS goals to
support basic service delivery and private sector-led growth: it aimed, among other
objectives, to test models for improving service delivery in urban centers, and to improve




                                              1
access to water in selected urban communities. In the urban sector, a Bank review 1
highlighted the need for capacity building and institutional support for decentralized
authorities, and potential to complement the IDA-funded Douala Infrastructure Project
(DIP) that piloted urban strategies and infrastructure works in slums, to learn from
participatory approaches promoted in the Community Development Program Support
Project (CDPSP), and to coordinate with other development partners.2
6.      On the water side, the divestiture of SNEC was part of the IDA-funded Public
Private Partnership for Growth and Poverty Reduction Project (PPPGPRP), in effect since
2000, which targeted other sector reforms to enhance competitiveness and growth.
Building on the Bank experience in water PPPs in West and Central Africa, this project
financed preparatory studies and a transaction officer to set up a series of contracting
agreements, including a lease contract with a private service operator, to support the water
PPP (see Box 1).3 Several donors, including the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the
French Development Agency (AFD), were interested in coordinated support to the PPP to
restore and expand good quality water services in urban and semi-urban centers.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
7.      As stated in the Loan Agreement, the objective of the project was to increase access
of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic
infrastructure and services, including water supply.4 The project outcome indicators were
the additional population benefiting from: (i) all-year access to transportation and improved
sanitary conditions; and (ii) access to safe water services in the targeted areas.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
8.      The PDO was not revised. Outcome indicators were later revised to align with the
Bank’s core sector indicators to measure the number of (i) people in urban areas provided
with access to all-season roads within a 500 meter range under the project, (ii) people
benefiting from appropriate drainage, (iii) people in project areas with access to improved
water sources, and (iv) direct project beneficiaries, of which female (see ICR datasheet).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
9.      The project targeted: (i) the population of the cities of Douala, Yaoundé, Bamenda,
Maroua, and Mbalmayo, particularly those living in low-income settlements benefiting
from infrastructure upgrading; and more broadly, (ii) the urban population to be serviced
by the private operator in the water PPP area, especially poor households without access to
piped water through private or collective connections.

  The Project Development Document (PAD) added: “To achieve this, the project will (i) assist the various
stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools and investments designed
to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate
the implementation of the public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.”


                                                       2
10.     The project also included a large capacity-building program, targeting (i) local
authorities and staff in the beneficiary cities, (ii) local community groups, social focal
points and small enterprises, (iii) central agencies and their decentralized bodies in charge
of urban development, and (iv) the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) and the Cameroon
Water Utilities Corporation (Camwater) as implementing agencies.

1.5 Original Components
11.      Component 1: Capacity building and support to decentralization (US$4.00 M).
This component was designed to strengthen urban management capacity to plan,
implement, and maintain the delivery of infrastructure and urban services, primarily in the
cities of Bamenda, Douala, Maroua, Mbalmayo, and Yaounde. Activities included capacity
building, the completion of a national urban strategy, and the development of management
tools and planning instruments (national urban database, city development contracts, etc.).
12.     Component 2: Infrastructure works in low-income settlements (US$40.45 M). To
increase access to basic services in low-income settlements of the five target cities, this
component was designed to finance small infrastructure works (primarily roads and
drainage systems) and upgrading of social facilities (such as classrooms) selected through
participatory diagnostics. Local governments would progressively take over financial
management and procurement of such sub-projects.
13.      Component 3: Support to the implementation of the public-private partnership in
the provision of urban water services (US$33.00 M). This component was designed to (i)
provide Camwater with capacity building and technical assistance (TA) to manage the PPP,
(ii) fund priority rehabilitation of production and distribution facilities in Douala, Yaoundé,
and secondary centers, and (iii) promote access of the poor to piped water through the
following: (a) the construction of standposts and a social connections program, funded
through IDA, an expected US$10 million (M) grant from the Global Partnership for Output
Based Aid (GPOBA), and US$2 M from Camwater, and (b) the expansion of tertiary
networks. As per the Financing, Project and Subsidiary Agreements, Camwater would
implement this component (see Box 1 below on the PPP design).
14.     Component 4: Project management (US$2.55 M). This component provided
funding for the efficient management of the project, including PCU staff and operating
costs, monitoring and evaluation, information and communication, and costs of technical
and financial audits.

1.6 Revised Components
15.    The content of the original components was not revised. However, their allocated
budget changed with the Additional Financing (AF) granted in 2010 (see section 1.7).

1.7 Other significant changes
16.     Additional Financing. AF of US$28.70 M to the initial IDA credit of US$80.00 M
was approved in September 2010. The rationale was threefold: (i) to scale-up activities to
enhance the project development impact (50 percent of funds for urban infrastructure and
services); (ii) to close the financing gap (see Box 1) of the urban water investment plan
(40 percent); and (iii) to cover cost overruns of TA activities to Camwater, and to support
project management for an extended project duration (see section 2.2).

                                              3
17.     Funds Cancellation. Due to important delays, GoC and the Bank agreed to cancel
activities that could not be completed in due time and to refocus the project on selected
high-impact activities. In March 2014, US$16.8 M of project proceeds were cancelled,
mostly under the water component.
18.    Extension of closing date. The project was designed for a duration of five years, but
was restructured to provide sufficient time to implement the AF activities, and to achieve
the PDO. The closing date was extended by two years, from August 31, 2012, to August
31, 2014. Together with the partial cancellation of funds, the decision to pursue the
achievement of two strategic contracts under the water component translated into a second
extension of the project closing date up to August 31, 2015.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
19.     Bank experience from other operations influenced the proposed design. The initial
concept was focused on urban development. It built on the 2004 urban sector review, on
early lessons from the PID, and to a lesser extent on the CDPSP. It then focused on the


                                             4
sector governance and cities’ capacities to plan, deliver, and maintain social infrastructure
and services. Participatory planning would be key in scaling-up projects in poor settlements
by means of direct, small-scale interventions. Budget support and sector-wide approaches
were therefore discarded as potential alternatives for the project. Bank experience in the
region (Senegal, Niger) was later utilized to support the water PPP. A lesson learned was
that providing IDA investment financing was instrumental to influence the sector dialog,
and to also be in a position to monitor the execution of related contracts. As a result, the
project financing would be through regular investment lending, rather than through support
the ongoing IDA-funded Privatization Project (PPPGPRG). This third component was
fine-tuned in 2006, taking advantage of other donors’ interest in the PPP.
20.     Project preparation spanned over more than two years. It took 18 months between
the concept review meeting in December 2005 and Board approval in May 2007.
Preparation funds granted in April 2006 mostly benefited the urban components, including
the municipal financial assessments and scoping studies. As in typical urban framework
projects, sites and infrastructure would be selected later with beneficiaries. As a result,
detailed studies and environmental and social screenings could not be carried out during
preparation, and the ex-ante economic analysis was limited to a portion of road to be
constructed in Yaoundé. For the water component, the PPPGPRP funded transaction
advisory services to set up contracting agreements and an investment plan for the sector.
The latter provided data supporting the economic analysis at PPP level, which included
support from several financiers, including IDA. A GPOBA grant was requested to leverage
IDA support for increased water access.
21.     The PDO was consistent with proposed components and reflected strategic design
features. Key themes included a focus on cities, under pressure from increased demand for
infrastructure and services, and poverty targeting through participatory approaches in low-
income settlements and subsidized access to water. The components supported the
achievement of the PDO, through: (i) small-scale infrastructure in slums, (ii) the provision
of improved water services through the water PPP, and (iii) an important capacity-building
program aimed at sustaining access to targeted infrastructure and services. Key outcomes
indicators identified expected improvements in terms of access to urban roads, drainage,
and water supply.
22.      The multi-sectoral design involved complex implementation arrangements and
institutional challenges. In addition to overall project management, the PCU would
implement component 1, and would support municipalities to progressively take over the
implementation of component 2. The PCU was established within the Ministry of Housing
and Urban Development (MINHDU), and would have to deal with other agencies in charge
of decentralization and local governments. It would also coordinate with Camwater,
responsible for component 35 and a key stakeholder within the PPP architecture. PDUE
water activities were partly interrelated with those from other financiers, and therefore
depended on the smooth and timely implementation of the PPP.




5
 Component 3 included dedicated funds and covenants under the legal Agreements. The GPOBA sub-project
was also embedded in component 3. For details, see the GPOBA ICR (2014).


                                                 5
23.      The project risk was rated high, even with the proposed mitigation measures. At
PDO level, the risk of low Government support for decentralization and PPP reforms would
be mitigated by (i) the cautious approach to deploy the urban strategy through “city
development contracts”, and (ii) other donors’ support for the PPP. To prevent sector and
operational risks, extensive training and capacity building would address low institutional
(central level) and technical (local level) capacities of urban stakeholders. A Bank
assessment confirmed that the PCU and Camwater had adequate financial management
capacities to handle the project. Transfer of fiduciary responsibilities to municipalities
would be progressive and would include support to local small enterprises, boosting
infrastructure works. Technical assistance from the PPP auditors and other African water
utilities would strengthen Camwater’s capacities to manage the PPP. Improved services
and pro-poor measures to expand access would overcome resistance to tariff increases.
Settling arrears by public customers would limit the financial risk of the private operator
and help sustain the sector equilibrium.

2.2 Implementation
24.     The project, known as PDUE (projet de développement des secteurs urbain et de
l’eau), had some periods of difficulties in implementation, but ended up performing
reasonably well. Project implementation spanned over 88 months instead of the original
timeframe of 60 months. It disbursed XDR60.3 M (98 percent) of the revised allocation of
XDR61.3 M resulting from additional funding that was partially cancelled at a later date.
Rated as satisfactory (S) until mid-2013, the project was then downgraded to moderately
unsatisfactory (MU) due to delays that put the achievement of the PDO at risk. After funds
were cancelled, and until project closing, the PDO was rated moderately satisfactory (MS).
Implementation progress and several dimensions or components received temporary
negative ratings aimed to prompt action and draw management attention. At closing, the
PDO was achieved, despite contrasted results (see section 3.2).
25.     The project started slowly while piloting innovative approaches. It became
effective in April 2008, 11 months after approval, and the disbursement condition for water
was met in February 2009. The urban training program started up after completion of the
municipal, administrative, and financial audits that year. Most of component 2 works were
underway, despite late engineering studies and slow procurement processes. Participation
of local stakeholders in selecting priority infrastructure and services, labor-intensive works,
and simple technologies proved adequate to respond to the needs of informal
neighborhoods. This triggered, in mid-2009, a Government request to scale-up the project
in other settlements. Under component 3, the private operator Camerounaise des Eaux
(CDE) launched the social connections campaign subsidized by GPOBA and sold 4,000
connections in 2009. But, as reported in the GPOBA ICR, CDE could not meet all demands
due to the lack of tertiary networks in targeted areas, and Camwater had limited ability to
invest without the GoC financial support. By the end of 2009, disbursements stood at
9 percent, and components 2 and 3 were rated MU. A quality assessment review of the
project (2007-2009 period), completed in early 2010, also rated implementation progress
as MU (Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio, QALP-2).
26.   Additional financing of one-third the amount of the initial credit was approved in
September 2010. The AF benefited from the new IDA16 Crisis Response Window (CRW)


                                              6
to assist low-income countries in coping with the global economic crisis. The rationale for
using CRW funds was to upgrade living conditions for the urban poor, to provide job
opportunities, and to expand access to basic infrastructure. The disbursement rate had
progressed, but risks remained rated as high. To allow the full implementation of activities
and disbursement of proceeds, the closing date was extended by 24 months.
27.     The AF successfully scaled up development impacts in urban poor settlements. The
additional funds enabled the project to provide more social infrastructure and to strengthen
maintenance of works in municipal budget planning and management trainings. Outputs
for road and drainage were increased, leading to highly satisfactory outcomes (see section
3.2). Such results benefited considerably from community participation and social
intermediation of local development committees involved in maintaining works. Initial
audits had over-estimated municipal fiduciary capacities, but over time, municipalities
gained new skills in recruiting municipal engineers who were involved in procurement
commissions. Capacity-building activities continued until completion; the PCU
completion report noted that institutional strengthening could have benefited from more
coordination with central entities in charge of decentralization.
28.     The PCU managed to overcome issues that affected the implementation of the
urban components. Implementation of social safeguards, in particular, proved difficult in
densely populated areas (see section 2.4). This delayed some works contracts in Phase 2
(2012-2015), which were only completed in the last months of the project. The PCU was
not well equipped to deal with this unanticipated problem of compensation, from
documenting cases and transactions to mobilizing funds from municipalities and GoC, and
it also did not have control over lengthy national procedures required to assess and pay
compensation to affected people. In total, despite staff turnover, the PCU successfully
handled numerous contracts and dealt with recurring issues with small firms that had only
limited procurement and financial management capacities. It provided intensive support to
municipalities, and spent considerable energy to complete the payment of compensations,
although these could not be fully settled before the project closed.
29.     The remainder of the CRW AF was intended to boost the water PPP. Investments
from various financiers in production and distribution capacities and GoC subsidies to
Camwater took time to materialize. This financing gap (see Box 1) hampered the execution
of IDA-funded rehabilitation works and GPOBA-funded social connections sub-program.6
Water shortages and poor service were critical for existing customers, and limited the
private operator’s capacity to sell more connections. Addressing an emergency situation,
the AF would finance needed rehabilitation of water production facilities in Douala and
Yaoundé; supply of production and distribution meters; and tertiary networks to speed up
new connections’ rates, particularly in poor neighborhoods far from existing networks.
30.     The Mid-Term Review (MTR) in March 2012 considered that the PDO was
achievable, but raised flags on counterpart funding related to the PPP situation, and on
procurement. It reported that the implementation of the ambitious PPP rehabilitation
program suffered from the continuous deterioration of the sector’s financial situation. Since
2010, the Bank and other donors urged the Government to pay crucially needed investment


6
    The approved GPOBA grant itself was lower than expected in the PDUE financing plan; see Annex 1.


                                                    7
subsidies to Camwater and expressed their concerns about the situation. Delays affected
investments, which further disrupted the overall financial mechanisms supporting the PPP
(see Box 1). Partners, through the Steering Committee, agreed in 2011 that the financial
equilibrium was broken. 7 In addition, the creation of the new Ministry of Public
Procurement in 2012 affected progress of the PDUE and other projects (see section 2.4).
31.      A partial cancellation of funds helped refocus the water component on achievable
activities. By the end of 2013, after the mixed results of the GPOBA social connections
sub-project (see GPOBA ICR), two-thirds of IDA allocations for Camwater were not yet
committed (~US$30 M). This triggered the decision to cancel US$16.8 M or 57 percent of
the AF, mostly for water investments, including rehabilitation works that had been included
in the AF, and the construction of 1,200 standpipes. During negotiations in March 2014
however, at the Water Minister’s request, two high-impact activities were maintained—
additional tertiary network extensions, and IDA-funded social connections—and a one-
year extension was granted to execute them. At completion, the two contracts were fully
executed, as were all other project activities. At sector level, the financial situation
remained an issue, despite debt swap agreements between GoC, Camwater and CDE. An
action plan requested by donors was agreed upon in the summer of 2014 but was suspended
soon thereafter when the Government decided to assess the PPP (see section 2.5).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.    M&E design. The PCU was responsible for overall consolidation and reporting. It
would collect data related to the urban components, including from technical audits and
municipal budgets. Camwater would report on water indicators, some of them to be
produced by the private operator or the water ministry, with the assistance of the PPP
technical auditors. Fiduciary performance would also be monitored. The results framework
(RF) was consistent with the PDO, despite weaknesses for some baseline/target estimates;
some baselines would need to be fine-tuned once detailed studies would be completed.
33.     M&E implementation. The PCU developed a dashboard to monitor progress of the
different outputs in each target city, building on regular field visits, contracts’ and audits’
data. The M&E expert consolidated a methodology taking into account the specifics of
investments in roads and drainage to measure the number of beneficiaries. The PCU also
produced documentaries to visually demonstrate the impact of the project on upgrading
low-income settlements and on beneficiary satisfaction. At completion, it noted that data
on municipal budgets still needed to be improved to better track maintenance allocations,
a key indicator for municipalities. On the other hand, relevant data were regularly provided
by CDE and the auditors, but some of the project indicators would have deserved clearer
definitions, as some measured activities directly supported by project funds, while others
referred to the overall progress in the PPP area (all sources of funding). This made it more
difficult to assess achievements in water, and the extent to which the project contributed to


7
  The PPP financial model developed with IDA funding was first presented in 2010. In this preliminary
assessment, the financial situation of Camwater was considered balanced. But the model was not yet fully
operational, and needed to be updated with the 2009 balance sheet data, and with revised assumptions on
investments and demand. In 2012, AFD suspended its non-sovereign loan to Camwater and restructured it as
a sovereign loan to minimize risk and alleviate Camwater debt service.


                                                   8
the PPP, in terms of beneficiaries or operational and financial performance. For instance,
while the indicators on reduced public consumption and on the sector equilibrium were
crucial for the sector, they did not directly result from project activities such as developing
the financial model or providing technical assistance to Camwater (see section 3.2).
34.      M&E utilization. The PCU submitted regular progress reports documenting
activities and results. The PCU also prepared a detailed mid-term report (2012) that made
useful recommendations for the second phase of urban activities, and provided a candid
assessment of the project performance at completion, including lessons learned and
proposals for a potential follow-up operation (see Annex 7). Reporting on fiduciary aspects
improved over time (see section 2.4), but the lack of a tool to easily consolidate project
financial data contributed to delays and the PCU underscored this lesson to improve
efficiency in future operations. Similarly, a tool to monitor safeguards and compensations
would have helped keep track of transactions, and mitigate potential complaints. Overall,
the M&E system would have benefited from stronger coordination between the PCU and
Camwater, to ensure shared understanding of the objectives, consistency of data and
enhanced ownership. This could have triggered a restructuring of the RF to better capture
the project accomplishments at completion.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards compliance
35.    The project was approved as a Category B, with limited adverse environmental and
social impacts linked to civil works for urban infrastructure under Component B.
Operational Policy and Bank Procedure (OP-BP) 4.01 and OP-BP 4.12 were triggered.
36.     OP-BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. A satisfactory Environmental and
Social Management Framework (ESMF) was published in 2006 and was duly updated
before the AF to reflect new requirements on environmental license under the national
environmental regulation. Implementation was rated S until AF, then MS. The PCU then
recruited a permanent environmental and social specialist to further streamline
environmental and social requirements, from public consultations to capacity building for
contractors and local authorities, coordination with the ministry of environment for the
environmental screenings, and better documentation of related processes.
37.     OP-BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. Consistently with the framework
approach of the urban components, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared
and published during preparation. Compliance was downgraded during AF appraisal: the
PCU had duly updated the RPF, but not prepared standalone Resettlement Action Plans
(RAPs) in areas where infrastructure works had affected fractions of urban plots. In
practice though, as noted in supervision reports, the PCU had complied with the policy’s
requirements through consultations on the project’ benefits. In many cases, affected owners
agreed to formally transfer land to the public domain without financial compensation,
resulting in a significant gain of time to advance works. Other families were compensated
for damages incurred. The PCU was urged to fully document these transactions, maintain
extreme vigilance over safeguard compliance, and secure sufficient counterpart funding
for compensations. Completion of Phase 1 infrastructure works then followed a procedure
acceptable to the Bank: works could continue should compensations be paid.


                                              9
38.      Given delays in providing compensations, OP 4.12 was enforced more strictly for
Phase 2: works were not allowed to start before people affected by the project (PAPs)
received due compensation. The project only partially complied with this policy (MU
rating in early 2014 and at closing), due to delays that were beyond its control. Indeed, the
institutional framework governing land acquisition and compensation involved several
administrative steps, including a Presidential Decree clearing the list of PAPs that could
take months to be issued. RAPs for Phase 2 were approved by the end of 2014. Several
decrees—including those incorporating PAPs omitted in initial assessments—were
prepared and filed for legal clearance. Counterpart funding was secured to allow the PCU,
directly or through the concerned municipalities, to pay compensations to the 585 people
affected by PDUE. In total, 88 percent of the PAPs were compensated as of January 31,
2016 (a drastic increase from 51 percent at closing on August 31, 2015), for a total of
CFAF 401 M, or 88 percent of the total amount due (see section 2.5).
Fiduciary Compliance
39.     Procurement. Both the PCU and Camwater performed procurement activities in
accordance with Bank standards, despite delays in the first years. At MTR, transfer to
municipalities of the procurement role for component 2 works was considered acceptable
by the Bank, given the skills that had been built throughout the project and continued PCU
support. From mid-2012, however, the rating was downgraded to MU during three
semesters. In addition to changes of both the PCU’s and Camwater’s procurement
specialists at that time, the creation of the new Ministry of Public Procurement further
disturbed procurement processes. While the special commission in place for the urban
components was maintained, Camwater faced conflicting requirements between
procurement arrangements established in loan agreements, and those promoted by the new
ministry. In December 2013, eight months before expected closing, US$20 M of contracts
were ready to start for the urban components, while the water component had a backlog of
over US$30 M of contracts at different stages of procurement. This triggered a highly
unsatisfactory rating and the partial cancellation of funds. At closing however, both
implementing agencies had successfully handled a large number of contractors and contract
amendments, contributing to the PDO achievement.
40.     Financial management (FM). FM performance was rated S and MS until 2012.
Although there were no major deviations from the FM policy, supervision reports noted
important payment delays due to dealing with many small enterprises lacking experience
with administrative and tax requirements. Close FM supervision helped resolve these
issues. From the end of 2012, FM performance was downgraded to MU during three
semesters, and risk was upgraded to substantial. The new PCU accountant had to overcome
weaknesses in accounting practices and budget planning, including counterpart funding to
support the PCU. A new, inexperienced financial team took over during a sensitive
managerial transition period at Camwater. Interim financial audits were submitted with
delays in the initial years, but practices improved over time. While the qualification of the
2008 financial audit was quickly cleared, subsequent audits carried out recommendations
to improve internal control and financial consolidation. The final financial statements and
audit reports were expected at the end of February 2016.
41.    Disbursement. After a slow start and the difficult years of 2012-2013,
disbursements reached 94.6 percent of the allocated credits (including additional and

                                             10
cancelled funds) at project closing on August 31, 2015. They increased to 98.28 percent,
or US$90.02 M equivalent (XDR60.3 M) when the credits closed on December 31, 2015,
after the grace period. Despite delays in submitting disbursement requests, including during
the grace period, the urban components slightly over-disbursed, using uncommitted funds
of the water component. The definitions of the disbursing categories, which differed
between the initial and additional credits and did not overlap with the project components,
sometimes created budgeting and reporting issues.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
42.     On the urban side, the PCU has been maintained within MINHDU. Full payment
of outstanding compensations to affected people remains of utmost importance. Payments
have markedly progressed since the closing date (see section 2.4), but two for Yaoundé
were still awaiting the presidential clearance at the time of this report. Other post-
completion activities include minor but strategic activities that were not fully completed at
PDUE closing, such as dissemination of the national urban strategy. The PCU was also
mandated to prepare a new operation, building on lessons learned during PDUE, scaling-
up its successful approach to slum upgrading, and further strengthening municipal
capacities for urban management. The Bank expressed its interest in supporting this
operation on “Inclusive Cities”, with the condition to fully resolve PDUE compensation
legacy before Board approval (see section 2.4).
43.    On the water side, committed works and studies were fully completed at closing.
Camwater will launch a bid based on detailed feasibility studies funded by the project to
build 200 standpipes. The Government’s ongoing assessment of the PPP performance, and
Camwater’s draft investment plan for the next 25 years will guide strategic decisions on
the shaping of the urban water sector in coming years.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives: Substantial
44.     The project objective remained relevant in the context of rapid urbanization and
demand for social infrastructure and services, including water supply. It was aligned with
both the Government’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2009) and its Growth
and Employment Strategy (2010) that aimed to transform Cameroon into an upper-middle
income country, boost growth, and reduce poverty. The PDO also contributed8 to Pillar 2,
Outcome 9 of the 2010-2013 CAS, later extended until 2015, that targeted improved access
to basic infrastructure, including transportation, sanitary conditions (drainage) and water
supply in targeted urban areas. The ongoing Systematic Country Diagnostic for Cameroon9
recognized the low quality of service delivery and access to water as constraints to poverty

Relevance of Design and Implementation: Substantial
45.     The logical framework was consistent with the PDO. Working across various
interrelated policy areas made sense in the context of urbanization growth and lagging
investments to support poor urban dwellers, even though it involved institutional and
coordinated challenges. Key selected areas (roads, drainage, water) as well as institutional
strengthening indicators were captured in the RF, despite weaknesses for some
baseline/target estimates.
46.      The project design adequately balanced infrastructure development and
institutional strengthening to address sector reforms together with tangible progress in
service delivery and living conditions of the urban poor. Lessons learned from earlier
operations were useful to design the project scope and key features to support the PDO,
including: (i) a shift from traditional approaches to slum upgrading, based on participatory
decisions on priority infrastructure and services, small-scale, labor-intensive works with
quick and high- impact results, (ii) empowerment of the municipalities to progressively
take over responsibilities in planning and managing contracts on their own territory, (iii) a
focus on maintenance, involving more municipal financing and contractual arrangements
with local communities, (iv) a comprehensive capacity-building program to strengthen
urban stakeholders, from central to local levels.
47.     For water, the overall PPP structure provided (i) contractual incentives to improve
operational and financial performance, (ii) pro-poor measures, and (iii) financial
mechanisms that were intended to secure the sector viability. The PDUE supported these
features in, among others: (a) allowing direct contracting with the private operator for some
of the works contracts, (b) supporting the implementation of the GPOBA program of
subsidized connections in addition to IDA-funded the social connections, (c) coordinating
with other donors to help Camwater develop regulatory tools such as the financial model
and the tariff study, and strengthening its capacity as asset-holding company.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
48.     The PDO was substantially achieved. The project performed extremely well in
increasing access to urban roads (high) and to drainage infrastructure (high), while access
to water supply services (modest) increased at a more moderate pace (see Annex 2).
49.     Over 435,000 people were provided with all-year access to urban roads in targeted
settlements (achievement: 113 percent; rating: high). The project funded a total of 63.2
kilometers (km) of urban roads (achievement: 167 percent). Trunk roads connecting the
areas with other areas of the cities (voies structurantes) facilitated, among others, mobility
and better access to economic and job opportunities, with public transportation and other
means within a 500-meter reach. Proximity roads and streets within the areas (desserte de
proximité) enhanced access to schools, markets, offices and small businesses and
dramatically reduced hardship of walking, as they came with other small works like
footbridges and pedestrian paths.
50.    Over 565,000 people benefited from appropriate drainage in low-income
settlements (achievement: 149 percent; rating: high). The project funded 108.5 km of
new and rehabilitated drainage mains (achievement: 235 percent). Identified by
communities as priorities, such works helped address poor sanitary conditions, due to


                                             12
stagnating water, oftentimes mixed with uncollected garbage and, in case of low water
tables, possible overflows of domestic latrines. These investments also mitigated the
impact of frequent floods, a major issue in Cameroonian cities, particularly in informal
settlements. In Douala and Yaoundé, works were coordinated with other partners to
optimize water runoffs towards larger canals.
51.      In addition, the project provided other small infrastructure and services
contributing to slum upgrading by improving security (street lighting points, fences),
developing socio-economic activities (small markets), improving sanitation conditions
(wastewater collection platforms, public latrines, and community water points), and
enhancing social cohesion (classrooms in Maroua). Populations, as reported in PCU reports
and documentaries, expressed their satisfaction for the works and reported a better quality
of life in their settlements due to improved sanitary conditions, especially during the rainy
season. Urban works under the project provided over 318,500 man-days of local
job/income opportunities.
52.     378,710 people were provided with access to water supply services (modest)
directly by the project. Component 3 was deemed to support the implementation of the
PPP, and Camwater confirmed during supervision and the ICR preparation that “project
areas” referred to the affermage service area under the PPP. Over 2008-2015, the PPP
provided10 an additional 1,630,970 people with access to improved water sources, of which
378,710 resulted directly from the PDUE contribution (22 percent). Indeed, the PPP gained
136,157 new domestic connections and 898 standposts over that period. PDUE contributed
directly to this result through 35,411 domestic connections under the GPOBA and IDA-
funded social connection program (26 percent contribution), and 82 community water
points under the urban component (9 percent contribution). Progress in access, however,
was below targets, both for the PPP and for PDUE. PDUE social connections program was
achieved at 51 percent, and only a handful of community water points were provided in
urban slums (achievement: 7 percent). This performance followed the same curve as the
overall PPP: over the same period, the UWSP target for new domestic connections was
achieved at 56 percent and the target for new standposts at 15 percent.
53.     In addition, the project constructed and rehabilitated almost 370 km of water supply
network extensions, far above the objective of 200 km (achievement: 184 percent); 342 km
were executed through Camwater and covered Douala, Yaoundé, and secondary centers,
and 27 km resulted from works in urban slum (component 2). The latest contract to develop
an additional 215 km was completed before closing: it will enable CDE to reach more areas
in demand for connections and ultimately increase the number of beneficiaries. The project
also contributed to the rehabilitation program through emergency works and upgrading of
water production and distribution facilities in Douala and Yaoundé, and supported various
equipment and supplies, including 60,000 meters. Other PPP investments added new
production capacities to the supply system over the last years. It is reasonable and fair to

2015, at project closing. Beneficiary populations are calculated with the ratios used by Camwater and CDE
on people per domestic connection and per standpipe. CDE actual data can be compared to objectives set in
the Urban Water Sector Program for 2006-2015.


                                                   13
assume that as a result of these combined efforts, operational performance will continue to
improve and progressively restore reliable and continuous water services.
54.     Additionally, the project supported institutional capacity strengthening needed to
improve operation and maintenance of infrastructure and services, and to ensure their
sustainability in the medium and long term. To support municipalities and other urban
stakeholders, the project successfully assisted municipalities in developing planning and
management tools to monitor progress in urban development and municipal finance (tax
collection, maintenance, etc.). The six City Development Contracts (CDCs) prepared in
target cities are now being implemented. The share of municipal budget allocated to
maintenance of investments reached 10 percent, even though the PCU noted that progress
remained to better track maintenance expenses. It also supported: (i) the completion of the
National Urban Strategy; (ii) the created of a national urban database; (iii) the training of
more than 1,000 people, scaling up moving project results to a national momentum.
55.     The project also promoted the institutional strengthening of the water PPP
structure. Donors coordinated their efforts to develop regulatory tools and capacity-
building support, especially for the new public corporation Camwater. The PDUE funded
the setup of the financial model, the first contract of the technical auditors and the PPP
Tariff Study. The EIB funded the Action Plan for the reduction of public consumption,
which is yet to be implemented. The AFD funded the updating of the financial model and
recruitment of the model administrator, among others. The PDUE also provided technical
assistance and trainings for Camwater staff, as well as a study tour to learn from the
Senegalese asset-holding company, SONES. The two sector-level project indicators, one
on the share of public consumption in total water consumption, and the other on the sector
financial equilibrium, could not be reached. Both became sensitive issues for the PPP,
involving factors beyond Camwater’s sole control (see Box 1).
56.     Finally, the project reached its objective to support access to infrastructure and
services in urban poor areas. The PAD did not provide quantitative criteria to define
targeted low-income settlements; however, the selection of beneficiary areas was based on
non-monetary qualitative criteria describing deprived settlements, including: the level of
urban services and infrastructure (access roads, drainage, existing sources of water and
sanitation facilities, etc.), the urban fabric and quality of housing, zones prone to flooding,
etc. Local authorities backed such criteria, and field visits and physical evidence confirmed
these areas were poor settlements. The GPOBA ICR also reported that beneficiaries from
subsidized connections were mostly located in deprived areas, distant from the existing
networks; they also had consumption profiles similar to the poorest quintiles of households
based on the PPP Tariff Study issued in 2013.11 More than half of the OBA connections
consumed below 5 m3/month and on average, only 2.3 m3/month, far below the average
13 m3/month for domestic consumption.

3.3 Efficiency




11
  The PPP Tariff Study (2013), funded by IDA, included a willingness to pay survey and data on average
consumption per person and expenses for water in several big cities, sorted out by poverty quintiles.


                                                 14
57.    Overall, efficiency is considered modest. This assessment balances (i) reasonable
economic efficiency estimates for three sets of investments provided by PDUE—-roads,
drainage and water supply, and (ii) administrative efficiency. Indeed, the project lasted 88
months instead of the initial duration of 60 months, which increased both Bank supervision
and overall project management costs.
58.     At appraisal, separate economic analyses were undertaken given the diversity of
proposed investments and target areas. The ex-post analysis undertaken to assess efficiency
at completion built on the ex-ante analysis, including Cost Benefit Analyses (CBA) for (i)
the urban road Ngoa-Ekele in Yaoundé, and for (ii) the water component at PPP level. The
ex-ante analysis did not quantify benefits for other investments under component 2. Given
their large share in project costs and important achievements, a quantified ex-post
economic analysis was performed for drainage investments (See Annex 3).
59.     Economic efficiency for the urban road Ngoa-Ekele sub-project was substantial.
Although actual costs were slightly higher than planned, investments for this strategic road
section to enter this settlement in Yaoundé 3 generated a return higher than estimated at
appraisal. The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) was 44 percent at completion (Net Present
Value (NPV) of CFAF 1.3 million), compared to 39 percent at appraisal (NVP of
CFAF 1.5 million), at a 12 percent discount rate; the NVP would be slightly higher at a
5 percent discount rate. Other socio-economic benefits associated with urban road
investments, such as time saved to access this settlement, or economic opportunities for
street vendors along the road, are not reflected in this assessment. It is likely that other
sections of trunk road funded by PDUE would generate similar results.
60.     Investments in drainage systems usually generate a wide range of benefits,
including flood prevention and reduction of losses resulting from heavy rains, better control
of water discharge and pollution of water tables, and reduction of waterborne diseases.
Considering data availability and the complex modelling of other benefits, the ex-post CBA
focused specifically on benefits resulting from avoided costs of illness related to
waterborne diseases, mainly diarrhea and malaria. Results varied widely, with ERRs (at a
12 discount rate) ranging from 65 percent in Mbalmayo, 26 percent in Yaoundé, and
12 percent in Bamenda, to 10 percent in Maroua, and a negative ERR in Douala.
Differences in the size and types of drainage works, and related costs in the different cities,
partly explain the variability. These results represent a very conservative lower-bound
value, because many important benefits could not be quantified, especially flood
prevention in project areas known to be prone to intense flooding with dire consequences
for lives and properties.
61.     Efficiency for the water investments was severely affected by the challenges that
affected both the PPP and PDUE. At a 12 percent discount rate, the ex-ante ERR was
estimated at 12.2 percent (NPV of CFAF 10 billion), for an ex-post ERR limited to
5.43 percent (NPV of CFAF -41 billion, but of +6.1 billion at a 5% discount rate). PPP
investments were actually higher than expected at appraisal, but delays and cost overruns
weighed heavily on several investments, resulting in the postponement of expected benefits.
The number of new customers increased, but were less than planned in the sector strategy,
reducing the consumer surplus from ex-ante to ex-post CBA. The sector financial
disequilibrium has become a highly sensitive issue, and as a result, not all factors could be
fully assessed in this ICR. The Bank, through PDUE, put a particular emphasis on access

                                              15
to water. In total, with only five percent of actual PPP investments, PDUE provided one in
four of the PPP new connections. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that this
contribution increased the PPP ERR, albeit moderately. Finally, costs per connection were
in the range observed in other West African countries, validating the cost-effectiveness of
the project investment: US$ 153 for GPOBA connections (including a subsidy of over
30 percent of the cost), US$ 197 for IDA-funded connections (subsidy of 90 percent for
the regular connection length), for an average of US$ 200 in neighboring countries.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
62.     Project Outcomes are Moderately Satisfactory. The relevance of objectives and of
design and implementation are substantial, as is the achievement of the PDO, while the
efficiency is modest. Project Outcomes are therefore rated as moderately satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
63.    PDUE pro-poor orientation was discussed above (see section 3.2). Recent
economic and poverty data 12 confirmed that (i) urbanization continued to bring more
people to urban centers, maintaining pressure to provide them with housing, infrastructure
and services, employment, etc., and (ii) overall, the urban poor represented only 10 percent
of the total poor in Cameroon, a real decrease over the last 10 years. While PDUE
contribution to this trends is probably limited, this kind of project interventions including
small scale works, local materials, and intensive labor, may have played a role in it.
64.    While the project did not report particular gender-related aspects, it included
consultations and participatory decision making to select priority investments in target
areas to ensure ownership and to strengthen social development. Communities were
involved as well as local development committees (comités de quartiers). According to the
PCU completion report, in the first phase these groups had contractual arrangements signed
with the municipalities to maintain the works and to develop other social activities. This
dynamic was not as successful in the second part of the project, due to delays in works and
compensation issues. More attention to proper communication with beneficiaries should
help get buy-in and maintain involvement of beneficiaries (see Annex 7).
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
67.     For the urban development sector, governance needs further consolidation to
sustain the project’s achievements. At policy level, the National Urban Strategy developed
by PDUE needs to be fully owned by MINHDU and promoted to keep the momentum. The
urban database was set up, but was not fully operational at completion. The new urban
operation may help enhance these tools to ensure that the investment will be sustained and
will generate more outcomes in a later phase. Municipalities still need some support to
build on PDUE’s achievements and apply what they have learned ‘on the job’ to replicate
these types of interventions, to plan and implement their budget balancing maintenance
and investments, and to foster a culture of participation and accountability towards urban
dwellers/beneficiaries. Support from the Ministry in charge of local governments to further
champion the decentralization reform is a substantial risk, but on the other hand, the Bank-
funded Community Development Program Support Project III will support municipalities
country-wide to promote such approaches. On the technical side, and given the
urbanization rate, small investments may not be sufficient in the mid-term, and it is unclear
whether the urban local councils will fully integrate the urban planning approach in the
future. Maintenance is also a critical risk.
68.     On the water side, risks to development outcomes are high as long as the PPP
situation remains uncertain. To date, two years from the end of the affermage contract, the
positive scenario where the sector would stabilize and take advantage of all investments
completed or near completion, remains to be confirmed. Additional water produced, and
increased access to water services through additional networks and connections, together
with actual progress in operational performance (e.g. reduction in non-revenue water), are
likely to result in additional revenues for the PPP and better services to the population. It
should be supported by clear actions to restore the financial equilibrium, starting with the
full execution of debt swaps agreements and implementation of the action plan to reduce
public water consumption. The results of the Government’s assessment of the PPP should
pave the way for future institutional arrangements of the urban water sector that is facing
large needs to adequately provide safe water services to more than half of the Cameroonian
population.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
69.     To prepare this complex operation that spanned over two policy areas and
stakeholders, the Bank brought together expert support to build bridges between the two
sectors. The decision to combine small-scale urban interventions in slums and altogether
engage in the complex structure of the water PPP was risky but bold, as it aimed to optimize
supervision resources and to reach an overall project cost that would give the Bank some
leverage in the sector dialogs.



                                             17
70.     The Bank provided preparation funds and mobilized support from another Bank-
funded operation to support (i) programmatic studies and safeguards instruments that
structured the urban components’ framework approach, and (ii) transaction services to
complete the water PPP contracts and support the recruitment of the private operator, the
development of the investment plan that provided the water component’s economic
analysis at appraisal, as well as the initiation of the first financial model of the sector.
71.     In hindsight, as noted in the quality assessment report (QALP-2) issued in 2010,
the expected pace of implementation and disbursements proved optimistic given the
existing capacity: this may be related to the HIPC context that drew enthusiasm from
donors at that time. Similarly, there were high expectations from the water PPP, which
could have been better defined in the results framework. But overall, the PDO well
reflected the project components and incorporated lessons from both Cameroon and other
regional operations in the design of the project.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
72.     The Bank deployed important efforts to support the project with over 220 staff-
week time spent on supervision over eight years. Some team members provided support
from preparation to completion, ensuring an institutional continuity, even if four Task
Team Leaders (TTLs) were successively in charge; co-TTLs also mixed both urban and
water expertise. The team undertook regular supervision missions, even though, at times,
internal reporting was delayed. The PDO was rated satisfactory until early 2013, despite
lagging disbursement rates and accumulated risks. ISRs were reasonably candid, and flags
were triggered to alert management on issues encountered. Some sudden ups or downs in
ratings, in retrospect, appeared as signs of active internal discussions around various issues.
Before completion, the team candidly reported gaps in M&E and design issues, but rated
the project MS, considering the results that were achieved.
73.     The PCU noted the quality of support provided, including technical advice,
comprehensive reviews, and reasonable delays to provide non-objections. The close
engagement of procurement, FM, and safeguards specialists, mostly based in the Country
Office, was particularly important to provide just-in-time expert support on specific issues,
and to facilitate relations, as needed, with high level authorities or entities—the Ministry
of Public Procurement, Ministries in charge of land issues and decentralization, or the
Prime Minister’s office, to name a few. This helped following up on compliance with
fiduciary and safeguards policies and overcome problems.
74.      Proactivity measures ultimately supported the achievement of the PDO. The
decision to approve an additional financing and an extended implementation period
boosted the impacts of investments in slum upgrading and capacity strengthening. Given
existing difficulties of the PPP, the AF had a more limited success for the water component,
but it enabled strategic activities that were not initially included in the IDA funding.
Remedy measures were not envisaged to avoid negative effects of the project as a whole.
In this regard, the partial cancellation of funds and another year of project duration were a
good decision to refocus the project on activities that could be realistically achieved. At
completion, the project fully completed its revised scope of work. A restructuring of the
RF would have allowed to do more justice to the project performance.

                                              18
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
75.     Both quality at entry and quality of supervision are considered moderately
satisfactory. The overall Bank Performance is consequently rated moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
76.     The Government of Cameroon did not comply with its financial and sector
obligations stated in the Urban Water Sector Program and Development Policy Letter,
explicitly referred to in the legal Agreements. As such, GoC played a major role in the
difficult implementation of the PPP and the limited performance of most projects
supporting the PPP, including the Bank intervention through PDUE.
77.     On the urban side, more coordination at policy level with central agencies in charge
of decentralization and local governments could have enhanced project implementation.
However, GoC secured sufficient funding to cover the full cost of compensations owed to
people affected by PDUE, and strengthened its support to PCU and municipalities to ensure
outstanding payments. Although with much delays, this sped up payments and the process
is nearly completed at the time of this ICR. Counterpart funding for the urban part of PDUE
amounted to over US$ 2.8 M. (without taxes).
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
78.     Both the PCU and Camwater conducted their work programs until the completion
of the vast majority of activities, and they both developed skills in project management and
other core fiduciary and safeguards functions, while maintaining active relations with the
Bank. Both should be commended for their dedication to the project success.
79.     Weaknesses were noted during implementation, sometimes due to staff turnover
for the PCU, or the lack of a dedicated team within Camwater with enough time and
resources to manage the water component. However, there was no major deviation from
Bank requirements and they sometimes had to cope with factors beyond their full control.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
80.    The PDO was achieved, despite shortcomings in the Borrower performance. Given
the overall outcome rating of moderately satisfactory, the overall Borrower Performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
81.    A solid Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework is instrumental for efficient
and result-oriented project management. M&E provisions in PADs are often limited and
focused on project indicators in the results framework. To ensure full ownership of the
implementing agency/borrower, the M&E framework must be thought through together

                                            19
with design and its implementation get sufficient support. A M&E plan must be grounded
in shared understanding of project objectives and implementing arrangements. Templates
and other dashboards have to be customized to needs, meaningful and easy to use for both
data providers and data users. A good M&E system is able to monitor all dimensions of
project performance: smart output and outcome indicators, fiduciary performance, and
safeguards. It helps the agency/borrower to make decision on the project course.
82.     Obstacles to handling land acquisition and compensation in accordance with
national regulations and safeguards provisions can jeopardize infrastructure development
programs. In poor, informal settlements in developing cities, properly identifying affected
people and documenting their eligibility may speed up the overall process leading to
effective and timely compensation, and reduce risks of complaints from affected people
left aside in such process, or claims from people trying to benefit from the opportunity.
Adequate environmental and social screenings should, early in preparation, assess the
scope of potential land acquisition and compensation in project areas and bottlenecks
stemming from national regulations. Implementing units should develop and use
customized tools to closely monitor all transactions. Land issues may also be addressed at
the country portfolio level as they cut across sectors and project teams’ mandates.
83.     Sound and clear institutional and implementing arrangements strengthen project
ownership, especially when the project covers more than on sector. Prioritizing areas of
interventions can also mitigate risks. Even within one area of intervention, institutional
responsibilities can be fragmented across several line ministries, as is the case of urban
development and decentralization in Cameroon. A PPP structure also involves various
entities, including outside the sector itself. To address complexity, project design must
include an action plan clearly defining responsibilities at all stages of implementation, and
coordination mechanisms between implementing units and other stakeholders. This will
ensure that each agency involved has a good grasp of its role in the project architecture. A
stakeholder analysis and a good understanding of the sector(s)/country’s political economy
could also help assessing sector and stakeholder risks, and thereafter adjust the level of
support and mitigation measures to riskier areas of intervention.
84.     A water sector reform is a long-term process that needs a conducive environment
to mature, and clear incentives for all partners to perform. In Senegal, Niger, or Burkina
Faso, successful water reforms have enabled the development of performing utilities and
improved the quality of water services, resulting in high rates of access and financially
viable sectors. The Bank has supported these processes for 10 or 20 years. In Cameroon,
after eight years in an environment that was not conducive to success, water production
and distribution capacities have increased, as well as operational performance. Incentive
mechanisms to enhance the private operator performance were useful, for instance to sell
domestic connections for the poor or implement water works through direct contracting
with the asset-holding company. On the other hand, appropriate mechanisms were missing
to ensure that the Government would implement its sector commitments, and successive
technical assistance supports were not fully effective to strengthen Camwater’s capacity in
long-term sector development, asset management and control of operations, in a relatively
short timeframe. Continued sector dialog is critical to consolidate the reform and address
the needs of half of the population in Cameroon. However stronger mechanisms, such as



                                             20
guarantees or result-based financing, could provide additional incentives to perform, and
therefore also leverage more external funding.
85.     The PDUE experience is consistent with other projects in Cameroon or countries
with similar governance patterns: working at the local level yields better results than large
reforms at the central level that often involve competing institutions. Anchoring a project
in local institutions and involving communities through well-designed participatory
approaches can be more conducive to success than centrally organized projects with top-
down approach. In this regard, the progressive transfer of project responsibilities to
decentralized authorities is only one part of the equation. Building local ownership also
rely on mechanisms to involve communities in local development activities going beyond
external, time-bound projects. Contractual arrangements defining roles and objectives to
achieve are a good way to strengthen accountability on results between local authorities
and their constituents.
86.     In developing cities where informal economic activities prevail, it is important to
build capacity of local small and medium-size enterprises to improve both project efficacy
and efficiency. Dealing with small local firms with low procurement capacity and limited
experience of financial management and administrative requirements may overwhelm
project implementing units, create delays and affect procurement and disbursement
processes. Trainings customized for this audience, at the early stage of the project, can
positively impact project implementation. In a broader, longer-term perspective, working
with and supporting local/informal firms may help improve business standards and
professionalize local markets.
87.    Communication is a key function within a project implementing unit and requires
adequate skills and resources. Project management, procurement and contract
management, and financial management are usually the primary functions and positions of
an implementing unit. Particularly for projects working with local communities and across
large geographic areas, strengthening communication skills is important to complement
M&E efforts and to build trust with project beneficiaries and other partners. External
consultants recruited for punctual events and products, like documentaries, are not as fully
committed as internal resources could be to promote the project ideas, objectives and
achievements.

                                            process:
1.4 Preparation and implementation
                                            In Phase 1 of the project (2008-2011); 6 « partnership protocols » and
of city development contracts in pilot
                                            2 application conventions signed
cities – Bamenda, Douala, Maroua,
Mbalmayo, and Yaoundé                       In Phase 2, the 6 city contracts were developed and signed, and are
                                            now being implemented

The objective of the city contracts is to
                                            The project also applied this approach at community level, to
render the municipalities responsible
                                            enhance local involvement in managing local works or service,
for the choice and financing of a set of
                                            through contracts between community groups (comités de quartier)
actions to be carried out within the
                                            and municipalities.
framework of a program by
contracting interventions.                  In Phase 1, all (100%) targeted settlements had signed for such local
                                            contracts (conventions de quartier). In Phase 2, community groups
                                            showed less interest, no contract was signed (0%).
                                            Project communication strategy:
                                            - A communication strategy was designed: newsletters produced,
                                            website partially up to date, communication materials disseminated

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
The project approach including distinct types of activities, namely infrastructure works in
low-income settlements in selected cities (component 2), and improved water services
under the water PPP (component 3), led to separate analyses for these two components.
Therefore, there was no overall economic rate of return calculated for the entire project,
neither in the ex-ante nor in the ex-post analyses.
The ex-post analysis undertaken during the ICR preparation built on the ex-ante analysis
prepared at appraisal (see PAD, Annex 9), wherever possible:
   -   A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) was undertaken ex-ante for (i) one urban road sub-
       project in Yaoundé, and for (ii) the water component, at PPP level; the analytical
       frameworks used for calculating returns on investment ex-ante and ex-post for these
       two subsets are similar to allow for necessary comparison;
   -   The analysis at appraisal did not provide quantified benefits and rate of return for
       other investments planned under component 2 as preparation for some sub-projects
       were not sufficiently advanced to enable such an analysis. Given its large share in
       project costs and the importance of its outputs and outcomes achieved, a quantified
       analysis was performed ex-post for drainage works, even though there is no ex-ante
       ERR or NPV to compare results.
   A. Component 2. Infrastructure works in low-income settlements
The urban component was based on an approach designed to increase access to services to
a section of the population as large as possible. As explained in the PAD, the beneficiaries
would identify specific operations and the level of desired service based on the availability
of resources. This participatory process enabled them to appreciate the benefits that would
stem from the proposed improvement in terms of improved mobility, reduced flooding,
access to water, improved sanitary conditions, reduction of water-borne diseases, reduced
health-related expenses, added safety (through street lighting), and overall improvement of
living conditions and social cohesion within the settlements.
A.1. Mobility
Increasing access to urban roads in low-income settlements was one of the objectives
contributing to support the PDO.
Overall benefits
The main benefit of urban road infrastructure stemmed from improved mobility in poor
settlements of targeted cities. The project invested in several types of road infrastructure.
Trunk roads (voies structurantes), connecting the major areas of city, and proximity road
within the areas (desserte de proximité) infrastructure enhanced access to schools, markets,
offices and small businesses (see Borrower completion report). Furthermore, the proximity
roadways in poor settlements dramatically reduced hardship of walking: the average
distance to reach a public transportation means decreased from more than 700m to less
than 500m. Improvement of comfort and security (less accident) were other associated
benefits. Such benefits accrued primarily to the most vulnerable pedestrians (elderly, sick,
pregnant woman, etc.). Increase of income-generating activities were also observed along
the trunk roads.


                                             29
Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) of the Ngoa-Ekele sub-project
At appraisal, the most dramatic improvements were expected in the Ngoa-Ekele settlement
in Yaounde 3, and the preparation process did not allow to carry out a CBA for other road
sub-projects at that time. To allow for comparison, the CBA conducted during ICR
preparation focused on that same settlement and followed the same methodology.
As reported in Aide-Memoires during preparation, Ngoa-Ekele settlement in Yaoundé 3
was representative of poor settlements in the city, not structured and lacking basic services
and infrastructure. It was also an important residential student area with growing attraction,
where improved mobility and access to the settlement were a challenge. It was therefore
considered of strategic importance by the Yaoundé Urban Community and selected for
project investments.
Benefits were estimated based on operational costs avoided by vehicles thanks to the
construction of the road, building on traffic data and operation costs of vehicles using the
roadwork:
     1) The Average Daily Traffic (ADT) was estimated based on field surveys conducted
        at the different points along the street ‘Cité des Nations-pharmacie’ bordering the
        roadway, at appraisal (2007), and after completion (early 2016). The following
        table presents estimates before and after the project:

     2) At appraisal, operation costs (in CFAF/km, not including taxes per vehicle) were
        based on those estimated for a similar investment for the Douala road network (Lot
        N3) in 2004.13 At completion, the same estimated operation costs are used due to
        lack of reliable data from similar projects and investments.

original document mentioning the data.


                                                  30
Costs
    1) Investment costs: at completion, actual cost of the Ngoa-Ekele roadway (0.985 km)
       was estimated at CFAF 672.5 million, which was higher than the allocated budget
       of CFAF 340 million. This cost may appear in the upper-range value of road costs
       in Sub-Saharan Africa, 14 but this should be balanced against the nature of road
       construction: Ngoa-Ekele settlement is located on an uneven and hilly landscape.
    2) The maintenance costs were estimated at 1 percent of the investment costs and
       expected to be invested every year.
Results
For both with and without project scenarios, an estimation of the annual operating costs for
the different vehicle categories was undertaken multiplying the operating cost per km by
the annual total number of km by each vehicle. The annual benefit, which represents the
total operating costs saved for a given year, is the difference between the costs without the
project and the total costs with the project.
A 15-year time horizon was considered for the ex-post CBA as it was at appraisal. A linear
progression of the traffic was assumed between 2007 and 2015 and remained to be constant
from 2015. At appraisal, calculations were made with a 10% and a 12% discount rate; at
completion, results were compared using a 12% discount rate. The Net Present Value
(NPV) and Economic Rate of Return (ERR) ex-ante and ex-post are presented in the table
below:

Sensitivity analysis
Due to uncertainties on data sources, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the
robustness of the results. Sensitivity analysis shows that even if actual costs were 10%
higher than estimated the project would remain economically justifiable with a NPV of
CFAF 1,255.1 million and an ERR of 40%. If actual benefits were 10% lower than
estimated, NPV would be CFAF 1,117.6 million and ERR 39%. At a 5% discount rate,
NVP would provide a higher return. Therefore, sensitivity tests results show that economic
results are robust.




14 According to Africon (2008), the upper quartile road construction cost of new paved roads is CFAF 306,
964, 500/km. See Unit Costs of Infrastructure Projects in Sub-Saharan Africa Africon June 2008. Africa
infrastructure Country diagnostic.


                                                   31
Conclusion
The ex-post NPV is slightly lower than that estimated ex-ante, likely because actual
investment costs were higher than planned. The ex-post ERR on the other side is higher
than that estimated ex-ante.
As mentioned before, the methodology does not take into account other socio-economic
benefits from urban road investments. Some benefits may not have been quantified - owing
to the lack of data and complexity of modeling these effects.
The CBA supports the conclusion that investments undertaken in Ngoa-Ekele settlement
were fully justified.


A.2. Drainage and sanitation
Increasing access to appropriate drainage in low-income settlements was one of the
objectives contributing to support the PDO.
Overall benefits
This section presents the ex-post CBA of project drainage investments. No ex-ante
economic analysis was performed at appraisal, but the PAD underlined the different
benefits expected from the project investments, and how they could vary according to the
target cities:
   -   Control of floods and avoided cost of damages (Mbalmayo and Douala).
   -   Reduction of losses (damage construction sites) due to landslides in steep and
       eroded areas (Bamenda, Yaoundé, and Mbalmayo)
   -   Better control of water discharge, including preserving water tables from
       contamination from waste water, especially where tables are very high like in
       Douala.
   -   Reduction of waterborne diseases, especially when combined with interventions on
       waste collection or water supply. By reducing stagnating water, improved drainage
       system can considerably reduce the incidence/prevalence of water related diseases
       including malaria, cholera and various types of diarrhea.
In addition, improving drainage systems also provides an array of benefits including:
   •   Less school absenteeism for children
   •   Lower health expenses incurred for waterborne diseases; and
   •   Less time spent by parents providing health care to themselves or their children and,
       as a result, greater opportunity to increase their income;
   •   Time saved, principally by women, for activities associated with household
       wastewater removal.
   •   Improved well-being as a result of healthy life.
Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) for drainage works in the target cities
The ex-post analysis was carried out for some of these important expected benefits.
Considering data available, it focused on benefits resulting from avoided expenses related
to waterborne diseases that is diarrhea and malaria. According to WHO, children under 5


                                            32
years old represent 90% of those suffering from diarrhea in the world; this percentage is
probably higher in developing cities with limited access to improved sanitation, water
supply and drainage. The analysis focused on the benefits for this vulnerable group of
beneficiaries.
The methodological approach
A Cost Benefit Analysis was used for the ex-post analysis and calculated the net benefits
stream generated by drainage interventions in the different sub-projects in the target cities.
The benefits are equal to the difference between the incremental benefits and the
incremental costs of two scenarios: “with” and “without” the project. The “with” project
scenario considered the actual achievements obtained with the drainage systems. The
“without” project scenario considered that the situation would have likely remained the
same during the project life cycle. The project life cycle was estimated at 30 years based
on similar projects.
Project Benefits
The assessment of benefits was based on the avoided cost method. Based on similar
projects and literature, it was assumed that investments in drainage systems would at least
partially avoid costs occurring from water-borne diseases (malaria and diarrhea). Benefits
would in particular focus on health costs for children under 5 years who represent the most
vulnerable group.
Without project scenario
To assess avoided costs in the without investment scenario, the following information was
collected from existing literature:
     1- Health expenses data were sourced from a health survey undertaken in 2009 in
        major cities in Cameroon. Data from the report was corrected for subsidies.
     2- Prevalence of major water-borne diseases were also sourced from “troisième
        Edition du tableau de bord social” (TBS3)15. The data is presented in table 4.
It was assumed that, for the treatment duration, each child will be taken care of by one
adult. Time spent by this adult translates into an opportunity cost as the adult will forgo
revenues he/she could otherwise earn. The daily revenue of the average adult was estimated
at CFAF 1500/day (TBS3). Therefore, given the population in the different sub-projects,
avoided costs included (i) the direct costs incurred for different water-borne diseases for
children under 5 years, and (ii) indirect costs related to the opportunity costs of adults’ time
spent on care.16

It should be noted that although the positive impact of drainage system on waterborne
diseases is largely recognized (FAO, Sasaki et al, 2011), a limited number of studies
analyses the quantitative relationship between the provision of drainage network and the
decrease of the incidence/prevalence of specific water-borne diseases. A study by Moraes
et al. (2003) is one of the few to address this critical issue. After controlling for all
compounding effects, their results suggest that drainage reduces the incidence of several
waterborne diseases by approximately 40%. Based on this indication, the ex-post analysis
assumed that drainage systems reduced the costs of related medical care by 40%.

Project Costs
Costs include investment costs and maintenance costs:
    1) Investment costs data were provided by the PCU, referring to actual costs based on
       completed works contracts. It should be noted that such costs included, as per
       contracts, support infrastructure needed for a proper functioning of the systems
       such as security fences or footbridges.
    2) The annual maintenance costs, estimated at 1% of the total investment based on
       other similar projects.

Conclusion
Results vary from one city to the other due to differences in the size and types of drainage
system built, the population of the cities and the initial prevalence of diseases. For example,
in Douala, drainage works also included rehabilitation of a river systems resulting in higher
costs.
These results represent a very conservative lower-bound value as many important benefits
could not be quantified. As noted above, one of the objectives and source of benefits of
improved drainage is protection against flooding. Floods can in particular generate high
costs to repair damages incurred on household assets (house, etc.), in addition to expenses
to recover from one particular event (health, etc.).
Due to climate and rainfall patterns, several large cities in Cameroon including Douala,
Mbalmayo are exposed to intensive annual flooding with dire consequences for lives and
properties. For example, in 2015, Douala suffered dramatic flooding that affected many
parts of the city, resulting in considerable losses.
Overall, the analysis supports the conclusion that PDUE investments in drainage systems
were fully justified.


   B. Component 3. Support to the implementation of the public-private
      partnership in the provision of urban water services
The urban water component of the project aimed to increase access to water services in the
framework of the water PPP. The Bank, through IDA and GPOBA funds, would be one of
the financiers of the PPP. As various donors’ investments would support the sector
investment plan, expected benefits (additional production and distribution capacities,
increased access, and better services) would be inextricably linked. Therefore, the
economic analysis at appraisal was carried out at PPP level.
The economic analysis undertaken during the ICR preparation, to allow comparison of key
efficiency indicators, used the same methodology as the one used at appraisal. It took into
account changes in IDA and GPOBA allocations during implementation, and actual costs
and achievements of both the Bank intervention and the PPP. A sensitivity analysis was
conducted to assess the robustness of the results.
Economic analysis at appraisal
The ex-ante analysis (PAD, Annex 9) was based on a standard methodology for the
calculation of the net present value (NPV).
Economic costs included the cost of water investments (all donors) and the incremental
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs associated with the increased access and water
consumption. Capital cost estimates were based on the rehabilitation and expansion 5-year
program of Camwater (2007-2011), amounting to about US$230 million (CFAF115




                                              35
billion) and including investments financed by IDA, GPOBA, the Exim Bank of China,
AFD, EIB and the Government of Cameroon.18
Economic benefits included the value of incremental water consumption (using tariffs as
a proxy of profits (service provider) and the consumers’ surplus) together with the cost
savings resulting from the rehabilitation program. The component was expected to provide
access to safe water to an additional 1.2 million people, of whom about 700,000 would
benefit from subsidized water connections.
Results. On this basis, the NPV was estimated at about US$20 million (approximately
CFAF10 billion) and the economic internal rate of return at 12.2 percent.
Economic analysis at completion
Scope of work. The ex-ante analysis was based on the project’s scope of work that evolved
during implementation. Changes included:
     1) For the Bank intervention/PDUE:
IDA additional financing was granted in 2010, adding US$28.70 M to the initial IDA credit
of US$80.00 M for the entire project. 50% of the AF supported to water component (initial
allocation of US$33 M), and aimed to finance needed equipment and rehabilitation of
water production facilities in Douala and Yaoundé; supply of production and distribution
meters; and long-expected tertiary networks to speed up new connections’ rates. 19
However, given important implementation delays, almost all those funds were cancelled in
2014 (see section 2.2); the construction of 1,200 standpipes was dropped; due to
availability of remaining funding, the contract for social connections was targeting 10,000
social connections, and no more 20,000 as planned at design;
The GPOBA sub-project was fully embedded in component 3 (see GPOBA ICR for more
details). In the PAD, the expected grant from GPOBA was US$10 M for a target of 55,000
connections. However, following a decision from the Government to change the
connection cost formula, the GPOBA grant was revised to US$5.25 M while Camwater
expected contribution, deemed to cover the difference between the actual connection costs,
GPOBA subsidy and beneficiary households’ contribution, grew from US$2 M to
US$5.75 M. The GPOBA Grant Agreement was targeting a more conservative objective
of 40,000 connections that would benefit from the GPOBA subsidy.



18
   The investment program was building on the investment plan prepared during the SNEC divestiture
transactions; listed donors had expressed their interest and these assumptions were included in the pilot
financial model for the sector.
19
   An economic analysis was conducted at AF to assess the proposed additional investments in urban water
supply. Assumptions differed from those at appraisal as they did not include the consumer surplus and
progress made in number of connections and standpipes at that date. The economic benefits included: (i) the
value of incremental water sales that are made possible through the rehabilitation of water production
facilities; and (ii) operational cost savings resulting from the improvement of metering. Economic costs
included the cost of the additional water investments, the incremental operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs associated with the increased water consumption and renewal costs. On this basis, the Net Present Value
(NPV) (with a discount rate of 12 percent) of the additional water investments was estimated at about
US$11.7 million and the economic rate of return at 17.3 percent.


                                                    36
   2) At PPP level:
As reported in the ICR report (see section 2.2), the level of expected investments to support
the PPP varied during project implementation. Some investments, including those from the
Government, experienced delays; for instance, the AFD loan was approved in 2010, but
was suspended in 2012 and restructured as a sovereign loan to the Government, to be on-
lent to Camwater as subsidy. In parallel, Camwater benefited from other loans that were
not included in the initial economic analysis, for instance from the AfDB, Dexia or
additional investments from the Exim Bank of China. Other factors contributed to disrupt
the financial mechanisms planned to support the PPP (accumulated arrears from the public
customers, new HR policy that affected the private operator’s operational costs, etc.).
PPP partners agreed that the financial equilibrium of the sector was broken in 2011. Despite
high level discussions and action plans to resolve this sensitive issue, the financial
equilibrium was not restored yet when the project closed in August 2015.
Assumptions supporting the ex-post CBA
Ex-ante assumptions were updated considering actual costs and achievements during the
project implementation, using sector data available from Camwater, CDE and the PPP
audit reports.
Benefits included:
   1) The profit generated by the incremental water produced and supplied as a result of
      the PPP program; it includes:
          a. The total revenue from water sales (water sales, connection fees and rental
             fees) minus operating costs (energy for water pumping, chemicals for water
             treatment and staff costs);
          b. Various cost savings (energy and chemical) resulting from reduced non-
             revenue water.
   2) Consumer surplus (only domestic customers are taken into account) is measured
      based on changes in volume of water consumed per person and water expenses
      when a household gets connected to CDE/Camwater piped water:
          a. the PAD provides assumptions on water consumption and expenses levels
             for people without the project (using existing standpipes or alternative
             sources of supply);
          b. Consumption and expenses levels with the project, for customers using new
             standpipes and domestic connections, are based on actual sector data
             (volumes in liters/capita/day and expenses in FCFA/m3).
Costs included:
   1) Capital or investment costs, taking into account actual funds disbursed to support
      the investment program, through all sources of funding (including traditional
      donors (IDA, GPOBA, AfDB, AFD, and EIB), commercial banks (Exim China,
      Dexia Belgium) and the Government). They included rehabilitation and expansion
      of the overall water production and distribution capacities, as well as an increased
      number of connections and standpipes:



                                             37
                 a. In total, capital costs injected into the sector (PPP level) amounted to
                    CFAF268 billion or US$527 million from 2008 to 2015;20
                 b. PDUE contribution was as follows:
                         - Out of the US$90 million of IDA credit, US$30.4 million supported
                           the urban water sector component/PPP;
                         - As reported in the GPOBA ICR, US$1.82 million of the GPOBA
                           grant was actually disbursed;
          For the purpose of the CBA, the investment costs have been estimated in constant
          2007 prices, costs having been corrected to account for depreciation assumed to be
          2% per year.21
      2) Operating costs directly related to the provision of services: chemical (CFAF
         35/m3), energy (19/m3), and commercial (staff costs) costs (53% of sales
         revenue).22

Results
The ex-post economic analysis of urban water component is presented below for different
discount rates. For the benchmark analysis at a discount rate of 12%, the net present value
is CFAF -41.6 billion (US$ - 83.2 million). The ERR is 5.43%. This result indicates that
the sector achieved less than the economic performance estimated at appraisal. However,
for a more moderate discount rate of 5%, the NPV is positive at CFAF 6.1 billion.
Several reasons may explain such result, clearly linked to the difficulties experienced by
the PPP: delayed investments also delayed the expected incremental volumes to water to
be produced and sold, the number of new domestic customers (household connections and

     While contributing 5% of the total investments, the IDA and GPOBA social connections
     account for more than 26% of the new domestic connections implemented the PPP area
     during project implementation. Additionally, the water supply networks funded by IDA are
     providing opportunities for future further extensions.
     The CBA methodology used in both ex-ante and ex-post analyses gives a lower-bound
     value of the benefits of the investment, as due to lack of relevant data, it could not quantify
     important benefits:
     1) Benefits include only the surplus of domestic customers and not all customers;
     2) Health externalities arising from improved access to good quality water were not
     assessed;
     3) Future benefits that will arise from extended supply networks are not taken into account.
     Sensitivity analysis
     To test the robustness of the results, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to test alternative
     scenarios and to check if the project would still be economically justifiable under such
     scenarios.

          1. Consumer surplus: consumer surplus calculation depends on the assumptions on
             expenses for water (using the cost paid by m3 as a proxy) in the “without project”
             scenario. Assumptions made in the PAD assumed that households not connected to
             piped water were buying water from vendors at very expensive rates, and used such
             cost for all consumption. As discussed in the GPOBA ICR, people without
             connections usually get water from available sources at different prices, and
             vendors represented only a relatively small share of water providers. Therefore, to
             be conservative, this scenario considers expenses for water (before being
             connected) that were 10% then 20% below the values used in the PAD. ERR values
             are of 4.9% and 4.5% respectively.
          2. IDA+GPOBA contributions to the PPP: The ERR was calculated at the PPP level
             including contributions of all financiers. However, to have a sense of PDUE
             contribution, this scenario assumes that IDA and GPOBA investments and the
             related social connections did not occur. The resulting ERR would fall from 5.4%
             to 5.0% implying the significant impact of the Bank intervention to the PPP despite
             a relatively small monetary contribution.
          3. 100% achievement rate of PDUE social connections program (IDA+GPOBA):
             if both GPOBA and IDA social connections had been fully realized as initially
             planned (total 70,000 new connections), the ERR would have increased to 5.6%.
             This result shows the impact of PDUE contribution although with modest effect.
          4. Effect of delays in works: the PPP experienced delays; works planned under
             PDUE started at least one to two year later than planned, some were completed only
             before project closing, postponing benefits after the project closing date. This
             scenario tries to capture what would have happened if project activities had
             remained on schedule. ERR calculated for 2 year advance in activities is 5.8% and
             4 year advance is 6.2%. This result implies that considerable economic value may
             be saved by keeping projects on schedule.
          5. Sensitivity to staff costs: during the PPP implementation, the private operator
             experienced severe increase in staff costs, as a result of (i) the mandatory
             implementation of a new HR policy, (ii) the increase in service provision activities
             directly to the increased number of connections and water sales, and (iii) renewing
             of staff and retirement provisions. A PPP audit report noted in 2013 that staff cost
             as a percentage of the sales revenue was estimated at 35% while this value averaged
             around 23% for the main water supply companies in Africa; this percentage
             increased up to 53% in 2015. The analysis shows that for staff cost representing
             20% of sales revenue, the ERR would be 12.8% and for a staff cost of 23% (the



                                                     40
       average for SSA), this value would be 12.1%. Lower staff costs would have resulted
       in higher net economic values of the PPP.
Benefit cost ratio and cost effectiveness
The upfront connection cost is an entry barrier in the water supply for many poor
households.
The GPOBA sub-program directly subsidized 18,854 connections for an average of 38%
of the average cost, and de facto enabled another 6,000 connections that were realized
under the program but could not be eligible to benefit from an equivalent subsidy from
Camwater (see GPOBA ICR: a total of 25,254 households benefited from the GPOBA
connections). For the 10,157 social connections funded by IDA, beneficiaries were
expected to pay 10% of the connection cost and the difference was paid through IDA funds.
Overall; the project facilitated access to water services of poor urban dwellers that did not
enjoy the benefits of piped water before the project.
The average connection cost for GPOBA connections was US$ 153 per connection
(including OBA subsidy, Camwater/GoC and beneficiary contributions).
The average connection cost for IDA connections was US$ 197 per connection.
PDUE-funded domestic connections are cost effective investment compared to average
costs observed in West Africa (US$ 200).
The project provided other benefits that could not be quantified in the CBA. These include:
   •   The project built 369 km of secondary and tertiary water supply networks in
       Yaoundé, Douala and secondary centers. This will enable more connections to be
       realized, implying more people gaining access to safe drinking water.
   •   Increased access to safe drinking water may have generated additional health
       benefits for more than 1.2 million people that got access to piped water during
       project implementation.
   •   The project funded infrastructure rehabilitation that did not directly translate into
       additional connection but improved the lifetime of the infrastructure.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The Borrower prepared a full Implementation Completion Report that was shared with the
Country Director and Bank team. The following text is the Executive Summary and the
synthesis of Lessons Learned extracted from PDUE Completion Report.


   A. OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE PROJECT
1.     Project appears satisfactory and achieved its goals: The number of beneficiaries
(people with access to drinking water and / or improved mobility conditions and / or saved
from the floods) is estimated to have reached 2,098,000 by 25th August 2015. The water
component performed relatively well despite delays in network extensions works and the
remaining beneficiaries gap has been filled thanks to the urban component.
2.      However in terms of execution, the performance is considered moderately
satisfactory, since the project was restructured, the closing date was extended, and some
planned activities were not fully achieved. The project implementation was negatively
impacted by three main factors: (i) the initial delays in the signature of the Financing
Agreement and the lifting of effectiveness conditions and the disbursement condition for
the water component; (ii) the lack of project "maturity" at the beginning of the project,
because preparatory activities were still in progress when implementation started; and (iii)
the process of paying compensation to people affected by the project, which was both long
and marked by numerous flaws.
   B. IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT AND SUSTAINABILITY OF
      UNDERTAKEN ACTIONS
Socioeconomic aspects
3.      The main impacts of the project are undeniable: improving access to transportation
and walking conditions; improving drainage and sanitary conditions; improving water
quality, water quantity and service continuity, as well as the quality of water service
(complaints); enhancing security and building entertainment facilities in neighborhoods
and, indirectly, improving housing.
4.      The economic impacts of the project broadly cover impacts as expected during
preparation: (i) improved production capacity and distribution of drinking water; (ii)
household health expenses saved by increasing water quality and quantity, reduced water
stagnation; (iii) reduced cost of water access for users leaving alternative supplies in their
neighborhood (from neighbors or standpipes) and getting private water connections; (iv)
reduced connection cost thanks to the extension of tertiary networks; and (v) reduced
transportation costs giving the new access roads to connect target settlements.
5.      Nevertheless, sustainability of these gains is threatened by the low importance
given to the maintenance of equipment and infrastructure at the municipal level.
Decentralization aspects
6.     The project had significant positive impacts on the decentralization policy even if
the impact is limited to the municipalities affected by component 2: (i) human capacity

                                             45
strengthened; (ii) strengthened local project ownership; (iii) Local Councils’ finances
restructured; (iv) improved resources; and (v) strengthened citizen participation in public
governance. The main highlight is the significant improvement of municipal resources,
specifically own resources. Gaps in municipalities’ management identified by the audits
have not been fully corrected yet. Similarly, the relation the project has established between
the neighborhoods and the councils remains precarious.
Urban development policy aspects
7.       The current or induced effects / changes on urban development policy are
numerous: (i) the project has promoted a results-based management approach that is not
strictly based on quantitative measures of infrastructure output, as it was usually the case;
(ii) the project has tried to reverse the current trend consisting in concentrating resources
on projects known as "structuring" to the detriment of those within the vicinity; (iii) the
project has tried to get out of the policy of "road" only to demonstrate the benefits of an
integrated approach to enhance the positive effects of the road; (iv) consultation with
populations has been an innovative approach of urban management for activities within
targeted neighborhoods.
8.      The main weakness to note is that the ministry in charge of urban development does
not yet have enough support tools for decision making; in particular, the urban database
designed to be implemented in the project has yet to become operational.
Water policy aspects
9.      Results achieved have helped reinforce the major lines defined by the government
in the sector policy letter, at least regarding the Public Private Partnership scheme
implemented around the Contracting Authority (Government), the public asset-holding
company, and the private operator (lease). The project, through the emergency operations
in Yaoundé, Douala and secondary centers, has helped mitigate the water crisis and
contributed to increase water production, which in turn has improved the financial position
of the private operator. The fiscal balance, essential for the sustainability of achievements,
is considered achieved and maintained since 2010 according to the criterion of "Net Cash
Balance" of the CDE in the project assessment document; however the cash flow
difficulties undermine the public asset-holding company functioning while the service
provider faces higher than expected operating expenses, which jeopardizes this balance
since 2012. Furthermore, the current pricing does not release a true social block, which
limits access to water for low-income households. Finally, community access points are
limited, which penalizes low-income households that live mostly of popular economy and
are not able to settle monthly bills.
   C. PROJECT RELEVANCE / DESIGN
10.      In terms of design, the project was in line with the policies and socio-economic
context that prevailed during preparation. It remained so since, despite some changes, such
as: updated guidelines set by the SDGE; decentralization progress with the effective
transfer of resources; governance with the introduction of new instruments that control the
activity of the public accountants’ number; or results-based management. Its objectives are
still relevant, both for the urban component and for the water component, the needs still
very important.


                                             46
   D. PROJECT EFFICACY
11.    As for effectiveness, that is the level of achievement of results (products), the IDA
funding disbursement rate (31 July 2015) is around 90 percent and should increase by the
accounting close. Implementation of activities by component is as follows:
12.     For component 1: Generally, planned activities were mostly realized, mainly the
organizational and financial audit of Councils as well as certain related activities
(consolidation of accounts, taxpayers file, introducing financial information management
systems in 22 municipalities). In addition, seven LRA were granted with strategic planning
documents (4 cities’ development strategies and 3 PIP / PEP) and six city contracts were
signed. Some activities have not been fully realized: the urban database is not supplied (the
collection pilot operation was not performed), the support surveys to the definition of
housing policy were not all completed, the urban sector strategy was defined and adopted,
but not broadcasted.
13.     For component 2 : Almost all the planned activities (construction of basic and
nearly infrastructure in the precarious housing area) were performed.
14.     For component 3 : The main performed activities focus on the strengthening
capacity of the public asset-holding company the private operator and the ministry of water
(MINEE), the implementation of production facilities (emergency works) as well as
network extension and the implementation of connections. Activities are implemented at
100 percent of the program after restructuring. The standpipes were removed and private
connections are slightly above expectations; standpipes, just as low-cost connections, are
nevertheless essential to improve household water supply. The main gap lies in the
strengthening of public-private partnership: partners’ relations are fresh, public customers’
water consumption is still increasing, studies for the review of the financial model and the
adjustment of the fee schedule were conducted but not applied and the financial model does
not fully play its role as regulator and forecasting model.
   E. PROJECT EFFICIENCY
15.   The assessment shows that the project as a whole was efficiently managed, even if
some problems are to be reported.
   -   The lead ministry, MINHDU: (i) ensured a constant monitoring of activities and,
       above all, (ii) helped to solve the difficulties encountered, particularly in the
       relationship with other departments.
   -   The steering committee met regularly, according to its powers, to: (i) ensure the
       general strategic direction and supervision of project implementation; (ii) ensure
       communication and cooperation among stakeholders; (iii) approve work programs
       and annual budgets, and (iv) review progress reports. However, two weaknesses
       can be reported: the non-compliance of the six-month rate sessions and the non-
       consideration of audit reports and advices made by the World Bank.
   -   Municipalities, as expected, took an active part in the implementation of the
       component 2 within phase 1 and completely assumed liability in phase 2. However,
       the transfer of responsibilities for fiduciary management expected from the third
       year of the project could not be made. It appears that many criteria were set to allow
       this transfer; this may be too many constraints for the relatively modest volume of

                                             47
          activities to be managed. This transfer was therefore not appropriate. On the other
          hand, the transfer of procurement responsibility was effective in Phase 2 of the
          project, as planned.
      -   The established “neighborhood development committees” (comités de quartier),
          despite some misunderstandings, appear to have played their role. Especially during
          the planning stage, they played an active role in the selection of sub-projects related
          to the vicinity, highlighting issues that might not have emerged otherwise.
          However, their relationship with the municipal executive has hardly been effective.
      -   The project coordination unit and CAMWATER have played the role assigned to
          them in project implementation.
16.       The performance is also measured through specific activities :
      -   Regarding payment terms, performance appears insufficient on the 2nd phase of
          the project. Bottlenecks were both at the Coordination Unit and municipality levels,
          as well as at the ‘Caisses Autonomes d'Amortissement’. The performance is similar
          with regards to delays for procurement, which regularly exceed the period of
          tenders’ validity; the delay is justified neither by delays in obtaining non-objection
          notices, nor by the delays of tenders analysis, but found primarily at the
          administrative level, in submitting files to IDA, and especially for contracts
          signature (conditioned in phase 2 for works contracts by the compensation of
          persons affected by the project). This situation, already difficult at mid-term, was
          exacerbated by the processing period at the Ministry of Public Contract
          (MINMAP).
      -   Financial management appears fairly good; audits have not identified any major
          problems. The only weaknesses identified concern budget management and credit
          monitoring.
      -   The monitoring and evaluation (in particular its internal control aspect) appears to
          be the main weakness of the organization. In fact, there is no monitoring of
          activities leading to the achievement of results, justifying delays in the absence of
          an internal warning system.
      -   Relations with the IDA do not seem to pose any particular problem: Supervision
          missions were conducted regularly, non-objection notices and the reactions on the
          financial reports were given in a reasonable time period.


      F. SUMMARY OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PROJECT


ON THE PROJECT DESIGN
Keep PDUE objectives which remain relevant
17.     The project objectives, which were coherent and aligned with the context that
prevailed at appraisal, are still relevant today. They perfectly fit in with national policies
and strategies in the sectors concerned. They may therefore renewed be for a new project,
while needs remain globally important, both for the urban and water sectors.

                                                48
Establish links between investments and capacity building
18.     For the water component, despite some progress made during the project and other
financial supports obtained by CAMWATER, it is important, for the future, to continue to
act in three directions: (i) supporting the implementation of the PPP, (ii) improving water
production and (iii) improving access to potable water.
19.    For the urban component, access to urban services remains limited, and an
intervention in housing areas always seems indispensable. However, it must be supported
by capacity building of stakeholders at different levels, mainly at the municipal level,
which is at the center of urban policy of the Government.
TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACTS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE URBAN
COMPONENT
20.     Government resources help leverage improvements in local management, in five
areas: (i) local organization; (ii) increasing municipal resources (own funds); (iii) the
effective management of infrastructure and equipment maintenance; (iv) improving
transparency; (v) beneficiary participation.
   -   Municipal adjustment. Resources allocated to investments in cities should continue
       to serve as leverage to achieve improvements in terms of municipal management,
       as the government cannot be held responsible for deficiencies. PDUE has revealed
       the main areas of concern: (i) consolidation of municipal accounts, including
       outstanding payments due to contractors, social organizations and the State; (ii)
       mobilization of financial resources; (iii) better monitoring of operating expenses;
       (iv) management of financial information; (v) transparency and information of the
       citizen. Requirements of the Law regarding budget allocations for investment and
       operating costs, among others, must be respected.
   -   Increasing financial resources of municipalities. Financial restructuring will not be
       sufficient. Acting simultaneously on tax recovery, mainly through better
       identification (including location) of taxpayers is needed.
   -   Maintenance of infrastructure / equipment by municipalities. Maintenance of
       infrastructure and equipment is a key aspect of municipal management and require
       a minimum budget allocation. Financial audits have shown that it is currently
       difficult for most municipalities to contribute to investments. At the same time,
       major investments are made without clear maintenance prospect. Efforts made
       during PDUE by the municipalities to maintain infrastructure and facilities under
       their jurisdiction should be sustained. . Given PDUE achievements, it is appropriate
       that municipalities assign at least 10 percent of their own revenues to maintenance.
   -   Participatory approach. Neighborhood committees should be better involved, and
       in a more sustainable way, for instance with leading activities that may have a more
       permanent dimension, beyond the project investment. This participatory approach
       should be used wisely, though, to avoid conflicts and unnecessary costs. People
       should be directly associated in decision making only as regards operations related
       to their immediate environment. There is therefore no interest to involve them in
       the decision making regarding trunk infrastructure, whose area of influence extends
       far beyond the boundaries of the neighborhood.


                                            49
   -   Technical assistance, training and support. The project has demonstrated that
       “traditional” training actions produce their full effect only if they are
       complementary to ad hoc technical assistance missions focused on specific
       problems identified through thorough investigations (organizational and financial
       audits). This technical assistance may include the provision of context-specific
       tools (procedures, working methods, software or even hardware) that would be
       tested or implemented with the direct beneficiaries, ie staff concerned by these
       problems, participation of key actors from their workstation.
21.    Targeting large cities for more impact at country level. The impact of the project
on small towns, though very noticeable locally, does little to improve the situation at the
national level in terms of both works and capacity building. It is usually less flexible to
work with them, for instance because of their limited municipal workforce. This is what
happened with the town of Mbalmayo. It was included in PDUE as a pilot city, after the
experience in PACDDU cities, which were much larger in size. It therefore seems
appropriate to target mainly large cities. The threshold of 100 000 inhabitants seems
appropriate, these cities including around 72 percent of the urban population.
22.    Operating at a more important scale. In view of both the scale of need and the cost
(especially in time) of works, working at large it is more efficient and would maximize
impacts. Below 100 ha, there may not be any impact on mobility, while populations are
probably already located within 500 m of public transport. This also confirms the priority
focus on large cities where it is possible to find such sufficiently large operational areas. In
addition, densities are low in small towns, making prohibitive the intervention costs.
23.     500m from road is a good indication of isolation limit. The project enabled to test
and confirm the idea of considering the distance of 500m as isolation limit. Therefore, a
resident located more than 500m from a path from which he/she can use a public mean of
transportation (other than the Moto-taxi or the informal taxi), is considered as located in a
landlocked area, which is not well connected to other neighborhoods. This access distance
also appears relevant and “feasible” in financial terms, given resources available. It is also
increasingly used at international level.
24.    Reduce land insecurity. Land regularization is essential for the servicing
operations to produce their full effects. This difficult issue must be addressed.
25.    Improve decision making tools. This is to complete or strengthen actions initiated
with PDUE, following three directions:
   -   The results-based approach should remain a key element of urban management.
       Within MINHDU, relevant services should be involved (Monitoring Unit, attached
       to the Secretary General) to the project monitoring and evaluation to build capacity
       in this area. Clarify or refining project outcome indicators is therefore crucial to
       ensure a shared understanding before sharing them with all actors of the urban
       sector. As for transportation, the project has confirmed that 500m is a relevant and
       “feasible” distance of access. The planning of interventions for trunk infrastructure
       should therefore be based on this result. Thus, contrary to what was done in PDUE,
       the areas of intervention shall be defined in relation with the trunk network. Within
       these areas, it is essential to rely on a number of constants that emerge from the
       current project (i) the priority is to have properly drained areas, the decision on

                                              50
       paved or earthen roads comes next; (ii) an integrated approach enables to include
       other services in neighborhoods, not strictly the road (garbage removal, access to
       piped water, access to social facilities, public lighting, etc.).
   -   The effective urban planning initiated by MINHDU must be supported to give more
       light to future actions in urban areas. It is then recommended to: (i) disseminate the
       National Urban sub-sector Strategy that is now the compass for planning,
       programming, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation of MINHDU’s
       interventions with local actors (decentralized services and LRA); (ii) finalize all
       activities identified in the City Development Strategy for Yaoundé, including the
       establishment of POS / PSU.
   -   Operationalizing the urban database should continue. For purely “Urban”
       information to be collected by the MINHDU relevant services, it may however be
       more realistic to initially rely on a short list of cities and to only gradually expand
       the number of items.
   -   To strengthen synergies, the State Higher Control services and the Chamber of
       Accounts should be associated from the beginning to municipal adjustment
       measures, between the actors.
TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACTS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THE WATER
COMPONENT
26.     Strengthening the Public-Private Partnership. Revising the financial model has
become a critical issue, including the tariff structure and the lease contract. Normalizing
the relations between the public asset-holding company and the private operator is also
essential. In the present context, these important reforms would be difficult to conduct
without a donor commitment that would back the process, as for the establishment of the
public-private partnership (PPP). The support of an institution like the World Bank is
essential, especially a technical support for the monitoring and consolidation of the PPP
which is the main challenge.
27.     Acting continuously in favor of the final beneficiaries. The connection rate and
level of household access to water are low. It is important to continue developing the
tertiary distribution, connections and standpipes, as significant funding is available for
other segments (production, primary and secondary distributions).
TO IMPROVE EFFICACY
28.     More communication to support municipalities. To support local development,
communication activities are essential and should be included in the process of improving
the relationship between the town and the citizen. There is a need to go beyond the project
activities to support municipalities in their overall communication vis-à-vis citizens.
29.     Clearly separate trunk infrastructure and proximity. Identifying trunk facilities
and infrastructure must be made from the outset by the municipality, as consultations with
the beneficiaries are not essential for this level. Arbitration after consultations with
beneficiaries should only concern proximity facilities or infrastructure.
30.     Improving programming. TORs for programmatic activities should be revised to
better reflect realistic expectations, for instance:


                                             51
    -   To connect the area with the rest of the city, at the stage of diagnosis, clearly
        identify isolated areas (located within 500m of an accessible route to public
        transportation) and that will need to be developed; then, at the proposal stage, ways
        to open up these areas (and nothing more) ;
    -   For mobility within the neighborhood, highlight priority issues for roadways as
        footpaths (will need to be coated);
    -   For drainage, identifying problem areas: flood and/or prone to erosion, where
        ditches’ coating should be associated with the rehabilitation of earth road;
    -   The summary of programmatic proposals must clearly present the expected results:
        Opened up areas and areas saved from floods.
31.    Improving the process of decision making for the “service” level. Arbitration must
well be understood as an exercise that involves matching the choices of people with
technical concerns or concerns related to the city development. This does not implies
giving in to all the wishes of the people, the opinion of the latter being only advisory
because the final decision belongs to the mayor. Moreover, arbitration must be done only
on the proposals of the main contractor from a trunk solution previously validated by the
City Council. Targeting only one sector of intervention (eg roads - this is the easiest to
implement and most politically sensitive) or only part of the intervention area should be
avoided as it may jeopardize the balanced development of the area.
32.      Carrying on activities related to water access to the poorest population. Under the
current socio-economic context, it is crucial to: (i) adjust the tariff structure to set up a real
social tranche , (ii) set up measures to support system for standpipes (tariff and others); and
(iii) expand social connections.
TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY
33.     Having a more “mature” project. For, Contracts should be ready to sign at
effectiveness, so that activities could start soon after. The preparation period must be
harnessed to complete all the programming and detailed technical studies, and to sign the
first contracts.
34.     A project implemented by existing structures… Institutionally and in general,
existing structures should be in charge of project implementation, in accordance with
national legislative and regulatory frameworks and in line with the Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness (on Alignment). As such, municipalities must perform all activities
relating to them, including procurement. This also applies at government level, regarding
the different administrations.
35.     … With a coordination unit. Given the multiplicity of stakeholders at different
levels, it is essential to maintain both a steering committee (with its current role) and a
coordination unit, whose role will be limited to: (i) supervising, including monitoring and
evaluation and reporting to the Steering Committee, (ii) advisory support to implementing
agencies, and (iii) financial management. However, and in line with the Accra Agenda for
Action, it is crucial to set up safeguard measures to strengthen national systems and
procedures, for example in involving various units within implementing agencies in the
implementation of monitoring and evaluation activities.


                                               52
36.    Enhancing strategic management by the steering committee. Steering Committee
meetings must be scheduled regularly to limit the discussions during the budget discussion
in December. Moreover, general strategic management must be strengthened through a
systematic review of the recommendations of the World Bank Missions.
37.     A stronger involvement of the ministry in charge of local authorities. The ministry
in charge of local authorities was not enough involved in PDUE. It should be represented
in project management, according to its responsibilities regarding the improvement of town
management.
38.     City councils as client. At municipal level, the general principle is that the
municipalities must fully fulfill their role as client, in line with the principle of subsidiarity.
The operations carried out have confirmed interest in firmly set projects in the
decentralization process. It appeared that decisions must be taken at the appropriate scale
and will only be back up to the upper scale what cannot be decided below. The
Municipalities taken as project owner appears thus fundamental, especially with regard to
tasks such as programming.
39.    Involvement of all entities in charge of urban networks. All stakeholders
(government, municipalities and network concessionaires) put into practice the regulatory
framework governing roads and networks in urban areas.
40.       Adjusting/strengthening the role of neighborhood development committees.
      -   Contractual arrangements must be signed and implemented from the project outset
          (neighborhood-municipality agreements, including monitoring arrangements);
      -   The creation or revitalization of neighborhood development committees should not
          only rest on the project activities but on more comprehensive and permanent areas
          of interest, such as hygiene and sanitation, which the municipality may support
          regardless of the project.
      -   Information on the project progress and the expected / achieved results should be
          widely disseminated, both at municipal level and at the level of neighborhoods;
      -   Position social focal points in an intermediation role between the stakeholders\;
          their role should be sustained for at least one year after the end of works to
          consolidate local ownership and maintenance.
41.     Review compensation process of People Affected by the Project. Regardless of the
actors’ will, the procedure is too long and is a real constraint to implement PDUE-like
projects consisting of small-scale activities. An option to explore could be to redirect the
approval of compensation decrees to the minister in charge of domains, at least for certain
thresholds or project categories (eg compensation decrees below CFAF 100 million, or if
there is household to resettle).
42.     The operation of Committees in charge of assessing compensations (CEC) must
be better monitored: compensation levels should respect regulations and be harmonized
for all Divisional Offices; Divisional Offices should not manage compensation funds;
operating funds of CEC should be managed by the project; relevant provisions defined in
the CPRP should be applied; assessing compensations should be done together with the
Ressetlement Action Plan.


                                                53
43.    Budgeting counterpart funding. Costs that cannot be supported by external
support should be estimated at the outset, budgeted and funding arrangements clearly
defined. This is particularly the case of expenses for compensation, which are the
responsibility of the project owner (municipalities).
44.     Establish a real device of the project monitoring and evaluation. It is essential to
define and design an effective monitoring and evaluation plan describing in a simple but
detailed manner: (i) the information to report to the CSR (indicators) by different actors of
the project; (ii) reports and indicators (monthly, quarterly, etc.) produced the CSR and (iii)
the plan for dissemination of such reports. This system, which remains simple and reduced,
must cover the entire project performance: Performance indicators, intermediate and
efficiency results, (procurement delays, implementation delays, commitment rate,
disbursement rate etc.).
45.     Redirecting MINMAP in the execution of public contract monitoring. The
Ministry in charge of public contracts was given a clear role, but it is not the case with
regard to the “control”. Roles need to be clarified to avoid bottlenecks in procurement and
improve control instead.
