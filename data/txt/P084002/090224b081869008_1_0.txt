                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic infrastructure and services,
                         including water supply. To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools
                         and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the
                         public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.

                         The first phase of infrastructure works in low-income settlements have been completed in the cities of Yaoundé, Douala, Bamenda, Mbalmayo and Maroua. The planning activities to
                         identify investments priorities to use the remaining project funds have been concluded, these include consultations with communities, and the preparation of technical studies

                         integrated with the social and environmental assessments. The procurement processes for these additional activities is under way, and it is expected that all contracts for the works
                         will be signed by the end of 2012.

                         With regard to the water component, its implementation is affected by the financial disequilibrium of the sector due mainly to delays in the Government’s payments of the contributions
                         and the public agencies’ water bills.
