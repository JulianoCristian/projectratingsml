{"cdata!": "Ratings for the Urban and Water\n            Development Support Project for Cameroon were as follows:\n            outcomes were moderately satisfactory, the risk to\n            development outcome was high, the Bank performance was\n            moderately satisfactory, and the Borrower performance was\n            also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons learned included:\n            obstacles to handling land acquisition and compensation in\n            accordance with national regulations and safeguards\n            provisions can jeopardize infrastructure development\n            programs. Sound and clear institutional and implementing\n            arrangements strengthen project ownership, especially when\n            the project covers more than on sector. Prioritizing areas\n            of interventions can also mitigate risks. Dealing with small\n            local firms with low procurement capacity and limited\n            experience of financial management and administrative\n            requirements may overwhelm project implementing units,\n            create delays and affect procurement and disbursement\n            processes. Trainings customized for this audience, at the\n            early stage of the project, can positively impact project\n            implementation. In a broader, longer-term perspective,\n            working with and supporting local/informal firms may help\n            improve business standards and professionalize local\n            markets. Project management, procurement and contract\n            management, and financial management are usually the primary\n            functions and positions of an implementing unit.\n            Particularly for projects working with local communities and\n            across large geographic areas, strengthening communication\n            skills is important to complement M&E efforts and to\n            build trust with project beneficiaries and other partners.\n            External consultants recruited for punctual events and\n            products, like documentaries, are not as fully committed as\n            internal resources could be to promote the project ideas,\n            objectives and achievements."}, "docdt": "2016-02-29T03:29:02Z"}
