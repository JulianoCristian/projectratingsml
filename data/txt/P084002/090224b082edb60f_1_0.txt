Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic
 infrastructure and services, including water supply. To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban
 development in the preparation and implementation of tools and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of
 beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 All ongoing activities of the Project are expected to be completed by its closing date on August 31, 2015. The PDO is expected to be achieved: the
 Project has increased access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic infrastructure and services, including
 water supply.
 The Project has successfully strengthened urban capacities, through institutional capacity building, training, system development as well as through
 social infrastructure in poor settlements. The activities to strengthen institutional capacities both at central and decentralized levels have built
 on successful participatory methodologies and tools to enhance planning and decision making, procurement and urban management in the targeted
 cities (Yaoundé 3 and 4, Douala, Mbalmayo, Bamenda, Maroua). The social infrastructure such as roads (to and within the low-income settlements) and
 drainage works have helped structuring the Project areas and benefitted an ever-growing population in those areas. However, while all resettlement
 action plans were approved, their level of implementation is uneven, and the Project and the Government still need to make sure that the due payment
 for all compensations to identified People Affected by the Project will be executed before the Project closing date.
 The urban water PPP the Project was to support has faced various issues and the lessons being learned will feed the Government of Cameroon's
 strategic thinking and Bank dialogue on the future of the sector reform, especially taking into consideration the upcoming end of the current affermage in
 2018.
 The Project has currently disbursed 89% of the proceeds of the loan.

         Comments
         The baseline in the 2007 PAD was 6,800,000 "additional population benefitting from access to safe water". The wording was adjusted in the
         Additional Financing Project Paper to comply with the Bank Core Sector Indicators.
         The 2007 PAD figure refers to the UNICEF-WHO Joint Monitoring Program, which provides the rate of urban population accessing to
         improved water sources. It thus considered the entire urban population. While the project was supporting the implementation of the PPP in
         the urban water sector, actually the affermage perimeter did not (and still does not) cover the entire urban areas, but only those with
         existing water systems or approximately over 100 urban centers for a total of over 300 urban centers in the country. The projections initially
         made were, in that sense, relatively unrealistic as they could not be monitored strictly by the project, and the target was way beyond the
         achievements that could be attributed to the project, both in terms of geographic coverage and in terms of funding (Bank versus other
         sources of funding). This was not amended with the AF.
         The discussion between the Project and the Bank team led to suggest a more realistic indicator based on the CDE perimeter only (see
         supplemental indicator). It was calculated for every year of the project which started at the same time as the affermage (baseline:
         12/31/2007), taking into account the 2007 existing customers and adding, for each year, the number of customers newly served by CDE

         However, even in this reduced perimeter more consistent with the project targeted areas, achievements in terms of number of
         people/beneficiaries are based on all CDE operations (all kinds of funding) and results attributable strictly to the project-funded activities
         cannot be accounted for separately.

         The direct project beneficiaries are defined by the sum of beneficiaries of the urban component (the maximum number of people reached
         either through roads or through drainage, to avoid double-counting as the 2 kinds of activities took place in the same areas) and
         beneficiaries of the water component.
         Following on the revised assessment of the number of people with access to improved water sources, the Project and the Bank team
         agreed to also revise the direct project beneficiaries to get a more realistic, though not fully satisfactory account of the project achievement.

               The target as initially set (2007 PAD) included 50,000 social connections to be funded by GPOBA following an output-based approach, and
               20,000 social connections to be funded under this IDA financing.
               The ICR for the Cameroon Water Affermage - OBA For Coverage Expansion project (P106794) concluded that the number of social
               connections actually funded by GPOBA was 18,854.
               The contract between Camwater and CDE to construct additional social connections, signed in June 2014, sets a contractual objective of
               10,000 connections. Most of them were already sold as of April 2015 and a large third of the 10,000 were already constructed at that time
               (validated by the firm in charge of controlling the works).
               Assuming that all the 10,000 IDA-funded connections will be completed (constructed and approved) by August 31, 2015, the maximum
               number of social connections built under the project (GPOBA and IDA funding, as set in the PAD) will be around 28,000, far below the end
               target value of 70,000.

               As explained for the PDO indicator on the Number of people with access to improved water sources, it was not possible for the project to
               monitor the house connections resulting from the IDA funded activities separately. The actual achievements for each year of the project
               were thus recalculated by the Project based on the total of new piped household water connections (including the social connections) that
               were implemented in the affermage service area. The achievement mentioned for October 2014 and the previous ones did not include the
               social connections.

               The 2007 PAD indicated that this indicator should be monitored through an annual review of the updated financial model; the 2010 AF PP
               specified to refer to the private operator's net cash balance to measure the indicator. The operator's net cash balance was negative in 2010,
               but has since then been positive, while the financial equilibrium is not restored yet, as agreed by all partners.
