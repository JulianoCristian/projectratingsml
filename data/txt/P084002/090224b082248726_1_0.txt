                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic infrastructure and services,
                         including water supply. To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools
                         and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the
                         public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         civil works related mostly to the processing of the compensation payments for project affected people that needed a Decree authorized by the Presidency. The water component has
                         also been experiencing procurement-related delays due to reasons linked to internally to Camwater as well as externally from the requirements of the new procurement code. The law
                         entails that Camwater (based in Douala) process contracts above a certain ceiling through the Central Ministry of Public Procurement (based in Yaounde). However, some progress
                         can still be recorded of late, notably: i) on easing the administrative burden of contract procurement, payment and processing such as the authorization of Camwater to procure

                         contracts while awaiting the creation of a Special Commission as mandated by the new procurement law, and ii) on Camwater paying some of the arrears to Cameronaise des Eaux
                         for about $16M regarding investment subsidies and regularization of cross-debt, moving towards restoring the financial equilibrium of the water sector. In terms of the urban
                         component, there has also been some progress on starting the compensation progress of people initially affected for Phase II works in selected cities (Bamenda, Mbalmayo,
                         Yaounde); while in Douala works for Phase II are under implementation and expected to be completed in March 2014. Additional compensation decrees for each one of the
                         municipalities (except Douala) will be required to compensate people that were not officially identified in the initial phase and thus not covered by the current compensation decrees.
