                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic infrastructure and services,
                         including water supply. To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban development in the preparation and implementation of tools
                         and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the
                         public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         with the exception of civil works in Maroua. Following the countersigning by MoF, the Financing Agreement was amended to change the project closing date, thus extended until
                         August 31, 2015, allowing remaining urban activities to further progress toward PDOs achievement, and two water activities (water network extensions and execution of social
                         connections) to resume implementation after project extension. Current undisbursed balances are fully committed and likely to be used before project closing date.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         There is a need by the client side to (i) continously review progress made on remaining activities both for the urban and the water components; (ii) closely assess the use of
                         remaining funds by project closing date; (iii) accelerate implementation of civil works, especially in finalizing works procurement in Maroua under the urban component; (iv) ensure
                         close supervision of the two strategic activities under the water component to progress toward PDOs related to network extensions and new household connections, including social
                         connections.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
