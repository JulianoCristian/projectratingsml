Project Development Objectives

 Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
 The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic
 infrastructure and services, including water supply. To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban
 development in the preparation and implementation of tools and investments designed to increase access to services to as large a number of
 beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and facilitate the implementation of the public-private partnership in the provision of urban water services.


 Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project Objective?

Implementation Status and Key Decisions

 All major activities of the Project are already completed and only a few remain pending before the project final closing date on August 31, 2015. The
 PDO is expected to be achieved: the Project has increased access of the urban population, particularly those living in low-income settlements, to basic
 infrastructure and services, including water supply. The Project has currently disbursed 91% of the proceeds of the loan.

 The Project has successfully strengthened urban capacities, through institutional capacity building, training, and system development as well as through
 social infrastructure in poor settlements. The activities to strengthen institutional capacities both at central and decentralized levels have built on
 successful participatory methodologies and tools to enhance planning and decision making, procurement and urban management in the targeted cities
 (Yaoundé 3 and 4, Douala, Mbalmayo, Bamenda, Maroua). The social infrastructure such as roads (to and within the low-income settlements) and
 drainage works have helped structuring the Project areas and benefitted an ever-growing population in those areas.

 Regarding access to water services, the lessons being learned from this project and 8 years of implementation of the urban water PPP will feed the
 Government of Cameroon's strategic thinking and Bank dialogue on the future of the sector reform, especially taking into consideration the end of the
 current affermage in 2018.

 The Project has commissioned an evaluation of the project that was be shared with the Bank. The Report will inform the Bank’ Implementation
 Completion Report that will be prepared in the semester following project closing.

         The actual value is considered not applicable. See below “Number of people in urban areas =served by CDE= provided with access to
         Improved Water Source”.

         The baseline in the 2007 PAD was 6,800,000 "additional population benefitting from access to safe water". The figure refers to the UNICEF-
         WHO Joint Monitoring Program, which provides the rate of urban population accessing to improved water sources. It thus considered the
         entire urban population.
         While the project was supporting the implementation of the PPP in the urban water sector, actually the affermage perimeter did not (and still
         does not) cover the entire urban areas, but only those with existing water systems or approximately over 100 urban centers for a total of
         over 300 urban centers in the country. The projections initially made were, in that sense, relatively unrealistic as they could not be
         monitored strictly by the project, and the target was way beyond the achievements that could be attributed to the project, both in terms of
         geographic coverage and in terms of funding sources. This indicator was not amended with the AF - the wording was adjusted to comply
         with the Bank Core Sector Indicators but target values were not revised.
         The discussion between the Project and the Bank team led to suggest a more realistic indicator based on the CDE perimeter only (see
         supplemental indicator). It was calculated for every year of the project which started at the same time as the affermage (baseline:

         through house connections and CDE-operated standpipes.
         However, even in this reduced perimeter more consistent with the project targeted areas, achievements in terms of number of
         people/beneficiaries are based on all CDE operations (all kinds of funding) and results attributable strictly to the project-funded activities
         cannot be accounted for separately.

         The actual value is considered not applicable. See below “Direct project beneficiaries (including only urban areas served by CDE)”.
         The direct project beneficiaries are defined by the sum of beneficiaries of the urban component (the maximum number of people reached
         either through roads or through drainage, to avoid double-counting as the 2 kinds of activities took place in the same areas) and
         beneficiaries of the water component.
         Following on the revised assessment of the number of people with access to improved water sources, the Project and the Bank team
         agreed to also revise the direct project beneficiaries to get a more realistic, though not fully satisfactory account of the project achievement.

               34 standposts and 48 improved wells were constructed as part of the urban component activities and project funds. The activity planning to
               construct 1,200 standpipes operated by CDE under the water component was cancelled when the related funds were cancelled in March

               The target as initially set in the PAD included 50,000 social connections to be funded by GPOBA following an output-based approach, and
               20,000 social connections to be funded under this IDA financing - the GPOBA funding was included in the project cost as part
               of Component 3 activities.
               The ICR for the Cameroon Water Affermage - OBA For Coverage Expansion project (P106794) concluded that the number of social
               connections actually funded by GPOBA was 18,854.
               The contract between Camwater and CDE to construct additional social connections, signed in June 2014, sets a contractual objective of
               10,000 connections. The total of the 10,000 connections were sold and most of them are expected to be completed at completion (final
               check underway).

               As explained for the PDO indicator on the Number of people with access to improved water sources, it was not possible for the project to
               monitor the house connections resulting from the IDA funded activities separately. The actual achievements for each year of the project
               were thus recalculated by the Project based on the total of new piped household water connections (including the social connections) that
               were implemented in the affermage service area. The achievement mentioned for October 2014 and the previous ones did not include the
               social connections.

               The Project confirmed that instead of decreasing, the share of public customer in total water consumption was currently increasing, as a
               result of a delayed implementation of the Action Plan (funded by EIB under the PPP) to reduce public consumptions

               The 2007 PAD indicated that this indicator should be monitored through an annual review of the PPP financial model, yet to be developed
               and implemented at that time. The 2010 AF PP specified to refer to the private operator's net cash balance to measure the indicator.
               Actually, the operator's net cash balance does not reflect the sector's financial situation that involves PPP partners (GoC, asset holding
               company and operator): CDE cash balance has been positive since 2011, while the financial equilibrium is not restored yet, as agreed by all
               partners and shown by the PPP financial model.
