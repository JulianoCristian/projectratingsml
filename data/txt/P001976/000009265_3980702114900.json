Implementation Completion\n            Report (ICR) for the Population Projectz in Niger. The\n            project was designed to assist the Government in\n            implementing an effective national population program, with\n            the primary objective of accelerating the onset of fertility\n            decline by increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate as\n            rapidly as possible, reducing maternal mortality, promoting\n            attitudes favoring a reduction in family size norms, and\n            enhancing the capacity of women to participate effectively\n            in socioeconomic development. Bank's performance was\n            deficient. Borrower's performance was not satisfactory.\n            The key lessons learned were as follows: (i) it is necessary\n            to include the beneficiaries and agents in the design and\n            management of the project; (ii) performance and impact\n            indicators should be established at the beginning of the\n            project, and monitored on a regular basis; (iii) training\n            programs should include a monitoring and evaluation plan;\n            (iv) decentralization rnust take into account the following:\n            operationalization of the current structure, management\n            decentralization, and training; (v) donors must be more\n            flexible and adaptable to the context and capacity of the\n            structures responsible for project implementation; (vi) an\n            appropriate maintenance plan is necessary to ensure\n            longevity of equipment and materials; (vii) project\n            Coordination Units should be have appropriate technical\n            competencies; and (viii) project actions must be coherent in\n            order to improve efficiency and impact."}, "docdt": "1998-05-01T00:00:00Z"}
