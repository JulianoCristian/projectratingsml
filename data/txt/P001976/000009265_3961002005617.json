in implementing an effective national population\n            program, with the primary objective of accelerating the\n            onset of fertility decline by increasing the contraceptive\n            prevalence rate as rapidly as possible, reducing maternal\n            mortality, promoting attitudes favoring a reduction in\n            family size norms, and enhancing the capacity of women to\n            effectively participate in socioeconomic development. To\n            this end, the project supports policies and investments\n            designed to: a) strengthen the delivery of maternal health\n            and family planning (MCH/FP) services by: i) supporting\n            policy reform; ii) increasing access to and improving the\n            quality of MCH/FP services at all levels of service\n            delivery; and iii) providing support for the participation\n            of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in MCH/FP service\n            delivery and information, education and communication (IEC)\n            activities; b) promote family welfare and women's\n            status by encouraging behavior favoring a reduction in\n            family size norms, and by enhancing the capacity of women to\n            participate in socioeconomic development, through support\n            for : a nationwide IEC program and nutrition interventions;\n            and c) reinforce the capacity for population policy\n            analysis, research, monitoring and coordination."}, "docdt": "1992-04-03T00:00:00Z"}
