MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGER
FOR A POPULATION PROJECT
1.            I submit for your apn;roval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Niger for SDR 12.9 million, the equivalei t of US$17.6 million, on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a population project. The Governmvnt,
nongovernmental organizations, the private sector and local communities would contributc US$3.0 million.
Cofinancing is expected from the Government of Belgium (US$2.5 million), and UNICEF (US$1.0 million).
2.            Sector Background. Niger's high and accelerating rate of population giowth imposes severe
constraints on this resource-poor country's long-term  development prospects.   "he Government's
commitment to addressinig this problem has evolved rapialy over the last several years. Its Five-Year
Developmen. Plaii 1987-91) identified rapid populatior growth, currently estimated at 3.4% per annurn, as
a major constraint to the medium- and long-term economic and social development of the country.
Subsequently, the national family planning strategy (1988-93) and the demographic plan of action (1991-95)
spelled out the Government's priorities and strategies in population and family planning, which aim to:
(a) provide broader access to family planning services through an integrated maternal and child health care
and t'amily planning (MCH!FP) program; (b) reduce maternal and child mortality; (c) support programs to
improve the status of women; and (d) improve demographic data collection and research, and strengthen the
national capacity for population policy analysis, program planning, management and coordination.
3.            To provide policy guidance and institutional focus tor these objectives, the Government
enacted in )88 an ordinance on contrace,)tive practice, established a Department for Family Planning and.
in 1989, established a Ministry for Social Affairs and Women's Promotion (recently renamed the Ministry
tor Social Development, Population and Women's Promotion). These policy and institutional changes are
reflected in the steady progress that has been achieved over the last three years in the expansion of family
planning services to almost all urban areas of the country. Although the contraceptive prevalence rate is still
very low for the country as a whole -- about 2-3% -- it has risen rapidly in the major urban areas to about
18%. All of these efforts, however, are constrained by strong pro-natalist traditions, the low level ot' female
literacy, high maternal and child mortality and poor nutrition, a limited capacity for demographic planning
and program development, and an inadequate health service delivery system. Thus, while the Governmient's
objective of achieving a contraceptive prevalence rate of between 25% and 30% in urban areas and between
5% and 10% in rural areas by the end of the project is feasible, it may be difficult to achieve given the
above-mentioned constraiPts, without the adoption of a more effective service exransion strategy and further
et'forts to generate effective demand for services. These two objectives, i.e., service expansion and creating
et't'ective demand, constitute the major thrust of the proposed project.
4.            Proiect Objectives. The project would assist the Government in implementing an effective
national population program, with the primary objective of accelerating the onset of fertility decline by
increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate as rapidly as possible, reducing maternal mortality, promoting
attitudes favoring a reduction in family si7e norms, and enhancing the capacity of women to effectively
participate in socioeconomic development.
5.            Project Description. The project comprises the following components: (a) Strengthening
the delivery of maternal and child health and family planning (MCH/FP) services (52% of total base costs)
by: (i) supporting policy reform in the areas of essential drugs and cost recovery, and strengthening
departmental and district capacities in sector management, planning, monitoring and evaluation; and
(ii) increasing access to and improving the quality of MCH/FP services at all levels of service delivery
(village, canton, district, and department), and providing support for the participation of NGOs. including



- 2 -
community groups and other private sector agencies, in MCH/FP service delivery and information,
education, and communication (IEC) activities; (b) Promrioting family welfare and women's status (34% of
total base costs) by encouraging behavior f;voring a reduction in family size norms and by eihancing the
capacity of womeni to effectively particir,ate in socioeconomic development, through suppolt for: (i) a
nationwide IEC program; (ii) promoting tlhe status of women; and (iii) nutrition interventions; and
(c) Reinforcii.g the Government's capacity for population poliky analysis, research. monitoring and
coordination G( % of total base costs) by: (i) improving the capacity for sociodemographic data col'ection,
analysis, research and evaluation; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity for the promotion ard
coordination of the national population program; and (iii) establishing a Population Fund tu encourage active
private sector and NGO involvement in the population program. The project will also finance project
coordination and management, as well as refinancing of the PPF (7% of total base costs). Schedt'es A to
D annexed to this memorandum provide summaries of project costs and financing plans, procurement
methods and disbursements, key project processing events, and status of Bank Group operations.
6.           Project Implementation. Each of the three project components will be implemented by the
relevant units in the responsible ministries, namely the Ministry of Public Health; Social Development,
Population and Womern's Promotion; and Economy and Finance. The project reinforces the planning,
management and technical capacities of the key implementiiig agencies. A Pro ject Coordinating Unit (PCU)
located in the Ministry of Social Development, Population and Women's Promotion will be responsible for
administrative and financial matters, as well as monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the PCU wi!l
administer the Population Fund. The project is expected to be completed over a four- year period, and the
IDA credit would be disbursed over a six-year period, compared to Niger's standard disbursement profile
of ueven ye'ars.
7.           Project Sustainability. Three aspects of project design will help promote the sustainability
of Nige.'s population prog.arn beyond project completion. First, the strengthening of program planning and
management at the departmental and district levels, and the redeployment of health personnel from urban
to rural areas will ensure more cost-effective use of available resources. Second, these reforms, together
with project support to enhance the quality of service delivery and to promote family welfare and women's
status will stimulate effective demand for FP services. Third, increased cost recovery and support under the
Population Fund for private sector and NGO involvement in MCH/FP service delivery, and for community
initiatives in WID and nutrition activities would help expand internal resource mobilization for the population
program outside of the public sector.
8.           Lessons Learned. The project benefits from the experienc>e gained under the ongoing IDA-
funded Health Project (Cr.1668-NIR), the results of the recent OED evaluation of eight case studies
(including one Sahelian country) on the impact of Bank assistance on fertility reduction, as well as from
project experiences in other African countries, such as Zimbabwe and Kenya. These experiences have
demonstrated the importance -- under a nascent population and family planning program such as that in Niger
-- of: (a) an effective integration of FP services irnto ongoing MCH programs; (b) a multi-channel approach
to MCHIFP service delivery and communication; and (c) a broad-based demand creation strategy, including
an expanded IEC program with support for programs aimed at improving women's status and social welfare.
The lessons learned also relate to the need to improve efficiency of service delivery through well-designed
training programs, effective decentralization, ariU efficient allocation of personnel. Finally, in order to
ensure effective implementation of project activities, there is a need for substantial improvemr.ent in project
management, particularly in the areas of financial management and procurement.
9.           Rationale for IIDA Involvement. There is consensus between the Government and IDA on
the importance of the "population factor" in the country's long-term development goals and strategies, and



on the need to act now. This consensus has been achieved through a continuing dialogue with the
Government over the past few vears, and has contributed to the recent development of a naticnal policy on
population. IDA's strong position in influencing the Government's plans and strategies in the population
sector a& well as its ability to help mobilize financial support for the sector, is recognized by both the donor
community and the concerned government agencies. This places IDA in a position to continue playing a
catalytic role in assisting the Government in its efforts to further this prccess, and to help build on the
current momentum for increased population and FP activities. The proposed project is consistent with iDA's
human resource development objectives in the Sahelian countries and with the Bank-wide policy objective
of poverty alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa.
10.           Agreed Actions. The following are conditions of credit effectiveness: (a) Publication of
an Arrete defining the structure of the regional health system, including the roles and functions of the
departments and districts in the administration and management of the decentralized health system; and
adoption of the pol;:y document defining the persorael recruiiment and redeployment plan for 1993-95;
(b) Adoption of an action plan establishing guidelines for the extension of the drug distribution network, as
well as procedures for the intioduction of the national essential drug! list; (c) Adoption of the revised
departmental in-service tr..ining modules for MCH/. P and nutrition, including a detailed in-service training
plan for the first two years of project implernentation (1993-94); (d) Adoption of the st: ite governing the
proposed interregional family health center in Zinder and giving details of the center's organizational
structure, role and functions, as well as a proposed staffing plan; (e) Publication of the Arret1 defining the
norms and standards for the prcvision of MCH/FP at each service delivery ievel; (t) Publication of an Arrat
(i) authorizing newly-recruited village health workers to provide refills for hormonal coiatraceptives, as well
as supplies of barrier methods, and (ii) defining the revised chiecklist to be used to screen new FP acceptors
and other modalities for its utilization; (g) Adoption of thle by-lavs and regulations governing the
administration of the Population Fund, together with a procedures manual and a standard contract to be
entered into with the would-be berneficiaries of the Fund; and es:ablishment cf the committee for the selection
of sub-projects to be financed under the Fund; (h) Publication of the Arrete establishing the Interministerial
TEC Technical Committee; (i) Submission to IDA, for review and comment, of draft bidding documents for
all bid packages in the first year of the project; and (j) Finalization and signature of the contract with the
selected auditor. Also, as a condition of credit effectiveness, the Government will have satisfied IDA that
it has concluded appropriate agreements with other cofinanciers in view of securing all complementary
financing required for the execution of the projcct, ind has satisfied all the conditions precedent therec - other
than any such conditions related to the effectiveness of the IDA credit. It should be noted that the draft
versions of the policy documents listed in conditions (a) - (ji above were discussed and agreed upon at
negotiations. For that reason, timely fulfillment of these effectiveness conditions is expected.
11.           Environmental Aspects. The project is rated C. Actions to reduce population growth will
have direct long-term positive effects on the environment.
12.           Project Objective Categories.  The project responds directly to the human resource
development and antipoverty objectives of the Government. Extending FP services, strengthening MCH
services, promoting women's interests and improving populaticn policy analysis, planning and management
will contribute significantly to the achievement of the long-terrm development objectives of the country.
13.           Project Benefits. Project benefits would be widespread, especially in five areas. Eirst,
between 0.8 to 1.0 million women of reproductive age would gain direct access to MCH/FP services. Pre-
and post-natal consultations wouLld be significantly increased, thus directly affecting maternal and infant
mortality rates. FP service consultations, the number of new acceptors, and continuity of contraceptives use
wouid rise significantly, resulting in a estimated contraceptive prevalence rate of between 25%o and 30% in



- 4 -
urban areas, and between 5% and 10% in rural areas by the end of the project period. In addition, ther
efficiency and qualitv Lf service delivery of the health care system at the regional, d'strict and village levels
would be greatly improved. Scnd, the JEC sub-component is expected to have far-reaching qualitative
impact on tne social and economic well-being of the Nigerien population. The lEC activities would cover
the whole country through mass media (about 95% of the population have access to radio and 125% tc
television), and would enhance people awareness of population, environmental, health and FP issues, thus
facilitating the Government's efforts to implement more aggressive and effective policy reforms. Thid, the
WID sub-component, through its support for energy- and time-saving technologies, expansion of
microenterprises, functional literacy programs ind nutrition surveillance, would have a far-reaching impact
on women's health ani nutrition, as we!' -- on faniily welfare, and would help reinforce the FP objectives
of the project.  Fourth, the population policy analysis. research and coordination component would
signitwiantly enhance the Government's ability to promote and coordinate broad-based program implemen-
tation. The establishment of a permanent secretariat for the National Commission on Population Activities
(CONAPO) will provide ilh needed institutional leadership, and help strengthen the political cormnitment
essential for establishing a stable, susta' iable, and legitimate national population program. By the end of the
project period, the quality of overall development and sectoral planning would have significantly improved,
as a result of improved analytical work, the availability of a more reliable and comprehensive data base, and
a body of technical expertise in relevant ministries able to integrate demographic factors into development
planning. Fifth, the Population Fund would help expand the capacity to deal with social sector issues by
encouraging increased participation of the private sector and NGO involvement in the population program.
14.           Proiect Ris!s. There are three main risks. First, it the current unstable political situation
were to persist, the population and family planning program may not continue to receive the same attention
and visibility that it currently enjoys. However, the open attitude that has come to prevail in the discussions
of these issues, as well as the track record of strong and broad-based suppor. for FP throughout the country,
are reasons to believe this is now a well-accepted item on the national agenda. Furthermore, the support
provided by this project for the establishment of a nationwide IEC program should help maintain population
issues as a high priority national concern. Second, the implementation of the decentralization strategy at the
departmental and district levels may be slow to materialize. It is expected that project interventions aimed
at improving the management, administrative and technical capacities of health personnel at the provincial
levels will mitigate this risk. Third, the redeployment of health personnel from the central to the regional
and district levels may not be achieved effectively. To minimize this risk, a personnel recruitment and
redeployment plan was discussed and agreed at negotiations; Government's adoption of the agreed plan is
a condition of effectiveness.
15.           Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
