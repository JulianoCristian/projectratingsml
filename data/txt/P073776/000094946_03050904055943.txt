1.1     Background of the Prolect
India has embarked on a 10-year highway transportation improvement program as a part
of the national policy to globalize its economy. National Highways comprise about 2% of
total road length in the country and carry over 40% of total traffic across the length and
breadth of the country. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) constituted under
the National Highways Authorities of India Act, is responsible for the development,
maintenance and management of National Highways in the country. One of the major
tasks mandated to NHAI is the implementation of National Highways Development
Project (NHDP) comprising of Golden Quadnlateral, North -South and East-West
corridors. The   golden   quadrilateral (GQ) comprises     of the   following   stretches
Stretch                    Length (Km)
Delhi - Calcutta                    1469

The proposed Allahabad Bypass, which is a part of Delhi-Calcutta stretch, starts at Km.
158 of NH-2 near Kokhraj and ends at Km.245 of NH-2 near Handia bypassing the
congested city of Allahabad. It is a part of consultancy Package III, which has a total
length of 202 km, starting from Khaga (Km 115) and ending at Varanasi (Krm 317).This
package has been divided into five construction packages as described below:

1.2   Need of By-pass for Allahabad Town
Over a period of time traffic volume has increased many fold on National Highway -2
due to increased traffic on NH-2 and merging of four other major roads, viz. NH-27
(connecting Rewa),SH-7(connecting Jaunpur), SH-9 (connecting Lucknow) and SH-47
(connecting Mirzapur) into Allahabad town .
Current Situation
As per the latest traffic census, the traffic volume on NH-2 on either side of Ahahabad
town is of the order of 8000-10000 PCUs whereas intensity of traffic within the city is of
the order of 25000-28000 PCUs of fast moving vehicles. This gives a fair idea of the
extent of mixed traffic passing through Allahabad town. Due to the increased traffic and
restricted width of carriage way operative speed in Allahabad town is of the order of 10
kmph on NH-2.
Needs Assessment
In order to achieve higher operative speed for traffic in future years the following options
were explored.
- Widening the existing NH-2 in city portion to four lanes;
- Construction of elevated structure in town above existing NH-2 carriageway; and
- Construction of Bypass.
The widening of National Highway - 2 in the town portion was not feasible due to the
following reasons.
1.    It could have resulted in massive destruction of properties displacement of
large no of people and resulting R&R problems.

2.    The construction of elevated structure was rejected due to financial and
environmental considerations. The construction of elevated structure would
have also reduced sun light to the households on either side of NH-2.
Therefore bypass to the city was found to be the most viable option. The present
alignment of bypass was adopted for detailed DPR after careful evaluation of various
alternative alignments. The details on "Selection of present alignment are covered in the
following section.
1.3   Selection of Present lignment (Analysis of Alternativel
Seven alternatives alignments were considered for the bypass of NH 2 for the Allahabad
town. Among these seven alternative alignments only one alignment (AS1) was on
southern side, five (AN1 through AN5), were on the northern side of Allahabad Town
and the seventh alternative is 14.5 km long elevated structure with four lane above the
existing National Highway within Allahabad town.
During the feasibility phase of the project, a separate study was undertaken for
finalization of the alignment and a separate report named as "Selection of Alternatives"
was prepared. For the selection of best alternative the relative merits of various
alternatives were assessed by a weighted marking scheme. The weights were allotted to
vartous factors which could influence the choice i.e., capital cost, scope of future
widening, land acquisition, user cost, impact on environment and suitability of alignment
etc. For each of these factors the vartous alternatives were marked on a scale of 1 to 5.
The marks were multiplied by various weights. The sum of weighted marks provided an
objective ranking of various alternatives. Numerical values to various factors were
assigned by consensus with experts in different fields and NHAI officials. The marks in
two categories namely capital cost and land acquisition were calculated numerically, but
other categories were arrived subjectively after discussion with various experts.
Based on described evaluation, alternative 'AN-4' was found to be the most viable
option. The detailed report of AN-4 has been submitted to the World Bank and this report
has been accepted. Therefore EIA of AN -4 was carried out by the DPR consultants.
1A    DPR Consultants
The detailed project report has been prepared by a Consortium consisting of SNC Lavalin
International and Gherzi Eastern Ltd for bypass construction packages ABP-2 and ABP-
3. M/s Tandon Consultants (P) Ltd. were associate consultants for Ganga Bridge package,
ABP-1. The environmental and social assessment for the project has been carried out by
M/s Gherzi Eastern Ltd, Kolkata. The consultants had first undertaken environmental
screening exercise to identify critical environmental issues of the project followed by
environmental impact assessment. The EIA preparation led to identification of potential
environmental hotspots and their feasible remedial measures (including avoidance,
mitigation and enhancements) which were made a part of environmental management
plan.

1.5   Independent Environmental Reviewers IIERJ
Since the project has been categorized as category 'A' project due to its cumulative
magnitude of social and environmental impacts, independent reviewers have been
appointed to review the EIA process as per operational directives of World Bank. The
independent reviewers is a consortium consisting of DHV Consultants and MDP
consultants (P) Ltd.; New Delhi. The Independent Review Consultants have reviewed and
strengthened the EIA report prepared by DPR consultants and accordingly revised the
EMP.
Approach & Methodology adopted
The scope of the present EMP includes review and strengthening of the earlier EMP by
adopting the following approach.
1.    Gap Analysis
2.    Addressal of the gaps through
Data verification
Physical verification through sample site visits
Collection and interpretation of required data
3.    Summarizing the EMP during construction and operation stage
4.    Identification of monitoring requirements
Initially gaps identification was carried out based on the report submitted by the
consultants. Subsequently, the site visit was undertaken to verify the identified gaps. This
was followed by the detailed discussion with the consultants, NHAI and other
government agencies. The implementation of EMP including reporting requirements for
the ongoing project by NHAI on Khaga Kokhraj section was also studied as a sample
during the site visit. Documents such as detailed project report (DPR), strip plans and
other drawings were studied and checked for incorporation into environmental
consideration of the project.
1.6   Deliverable
This report summarizes the EMP for the Ganga bridge from km 163.267 to km 164.280
(1.03 km). The following chapters describe the project, identified impacts, mitigation
measures and monitoring, reporting requirement, bills of quantities and budget required to
implement EMP. The appendix also describes a section on best practices to be followed
during construction of the bridge.

I2)PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.1     PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The total length of Allahabad bypass is 84.725 km and is divided into three construction
packages. It has been designed as an access controlled toll road with divided 4-lane
carriageway with provision of 6 - laning to cater to future traffic projections. The design
life of the project is 30 years. A 70 m Right of Way (RoW) has been proposed for the
project corridor with provisions of high embankments, interchanges, toll plaza, rest area,
etc. and 90 m RoW at appropriate places.
The three construction packages are as stated below:
ABP - 1:         Ganga bridge with river training work from km 163.267 to km
164.280 (1.03 kmn)
ABP- 2:          From km 158.000 to km 163.267 and km 164.280 to km 198.0
(38.987 km)
ABP - 3:         From km 198.0 to km 242.708 (44.708km)
2.1.1    Proposed Bypass Carrlageway Details

2.1.2    Descriptlon of Area and Terrain
Alignment along NH-2 on Existing ROW
The existing NH-2 from km 158 to 160 and km. 244 to 245 form part of this bypass
package. The terrain is flat and agriculture land and settlements about the RoW. The
culverts will be extended in the widening. The widening of these existing NH-2 portions
to four lanning is planned as a part of bypass. In order to accommodate the widening land
acquisition will be there. Major interchanges are planned at start point (km 160) and end
point of new RoW (km 242.0) to segregate the through traffic from local traffic. There are
three culverts in the portion between km 158 to 160 and two culverts in km 244 to 245
Alignment of Bypass on New ROW
The bypass takes off NH-2 alignment at km.160 and traverses in an east direction about 2
km along the existing NH 2 then turns north-east through the cultivated land. It crosses
Ganga River at Km. 163, and continues in the same direction upto km 167, crossing Doab

River (Km 166.362). From there it heads eastward crossings SH 38 at (Km. 185.544) and
Lucknow - Allahabad Rail link at Km 188.749.
From there it continues in north-east direction and crosses SH 9 at Km. 196.600 and
heads towards east to cross Pratapgarh-Allahabad Rail link at Km. 199.810. The
alignment now takes south-east direction crossing SH7 at Km. 216.816 and turns south
ward at Km. 230 to meet NH-2 at Km. 242.10 and ends at km. 245 of existing NH-2.
The area through which the new alignment of bypass passes is predominantly agricultural
land. As the bypass alignment passes through agriculture land there will be minimum
impact on human settlements. This agriculture land falls under irrigated category, due to
canal network, catering to four crops a year.

Environmental Setting
3.1    Environmental Setting
The entire area of Allahabad bypass lies in a sub-tropical region with marked monsoon effects. The broad
indicators defining the environmental setting of the study area are given below.
1. Air Quality (i.e. NOx, SO2 and RPM) along the bypass alignment is within permissible limit
prescribed by CPCB except SPM, which exceeding in few places. The predicted air quality based
on modeling and baseline studies indicates levels are also within CPCB liimts.
2. The surface water flow in the project area is in the direction of the Ganga River. Therefore, all
other existing river and streams flow from north of Ganga flow towards south and east while
those are present south of the Ganga flow north and east.
3. In general the ground water table of the study area varies between 10-15m. The water table also
varies in different seasons.
4. The topography of the area is plain.
5. The entire length of Allahabad bypass falls in Zone III with a seismic coefficient of 0.02. Hence
the area is relatively stable.
6. The soils in the area are of alluvial type, capable of producing high yields, largely due to the rich
soil nutrients deposited by the Ganga and its tributaries.
7. The predicted noise levels based on baseline surveys and modeling indicate that predicted noise
levels for day time are well within CPCB limits considering the traffic projection till 2026. Night
time noise levels exceed CPCB limits for the horizon year 2026 and 2036.
Though no change in the macro-climatic setting (precipitation, temperature and wind) is envisaged due to
the project, the microclimatic parameters are likely to be temporarily changed mainly by vegetation
removal and laying of pavement surface.

3.2    Generic Recommendations
The respective implementing agencies including NHAI, contractor & PIU etc. identified in earlier
section should follow the following recommendations.
Air Pollution:
Stock-piles
>  Mist sprays should be provided at appropriate places for preventing dust pollution during
handling and stockpiling of stones and loose earth.
>  Over Burden (OB) waste dumps shall be sprayed with water as they are the major source of air
bome particulate matter/dust.
O GB waste dumps shall be reclaimed/ afforested to bind the loose soil and to prevent soil erosion.
Haulage
>  Regular water spraying on haulage roads during transportation of construction material by
water sprinklers.
>  Transfer points for transporting construction material shall be provided with appropriate
hoods/chutes to prevent dust emissions.
> Dumping of construction material should be from an optimum height (preferably not too
high) so as to reduce the dust blow.
Occupational Noise Pollution Control
To keep the ambient noise levels within the permissible limits, the measures to be adopted are:
>  Innovative approaches of using improvised machinery designs, with in-built mechanism to
reduce sound emissions like improved silencers, mufflers and closed noise generating parts.
> Procurement of drill, loaders and dumpers and other equipment with noise proof system in
operator's cabin.
>  Confining the equipment with heavy noise emissions in sound proof cabins, so that noise is
not transmitted to other areas.
> Regular and proper maintenance of noise generating machinery including the transport
vehicles to maintain the noise levels.
>  Provision should be made for noise absorbing pads at foundations of vibrating equipment to
reduce noise emissions.
3.3    Disaster Management Plan
Emergencies may occur due to vanous reasons, like natural calamities i.e floods, construction/
operation related activity and spills due to accidents. The disaster management plan is aimed at
insuring the safety of the people, protecting the environment and equipment and property safety. This
plan summarizes identification of hazards, response and recommendations to mitigate and minimize
environmental emergencies. During construction stage, it is proposed that the environmental
coordinator act as emergency coordinator in case of emergency. He should be having the following
resources at his disposal at the time of emergency.

3.     MSDS
4.     Trained manpower
5.     Procedures for meeting emergency
Response System should address the following features/ issues
> All residents and employees need to be informed using the PA system to stay indoors and
not to use any roads crossing, which may get affected.
> The ambulance and fire tender need to be informed to be ready
> Emergency response team should be put on alert and district authorities to be notified if
any search and rescue operations need to be carried out.
> Once the water body is restored to its normal flow conditions then an overall assessment
of the damage caused due to the breach on people and property needs to be carried out.
>  All debris in the area needs to be cleared once the rescue operations have been carried out
Response due to fuel Leakage
>  The affected area should be evacuated and cordoned off immediately
>  Only trained and experienced emergency response team members approach the area
>  Inform electrical department to shut down power supply
>  Ensure that only concemed personnel are present in the affected area and all other
personnel and guests are moved to the nearest assembly points.
> Source of leakage to be traced and isolated from all the other areas. In case of a fire
follow the instructions in case of fire.
Response in case of Fire
>  On sighting a fire the first person should immediately inform the nearest resource center/
and the exact location and type of fire in detail.
>  If the fire is small engage in extinguishing the fire using the nearest fire extinguisher.
>  Move the staff to the emergency assembly point.
>  The control room will immediately inform the first aid Center and the quick response
team which consists of trained fire fighting personnel.
>  Mobilize the fire tender.
>  The Quick Response team will immediately move to the point of fire and take all
necessary steps to stop the fire. If the fire is beyond control and spreads further then
immediately inform the security post who would in turn inform the district authorities and
call for extemal help.
>  First aid team will provide immediate relief to the injured personnel or guests at the scene
of incident.

Recommendation for NHAI
The NHAI, the primary organisation entrusted with the responsibility of developing and maintaining
the highways and road network of India, have a very important role to play in the prevention of
accidents on the highway, information dissemination and contact information of emergency response
agencies.
O They must conduct a study of accident history based on accident records maintained by the police,
along these stretches to see any patterns of frequently occurring accidents at certain accident
points. NHAI should take measures to reduce such accidents by adopting one or more of the
following actions - assess the condition of the road at/near the point to assess the cause of
accidents.
O Take adequate measures to address accidents, install warming signs for speed check/no overtaking
etc.
o Information boards giving contact details of hospital, ambulance, fire brigade, police and other
facilities should be erected along the highway at appropriate distances.
L At an appropriate distance from population pockets along the highway, boards, warming drivers of
crossing pedestrians and live stock should be erected.
L Boards should also be erected before population pockets giving contact details of emergency
facilities in the population pockets.
O NHAI must ensure that land close to the highway are not allowed to be unduly populated by
commercial activity but land allocation preference should be given to service establishments like
tire repair shops, mechanics, public call offices (PCO), rest rooms, spare parts shops etc.
O They must ensure that warning sign boards are erected at all dangerous curves, embankments,
bridges, road repairs works, crossings and other such places thait increase accident probability.
3A     Monitoring Program
The monitoring program is an important element of EMP to test the efficacy of Impact assessment and
mitigation measures and to achieve the desired environmental quality both during construction and
operation phase of the project. The broad objective of the monitoring program is as follows.
1.     Monitoring to meet the compliance
2.     Effects monitoring
The purpose of the monitoring program is to ensure that the envisaged objectives of the project are
achieved. To ensure the effective implementation of the EMP, it is essential that an effective
monitoring program be designed and carried out. The broad objectives are
*  To evaluate the performance of mitigation measures proposed in the EMP
*  To evaluate the adequacy of Environmental Impact Assessment
*  To suggest improvements in management plan, if required
*  To enhance environmental quality
*  To satisfy the legal and community obligations.
The monitoring program lays the basic framework for quantitative evaluation of impacts. This
evaluation is based on monitoring of performance evaluation indicators.
3A.1   Performance Indicators (Pis)

Noise level Monitoring
The measurements for monitoring noise levels would be carried out at all designated locations along
all contract package in accordance to the Ambient Noise Standards formulated by Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) in 1989. These standards have been described in table 3.4. Sound pressure
levels would be monitored on twenty-four hour basis. Noise should be recorded at a "A" weighted
frequency using a " slow time response mode" of the measuring instrument. The location, duration
and the noise pollution parameters will be monitored and the responsible institutional arrangements
are detailed out in the following sections.

Soil Contamination
Contamination of the soil, especially due to increased levels of Pb, Cd and Cr are likely due to the
increased traffic movement on the project corridor. The comparison of the concentrations of these
parameters before and after the project will aid in arriving at the increase in concentrations of these
heavy metals, if any.
The monitoring plan for the various performance indicators of the project in the construction and
operation stages is summarized in table 3.5.

Reporting Arrangements
41        Introduction
The Monitoring and Evaluation of the performance indicators are critical activities in
implementation of the Project. Monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain
weather activities are going according to the plans. It provides the necessary feedback for
project management to keep the program on schedule. The rationale for a reporting
system is based on accountability to ensure that the measures proposed as part of the
Environmental Management Plan get implemented in the project. Therefore there is a
need for evaluation of institutional capacity of the stakeholders including the organization
structure and reporting structure. This chapter summarizes the existing institutional
structure, proposed reporting structure and training needs for NHAI for implementing
EMP.
42        ExIsting Institutional Arrangements
The existing organization structure of NHAI and other stakeholders is summarized in the
following section. NHAI has an organization structure at the corporate and project level.
The reporting structure between the two levels is shown in the following figure.
Corporate Level
The NHAI, through the member (WB) will be responsible for the effective
implementation of the project activities. The member is assisted by a General Manager
(WB) and the Project Directors of the various project packages, Separate NHAI units,
Project Implementation Unit (PIU') with a Project Director as its head have been
established for each of these packages. International consultants have been appointed for
carrying out the feasibility study and preparation of the Detailed Project Reports and
designs for four-laning, of the project packages.
Prolect ImPlementatlon Units
These are separate NHAI units established at the project locations for each of the project
packages, with a Project Director (PD) as its head. The Project Director is assisted on all
technical issues related to environment and R&R by a manager. The various Project Directors, in
turn report to the General Manager (WB), who is responsible for the co-ordination of the project
preparation activities of the various project packages.

The review of the preparation of the Environmental and Social assessments for the project
and ensuring effective implementation of the Environmental Management Plan/
Resettlement Action Plan will be carried out by the GM (Environment) at Corporate
office in due consultation with the manager (environment) and manager (R&R) at PIU.
Environmental Unit at the NHAI Corporate
NHAI, primarily betng a road agency, till recent past did not have the capacity to address
the environmental/social issues likely to result because of the project. To assess, advise
and monitor the environmental performance of the various projects being planned,
designed and implemented by the NHAI, an Environmental and social development
(ESDU) has been established at the Corporate Office of the NHAI. The Environmental
Unit is headed by the General Manager (Environment), and is assisted by ONE Deputy
General Manager (DGM) and one manager.
The Environmental Unit is responsible for the co-ordination of the environmental and
social issues of the various project packages and shall work in close interaction with the
environmental managers at the various PlUs.
In association with



Consolidated Environmental Management Plan for ABP-1 (Ganga Bridge) of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
4.3   Other Stakeholders
The other stakeholders, which assist NHAI include DPR consultants, independent
reviewers, supervision consultants, NGO's and contractors.
DPR Consultants
The DPR Consultants assist the PIU during project preparation. The Environmental and
Social experts of the DPR consultants have been responsible for the preparation of EA as
per the ToR approved by the World Bank. The major inputs of the DPR consultants ends
with submission of draft documents. However, their technical inputs continue for the
entire project duration on a limited scale.
Independent Reviewers
Since Allahabad bypass project has been categorised category 'A' project due to
cumulative environmental and social impacts, therefore, independent reviewers have been
appointed. The reviewers reviewed the environmental and social assessments carried out
by the DPR consultants and have identified missing gaps These missing gaps have been
rectified and consolidated environmental and social assessment have been submitted to
the World Bank and NHAI along with Independent Review report.
Supervision Consultants (SC)
The project envisages the use of Supervision Consultants for the implementation stage to
assist the PIU during construction stage. The SC will assume the role of the Engineer and
will have the powers and responsibility for the approval of bills, etc. normally vested with
the client. These consultants will be selected through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) and it is expected that they will have substantial capability to supervise the
implementation of the environmental component of the project as part of their
assignment. Implicitly, the construction supervision consultants are expected to have
specialists to advice and co-ordinate implementation of the measures developed as part of
the Environmental Management Plans for various construction packages of the Allahabad
bypass.
Non-Governmental Organisations
The provisions envisaged in the RAP shall be implemented by Non-Governmental
Organisations contracted for the purpose by the PIU. Their mandate is to monitor the
progress and implementation of the proposed measures. A representative of the NGO will
also be a part of the District Level Committee which will decide the replacement value of
land and properties to be acquired. One representative of the NGO will also be a part of
the Grievance Redressal Committee for each district.
Contractors
The execution of the works will be responsibility of the contractor. Three contractors will
be appointed by International Competitive Bids (ICB) for the three packages of this
project. It is expected that the environmental measures will also be implemented by the
same contractors who will execute the road and bridge work It will be ensured that each
contractor  will  have  enough  environmental/social  expertise  to  incorporate
In association with



Consolidated Environmental Management Plan for ABP-1 (Ganga Bridge) of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
environmentally-sensitised construction practices. Though each contractor will have a set-
up for executing works specified in the EMP, it is expected that staff will be appointed to
implement EMP for the successful completion of the works entrusted.
44    Institutonal Needs Assessment
Need for further Strengthening of NHAI - ESDU at Corporate Office
There is a need to strengthen the ESDU unit by inducting manpower as many projects are
going simultaneously. Additional social and environmental managers need to be inducted
to assist GM environment. This induction should be according to HR pollcy of NHAI.
Need for additional capacity
During the implementation stage, construction will proceed simultaneously on the 3 sub
packages of Package III. It has been estimated that the present resources of the PIU will
be extremely stretched due to overlap of construction activities. It is therefore
recommended that a separate environmental manager be inducted at PIU level since
manager technical looking after environmental aspects will find it difficult to cope up
with the implementation work of the project.
4.5   Proposed Set-up
The proposed set up for project envisages to cover the following aspects.
*  Strengthening the environmental component of the PIU and ESDU
*  Associate the other stakeholders in the existing team in order to implement the
provisions of the Environmental Management Plan
*  Integrated approach to implement EMP &-RAP
*  Monitor & upgrade EMP
Institutional Setting for the Project
Important issues and recommendations relevant to their identified role & responsibilities
in the project implementation is presented in the following sections.
Prolect Implementation Unit
*  Strengthening of NHAI's PIU environment team   by recruiting at least one
environmental manager responsible for looking after environment issues.
*  PIR needs to identify laboratories approved by UP Pollution Control Board and

Box 4-1: Draft Terms of Reference for Supervision Consultants' Environmental Specialist
The Allahabad Bypass Road Project, financed by the World Bank, integrates environmental and social
Issues in the planning and design of the Htghway. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been
prepared for each construction package and is Integrated in the technical specification and contract
documents. The prime duty of the Environmental Specialist is to supervise the implementation of the EMP
by the Contractors and to ensure that the day-to-day construction activities are carried out in an
environmentally sound and sustainable basis. The scope includes development of environmental
procedures and good construction practices, development and delivery of training programs, etc.
Qualifications and Experience
. A civil engineer preferably with postgraduate specialization in environmental engineering.
. 12 years of working experience related to the integration of environmental and social issues in the
design, construction and operation of transport projects. Experience in construction management and
operational maintenance of highways is preferred.
Principal Duties
. Supervise the implementation of the EMP by the Contractors.
. Hold regular consultation meetings with the environmental managrat PIU
. Review the Contractors' Environmental Implementation Plans to ensure compliance with the
Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
. Organise periodic environmental training programmes and workshops for the staff of the Contractors,
Construction Supervision Consultants and the Project Implementation Units (PIU).
. Develop good practices construction guidelines to assist the contractors in implementing the EMP.
. Monitor tree plantation programmes and the periodic environmental monitoring (air, noise, water, etc.)
programmes to ensure compliance with the Statutory requirements and the EMP.

Enuironmental Reportng System lERSI
Environmental monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain whether environmental
activities are going according to the EMP. It provides the necessary feedback for project
management to keep the program on schedule. The evaluation is essentially a summing
up of the project assessment of whether those activities have actually achieved their
outcomes. The important features of ERS are summarized below.
*  The reporting system will operate linearly with the contractor who is at the lowest
rung of the implementation system. The contractor will report to the Supervision
Consultant, who in turn shall report to the PIU and Environmental and Social
Development unit of NHAI at corporate office.
*  All reporting by the contractor and Supervision Consultant shall be on a quarterly
basis.
*  The ESDU in association with PIU shall be responsible for preparing targets for
each of the identified EMP activities.
*  All subsequent reporting by the contractor shall be monitored as per the targets set
by them before the contractors move on to the site.
*  The compliance monitoring and the progress reports on environmental
components may be clubbed together and submitted to the ESDU at corporate
office and PIU, quarterly during the implementation period.
*  The operation stage monitoring reports may be annual or biannual, provided the
Project Environmental Completion Report shows that the implementation was
satisfactory.
* During the implementation period, a compliance report may include description of
the items of EMP, which were not complied with by any of the responsible
agencies. This would help in rationalising the implementation of the EMP during
the remaining duration of implementation. Solutions for further effective
implementation should also come out as a result of the compliance monitoring
reports.
*  Responsibilities for overseeing will rest with the Supervision Consultant's staff
reporting to the PIU and ESDU corporate office.
*  Capacity to quantitatively monitor relevant ecological parameters would be an
advantage but monitoring will primarily involve ensuring that actions taken are in
accordance with contract and specification clauses, and specified mitigation
measures as per the EMP.
* Photographic records will also be established to provide useful environmental
monitoring tools.

*   A full record will be kept as part of normal contract monitoring. Reporting and
Monitoring Systems for various stages of construction and related activities have
been proposed to ensure timely and effective implementation of the EMP.
The reporting system has been prepared for each of the stage of road construction namely:
- Pre construction stage
- Construction Stage
- Operation Stage
This reporting shall be done through:
- Reporting by the Contractor to the SC
- Reporting by SC to PIU/ EDSU
The stage-wise reporting system is detailed out in the following Table 4.1.

The formats for the reporting of the various environmental issues through the various
stages of the project implementation are annexed to the individual EMPs.
Internalizing Environmental Exuertise In the NHAI
It is expected that NHAI will develop internal capability over the next decade in the
highways sector in India, which needs to be fully internalsed. It is important that there
should be substantial environmental capacity beyond the staff, directly responsible for
implementing the EMP in different projects. This may be achieved through training and
dissemination of information.

4.        Operationalisation
Operationalization of the environmental setup for this project would involve the
following aspects. These are:
-  Identification and appointment of Staff
-  Procurement of NGOs, supervision consultants, contractors and other agencies
responsible for implementation
Each of these aspects is described below.
Identification and Appointment of Staff
At the project level, the PIU has already been functional. Three managers (engineers) are
already working for the project's environmental and social components. An additional
managerial staff will be inducted when implementation begins. It would be advantageous
if this manager has post-graduate qualifications in Environmental Engineering or previous
experience on environmental related activities of road projects.
Procurement of NGOs and other Agencies
NHAI will appoint the NGO's to implement the RAP provisions. NHAI will procure the
services of any other agency, such as educational institutions for monitoring, if found
essential, during the implementation stage.
Supervision Consultants (SC)
The NHAI will appoint supervision consultant selected through International Competitive
Bid (ICB)
Contractors
Three separate contractors need to be appointed for the three sub construction packages.
These contractors will be appointed through international competitive bids.
Training
The ESDU at the NHAI headquarters and the PIU, responsible for the implementation of
EMP, need to be trained on the effective implementation of the environmental issues. To
ensure the success of the proposed implementation set up, there is a need for training and
skill upgradation.
As part of the TNHP and GTRIP project different training program have been worked out
by NHAI to incorporate the project as well as the intermediate - term capacity building
needs of the NHAI.
Looking into the potential requirements of each of the target groups, following training
modules are suggested as part of ABP.

construction of such projects. The major emphasis is on resource conservation, resource
recovery and recycling so that the minimum quantity of waste is generated. These
practices can be modified according to prevailing construction conditions at the time of
execution of project.
1.      Vegetation Clearance
Vegetation clearance shall comprise uprooting of vegetation, grass, brushwood, shrubs,
stumps, trees and saplings of girth upto 30 cm. measured at a height of one meter above
the ground level. Where only clearance of grass is involved it shall be measured and paid
for separately. The procedure/ steps involved for uprooting, skating and felling trees are
described below
1.1     Uprooting of Vegetation
*  The roots of trees and saplings shall be removed to a depth of 60 cm. Below
ground level or 30 cm. below formation level or 15 cm below sub grade level,
whichever is lower.
*  All holes or hollows formed due to removal of roots shall be filled up with earth
rammed and leveled.
*  Trees, shrubs, poles, fences, signs, monuments, pipe lines, cables etc. within or
adjacent to the area, which are not required to be disturbed during vegetation
clearance shall be properly protected by the contractor at his own cost.
1.2     Staking and Disposal
*  All useful materials obtained from clearing and grubbing operation shall be staked
in the mannler as directed by the Engineer.
*  Trunks and branches of trees shall be cleared of limbs and tops and stacked neatly
at places indicated by the Engineer- in - charge. These materials shall be the
property of the Government.
*  All unserviceable materials are disposed off in such a manner that there is no
likelihood of getting mixed up with the materials meant for construction.
