I. Introduction 
1.  This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Regional Vice President, South Asia to 
introduce changes in the Allahabad Bypass Project (ABP, P073776, Loan 4719-IN) 
and the accompanying amendments to the project’s legal documents. 
 
2.  The Part B, corridor management component of the project, as originally envisaged, 
involved piloting of performance based management contract and procurement of 
advanced traffic management and tolling equipment on selected sections of Golden 
Quadrilateral (GQ). However, due to a policy shift by Government of India (GOI) / 
National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) in 2006 to further widen the GQ to a 
six lane configuration, the component and the associated Bank financing for the 
component has become irrelevant. On the other hand, the Part A, bypass 
construction component has undergone some implementation delays and marginal 
cost overrun. The NHAI / GOI has request to reallocate the loan amount originally 
allocated for the corridor management component (USD 16.07 million) to the 
bypass construction Component. The project needs to be restructured to effect 
exclusion of the corridor management component from the project scope and 
reallocate the loan amount to the Bypass Construction component.    
 
3.  The proposed changes, involving exclusion of one of the project components and 
reallocation across components, would constitute a second order project 
restructuring. The restructuring is aimed towards utilizing the loan amount allocated 
for the corridor management Component, which would otherwise remain unutilized. 
Moreover, by reallocating the loan amount to the bypass construction component, 
the marginal overrun in civil works can be met and achievement of development 
objective can be enhanced.

Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Progress towards Achievement of 
PDOs. 
 
The primary project development objectives are to reduce the transport constraints on 
national economic activity and improve institutional capabilities to manage road 
Page  6
3
programs, assets and services on an increasingly commercial basis. The civil works are 
expected to be substantially completed and the facility opened to traffic by mid June 
2009. The bypass is expected to provide a 60% time savings (one hour travel time vis a 
vis two and half hours through the existing highway stretch) and would indeed 
significantly contribute to reduction of transport constraints on the Delhi 
–
Kolkata 
corridor. On the other hand, combined with other institutional activities undertaken under 
the two predecessor national Highway loans, Third national Highway Project and Grand 
Trunk Road Improvement Project, the road user satisfaction surveys have improved 
NHAI’s user focus and asset management capabilities on a more commercial basis. The 
progress towards achievement of the Project Development Objectives is therefore 
considered as satisfactory.               
 
6. 
Project Implementation Progress 
 
The project implementation progress is being currently rated as satisfactory. The Project 
has three components – (a) Bypass Construction, (b) Corridor Management, and (c) 
Institutional Strengthening. The completion of component (a) has advanced 94% and it is 
expected that the bypass will achieve substantial completion and opened to traffic by mid 
June 2009. The component (c) has only one activity – the road user satisfaction surveys. 
This component has also progressed satisfactorily considering one round of user 
satisfaction surveys were completed in 2006, results were widely disseminated and 
integrated in NHAI operations and the second round of surveys are in progress. The 
implementation progress on component (c) has, however, been rated as moderately 
unsatisfactory as the implementation could not commence following GOI / NHAI policy 
change on further widening of GQ. It is now proposed to exclude this component from 
the scope of the project.  
 
Specific Reasons and Rationale for Project Restructuring:
7.  The following factors make a strong case for the proposed project restructuring: 
a. 
Non-utilization of the loan allocated for the Corridor Management 
component. 
In 2006 NHAI took a policy decision to further widen the Golden 
Quadrilateral to six lane configuration on a Build Operate Transfer (BOT) basis. 
Due to this decision, the corridor management component, originally planned to 
be implemented in selected sections of GQ, has become irrelevant. The activities 
included under this component would now be implemented through the BOT 
concessions and the loan amount would remain unutilized. The proposed 
restructuring would provide an opportunity to exclude the component from the 
scope of the project and reallocate the loan amount (USD 16.07 million) to the 
marginally fund-deficient bypass construction component. 
 
b. 
 Marginal Cost overrun in Bypass Construction Component. 
Due to the 
initial delays in land acquisition and utility relocation, the Bypass construction 
component has undergone time and cost overrun. It is now estimated that the 
overall cost increase for this component, with respect to the original PAD 
estimate, could be about USD 41.0 million. While NHAI is ready to bridge this 
financing gap from the GOI counterpart funding, the unutilized loan for the 
Page  7
4
corridor management component could contribute to bridging of this gap. Under 
the circumstances, reallocation of the loan amount from corridor management to 
the Bypass construction will be the best use of the unutilized loan amount.  
 
III. Proposed Changes 
Changes in Project Development Objectives
8. 
The originally stated Project Development Objective would remain the same as “to 
reduce transport constraints on national economic activity, and to improve 
institutional capabilities to manage road program, assets and services on an 
increasingly commercial basis”. The Bank has supported the Government of India’s 
(GoI) National Highways Development Program (NHDP) through four projects.  
Already closed projects TNHP and GTRIP and the current project together finance 
capacity expansion on a continuous stretch of about 980 km of National Highway 2 
(NH-2) between Agra in Uttar Pradesh and Barwa Adda in Jharkhand.  The subject 
three projects also support various institutional strengthening actions for NHAI and 
Department of Road Transport and Highways (DoRTH).  Development Objectives 
for these three projects are essentially similar. All key studies on Institutional 
Strengthening (IS), establishment of Road Information System (RIS), and 
formulation of
 
Corridor Management (CM) Strategy have been completed under the 
preceding projects.
 
NHAI has successfully entered into a number of PPP road 
concessions utilizing its own resources, and the various studies and activities 
supported by these Bank funded projects have made important contributions to the 
development and evolution of new policies and practices. Exclusion of the corridor 
management component would therefore not necessitate any change in project 
development objective.    
9.  The description of the outcome indicators or the target values need not be modified 
as well. The outcome indicator related to the corridor management component is 
“increased private sector participation in the operations and maintenance of national 
Highways.” Although the corridor management component is excluded from the 
scope of the project, the bypass is being developed as an access controlled facility 
to be operated by a private agency through a long term operation and maintenance 
contract. Moreover, as already explained in the preceding paragraph that NHAI has 
already successfully entered into a number of PPP road concessions for 
development and operation and maintenance of the network and the various studies 
and activities supported by the preceding Bank funded projects have contributed to 
this. It can, therefore, be concluded that the outcome indicator related to the 
corridor management remains fully relevant and achievable notwithstanding 
deletion of the component from the project scope.         
Changes in Project Design, Scope, and Costs
10. The following changes in the project scope are proposed: 
a. 
Exclusion of Corridor Management Component 
–
This entails exclusion of 
the part B, Corridor management Component of the Project. The originally 
envisaged cost for this component as mentioned in the PAD was USD 21.19 
Page  8
5
million and the loan allocation was USD 16.07 million. The loan allocation 
constituted of works amounting to USD 6.93 million and goods for the balance of 
USD 9.14 million.  
b. 
Reallocation from Corridor Management to Bypass Construction 
Component 
–
The entire amount of loan savings of USD 16.07 million, resulting 
from cancellation / exclusion of the corridor management component is proposed 
to be fully reallocated to the Bypass Construction under the civil works category.  
11.

Procurement Plan
.
The procurement plan has already been modified and agreed 
with the Bank to reflect the change in scope of the project. The procurement plan is 
attached as Annexure 1 to the Project Paper. There will be no further procurement 
activity under this loan.  
13. 
Closing Date and Implementation Schedule
 
–
The current loan closing date is June 
30, 2009 and no loan extension is envisaged. The civil works component has 
achieved 92% progress and expected to be substantially completed before June 
2009. The bypass is expected to be opened to traffic by mid May 2009. No 
modification in the implementation schedule is expected on account of the project 
restructuring.  
IV. 
Appraisal/Analysis of Restructured Project Activities
14. The proposed restructuring does not raise the environmental category of the project. 
The classification remains as Category A under the Bank’s OP 4.01. There are no 
new environmental safeguard policies triggered.  
15. 
The restructuring would not involve any additional procurement and 
implementation of the civil works is nearing completion.  
16. The proposed project restructuring does not involve any exceptions to Bank 
policies. 
17. The original PAD estimate for net project benefits was US $ 554 million. With the 
current increase in costs of civil works to the extent of about 15%, the net benefits 
get reduced to about US $ 520 million. However, even with this reduced net benefit, 
the project remains to be strongly viable with a Net Present value (NPV) of about 
US $ 6.5 million / km.     
V. Expected 
Outcomes
18. The proposed changes do not alter the original PDOs and outcome indicators as 
explained earlier. Moreover, with the loan reallocation from corridor management 
to the bypass construction component the possibility of full achievement of the 
originally intended project outcome would improve.  
 
VI. 
Benefits and Risks
Page  10
7
19. Benefits 
–
Major benefit from the project restructuring would be the effective 
utilization of the savings accrued from cancellation of the Corridor management 
Component from the scope of the project.  
20. Restructuring Risks – The loan is scheduled to close on June 30, 2009 and the 
project implementation is in a very advanced stage of completion. The proposed 
restructuring would not involve any new procurement or expanded implementation 
and as such will not entail any enhanced governance, management and results-
delivery risks.
