T he common property resources, which require enhancements and relocations, have been
identified by the NGOs. Such properties have been identified which are close to the
highway, and can improve the aesthetic quality of the corridor. Accordingly, SiWe-specific
plans for all the Common property resources are now in place. The common property
and religious structures have not only been relocated but some enhancement measures
have also been adopted like providing drinking water facilities, paved access, cemented
platforms etc. The proposals have been worked out in consultation with the local people.

Appendix 5
Guidelines for Borrow Area
Borrow area will be finalized from the list of locations recommended by DPR consuklnt in
DPR/ EIA report. Locations near to ABP 11 stretch are shown in Appendix 6.
The contractor will finalize the borrow area locations and will get approval frnm the
Environmental Expert of supervision Consultant The borrowing operation will not be carried
out in cultivable lands, unless and until it agreed upon by the Environmental Expert of 
Supervision Consultants that there is no suitable uncultivable land in the vicinity for bornwing,
or there are private land owners willing to allow borrowing on their fields.
Borrow area will be finalized based on the-following criteria:
-   *   sufficient quantity of suitable soil is available from the borrow pit
*  the borrow areas are as close to the proposed alignment road as far as possible
* the loss of productive and fertile agricultural soil is minimum
* there is minimum loss of vegetation.
The contractor will ensure that the excavation from identified borrow area will be direded by
following principles:
Borrow areas located in non cultivable lands
1. Borrowing of earth will be carried out up to a depth of 1.0 m from the existing ground level.
2. Borrowing of earth will not be done continuously throughout the stretch.
3. Ridges of not less than 8 m width will be left at intervals not exceeding 300 m.
4. Small drains will be cut through the ridges, if necessary, to facilitate drainage.
5. The slope of the edges will be maintained not steeper than 1:4 (vertical: horizontal).
Borrow areas located in cultivated lands
1. The contractor will obtain the prior permission of the Environmental Expert of Supervision
Consultants.
2. The preservation of topsoil will be carried out in a stockpile.
3. A 15 cm top soil will be stripped off from the borrow pit and this will be stored in stocpiles
in a designated area for height not exceeding 2 m and side slopes not steeper tban 1:2
(Vertical: horizontal).
3. The depth of borrow pits will not be more than 30 cm after stripping the 15 cm topsoil aside.
Borrow areas located in elevated lands
At location where private owners desire their fields to be leveled, the borrowing shall be done to
a depthi of not more than I m or up to the level of surrounding fields.
Borrow areas near river sides
Borrow area near to any surface water body will be at least at a distance of 15 m from the mDe of
the bank or high flood level, whichever is maximum.
Borrow areas near settlements
1. Borrow pit location will be located at least 0.75-km form villages and settlements. If
In assocd on wtl
77 1 4"I w~



Environmental Management Plan for ABP-I1 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
unavoidable, the pit will not be dug for more than 30 cm and drains will be cut to facilitate
drainage.
2. Borrow pits located in such locations will be re-developed immediately after borrowing is
completed. If spoils are dumped, that will be covered with a layer of stockpiled topsoil in
accordance with compliance requirements with respect to MOEF/UPPCB guidelines.
The contractor will facilitate inspection, supervision and monitoring of all borrow anas by the
Environmental Expert of Supervision Consultants and PIU, NHAI and fulfill all environmental
compliance. Any non-compliance will be the Contractor's liability.
Before start up of activity in borrow area, the contractor will consult the owner of the land, prepare a
report as per the reporting format given in appendix 4. The contractor will make an agreement in
writing with owner and collect necessary clearances and permissions from Environmental Expert of
Supervision Consultants before starting work.
A redevelopment plan will also be prepared by the contractor before starting the work and will be
approved by the Environmental Expert of Supervision Consultants. The redevelopment plan will
include the following:
* Description of the borrow area including dimensions and area to be filled
* Assessment of baseline conditions that include soil type, distribution, land use, vegetation
cover and slope aspects
* Time schedule for implementation Detail of monitoring plan.
Redevelopment of borrow areas will be taken up in accordance with the plans approved by the
Environmental Expert of Supervision Consultant. Preferable redevelopment of used up pwitions will
start simultaneously.
The contractor will keep record of photographs of various stages i.e., before using materials
from the location (Pre-project), for the period of borrowing activities (Constructio phase)
and after rehabilitation (post development phase), to ascertain the pre and post borrowing
status of the area.
The Environmental Expert of Supervision Consultants will regularly inspect these areas (to check
borrowing and redevelopment activities) at a frequency specified in monitoring plan.
Borrow areas might be used for aquaculture incase landowner wants such development. In that case,
such borrow area will be photographed after their post use restoration and Environment Expert of
Supervision Consultants will certify the post use redevelopment.

Environmental Mfanagement Plan for ABP-II of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
Annexure-9
Tree Plantation Strategy along Allahabad bypass
One of the most effective, economical and useful remedies for control of environmental
pollution is tree plantation. Plants purify air by assimilating carbon dioxide and releasing
oxygen thus keeps check on the vehicular pollution on road and its surroundings. It also
helps in soil and water conservation, and offers shades. Big foliage trees also help in
reducing noise and dust pollution.
The main objectives of planting along the proposed Bypass road are as follows:
I. To reduce the impacts of air and dust pollution
2. To provide shade on glaring hot road surface during summer
3. To reduce the impact of vehicular noise caused due to movement of vehicles
4. To arrest soil erosion at the embankment slopes
5. Beautification of tlle project corridor by planting selective ornamental trees,
landscaping and turfing with grasses and shrubs
6. Prevention of glare from the headlight of incoming vehicles
The plantation scheme prepared for Allahabad bypass in accordance with the plantation
strategy of GTRIP and TNHP to maintain the harmony in roadside plantation along the
NH-2.
Species Selected for the Plantation
The plant species are selected based on the climatic condition, soil characteristics and
conditions of the strip like usar / water logged areas etc. The first row along the main
carriage way will be of shade plants. Similarly, subsequent rows will comprise of
ornamental and flowering species. Mainly native deciduous species, which retain their
foliage longest, with high crown forms, resistant to fungus and insects with rapid growth
rate are selected for avenues. Lists of the species recommended as shade plants for avenues
are given below (Table 1.1):

Species for Median
Main purpose of plantation at median is beautification and prevent glare from the
headlights of incoming vehicles. At present four lanes divided carriageway will be
constructed and the land for the future expansion (ultimate 3-lane, six lane divided
carriageway) will be left on the both sides of the 5 m wide median. Hence, now 12 m
wide medians will be available for plantation. Low height trees, and shrubs are
suggested for the 5 m wide central part (original median) and 3.5 m (future lane) wide
strip on the both side of the medians respectively. The low height tree species
recommended for median are listed in the Table 2.1 and list of the shrubs are presented
in Table 2.2.

Plantation Scheme
The proposed plantation schemes has been broadly classified into 3 categories which
are as follows:
(i)   Tree plantating along the main carriage way
(ii)   Low height trees and shrubs on the medians
(iii)  Grass turfing on the median and at the embanlanent slope
A. Tree Planting along the Main Carriage Way:
The technical specifications for planting along the main carriageway are as follows:
(i)   Row of Shade Plants
*     Distance from edge of shoulder:  6 m.
*     Spacing between plant-to-plant:  12 m.
*     Size of the pits:
Normal site -             60 x 60 x 60 cms.
Alkaline soil (Usar)-     1.25 m. deep x 0.35 m dia
Water logged areas-       Mounds with 60 cm top and 100 cm.
Base height varying depending on
the water level
*     Species recommended:         List of species provided in Table 1.
*     Number of plants per km.:    84 (Approximately I tree/ 12 m.)
*     Activity and time schedule:  As per Table 3
*     Height of the plant:         Not less than 2 m.

Environmental Management Plan for ABP-11 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
*     Age of the Plant:            Not less than 3 years
Soil along the Allahabad bypass is alkaline in certain patches (pH 7.9-9.9), mainly after
chainage 200 kin, where pH is more than 8. In many locations calcium carbonate rich
Kankars are also present. In location where really bad patch of usar occurs, it is
suggested to dug deep pits by auger (mechanical device) to break the Kankar pan down
below and replacing it by good quality soil. The soil amender Gypsum I to 3 kg
depending on the pH along with 2 kg compost and sand are recommended to fill the pits.
This treatment is required to lowering down the pH and thus enabling better survival of
plants.
It is proposed to use the same species on either side of a road for at least 5 m or so. This
will secure regularly grown avenues of the same form and type. Such avenues will
mature at about the same time, give pleasant avenue appearance and can be replaced
with minimum sacrifice.
To provide ample growing space for most species an average spacing of 12 m is
suggested for 84 plants per km.
Protection Measures:
Barbed wire fencing around the plantation area will be provided to protect the plants.
Angle iron will be fixed at a spacing of 5 m. and 3-stand barbed wire will be stretched.
B.   Plantation on the Median:
The low height trees will be planted in the original median (5 m wide central part)
leaving 1.5 m from the edge. Outer part of the median with a width of at least I m. will
be left for flowering shrubs (plants listed in Table 2) and rest of the part (0.005 m at the
edge and 0.600 m on either side of central drain ) will have only grasses to strengthen
the surface.
Technical speciflcation Tree Planting along the Median
Distance from edge of
shoulder of original median         1.5 m.
Spacing between plant to plant:     3 m.
Size of the pits:
Normal soil-                    45 x 45 x 45 cms
Alkaline soil-                  1.25 m deep x 0.35m. dia
Water logged areas-             Mounds with specifications as given
for shade plants

Species recommended:               As per Table 2.1
No. of plants per km:              333 (for each row)
Height of the plants:              More than I m.
Age of the Plants:                 Not less than 3 years
Precautionary Measures:
* Plantation will be made in the monsoon months (July -August)
* The height of the plants should not be less than 1 ft. and should be in polythene
bags and these are not to be removed until the moment of planting
e All plants supplied must be planted within three days of removal from the nursery
* The contractor will be required to water the area in case of insufficient rains after
planting
* 2 kgs of compost / manure are suggested for each pit before plantation
Shrubs and Grass Turfing
Mainly grasses and shrubs, which are suggested on the both side of the median drain
and at the edge of the original median to provide a strong surface cover, needs a well-
prepared surface. Therefore, it is suggested to remove all loose debris, fill up all
convexities and concavities by good soil to level the median before planting. To ensure
better growth and survival of grasses and shrubs, surface should have sufficient layer of
good quality soil (up to 45 cms).
C. Turfing with Grasses:
Grass lines are used to provide a strong surface cover at the slope but it also needs a
well-prepared surface in which to be planted. If grass is to be an effective form, then it
must be allowed to establish properly on a slope which does not subject to undue stress
from erosion and mass movement in its initial stages. To ensure this following
measures are suggested for the grass turfing:
* A cover of 25 grams of grass seed per square m. of surface will be prepared
* Bed will be prepared in June. The seed sowing must be carried out before the
onset of monsoon so that they yield desired results. Till the onset of the
monsoon, watering of the surface to be done by tankers
* After sowing, mulch of prepared and dried out herbs will be laid over the
whole seeded area in a thin layer so that the direct sunlight and transpiration
loss may not affect the grasses

* The grass species recommended for median are Cynodon dactylon, Cythocline
purpurea, Solanum nigrum, Xanthium strumerium etc.
* Saccharum spontaneum, and Saccharum bengalensis two common local grass
species are recommended for the embankment slope at major rivers and stream
crossings. These are locally available species and good soil bounder. Sowing
of these species on the embankment will help in maintaining the habitat
continuity across the bypass. Such water crossings will serve as natural
passages of wild animals because of presence of native grasses
* Desmostachya bipinnata, Cenchrus ciliaris and Aristida hysterix are
recommended for the side embankment of eroded and dry patches. All these
species are locally available in the surrounding area of proposed bypass.
Contractor will ensure that the condition of the site is good enough for the
successful establishment of grasses. They will also supervise all field operations
like preparation of surface, sowing of grasses and qualiy of grass seeds used.

Appendix - 10
Generic Recommendations
The respective implementing agencies including NHAI, Engineer, Contractor & PIU etc.
identified in earlier section should follow the following recommendations.
Air Pollution:
Stock-piles! Crushers
* Mist sprays should be provided at appropriate places for preventing dust pollution
during handling and stockpiling of stones and loose earth.
* Over Burden (OB) waste dumps shall be sprayed with water, as they are the major
source of air bome particulate matter/dust.
* OB waste dumps shall be reclaimed/ afforested to bind the loose soil and to
prevent soil erosion. The frequency of sprinkling should be fixed as per the
seasonal requirements in consultation with engineer.
Haulage
> Regular water spraying on haulage roads during transportation of construction
material by water sprinklers. The frequency of sprinkling should be fixed as per
the seasonal requirements in consultation with engineer.
> Transfer points for transporting construction material shall be provided with
appropriate hoods/chutes to prevent dust emissions.
> Dumping of construction material should be from an optimum height (preferably
not too high) so as to reduce the dust blow.
Occupational Noise Pollution Control
To keep the ambient noise levels within the permissible limits, the measures to be
adopted are:
> Innovative approaches of using improvised machinery designs, with in-built
mechanism to reduce sound emissions like improved silencers, mufflers and
closed noise generating parts.
In associatinw whg

>  Procurement of drill, loaders and dumpers and other equipmeht with noise proof
system in operator's cabin.
> Confining the equipment with heavy noise emissions in sound proof cabins, so
that noise is not transmitted to other areas.
> Regular and proper maintenance of noise generating machinery including the
transport vehicles to maintain the noise levels.
> Provision should be made for noise absorbing pads at foundations of vibrating
equipment to reduce noise emissions.
Others
The engineer will closely monitor extraction of sand from the river (Yamuna) and
prohibit extraction of sand from all other water bodies. The contractor shall ensure all
statutory clearances have been obtained for extraction of sand from the river.
2.   Best Practices For Environmentally    Sound   Construction  And  Facility
Management
The following sections describe the best practices, which should be followed during
construction of such projects. The major emphasis is on resource conservation, resource
recovery and recycling so that the minimum quantity of waste is generated. These
practices can be modified according to prevailing construction conditions at the time of
execution of project.
2.1   Vegetation Clearance
Vegetation clearance shall comprise uprooting of vegetation, grass, brushwood, shrubs,
stumps, trees and saplings of girth upto 30 cm. measured at a height of one meter above
the ground level. Where only clearance of grass is involved it shall be measured and paid
for separately. The procedure/ steps involved for uprooting, skating and felling trees are
described below.
Uprooting of Vegetation
* The roots of trees and saplings shall be removed to a depth of 60 cm. Below
ground level or 30 cm. below formation level or 15 cm below sub grade level,
whichever is lower.
* All holes or hollows formed due to removal of roots shall be filled up with earth
rammed and leveled.

* The bottom of the pit shall be forked to break up the subsoil;
Back Filling
The soil back filled watered through end gently pressed down, a day previous to planting,
to make sure that it may not further settle down after planting. The soil shall be pressed
down firmly by treading it down, leaving a shallow depression all round for watering.
Planting
*  No tree pits shall be dug until final tree position has been pegged out for approval.
*  Care shall be taken that the plant sapling when planted is not be buried deeper
than in the nursery, or in the pot.
*  Planting should not be carried out in waterlogged soil.
*  Plant trees at the original soil depth; soil marks on the stem is an indication of this
and should be maintained on the finished level, allowing for setting of the soil
after planting.
*  All plastic and other imperishable containers should be removed before planting.
*  Any broken or damage roots should be cut back to sound growth.
*  The bottom of the planting pit should be covered with 50mm to 75mm of soil.
*  Bare roots should be spread evenly in the planting pit; and small mound in the
center of the pits on which the roots are placed will aid on even spread.
*  Soil should be placed around the roots, gently shaking the tree to allow the soil
particles to shift into the root system to ensure close contact with all roots and
prevent air pockets.
*  Back fill soil should be firmed as filling proceeds, layer by layer, care being taken
to avoid damaging the roots, as follows:
Staking
Newly planted trees must be held firmly although not rigidly by staking to prevent a
pocket forming around the stem and newly formed fibrous roots being broken by
mechanical pulling as the tree rocks.
In association with



Environrmental Management Plan for ABP-II of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
Methods:
The main methods of staking shall be:
(A)   A single vertical shake, 900mm longer than the clear stem of the tree, driven
600mm to 900mm into the soil.
(B)   Two stakes as above driven firmly on either side of the tree with a cross bar to
which the stem is attached. Suitable for bare- rooted or Ball material.
(C)   A single stake driven in at an angle at 45 degrees and leaning towards the
prevailing wind, the stem just below the lowest branch being attached to the stake.
Suitable for small bare- rooted or Ball material
(D)   For plant material 3m to 4.5m high with a single stem a three- wire adjustable guy
system may be used in exposed situations.
The end of stake should be pointed and the lower Im to 1.2m should be coated with a
non-injurious wood preservative allowing at least 150mm above ground level.
Tying
Each tree should be firmly secured to the stake so as to prevent excessive movement.
Abrasion must be avoided by using a buffer, rubber or Hessian, between the tree and
stake. The tree should be secured at a point just below its lowest branch, and also just
above ground level; normally two ties should be used for tree. These should be adjusted
or replaced to allow for growth.
Watering
The Landscape Contractor should allow for the adequate watering in of all newly planted
trees and shrubs immediately after planting and he shall during the following growing
season, keep the plant material well watered.
Manure/Fertilizer usage
The fertilizers/manure usage should be such that the turn of all the fertilizers comes after,
every 15 days from the beginning of the monsoon till the end of winter:
Organic well-rotted dry farm yard manure: 0.05 cum or tussle.

3.      Ammonium sulphate 25gm.
4.      Potassium sulphate 25gm.
All shrubs, which are supplied pot grown, shall be well soaked prior to planting.
Watering in and subsequent frequent watering of summer planted container- grown plants
is essential.
Shrub Planting in Planter Beds
All areas to be planted with shrubs shall be excavated, trenched to a depth of 750mm,
followed by refilling the excavated earth after breaking clods and mixing with sludge in
ratio 8:1 (8 parts of stacked volume of earth after reduction by 20%: 1 part of stacked
volume of sludge after reduction by 8%.)
For planting shrubs and ground cover shrubs in planters, good earth shall be mixed with
sludge in the proportion as above and filled in planters.
Positions of planters should be marked out in accordance with the architectural drawing.
4.      Grass Turfing
The specifications for grass turfing are to be referred from 'specifications for Roads and
Bridge works' by MOST, Section300, Clauses 307.1, 307.2 307.3.
Preparation of Ground
During period prior to planting, the ground shall be maintained free from weeds. Grading
and preparation of the area shall be completed at least three weeks prior to the actual
sowing. Regular watering shall be continued until sowing by dividing the area into
portions of approximately 5 m squares by constructing small bunds to retain water. These
'bunds' shall be leveled just prior to sowing of grass plants; it shall be ensured that the
soil has completely settled.
Soil
The soil itself shall be ensured to the satisfaction of Landscape Architect to be a good-
Fibrous loam, rich in humus.
Sowing the grass roots
* Grass roots (cynodon dectylon or a local genus approved by the Landscape
Architect) shall be obtained from a grass patch, seen and approved before hand.
inr ansssociation with           'p   ->4,



Environrental Management Plan for ABP-11 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
*  The grass roots stock received at site may be stored and shall be manually cleared
of all weeds with water sprayed over areas.
*  Small roots shall be dibbled about 5 cm apart into the prepared grounds. Grass
will only be accepted as reaching practical completion when germination has
proved satisfactory and all weeds have been removed.
Maintenance
As soon as the grass is approximately a 3 cm high it shall be rolled with a light wooden
roller - in fine, dry weather - and when it has grown to 5 to 8 cms, above to the ground
weeds must be removed and regular cutting with the scythe and rolling must begun. A
top-dressing of an ounce of guano to the square yard or well decomposed well broken
sludge manure shall be applied. When the grass is sufficiently secure in the ground to
bear the mowing machine, the blades must be raised an inch above the normal level for
the first two or three cuttings. That is to say, the grass should be cut so that it is from 4 to
5 cms in length, instead of the 3 cm necessary for mature grass.
In the absence of the rain, during the monsoon, the lawn shall be watered every ten days
heavily, soaking the soil through to a depth of at least 20 cms.
Damage failure or dying back of grass due to back neglect of watering especially for
seeding out normal season shall be the responsibility of the contractor. Any shrinkage
below the specified levels during the contract or defect liability period shall be rectified at
the contractor's expanse. The contractor is to exercise care in the use of rotary cultivator
and mowing machines to reduce to a minimum the hazards of flying stones and brickbats.
All rotary mowing machines are to be fitted with safety guards.
Rolling
A light roller shall be used periodically, talking care that the area is not too wet and
sodden.
Edging
These shall be kept neat and must be cut regularly with the edging shears.
ManuringW Fertilizer use
The area shall be fed once in a month with liquid manure prepared by dissolving 45 grms
of ammonium sulphate in 5 litres of water.

Watering
Water shall be applied at least once in three days during dry weather. Watering whenever
done should be thorough and should wet the soil at least up to a depth of 20 cms.
Weeding
Prior to regular mowing the contractor shall carefully remove rank and unsightly weeds.
Maintenance
The Contractor shall maintain all planted areas within contract boundaries for the entire
contract period (for one year until the area is handed over in whole or in phases).
Maintenance shall include replacement of dead plants, watering, weeding, cultivating,
control of insects, fungus and other diseases by means of spraying with an approved
insecticide or fungicide, pruning, and other horticulture operations necessary for proper
growth of the plants and for keeping the landscape sub-contract area neat in appearance.
5. Maintenances
Pruning and Repairs
Upon completion of planting work of the sub-contract (for plantation) all trees should be
pruned and all injuries repaired where necessary. The amount of pruning shall be limited
to the necessary to remove dead or injured twigs and branches and to compensate for the
loss of roots and the result of the transplanting operations. Pruning shall be done in such a
manner as not to change the natural habit or special shape of trees.

Planting should be carried out as soon as possible after reaching the site. Where planting
must be necessity he delayed, care should be taken to project the plants form pilfering or
damage from people animals. Plants with bare-roots should be heeled- in as soon as
received or otherwise protected from drying out and others set closely together and
protected from the wind. If planting is to be delayed for more than a week, packaged
plants should be unpacked, the bundles opened up and each group of plants heeled in
separately and clearly labeled. If for any reason the surface of the roots becomes dry the
roots should be thoroughly soaked before planting.
Completion
On completion, the ground shall be formed over and left tidy.

Institutional Setting for the Project
NHAI has an environmental and social development unit at NHAI corporate office
and a project Implementation unit (PIU) at Allahabad. At both the locations the
current strength of NHAI to implement mitigation measures for environmental
protection are found to be in adequate.
There is need to strengthen the EDSU unit by inducting manpower as many projects
are going simultaneously. Additional social and environmental managers need to be
inducted to assist GM (Environment). This induction should be according to HR
Policy of NHAI. Similar to corporate office the present human resources of PIU for
environmental management are not adequate. It is therefore recommended that a
separate environrmental manager be inducted at PIU level since manage technical
looking the environmental aspects will find it difficult to cope up with the
implementation work of the project.
The proposed set up for the project envisages to cover the following aspects
-  Strengthening the environmental component of PIU and EDSU
-  Associate the other stake holders in the existing team in order to implement
the provisions of the envirronmnntal management plan (EMP)
-  Integrated approach to implement EMP and RAP.
-  Monitor and upgrade EMP.
Itesponsibilities of other Institutional Players:
Construction Supervision Consultants (CS)
The supervision consultants will assume the powers and responsibilities of the Engineer for
the Allahabad bypass and assist the PIU in implementation. It is recommended that CS
should have the following capacities/ capabilities.
*  It is expected that the supervision consultants will have the necessary capability to
supervise the implementation of the environmental measures proposed in the EMP.
*  The CS to be selected through ICB are expected to have the in-house capacity to
advise on and supervise the implementation of the EMP
*  The CS should have capacity for making decisions regarding applicability of
enhancement design options and any modifications, if needed.
It is expected that the CS will employ a full time Environmental specialist. A sample of
(luties and qualifications for such a specialist are given below in Box 1.

C'ontractors
The Contractors are the major implementing agencies of EMP. The contractors are
recommended to employ Environmental Engineer/s. The roles and responsibilities of these
engineers are given below.
* Ensure proper construction and maintenance of the facilities for the labour camps
* Measurement and verification of quantities for environmental enhancement
* Ensuring that proper environmental safeguards are being maintained at borrow sites
and quarries
* Prepare the bills of quantities for the work carried out for enhancement
*  Ensure that proper facilities are available for the monitoring of ambient air quality
and co.llection of water and soil samples as mentioned in the environmental
monitoring plan
*  Ensure analysis and reporting of reporting of monitoring results
Other Agencies
The other agencies involved in project activities include the NGO procured for the
implementation of the RAP. It is also recommended to hire the services of local ecologist
to monitor the biodiversity at the bridge site.

Er.vironmental Management Plan for ABP-11 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
Box 1: Draft Terms of Reference for Engineer's Environmental Specialist
The Allahabad Bypass Road Project, financed by the World Bank, integrates
environmental and social issues in the planning and design of the Highway. An
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared for each construction
package and is integrated in the technical specification and contract documents. The
prime duty of the Environmental Specialist is to supervise the implementation of the
EMP by the Contractors and to ensure that the day-to-day construction activities are
carried out in an environmentally sound and sustainable basis. The scope includes
development of environmental procedures and good construction practices,
development and delivery of training programs, etc.
Qualifications and Experience
* A civil engineer preferably with postgraduate specialization in environmental
engineering.
*  12 years of working experience related to the integration of environmental and
social issues in the design, construction and operation of transport projects.
Experience in construction management and operational maintenance of highways is
preferred.
Principal Duties
. Supervise the implementation of the EMP by the Contractors.
. Hold regular consultation meetings with the environmental manager PIU
. Review the Contractors' Environmental Implementation Plans to ensure compliance
with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
. Organise periodic environmental training programmes and workshops for the staff
of the Contractors, Engineer and the Project Implementation Units (PIU).
. Develop good practices construction guidelines to assist the contractors in
implementing the EMP.
. Monitor tree plantation programmes and the periodic environmental monitoring (air,
noise, water, etc.)  Programmes to ensure compliance with the Statutory
requirements and the EMP.
. Hold consultation meeting with villagers on a regular basis in the project area to get
first hand information on the inconvenience caused due to activities contractor such
as noise, dust, debris, disposal etc.
- Prepare and submit regular environmental monitoring and implementation
progress reports.
Environmental Reporting System (ERS)
Environmental monitoring involves periodic checking to ascertain whether environmental
activities are going according to the EMP. It provides the necessary feedback for project
management to keep the program on schedule. The evaluation is essentially a summing up
In assoclaUton With



Environmental Management Plan for ABP-11 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
of the project assessment of whether those activities have actually achieved their outcomes.
The important features of ERS are summarized below.
* The reporting system will operate linearly with the contractor who is at the lowest
rung of the implementation system. The contractor will report to the Supervision
Consultant, who in turn shall report to the PIU and Environmental and Social
Development unit of NHAI at corporate office.
* All reporting by the contractor and Supervision Consultant shall be on a quarteily
basis.
* The ESDU in association with PIU shall be responsible for preparing targets for
each of the identified EMP activities.
* All subsequent reporting by the contractor shall be monitored as per the targets set
by them before the contractors move on to the site.
* The compliance monitoring and the progress reports on environmental components
may be clubbed together and submitted to the ESDU at corporate office and PIU,
quarterly during the implementation period.
* The operation stage monitoring reports may be annual or biannual, provided the
Project Environmental Completion Report shows that the implementation was
satisfactory.
* During the implementation period, a compliance report may include description of
the items of EMP, which were not complied with by any of the responsible
agencies. This would help in rationalising the implementation of the EMP during
the remaining duration of implementation. Solutions for further effective
implementation should also come out as a result of the compliance monitoring
reports.
* Responsibilities for overseeing will rest with the Supervision Consultant's staff
reporting to the PIU and ESDU corporate office.
* Capacity to quantitatively monitor relevant ecological parameters would be an
advantage but monitoring will primarily involve ensuring that actions taken are in
accordance with contract and specification clauses, and specified mitigation
measures as per the EMP.
.  Photographic records will also be established to provide useful environmental
monitoring tools.
* A full record will be kept as part of normal contract monitoring. Reporting and
Monitoring Systems for various stages of construction and related activities have
been proposed to ensure timely and effective implementation of the EMP.

Environmental Management Plan for ABP-II of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
The reporting system has been prepared for each of the stage of road construction namely:
- Pre construction stage
- Construction Stage
- Operation Stage
This reporting shall be done through:
-  Reporting by the Contractor to the SC
- Reporting by SC to PIU/ EDSU
The reporting formats are given in appendix 6.
Training
The ESDU at the NHAI headquarters and the PIU, responsible for the implementation of
EMP, need to be trained on the effective implementation of the environmental issues. To
ensure the success of the proposed implementation set up, there is a need for training and
skill up gradation. Please refer to training program is given in chapter 9 of EIA report.
Implementation/Construction Schedule
Prior to the actual construction work starts, the contractor need to acquire land and private
properties and clear the RoW by demolishing all the structures and trees from RoW.
Simultaneously the contractor needs to relocate all the community properties and cultural
properties before the actual work starts on those sites. Once the RoW is cleared the topsoil
need to be stripped and stored before actual construction of embankment starts. Preferably
these activities should be done before onset of monsoon.
The construction of all bridges/ culverts over any surface water bodies should be done in
lean season flow especially in the period starting from November-June. Since the aquatic
fauna in the river/ stream will have maximum impacts during construction; activities to be
taken up in the river eg. River training, construction of culvert /bridges (laying foundation
of well erection of piers etc.) should therefore be finished before on set of monsoon and
construction of embankment preferable should be in the non-monsoon season. The
construction schedule for the activities to be taken up in the ABP II is given below:
