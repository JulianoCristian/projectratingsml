The changes, involving\n            exclusion of one of the project components and reallocation\n            across components, will constitute a second order project\n            restructuring. The restructuring is aimed towards utilizing\n            the loan amount allocated for the corridor management\n            component, which will otherwise remain unutilized. Moreover,\n            by reallocating the loan amount to the bypass construction\n            component, the marginal overrun in civil works can be met\n            and achievement of development objective can be enhanced."}, "docdt": "2009-05-11T00:00:00Z"}
