Envimnmental Management Plan for ABP41 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
1                                                                INTRODUCTION
1.1    Background of tle Prefect
India has embarked on a 10-year highway transportation improvement program. The National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is the nodal agency coordinating the implementation of
National Highways Development Project (NHDP) comprising the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ),
North -South and East-West corridors. The proposed Allahabad Bypass is a part of Delhi-Kolkata
stretch of GQ, and a part of its consultancy package 111 on NH-2. The 'Package II' of NH-2 has-a
total length of 202 km, which, starts from Khaga (Km 115) and ends at Varanasi (Km 317).
Package III has been divided into three contract packages, i.e., 43km long 'Package III A', Khaga
- Kokhraj (km 115-158); 84.708 km long 'Package III B', Allahabad bypass; and 72 km long
'Package III C', Handia -Varanasi (km 245-317). The proposed Allahabad Bypass (package III
B), which has been further sub divided, into three construction packages as described below:
Packages                 Section (km)                          Length (km)
Package III B            (i) ABP-1 Gang Bridge
Allahabad Bypass           (km 163.267-164.280)                 1.013
(84.708 km)
(ii)  ABP-2  (kml58-163.267  and  km
164.280-198.000)                    38.987
(iii) ABP-3 (km 198.000 - 242.708)     44.708
The map showing Allahabad bypass has been given in Figure 1.1
This Environmental Management Plan pertains to construction package ABP-II. 38.987 km long
ABP II starts from km 158 at Kokhraj village of Kokhraj block and ends at km 198.0 at
Dandoopur of Soraon block.
1.2    ProjeCt DesCrIption
The select route of proposed 84.708 km has Allahabad bypass (Consultancy package III B)
comprises 2.608 km strengthening and widening of existing NH-2 (in which 2 km between) km
158-160 and 0.608 km at the end. In between, the bypass follows new RoW.
Bypass takes off from existing NH-2 at km 160 near Kokhraj village and ends at km 242.708
before kilometer post 245 of existing NH-2. The bypass has been designed as access controlled
toll road with provision of parallel service roads. Specifications of RoW, carriageway, service
road, shoulders, median etc. are given below:
1. Right of way (RoW)           70 m (general), 90 m (at high embankment locations,
interchanges, toll plazas)

1.3    Environmental Impact Assessmet and Envlronmental management Pla
The project has a new alignment for about 80 km length out of 84.708 km total length and has an
investment of more than 100 crore, therefore, the detailed design of the Allahabad bypass has
been closely coordinated with Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Study
as per the requirement of the EIA notification (1994) of Ministry of Environment and Forests
(MoEF) issued under the Environment Protection Act, 1986. Since project is being funded
through loan from the World Bank, Envirnmental Impact Assessment was also a requirement of
World Bank Operative Directive - 4.01. Along with the EA/SA, a consolidated Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) and separate Rehabilitation and Resettlement Plan including
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) are also prepared. The project has been categorized as category
'A' project, due to its cumulative magnitude of environmental and social impacts. In accordance
with the requirement of 'category A' project of the World Bank, an independent review of the
Environmental and Social Assessments and RAP has been carried out to address the gaps and
deficiencies in these documents. The EMP is finalized based on the outcome of the reviewed EA
report.

Environmental Management Plan for ABP-11 of
Allahabad Bypass of NH-2
2                                             Environmental Setfing
2.1       Environmental Setting
The entire area of Allahabad bypass lies in a sub-tropical region with marked monsoon
effects. The broad indicators defining the environmental setting of the study area are
given below.
1. The topography of the area is plain. The soils in the area are of alluvial type, capable
of producing high yields, largely due to the rich soil nutrients deposited by the Ganga
river and its tributaries. The entire length of Allahabad bypass falls in Zawne 11 with a
seismic coefficient of 0.02. Hence, the area is relatively stable.
2. Air Quality (i.e. NOx, SO2 and RPM) along the bypass alignment is within
permissible limit prescribed by CPCB except SPM, which exceeding in few places.
The predicted air quality based on modeling and baseline studies indicates levels are
also within CPCB limits.
3. The surface water flow in the project area is in the direction of the Ganga River.
Therefore, all other existing rivers and streams present north of Ganga flow towards
south and southeast, while those are present south of the Ganga flow north and
northeast.
4. In general the ground water table of the study area varies between 10- Im5 The water
table also varies in different seasons.
5. The predicted noise levels based on baseline surveys and modeling indicates that
predicted noise levels for daytime are well within CPCB limits considering the traffic
conditions till 2026. Nighttime noise levels exceed CPCB limits for the horizon year
2026 and 2036.
Though no change in the macro-climatic setting (precipitation, temperature and wind) is
envisaged due to the project, the microclimatic parameters are likely to be temporarily
changed mainly by vegetation removal and laying of pavement surface.
There will also be adverse impacts of project relating to the hydrology, drainage,
increased pollution load and break in landscape. There will be increased strain on
environmentally sensitive receptors, consumption of (non renewable) resources, and
increased pollution loads during construction period. The adverse impacts will also
include vehicular pollution in the area. Table 2.1 summarizes the identified environmental
impacts of ABP 2, the road section from km 158.0-163.267 and km 164280-198.00
(38.987 km).

3.2       Disaster Management Plan
Emergencies may occur due to various reasons, like natural calamities i.e floods, construction/
operation related activity and spills due to accidents. The disaster management plan is aimed at
insuring the safety of the people, protecting the environment and equipmcnt and property safety.
This plan summarizes identification of hazards, response and recommendations to mitigate and
minimize environmental emergencies. During construction stage, it is proposed that the
environmental coordinator act as emergency coordinator in case of emergency. He should be
having the following resources at his disposal at the time of emergency.
1.     Communication system
2.     Vehicles
3.      MSDS
4.      Trained manpower
5.      Procedures for meeting emergency
Response System should address the following features/ issues
>   all residents and employees need to be informed using the PA system to stay indoors
and not to use any roads crossing, which may get affected
>   the ambulance and fire tender need to be informed to be ready
> emergency response team should be put on alert and district authorities to be notified
if any search and rescue operations need to be carried out
>  in case of flood, once the water is receded and all the water bodies restored to its
normal flow condition then an overall assessment of the damage caused due to the
breach on people and property needs to be carried out
> all debris in the area needs to be cleared once the rescue operations have been carried
out.
Response due to fuel Leakage
>   the affected area should be evacuated and cordoned off immediately
>  only trained and experienced emergency response team members will approach the
area
>  electrical department need to be informed to shut down power supply
>  only concerned personnel will be present in the affected area and all other personnel
and guests need to be moved to the nearest assembly points
>  source of leakage to be traced and isolated from all the other areas
>  in case of a fire the instructions listed against fire hazards need to be followed.
Response in case of Fire
> on sighting a fire the first person should immediately inform the nearest resource
center (fire brigade office)/ and inform them the exact location and type of fire in
detail
>   if the fire is small engage in extinguishing the fire using the nearest fire extinguisher.
>  all the staff will be moved to the emergency assembly point
>  the control room will immediately inform the First Aid Center and the quick response
team which consists of trained fire fighting personnel
>  the fire tender will be mobilized
>  the Quick Response team will immediately move to the point of fire and take all
necessary steps to stop the fire. If the fire is beyond control and spreads further then
immediately inform the security post who would in turn inform the district authorities
and call for external help
>  first aid team will provide immediate relief to the injured personnel or guests at the
scene of incident.

4K                                      Environmental Monitoring
Reporting and Implementation
The monitoring programme is devised to ensure effective implementation of the EMP. The
monitoring programme contains monitoring plan for all performance indicators, reporting formats
and necessary budgetary provisions. Monitoring plan for performance indicators and reporting
system is presented in the following sub sections. Budgetary provisions are presented in
Chapter 5.
4.1    Performance Indicators
Physical, biological and environmental management components identified as of
particular significance in affecting the environment at critical locations have been
suggested as Performance Indicators (PIS). The Performance Indicators shall be evaluated
under three heads as:
(a) Environmental condition indicators to deternine efficacy of environmental
management measures in control of air, noise, water and soil pollution.
(b) Environmental management indicators to determine compliance with the suggested
environmental management measures.
(c) Operational performance indicators have also been devised to determnine efficacy and
utility of the proposed mitigation measures.
The Performance Indicators and monitoring plans prepared for ABP-II are presented in
Table 4.1

First sample will be taken at end of the first year of operational stage, thereafter once in six years. As it is expected that water pollution due to road operation will not
be much as the washings from the road is colleted separately through sedimentation cum oil and grease trap and oil interceptors. Therefore, water quality monitoring at
the interval of six years will be sufficient during operational stage.

4.3    Reporting System
Reporting system for the suggested monitoring program operates at two levels as:
(a) Reporting for environmental condition indicators and environmental management
indicators
(b) Reporting for operational performance indicators at the PIU level.
Contractor and construction supervision consultants operate the reporting system for
environmental condition and environmental management indicators. The Environmental
cell of PIU will operate the reporting system for environmental management operation
performance indicators. The PIU will see the targets for each activity envisaged in the
EMP beforehand and all reports will be against these targets. Contractor will report to the
environmental expert of construction supervision consultants, on the progress of the
implementation of environmental conditions and management measures as per the
monitoring plans. The environmental expert of supervision consultants will in turn report
to the PIU on a quarterly basis which will be reviewed and forwarded by the PIU to the
World Bank. The quarterly reports of the EMP will form an integral part of the 'Quarterly
Progress Reports' that are to be regularly submitted to the Bank. A detailed reporting
system for all the Performance Indicators has been developed and is presented in
Appendix 4. Reporting formats for contractors have been prepared, which will form the
basis of monitoring, by the environmental expert of supervision consultants and/or the
environmental cell as required.
In addition to these formats, to ensure that the environmental provisions are included at
every activity of the implementation by the contractor, it is suggested that the approval of
the environmental personnel of the supervision consultants is required in the 'Request for
Application to Proceed" or other similar reporting formats used by the constructor. These
will not only ensure that the environmental provision are addressed but also link the
satisfactory compliance to environmental procedures prior to approval of the Interim
Payment Certificate (IPC) by the supervision consultants. The activities by the contractor
that can impact the environment will be identified based on discussions between the
environmental specialist of the PIU, team leader and the environmental personnel of the
supervision consultants. The decisions will be communicated to the contractor.
4.4    EMP Implementation Arrangement
The NHAI is responsible for the implementation of the provisions made within the EMP
through the PIU. The services of a supervision consultants will be procured to assist the
PIU for monitoring the environmental aspects of the project during implementation
(mainly pre-construction and construction phases). Contractor will also have an
environmental specialist. Environmental expert of the contractor will provide key inputs
to the project implementation.

5.1    ERVIronmental Budget
Environmental budget has been checked considering BOQ with respect to Delhi Schedule of rates
published for CPWD. The unit rates for air, water and noise quality monitoring appears to be in line
with the prevailing market rates. This budget does not include the slope and embankment protection
costs. The embankment protection costs have been included in the DPR considering feasible
options based on sensitivity analysis. The trce plantation and maintenance cost has been estimated
to be Rs. 1200 per plant per annum based on 80% survival rate. The total cost comes out to be Rs.
1,9539,397.5. The breakup of the costs is given in the following table.
