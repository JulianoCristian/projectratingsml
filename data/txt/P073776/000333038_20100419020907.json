for the Allahabad Bypass Project\n            (ABP) for India were as follows: outcomes were moderately\n            satisfactory, the risk to development outcome was moderate,\n            Bank performance was moderately satisfactory, and Borrower\n            performance was also moderately satisfactory. Some lessons\n            learned included: non-completion of land acquisition and\n            resettlement operations before the start of civil works was\n            a major issue in the implementation of the ABP. Land\n            required for the project should have been substantially\n            acquired before the commencement of civil works to ensure\n            that contractors are not impeded by insufficient land to\n            progress the work. A well prepared detailed project report\n            (DPR) is essential for proper implementation of a project.\n            In the ABP, shortcomings in the DPR led to changes in the\n            alignment of the carriageway and consequent revisions to the\n            resettlement and rehabilitation plan. A well prepared DPR\n            with more accurate information on the amount and ownership\n            of the land required will have reduced the delays in land\n            acquisition and resettlement. Measures that are to be\n            implemented in a project should be clearly defined and be\n            ready for execution upon the launching of the project. The\n            corridor management component of the ABP suffered from a\n            lack of clarity of the locations where the actions were\n            supposed to be taken and also lack of specificity of the\n            actions to be taken. More attention should be given to\n            post-completion arrangements for the management and\n            operation of an asset once the construction phase has\n            finished. A clear plan should be in place for the handover\n            of newly developed assets to the client. Use of the assets\n            while some work is still in progress exposes the contractor\n            and the client to litigation should accidents and damages\n            occur. The use of fly ash in embankment construction has\n            been proven to be technically viable and cost effective."}, "docdt": "2010-01-28T00:00:00Z"}
