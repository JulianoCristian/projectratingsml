This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)\n            assesses the negative social impacts of the project, and\n            suggests socioeconomic rehabilitation measures, in order to\n            improve, or at least restore, the living conditions of\n            project affected people (PAP). Based on socioeconomic, and\n            census surveys, and in consultation with stakeholders, the\n            RAP determines the following measures to minimize adverse\n            social impacts resulting from project implementation. The\n            project will seek to redesign intersections as possible, to\n            avoid unnecessary loss of land, and structures, while\n            service roads will be constructed to provide easy access,\n            but under strict enforcement of parking, and traffic safety\n            measures to discipline the traffic flow. Compensation will\n            be provided at replacement values for loss of land, and\n            physical structures, which includes the provision of\n            drainage facilities; loss of crops, trees, and orchards,\n            will be compensated based on estimated market values, while\n            irrigation units will be replaced by the project; a\n            double-story shopping complex should be built on nearby\n            Government land, to accommodate demolished shops and\n            businesses, and alternative income restoration will be\n            considered; training will be provided to promote self\n            employment opportunities, in line with the Government's\n            poverty alleviation schemes; vulnerable groups will be given\n            special consideration for their resettlement/rehabilitation\n            needs, on priority bases; and, public awareness campaigns,\n            monitoring, and grievance mechanisms will be established to\n            ensure the adequate resettlement process."}, "docdt": "2003-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
