The National Highways\n            Authority of India (NHAI) is responsible for the\n            development, maintenance and management of national highways\n            in the country. However it is anticipated adverse\n            environmental impacts will occur, thus mitigating measures\n            stipulate the following. During construction operations -\n            particularly if on temporarily acquired land - adequate\n            traffic detours, storage and material handling should follow\n            standard regulations, and topsoil from agricultural land\n            will be preserved. Borrow pits shall not be dug continuously\n            in a stretch, but rather re-developed at selected borrow\n            location, while spoils shall be dumped with an overlay of\n            stockpiled topsoil. To limit potential chemical hazards, the\n            concrete foundation should contain a minimum cement content.\n            Potential soil erosion at the high embankment portion on the\n            north bank, should be contained by stone pitching.\n            Vehicles/machinery, and equipment operation, maintenance and\n            refueling activities shall be implemented so that spillage\n            of fuel, and lubricants does not contaminate the Ganga river\n            flows. Non-bituminous wastes will be dumped in borrow pits\n            covered with a layer of excavated topsoil. The sewerage\n            system for the construction workers' camp shall be\n            designed, built and operated so that no pollution to ground,\n            or adjacent watercourses occurs. On completion of the works,\n            all temporary structures shall be cleared away."}, "docdt": "2003-07-31T00:00:00Z"}
