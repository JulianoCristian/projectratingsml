MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF ITHE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUT
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA
FOR A TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.   I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to Albania for SDR 13.0 million (US$ 18.0 million equivalent),
on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, to help finance a Transport Project. The project
would be cofinanced by a US$6.4 million equivalent loan from the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (K.F.). Two maps (IBRD 24468 and EBRD 24469) are attached.
2.   Economy. For four decades, until the collapse of the old regime, Albania rigidly
centralized all economic activity and isolated itself to an extent unprecedented in the socialist
world. Albania ignored economic incentives, comparative advantage and financial constraints,
and in the end, the economy collapsed under the weight of a significant foreign debt, severe
price distortions and an archaic production structure. As a result, Albania is by far the poorest
country in Europe. The annual gross domestic product per capita of Albania's 3.3 million
population was estimated to be less than US$400 in 1992. However, Albania is now a full-
fledged member of the international community. With social stability broadly regained and thc.
basic institutional setting in place, the Government has decided to apply shock therapy,
supported by a US$27.0 million IA Standby Arrangement which was approved on August 26,
1992.
3.   The objectives of this program - underpinned by a sweeping set of reform initiatives -
were to regain macroeconomie control while startng the transition to a market economy. Goals
included the stabilization of output in 1993; progress towards macroeconomic stability; protection
of vulnerable groups through an expanded social safety net; and measures to initiate profound
structural change. Critical macroeconomic policy measures included comprehensive price and
external sector reforms, including the introduction of a floating exchange rate, trade
liberalization and a simplified tariff structure; a reduction in the public sector deficit through
a combination of expenditure controls and the elimination of subsidies and price supports to state
enterprises; and a move towards the separation of monetary policy from budget financing and
the introduction of higher interest rates. At the sectoral level, a series of structural reforms focus
on agriculture, state enterprises and the financial sector. The framework for prvate sector
development is being addressed through the establishment of commercial and legal codes, and
steps towards privatization, most notably of small scale enterprises and agricultural land, have
proceeded apace.
4.   Nearly a year after the start of the program, important progress has been made. The
sharp decline in output has been stopped, reflecting mainly the notable response of agriculture
to price reforms and privatization; inflation has declined significantly; the exteal position, and
reserves have improved somewhat, and budgetary and monetary targets have been met.
5.   Despite these achievements, the Governnment recognizes that there are considerable risks
in the economic reform program due to the wide-ranging nature of the policy changes which are
rerequired, the difficult conditions in the economy, and particularly Albania's limited
institutional capacity and lack of familiarity with market economics. However, the Government



2
has affirmed its commitment to the program at all levels. Substantial international support will
be required to make the refonn program succeed, and the proposed project is an important
component of this support.
6.   Transport Sector. Transport Infrastructure has deteriorated to the point where it is a
significant, andi sometimes severe, constraint to the functioning of the productive sectors and
government. Trucks are engaged primarily in the importation of foodstuffs, and will not be able
to transport other products when mining and industrial activity recover. Many of the main roads
are in poor condition, numerous villages lack year-round road access, port operations are
impeded by old equipment, and the runway and equipment require rehabilitation or replacement
to keep the main airport open.
7.   As in all centrally planned economies, the Govemment of Albania (GOA) directly
administered all transport modes, allocated traffic (primarily to the railway), selected
investments, set tariffs and prescribed transport regulations largely on the basis of social criteria.
Following the collapse of the old regime and democratic elections, the current GOA intends to
move towards a market economy wherein the transport modes would be either private'y owned
or commercially oriented state enterprises. The GOA invested only 1.2 percent of GDP in the
transport sector during 1986-90, or five percent of gross fixed investments Forty percent of
this amount went to the railways which appear to be uneconomic except for some mineral
traffics. As a consequence, most transport equipment and infrastructure is in poor or fair
condition, major projects were started but not completed, and other needed investments were
not carried out.
8.   Roads. Traffic is growing rapidly from a low base, despite the 30 percent decline in
GDP since 1987. About 1,300 km of the total 2,900 km of paved roads are in poor condition,
including 500 km which carry more than 4,000 vehicles per day (v.p.d.). These roads urgently
require rehabilitation or reconstruction (the most urgent 85 km being included under the project)
to carry anticipated traffic loads, and to avoid the need to rebuild them at high cost in the future.
More than 400 villages with a population of around 1.5 million are presently inaccessible by
motor vehicle at least part of the year because of lack of a reliable feeder road network. During
project preparation, GOA agreed to prepare a feeder road study, to be financed by bilateral
assistance outside the project, as the base for a labor-intensive construction program to expand
and improve the 10,200 km of existing feeder roads.
9.   Albanian contractors, presently owned by GOA, have been commercialized and are in
the process of privatization. However, they lack adequate equipment and financial resources to
execute road rehabilitation works by themselves. The best way to train contractors, modernize
equipment, improve financial conditions, increase employment, and reduce costs is for local
contractors to form long-tenn associations, or joint ventures for specific jobs, with qualified
foreign contractors. One association between a construction company previously owned by MTC
and a qualified foreign contractor has been negotiated, signed and approved by MTC, and is
under the final stages of approval by the Privatization Board, and is expected to start working
soon. Two other associations are under discussion, and several foreign contraivrs have
expressed interest in forming joint ventures with local contractors for specific projects. The
project's road component works will provide these contractors, following satisfactory



3
prequalification (para. 15), with an opportunity to bid minder ICB, and the technical assistance
for supervision will provide them with an opportunity for training in modem managerial and
construction techniques.
10. Ports. The main port of Durres has sufficient berth length (2,000 m) and infrastructure
to handle up to about 3.5 million tons p.a. of cargo if operations and maintenance are improved.
This is considerably more than its 1987-90 traffic of 2.2-2.8 million tons (30 percent general
cargo), an amount that was reduced to 1.0 million tons in 1991 and an estimated 0.9 million tons
in 1992 due to the critical economic situation. The port lacks spare parts and equipment for
cargo handling and maintenance workshops, is not equipped to handle containers, cannot cope
with the prssent volume of grain imports, and its surfaces, quay edges, and defenses, have
deteriorated. The Critical Imports Project (Credit 2404-ALB) includes US$280,000 for the most
urgent spare parts for the port andt the proposed project includes the most urgently required port
works and equipment.
11.  Tne port of Durres is presently a Division within an MTC department. Achievement of
its full poterntial will require an increase in operational efficiency, improvement of port finances,
reduction of over-staffing, and solution of its budget crisis which prevents the port from
purchasing goods and tools needed for daily maintenance. The rroject includes technical
assistance and a Port Master Plan Study directed at overcoming these issues and establishing an
autonomous port.
12. Transport Policy kisues. MTC has taken several steps to establish market-based
transport policies, and IDA has provided the draft CEM chapter on transport for initial guidance.
MTC requires technical assistance in order to:
(a)   plan investments on the basis of economic criteria. IDA informed the GOA that the
proposed construction of expressways and addition of berths at the port of Durres are
uneconomic;
(b)   decide whether, where and how to invest in the railways. Rehabilitation of infrastructure
and replacement of rolling stock do not appear economic, except for some lines which
carry mineral traffic. In this case, the best solution may be that the mining companies
rehabilitate and operate these lines. IDA and EBRD are investigating the mining
industry, which will provide the basis for this assessment. The project includes a Study
on the Future Role of Albanian Railways; and
(c)   reorganize and adopt policies to implement their role in a market economy, including:
(i) establishing and strengthening a more autonomous central road organization; (ii)
creating autonomous, commercially oriented, railway, port and airport organizations, and
define their relationship with MTC; (iii) privatizing transport enterprises; (iv) defining
MlCs role, and adopting transport regulations which ensure a "level playing field"
between and within transport modes, which do not interfere with their commercial
operations, and which would promote GOA's interest in safety and environment; and (v)
establishing a system of cost-based taxes, user charges, and tariffs for publicly owned
transport infrastructure and enterprises.



4
13.  The project includes technical assistance and/or studies to address these issues.
Agreements will be sought at negotiations concemning GOA's transport investments, and the
establishment of a system of road user charges to cover road expenditures. Agreement will also
be sought to implement action plans to adopt market based transport policies, to privatize the
MTC's remaining commercial truck fleet, and to establish an autonomous port authority at
Durres.
14.  Rationale for Bank Involvement. The GOA seeks assistance in implementing all aspects
of its economic and sector work program, which IDA supports. The project is justified because
it will (a) encourage the GC)A and co-donors to finance priority investments, (b) contribute to
the resolution of transport issues, (c) make up for years of deferred maintenance, only possible
with extemal support, and (d) promote institutional development, including enterprise reform,
pnvate sector promotion and economic pricing, wherever applicabie. The project components
have a high economic return and will also complement the Critical Imports Project, which
finances a first tranche of urgently needed equipment ard spare parts for the Port of Durres, and
tires, batteries and spare parts for trucks and buses.
15.  Project Objectives. The main objectives of the project are to (a) assist MTC and
transport organizations to adopt market based transport policies, (b) accommodate the eApected
growth of road traffic by rehabilitating and completing/extending main roads, and by improving
their maintenance and safety, (c) develop the domestic contracting industry and increase
employment, (d) improve operations, finances, and safety at the port of Durres, and (e) prepare
to determine the future role of the Albanian railways.
16.  Project Description. The project is based on the priority needs included in the National
Roads Department (NRD) 1993-95 Investment Plan, the program for replacement of equipment
in the port of Durres, and the needs for assistance in transitioning to a market economy. The
project includes (a) rehabilitation of about 65 kIn, and the completion and construction of about
19 km of main roads, (b) improvement of road maintenance in the Tirana district through the
provision of equipment and spare parts, (c) rvepair of quays and port surfaces, and provision of
equipment and spare parts for the port of Durres, (d) technical assistance (TA) and taining for
(i) NRD to implement the project, (ii) MTC to make investment decisions on the basis of
economic cnteria, to further privatize the road transport and construction industies, to
reorganize the Minishty, and to adopt market-based regulations, taxes and user charges, and (iii)
port of Durres to improve operation, productivity and safety, establish an autonomous port
authority, improve port finances, and develop a manpower pln; and (e) studies to (i) improve
road safety, (ii) prepare a Master Plan for the port of Durres, and (iii) determine the future role
of the Albanian railways.
17.  Cost Esthnate and Financing Plan. The project is estimated to cost US$27.0 million
equivalent including contingencies, of which US$19.7 million equivalent (US$16.2 million for
road works and their supervision, US$2.4 million for maintenance equipment, and US$1.1
million for TA, training and a traffic Safety Study) in the Road sector, US$7.1 million
equivalent (US$2.4 million for works, US$4.0 million for equipment, and US$0.7 million for
TA, training and a Master Plan Study) in the Port sector, and US$0.2 million for the Study on
the Futr Role of the Railways. The project would be financed by IDA (US$18.0 million



5
credit), the Kuwait Fund (US$6.4 million loan for full financing of port works and equipment
only), and the GOA (US$2.6 million).
18.  Inplementation and Procurement. The project wili be implemented by MTC, mostly
through its NRD and the port of Durres, with the assistance of consultants and a Project
Mlanagement Unit (PMU). The PMU has been already established and staff appointed by MTC
Order No. 51 dated December 28, 1992 which is satisfactory to IDA. The project will be
implemented during the four-year period 1994-97. Procurement will follow Bank Guidelines,
with prequalification of contractors and ICB procedures for the road works, and ICB with post
qualification for road maintenance equipment. NRD and port of Durres are completing bidding
documents for civil works and equipment using the Bank's sample bidding documents.
Consultants for TA, training and studies will be selected following Bank Guidelines for selection
of Consultants.
19.  Environmental Impact. The project requires a limited environmental analysis of
potential problems associated with road works (quarries, disposal of waste materials, adequate
drainage, erosion) and has been placed in Environmental Category WBW. The works would
diminish dust pollution and improve driving comfort and safety, and the equipment would allow
safer and more efficient road maintenance and port operations. Contractors are bound by a
clause in the bidding documents to maintain every work site pollution free and to return work
site to their original condition. Safety measures for road traffic will be defined and applied
under the Road Safety study and Acton Plan in order to reduce the high rate of road accidents
in Albania.
20.  Benefits. The project is expected to play an important role in establishing a market-based
transport sector, mainly through TA and training provided to MTC, and the implementation of
important works within a framework of free competition. The project road and port components
yield economic returns of 38 and 25 percent respectively. The project will also generate around
3,000 man-years of employment.
21.  Risks. The main project risks are the possibility that GOA might not have sufficient
counterpart funds for the project, or that recurrent budgets might be inadequate to implement
a satisfactory road maintenance program. In order to reduce these risks, GOA was asked and
agreed at negotiations to budget sufficient counterpart funds for the project, to charge border
prices plus an agreed tax for road fuel which covers aUl road expenditures, and to allocate road
funds first to maintenance and thereafter to other road expenditures. Project risks are considered
to be acceptable with these arrangements.
22.  Actions to be Agreed. During negotiations, the GOA agreed to the following:
(a)   GOA will consult with the Association on its transport investment plan annually;
and only undertake transport investments greater than US$5.0 million which have
an ERR and FYR greater than 12 percent (para. 9a);
(b)   GOA will adopt market-based transport policies by October 31, 1994, which
assure even intermodal competition, and permit the development of private road



6
transport, including establishing/maintaining a road vehicle licensing system
(para.9c);
(c)   MTC will privatize its remaining commercial truck fleet by June 30, 1994
(para.9c);
(d)   GOA will implement an action plan for the Port of Durres, satisfactory to IDA,
to: (i) establish an autonomous port authority in Durres by June 30, 1994; (ii)
improve operational performance by June 30, 1994, by implementing effective
working practices and streamlining administrative procedures; (iii) establish an
annual maintenance schedule for port infrastructure and equipment beginning
January 1, 1994; (iv) establish tariffs at the Port of Durres by January 1, 1994,
which generate sufficient revenues to cover operating expenses, depreciation or
debt service, whichever is higher, and a minimum 30 percent self-financing
contribution to future investments on a three year cycle; (v) achieve an annual
woildng ratio of not more than 45 percent at the Port of Durres, beginning in
1994; (vi) rationalize port staff so as to reduce their numbers by one-tW  by
January 1, 1995, and one-half by January 1, 1997; and (vii) prepare a Port Master
Plan covering the future development of the ports of Durres and Vlora by
December 31, 1994 (para.9c);
(e)   GOA will guarantee that it will provide adequate annual road maintenance funds
from 1993 onward, and it will allocate road funds first to maintenance, and
thereafter to other road expenditures (para. llc);
(f)   GOA will submit to Parliament for approval by December 31, 1994 a bill to
improve road safety (para. 16);
(g) GOA will submit to Parliament for approval by June 30, 1994 a bill establishing
a tax on road fuel (about US$0.15 equivalent per liter) which covers all road
expenditures (para. 18); and
(h) GOA will maintain the average retail price (without fuel tax) of category 2
gasoline and diesel fuel at or above US$0.30 equivalent per liter, and any fuel tax
which is introduced at or above US$0.15 equivalent per liter (para. 18).
23.   The IDA credit will become effective following increase of the average price of diesel
fuel and category 2 gasoline to at least US$0.30 equivalent per liter (para. 18).
24.  Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.
