Nonetheless, the key\n            lessons indicate that more attention should be given to\n            institutional components, rather than physical components,\n            for as a whole, most reasons for slow decision making, and\n            cost overruns, were of institutional origin, since not only\n            did Albania lack trained professionals in modern technology,\n            but sustainable, long-term policy frameworks, were issues\n            which took precedence over management, or engineering ones.\n            Thus, the lack of institutional capacity, coupled with the\n            supervision approach of \"advising\", proved the\n            need to demand, and implement, systematized decision-making\n            practices, as requested by the borrower, with a good start,\n            to be advanced into future operations. Furthermore, the lack\n            of a permanent civil service, hindered the development of\n            project objectives, whereas a parallel project could have\n            improved, a progressive restructuring of the civil service,\n            by reinforcing merit increase, compensation, and improved\n            accountability, in spite of the obvious lack of immediate\n            results, during implementation of this project."}, "docdt": "1999-12-29T00:00:00Z"}
