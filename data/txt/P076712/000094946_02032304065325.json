and regulations which form the protection of\n            the environment, and which need to be updated. Thus, EIA\n            functions will be carried out by the project implementation\n            unit, responsible for implementing the Community Development\n            Project's micro-projects, in compliance with existing\n            environmental regulations, linked to a social assessment, to\n            be followed by an analysis of alternatives, in consultation\n            with local communities, and nongovernmental organizations.\n            These guidelines on environmental procedures provide, first,\n            the preliminary selection, and appraisal criteria for\n            micro-projects, based on an environmental assessment\n            checklists' survey questionnaire. Second, a set of\n            environmental protection checklists, provide the following\n            mitigation measures. The construction of primary health, and\n            education facilities, of water supply, and wastewater sewage\n            infrastructure, as well as small scale irrigation will\n            generate contaminated wastes (including medical wastes),\n            clogging of drainage works, erosion of the soil cover,\n            vegetation degradation, as well as aquatic and wildlife\n            disturbances. Therefore, appropriate waste disposal services\n            during construction will be available, with particular\n            attention to oil spills, and drainage of hazardous\n            materials; construction will be restricted to daytime\n            working schedules to reduce noise disturbances; appropriate\n            engineering designs, and site selection should minimize\n            disturbance of natural habitats, wildlife, and vegetation\n            losses; control, and monitoring of irrigation water quality,\n            particularly as a result of agrochemical uses should be\n            enforced; improved technology for wastewater treatment\n            should be available, including monitoring programs. Solid\n            waste management micro-projects will comply with the\n            adequate design of sitting studies. Involuntary resettlement\n            issues should comply with the Bank's compensation\n            rules, and procedures."}, "docdt": "2002-02-28T14:13:04Z"}
