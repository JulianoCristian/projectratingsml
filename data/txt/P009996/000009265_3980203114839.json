The overall assessment of outcome is rated as\n            satisfactory; the performance of the Bank and the borrower\n            was rated satisfactory. The project aimed at strengthening\n            and expanding the sub-sector through increases in\n            production; improvements in productivity, product quality,\n            human resource base, support services; and increased private\n            sector involvement in selected aspects of the industry. The\n            main lessons learned from the project experience include:\n            (a) Future Operations - In the traditional silk producing\n            States, a more cost effective way of increasing and\n            sustaining raw silk production will be through raising\n            productivity. In the States with potential for producing\n            bivoltine silk, expansion of mulberry area should receive\n            greater attention combined with efforts to improve quality.\n            (b) Project Design and Appraisal - The less than\n            satisfactory performance of some sub-components (e.g.\n            bivoltine production / pilot States program) of the project\n            confirms the need for (i) greater involvement of\n            stakeholders in all stages of project formulation and\n            implementation to enhance ownership; and (ii) the\n            availability of on farm validated technologies to be\n            promoted, to ensure setting of achievable production\n            targets. (c) The project emphasis was on strengthening the\n            existing sericulture extension system and its approach. The\n            project experience has shown that the most effective\n            extension agent is the progressive and successful farmer.\n            Greater emphasis should therefore have been placed upon\n            promoting farmer-to-farmer transfer of technologies. (d)\n            Social Assessment - The project experiences reinforced the\n            need for conducting social assessment prior to appraisal to\n            identify issues such as child labor and develop an\n            appropriate strategy to address the relevant issues."}, "docdt": "1997-09-11T00:00:00Z"}
